                    "abstract": "Although liver transplant for decompensated cirrhosis secondary to Wilson disease is well accepted, the use of transplant for patients with severe neurologic manifestations of this condition remains controversial, and these can be perceived as a contraindication. Here, we describe a 45-year-old woman who presented with an incidental hepatocellular carcinoma at the time of transplant. The patient had severe neurologic manifestations of Wilson disease pretransplant, including dysarthria, hyperreflexia, asymmetrical ataxia, tremor, bradyphrenia, and shuffling gait. She underwent successful transplant from a hepatic and surgical standpoint, but her postoperative course was marked by protracted mutism, hypophonia, and fluctuating akinesia and immobility that did not respond promptly to withdrawal of calcineurin inhibitors or pramipexole but did respond robustly to amantadine. At 9 months posttransplant, there was marked neurologic improvement, and, at 18 months, she exhibited subtle memory and organizational difficulties but was fully ambulatory and otherwise completely functional. Our experience suggests that even patients with severe neurologic Wilson disease may recover after transplant, albeit slowly, demonstrating the need for a multidisciplinary approach, including pre- and posttransplant neurologic and neuropsychiatric consultations.",

Development of chelator induced immunological adverse events are a concern especially under d-penicillamine therapy. This study assessed the prevalence of co-existing or therapy-related immune-mediated diseases in Wilson disease patients, and evaluated the role of antinuclear antibodies in therapy monitoring. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 235 Wilson disease patients. Medical regimens were classified and analyzed in relation to adverse events and antinuclear antibody courses. RESULTS: Coexisting immune-mediated diseases were evident in 19/235 (8.1%) patients, of which 13/235 (5.5%) had pre-existing autoimmune diseases. Six patients (2.6%) developed an autoimmune disease under therapy, all of them under long-term d-penicillamine treatment. Data relating to antinuclear antibody courses during treatment and adverse events were available for patients treated with d-penicillamine (n = 91), trientine (n = 58), and zinc salts (n = 58). No significant increase in antinuclear antibody titers in patients treated with d-penicillamine (16/91; 17.6%), trientine (12/58; 20.7%), and zinc (7/58; 12.1%) were found. CONCLUSION: Under long-term d-penicillamine therapy a minority of patients developed immune-mediated disease. Elevations in antinuclear antibodies were found frequently, but no correlations were evident between increases in antinuclear antibodies and the development of immune-mediated diseases or medical regimes. Thus, the value of antinuclear antibodies for monitoring adverse events under chelator therapy seems to be limited.",

Hemolytic anemia in WD occurs in up to 17% of patients at some point during their illness. AIM: To screen for WD among children presenting with hemolytic anemia. METHODOLOGY: Twenty cases (mean age, 8.8 +- 3.9 y) with Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia, attending the hematology clinic of children hospital, Cairo University, were screened for WD by serum ceruloplasmin level, 24 hours urinary copper before and after D-penicillamine challenge test, and slit-lamp examination for detecting Kayser-Fleischer rings. RESULTS: No case had low ceruloplasmin, whereas bilateral Kayser-Fleischer rings was detected in 5% of our cases. Urinary copper was elevated in 5% before and in 40% after D-penicillamine challenge test. According to the scoring system used, 1 case had definite WD and 7 cases were likely to have WD. These 8 (40%) cases were referred to as group B. Group B had a significantly lower hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and reticulocytes (P=0.04, 0.001, 0.04, and 0.04, respectively) and a significantly higher urinary copper after penicillamine (P=0.000) when compared with group A (unlikely WD).

We report radiological changes in four patients with WDN who worsen after penicillamine. METHODS: WDN was diagnosed on the basis of clinical, KF ring, serum ceruloplasmin and 24h urinary copper. Hematological, biochemical and cranial MRI were repeated at the time of clinical deterioration following chelating treatment. RESULTS: Four WDN patients had neurological deterioration within 4-8 weeks of penicillamine therapy. This was associated with new lesions in white matter, thalamus, pons and mid brain and these lesions showed diffusion restriction. The neurologic deterioration was associated with increased free serum copper and malanodialdehyde and reduced glutathione. Clinical conditions stabilized after few weeks of penicillamine discontinuation. CONCLUSION: Neurological worsening was associated with new lesions on MRI which revealed diffusion restriction. Increased free copper induced oxidative stress may be responsible for these changes.",

Copper accumulation in the liver is a hallmark of WD. Current therapy is based on copper chelation, which decreases the manifestations of liver disease, but often worsens neurological symptoms. We demonstrate that in Atp7b(-/-) mice, an animal model of WD, liver function can be significantly improved without copper chelation. Analysis of transcriptional and metabolic changes in samples from WD patients and Atp7b(-/-) mice identified dysregulation of nuclear receptors (NRs), especially the liver X receptor (LXR)/retinoid X receptor heterodimer, as an important event in WD pathogenesis. Treating Atp7b(-/-) mice with the LXR agonist, T0901317, ameliorated disease manifestations despite significant copper overload. Genetic markers of liver fibrosis and inflammatory cytokines were significantly decreased, lipid profiles normalized, and liver function and histology were improved. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the major role of an altered NR function in the pathogenesis of WD and suggest that modulation of NR activity should be explored as a supplementary approach to improving liver function in WD.

To remove excess copper into the bile, ATP7B traffics toward canalicular area of hepatocytes. However, the trafficking mechanisms of ATP7B remain elusive. Here, we show that, in response to elevated copper, ATP7B moves from the Golgi to lysosomes and imports metal into their lumen. ATP7B enables lysosomes to undergo exocytosis through the interaction with p62 subunit of dynactin that allows lysosome translocation toward the canalicular pole of hepatocytes. Activation of lysosomal exocytosis stimulates copper clearance from the hepatocytes and rescues the most frequent Wilson-disease-causing ATP7B mutant to the appropriate functional site. Our findings indicate that lysosomes serve as an important intermediate in ATP7B trafficking, whereas lysosomal exocytosis operates as an integral process in copper excretion and hence can be targeted for therapeutic approaches to combat Wilson disease.

Phenotypic diversity of the disease can lead to delayed diagnosis. We describe a case of WD in a 10-year-old boy presenting with 3 months of increasingly intense, spasmodic lower extremity muscle cramps. Physical examination revealed tenderness on calf palpation and dark flat lesions over his ankles, knees, and elbows. Initial testing revealed creatine kinase of 302 IU/L (normal 24-248 IU/L), hemoglobin of 8.9 g/dL (11.5-15.5 g/dL), aspartate aminotransferase of 114 IU/L (16-52 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase of 54 IU/L (2-30 IU/L), and myoglobinuria. Extensive evaluation of his myopathy, including MRI and muscle biopsy, was negative. Additional laboratory tests revealed a prothrombin time of 21.3 seconds (11.8-15.5 seconds), total bilirubin of 1.4 mg/dL (<1 mg/dL), direct bilirubin of 0.5 mg/dL (<0.3 mg/dL), albumin of 2.1 g/dL (3.1-4.6 g/dL), a reticulocyte percentage of 4.5% (0.5%-2.5%), a negative Coombs direct antibody test, ceruloplasmin of 3 mg/dL (21-51 mg/dL), and 24-h urine copper of 393 mug/24 h (15-60 mug/24 h). Liver biopsy showed patchy advanced fibrosis, mild inflammation, positive staining for copper, and a tissue copper concentration of 768 microg/g (10-35 mug/g). Brain MRI revealed symmetric intrinsic T1 shortening within bilateral basal ganglia. Trientene therapy was initiated for WD. Symptoms and laboratory abnormalities resolved and remain normal at 21 months' follow-up. Musculoskeletal involvement in WD is uncommon and typically defined as bone demineralization, arthropathy, or hypokalemic muscle weakness. In patients with unexplained musculoskeletal symptoms and hepatic abnormalities, a diagnosis of WD should be considered and appropriate evaluation initiated. ",

Additional laboratory tests revealed a prothrombin time of 21.3 seconds (11.8-15.5 seconds), total bilirubin of 1.4 mg/dL (<1 mg/dL), direct bilirubin of 0.5 mg/dL (<0.3 mg/dL), albumin of 2.1 g/dL (3.1-4.6 g/dL), a reticulocyte percentage of 4.5% (0.5%-2.5%), a negative Coombs direct antibody test, ceruloplasmin of 3 mg/dL (21-51 mg/dL), and 24-h urine copper of 393 mug/24 h (15-60 mug/24 h). Liver biopsy showed patchy advanced fibrosis, mild inflammation, positive staining for copper, and a tissue copper concentration of 768 microg/g (10-35 mug/g). Brain MRI revealed symmetric intrinsic T1 shortening within bilateral basal ganglia. Trientene therapy was initiated for WD. Symptoms and laboratory abnormalities resolved and remain normal at 21 months' follow-up. Musculoskeletal involvement in WD is uncommon and typically defined as bone demineralization, arthropathy, or hypokalemic muscle weakness. In patients with unexplained musculoskeletal symptoms and hepatic abnormalities, a diagnosis of WD should be considered and appropriate evaluation initiated. ",

Here, we describe a 45-year-old woman who presented with an incidental hepatocellular carcinoma at the time of transplant. The patient had severe neurologic manifestations of Wilson disease pretransplant, including dysarthria, hyperreflexia, asymmetrical ataxia, tremor, bradyphrenia, and shuffling gait. She underwent successful transplant from a hepatic and surgical standpoint, but her postoperative course was marked by protracted mutism, hypophonia, and fluctuating akinesia and immobility that did not respond promptly to withdrawal of calcineurin inhibitors or pramipexole but did respond robustly to amantadine. At 9 months posttransplant, there was marked neurologic improvement, and, at 18 months, she exhibited subtle memory and organizational difficulties but was fully ambulatory and otherwise completely functional. Our experience suggests that even patients with severe neurologic Wilson disease may recover after transplant, albeit slowly, demonstrating the need for a multidisciplinary approach, including pre- and posttransplant neurologic and neuropsychiatric consultations.",

METHODS: This is a retrospective case series of 7 patients with WD with KF rings seen in our institute during the study period (August 2015 to June 2016). All patients underwent slit-lamp examination of the cornea and AS-OCT (Optovue RTVue Premier). In 2 patients, the length of the KF ring was measured using the gray scale of AS-OCT. RESULTS: The KF ring on the gray scale of AS-OCT was visualized as a hyperreflective deep corneal layer at the level of Descemet membrane in all eyes. The OCT color scale revealed the KF ring as a greenish, greenish-yellow, yellow, or yellow-orange band. The gray scale of AS-OCT could easily measure the length of the KF ring in patients 6 and 7. CONCLUSIONS: AS-OCT is an alternative method of evaluating the KF ring in WD, which can be used in combination with slit-lamp examination. The KF ring can be easily measured using the gray scale of AS-OCT. Further studies are required to study the potential advantages of AS-OCT including assessing the density of the KF ring, as a tool to assess response to treatment in WD, in differentiating the KF ring of WD disease from copper deposits in other situations and pigmented corneal rings in non-Wilsonian liver disease.",

                    "abstract": "The normal functioning of brain is intimately as well as intricately interrelated with normal functioning of the liver. Liver plays a critical role of not only providing vital nutrients to the brain but also of detoxifying the splanchnic blood. Compromised liver function leads to insufficient detoxification thus allowing neurotoxins (such as ammonia, manganese, and other chemicals) to enter the cerebral circulation. In addition, portosystemic shunts, which are common accompaniments of advanced liver disease, facilitate free passage of neurotoxins into the cerebral circulation. The problem is compounded further by additional variables such as gastrointestinal tract bleeding, malnutrition, and concurrent renal failure, which are often associated with liver cirrhosis. Neurologic damage in chronic liver disease and liver cirrhosis seems to be multifactorial primarily attributable to the following: brain accumulation of ammonia, manganese, and lactate; altered permeability of the blood-brain barrier; recruitment of monocytes after microglial activation; and neuroinflammation, that is, direct effects of circulating systemic proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor, IL-1beta, and IL-6. Radiologist should be aware of the conundrum of neurologic complications that can be encountered in liver disease, which include hepatic encephalopathy, hepatocerebral degeneration, hepatic myelopathy, cirrhosis-related parkinsonism, cerebral infections, hemorrhage, and osmotic demyelination. In addition, neurologic complications can be exclusive to certain disorders, for example, Wilson disease, alcoholism (Wernicke encephalopathy, alcoholic cerebellar degeneration, Marchiafava-Bignami disease, etc). Radiologist should be aware of their varied clinical presentation and radiological appearances as the diagnosis is not always straightforward. ",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Liver transplantation (LT) has emerged as a lifesaving modality for many liver diseases in children. Pediatric LT is an established treatment in the Western world but is relatively a new procedure in resource-limited countries like Pakistan. The study aims to highlight the outcomes and survival of pediatric recipients from the first pediatric liver transplant center in Pakistan. METHOD: A retrospective analysis of pediatric LT was done from 2012 to 2019. The study was conducted in the Hepatobiliary and liver transplant department of Shifa International Hospital (SIH), Islamabad. A detailed analysis for indications for pediatric LT, survival, and complications was done. RESULTS: Forty-five patients under 18 years of age underwent Living donor liver transplant (LDLT) in SIH. Median age was 9 years and M:F of 2:1. Cryptogenic liver disease followed by Wilson disease were the two most common indications of LT. The majority of patients had chronic liver disease 34 (75%) while 11 (24%) had acute liver failure. The right lobe graft was the most common type of graft 19 (42.2%). Thirty days, 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival was 77.8%, 75.6%, 73.3%, and 60.6% respectively. Mortality was highest in patients with biliary atresia 4 (33%). Causes of death included pulmonary embolism, sepsis, surgical complications, and acute kidney injury. Mean survival was 88.850 months (+-7.899) (CI 73.369-104.331). CONCLUSION: Pediatric LDLT has offered disease-free survival for patients. Survival can improve further with nutritional rehabilitation and anticipation and management of post-operative complications.",

In the absence of some of the typical features, diagnosis of WD is difficult and is based on the combination of clinical, biochemical and genetic testing. The aim of this study was to illustrate the complexity of the approach to WD in daily clinical practice. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of patients with WD, including the clinical presentation, histological and biochemical findings, and follow up after treatment. We also carried out genetic testing, and the Leipzig diagnostic score was applied. RESULTS: We included 15 patients. Four were symptomatic, with liver (n=1), neurological (n=1), psychiatric (n=1) and mixed clinical manifestations (n=1), and 11 were presymptomatic, with elevated transaminases (n=8) and family study (n=3). We observed Kayser-Fleischer ring in 2 patients, both without neurologic symptoms. Ceruloplasmin <= 5 mg/dL was present in 73%, and 24-hour urinary Cu> 100 mug in 40%. Liver Cu was >250 mug/g.d.t. in 85% of the patients. The final diagnosis of WD was given by genetic testing (ATP7B gene mutations) in 5 patients with minimal disease features, including one symptomatic patient (psychiatric symptoms). We identified 5 previously reported mutations (p.M645R, p.R827W, p.H1069Q, p.P768L and p.G869R) and 3 unpublished mutations (p.L1313R, p.I1311T and p.A1179D); the most frequent mutation was p.M645R. After treatment, biochemical parameters (transaminases, urinary cooper) and symptoms improved, except in patients with neurological and psychiatric manifestations. CONCLUSIONS: Our series illustrates the important role of genetic testing in the diagnosis of WD. The identification of the p.M645R mutation in most of our patients should be kept in mind in the molecular analysis of the ATP7B gene in our region.",

Alterations of copper metabolism have been associated with changes in coagulation factors. The aim of the present study was the analysis of coagulation factors in WD patients. METHODS: 100 patients attending a tertiary WD outpatient clinic were analyzed in a prospective cross sectional cohort study. Out of peripheral venous blood samples coagulation factors were assessed including: full blood count, INR, partial thromboplastin time (PTT), clotting factors II, V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, von Willebrand factor/-antigen, fibrinogen, antithrombin III, protein S, protein C, activated protein C (APC) resistance. Subgroup analyses of the blood tests were performed for sex, initial clinical presentation, WD treatment and liver function. RESULTS: Subgroup analysis by liver function showed decreased levels of factors II, V, VII and X. Subgroup analysis by gender or clinical course of the disease did not reveal significant coagulation changes. In patients treated with trientine significantly decreased levels of factors II, VII and antithrombin III and increased von Willebrand factor/-antigen levels were detected. Factor VIII levels were significantly reduced in patients receiving zinc. CONCLUSION: Although significant differences of some coagulation parameters in subgroup analysis were found, no clinically relevant alterations of the coagulation system in WD patients could be detected.",

MATERIAL/METHODS: A prospective analysis of 45 obese children initially diagnosed with liver pathology (elevated serum ALT activity and/or ultrasonographic liver brightness and/or hepatomegaly) was conducted. The diagnosis of NAFLD was established in the children with elevated serum ALT activity and liver steatosis on ultrasound examination. Viral hepatitis, autoimmune, metabolic liver diseases (Wilson disease, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, cystic fibrosis) and drug and toxin-induced liver injury were excluded in all children. The degree of liver steatosis was graded according to Saverymuttu scale and the total liver lipids concentration was assessed using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS). RESULTS: Serum fetuin A concentration was significantly higher in examined children compared to the control group (n=30) (p=0.00002). Higher serum fetuin A concentration was also observed in children with NAFLD (n=19) in comparison to the controls (p=0.000026). Additionally, higher BMI values, waist circumferences, ALT and GGT activity, intensity of liver steatosis on ultrasound and total concentration of lipids in the liver in (1)H MRS were found in children with NAFLD compared to the rest of the examined obese patients (n=26). There was not found any correlation of the investigated glycoprotein with any other assessed parameters both in children with NAFLD and obese children without NAFLD. CONCLUSION: Higher serum fetuin A concentration found in children with NAFLD compared to the control group support the hypothesis that atherosclerotic processes may develop faster in hepatopatic obese patients.",

Mutations in ATP7A may cause three distinct X-linked conditions in infants, children, or adolescents: Menkes disease, occipital horn syndrome (OHS), and a newly identified allelic variant restricted to motor neurons called X-linked distal hereditary motor neuropathy. These three disorders show variable neurological findings and ages of onset. Menkes disease presents in the first several months of life with failure to thrive, developmental delay, and seizures. OHS features more subtle developmental delays, dysautonomia, and connective tissue abnormalities beginning in early childhood. ATP7A-related distal motor neuropathy presents even later, often not until adolescence or early adulthood, and involves a neurological phenotype that resembles Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 2. These disorders may be treatable through copper replacement or ATP7A gene therapy. In contrast, mutations in ATP7B cause a single known phenotype, Wilson disease, an autosomal recessive trait that results from copper overload rather than deficiency. Dysarthria, dystonia, tremor, gait abnormalities, and psychiatric problems may be presenting symptoms, at ages from 10 to 40 years. Excellent treatment options exist for Wilson disease, based on copper chelation. In the past 2 years (2012-2013), three new autosomal recessive copper metabolism conditions have been recognized: 1) Huppke-Brendel syndrome caused by mutations in an acetyl CoA transporter needed for acetylation of one or more copper proteins, 2) CCS deficiency caused by mutations in the copper chaperone to SODI, and 3) MEDNIK syndrome, which revealed that mutations in the sigma1A subunit of adaptor protein complex 1 (AP-1) have detrimental effects on trafficking of ATP7A and ATP7B.",

The incidence for HAT is increased in patients with risk factors (vascular reconstructions, coagulation disorders and acute rejection episodes amongst others). Early retransplantation improves the prognosis for patients, but owing to lack of donors, surgical and interventional radiologic attempts to restore the patency of hepatic artery are made. The prognosis for the liver and the patient can also be improved by the development of collateral circulation. CASE REPORT: We describe a case of a 30-year-old woman with hepatic failure owing to Wilson disease. Liver transplantation with the use of vascular conduit made of donor's iliac arteries was complicated by an early HAT. Heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation was confirmed in the patient. Despite surgical and radiologic attempts to restore patency and despite treatment with fractioned heparin and aspirin, the hepatic artery remained occluded. Retransplantation was not considered, even though the patient was planning a pregnancy. After 1 year of observation of stable liver function, conversion from mycophenolate mofetil to azathioprine treatment, the patient was given consent for a high-risk pregnancy. DISCUSSION: The course of pregnancy was uneventful, with normal liver function parameters, without pathological bleedings. The patient was treated with doses of enoxaparin adjusted for the patient's weight. In the 34th week, owing to increasing concentration of bile acids, the pregnancy ended with a cesarean section. The newborn had 10-point APGAR score.",

We investigated the clinical outcomes of five patients with liver failure of various causes who received autologous CD34-depleted bone marrow-derived mononuclear cell (BM-MNC) transplantation, including mesenchymal stromal cells, through the hepatic artery. METHODS: CD34-depleted BM-MNCs were obtained from five patients waiting for liver transplantation by bone marrow aspiration and using the CliniMACS CD34 Reagent System (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany), and autologous hepatic artery infusion was performed. The causes of hepatic decompensation were hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), propylthiouracil-induced toxic hepatitis and Wilson disease. RESULTS: Serum albumin levels improved 1 week after transplantation from 2.8 g/dL, 2.4 g/dL, 2.7 g/dL and 1.9 g/dL to 3.3 g/dL, 3.1 g/dL, 2.8 g/dL and 2.6 g/dL. Transient liver elastography data showed some change from 65 kPa, 33 kPa, 34.8 kPa and undetectable to 46.4 kPa, 19.8 kPa, 29.1 kPa and 67.8 kPa at 4 weeks after transplantation in a patient with Wilson disease, a patient with HCV, and two patients with HBV. Ascites decreased in two patients. One of the patients with HBV underwent liver transplantation 4 months after the infusion, and the hepatic progenitor markers (cytokeratin [CD]-7, CD-8, CD-9, CD-18, CD-19, c-Kit and epithelial cell adhesion molecule [EpCAM]) were highly expressed in the explanted liver. CONCLUSIONS: Serum albumin levels, liver stiffness, liver volume, subjective healthiness and quality of life improved in the study patients. Although these findings were observed in a small population, the results may suggest a promising future for autologous CD34-depleted BM-MNC transplantation as a bridge to liver transplantation in patients with liver failure.",

                    "abstract": "Wilson disease is a genetic disease involving copper metabolism disturbances that result in copper accumulations, especially in the liver and brain. Wilson disease can be treated with pharmacologic agents, such as chelators that induce urinary excretion of copper or zinc salts that inhibit copper absorption in the digestive tract. Liver transplant is the only treatment option for Wilson disease when liver failure has occurred. In some patients, that is, in those with Child-Pugh A score, neurologic disease can be seen without hepatic failure. Our recommendation is for these patients to have auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplant. Here, we present a 36-year-old male patient with neurologic disease associated with Wilson disease who had successful related living-donor auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplant using a left lobe. The patient, as a result of neurologic symptoms that included tremor walking and speaking problems and low serum ceruloplasmin level of 7 mg/dL, was diagnosed with Wilson disease, and a liver biopsy was performed. Chronic necroinflammatory disease activity was 4/18, and the patient received chelation treatment. His hepatic functions were normal. The donor was the patient's 57-year-old father whose liver function tests were also normal. The graft-to-recipient weight ratio was 1% using a left lobe graft. After transplant, serum ceruloplasmin levels on day 15 and month 1 were 14 and 19 mg/dL. At month 1, liver function tests were normal. Doppler ultrasonography showed normal vascular flow of the native liver and the graft. The patient's neurologic symptoms were progressively reduced. Progressive neurologic deterioration with no hepatic insufficiency is considered a suitable indication for auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplant; this procedure is suggested before the neurologic and liver failure symptoms of Wilson disease occur.",

Auxiliary partial orthotopic LT (APOLT) has been performed successfully in end-stage WD patients, which expands the donor pool. METHODS: Atp7bmice were used as experimental model of WD. Eight- and 20-week-old mice were used as different timepoints to perform APOLT. Serum copper, tissue copper, serum ceruloplasmin (CP), and liver histological examination were observed after operation. RESULTS: Hepatic and serum copper levels in Atp7b mice decreased after APOLT, and copper metabolism disorder of WD mice was relieved at both early and late stages. The progression of pathology in the native liver was delayed only when transplantation was performed at an early stage. CONCLUSIONS: Auxiliary partial orthotopic LT can significantly improve copper metabolism disorder in the Atp7b mice, and early transplantation may prevent the disease progression.",

Auxiliary partial orthotopic LT (APOLT) has been performed successfully in end-stage WD patients, which expands the donor pool. METHODS: Atp7bmice were used as experimental model of WD. Eight- and 20-week-old mice were used as different timepoints to perform APOLT. Serum copper, tissue copper, serum ceruloplasmin (CP), and liver histological examination were observed after operation. RESULTS: Hepatic and serum copper levels in Atp7b mice decreased after APOLT, and copper metabolism disorder of WD mice was relieved at both early and late stages. The progression of pathology in the native liver was delayed only when transplantation was performed at an early stage. CONCLUSIONS: Auxiliary partial orthotopic LT can significantly improve copper metabolism disorder in the Atp7b mice, and early transplantation may prevent the disease progression.",

This study aimed to characterize the toxic milk mouse from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) (tx-j) mouse model of WD according to changes over time in hepatic copper concentrations, methionine metabolism, global DNA methylation, and gene expression from gestational day 17 (fetal) to adulthood (28 weeks). METHODS: Included liver histology and relevant biochemical analyses including hepatic copper quantification, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) liver levels, qPCR for transcript levels of genes relevant to methionine metabolism and liver damage, and DNA dot blot for global DNA methylation. RESULTS: Hepatic copper was lower in tx-j fetuses but higher in weanling (three weeks) and adult tx-j mice compared to controls. S-adenosylhomocysteinase transcript levels were significantly lower at all time points, except at three weeks, correlating negatively with copper levels and with consequent changes in the SAM:SAH methylation ratio and global DNA methylation. CONCLUSION: Compared to controls, methionine metabolism including S-adenosylhomocysteinase gene expression is persistently different in the tx-j mice with consequent alterations in global DNA methylation in more advanced stages of liver disease. The inhibitory effect of copper accumulation on S-adenosylhomocysteinase expression is associated with progressively abnormal methionine metabolism and decreased methylation capacity and DNA global methylation.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate hepatobiliary malignancies in Wilson disease patients concerning the clinical course of tumour disease and pathological analysis of tumour tissue. METHODS: Multicenter cohort study of patients with confirmed diagnosis of Wilson disease treated at the Second Department of Neurology, Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology, Warsaw, Poland, the university hospitals Heidelberg, Duesseldorf and Dresden, Germany, and the Department of Hepatology, University Leuven, Belgium. Occurrence, treatment and outcome of hepatobiliary tumours were analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: Of a total of 1186 patients, fourteen developed hepatobiliary malignancies. Eight were hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) and six were intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinomas (ICC). The prevalence of hepatobiliary malignancies in the cohort was 1.2% and the incidence was 0.28 per 1000 person years. Pathological analysis of tumour material showed no abnormal copper concentration. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of hepatobiliary malignancies in Wilson disease is very low, even in cirrhotic patients. As a result of the relevant number of ICC in addition to HCC histological analysis through surgical resection or biopsy should be mandatory when a suspect liver lesion is detected. The influence of copper depletion from Wilson disease-specific medical treatment on tumour activity remains to be elucidated.",

Within the WD cohort, correlations of BMD with WD disease parameters, lab results, type of treatment and known osteoporosis risk factors were analysed. METHODS: Hip and lumbar spine absolute BMD and T-score were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Osteoporosis and osteopenia were defined as a T-score <= -2.5, and between -1 and -2.5, respectively. RESULTS: There were significantly more subjects with abnormal T-scores in the WD population (58.8%) than in the control population (45.3%) (chi(2) = 6.65, df = 2, p = 0.036), as there were 50.0% osteopenic and 8.8% osteoporotic WD patients, vs. 41.2% and 4.1%, respectively, in the controls. Especially L2-L4 spine BMD measurements (BMD and T-scores) differed significantly between the WD population and matched controls. L2-L4 spine BMD for WD patients was on average 0.054 g/cm(2) (5.1%) lower than in matched normal controls (0.995 +- 0.156 vs 1.050 +- 0.135; p = 0.002). We found no significant correlation between BMD values and any of the WD disease parameters (e.g. the severity of liver disease), lab results, type of treatment or known osteoporosis risk factors. Duration of D-penicillamine treatment was negatively correlated with femoral BMD value, but in a clinically irrelevant manner, compared to age and gender. Importantly, BMD remained significantly lower in WD patients (n = 89) vs. controls after excluding WD patients with cirrhosis (p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that WD is intrinsically associated with bone demineralisation.",

The incidence for HAT is increased in patients with risk factors (vascular reconstructions, coagulation disorders and acute rejection episodes amongst others). Early retransplantation improves the prognosis for patients, but owing to lack of donors, surgical and interventional radiologic attempts to restore the patency of hepatic artery are made. The prognosis for the liver and the patient can also be improved by the development of collateral circulation. CASE REPORT: We describe a case of a 30-year-old woman with hepatic failure owing to Wilson disease. Liver transplantation with the use of vascular conduit made of donor's iliac arteries was complicated by an early HAT. Heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation was confirmed in the patient. Despite surgical and radiologic attempts to restore patency and despite treatment with fractioned heparin and aspirin, the hepatic artery remained occluded. Retransplantation was not considered, even though the patient was planning a pregnancy. After 1 year of observation of stable liver function, conversion from mycophenolate mofetil to azathioprine treatment, the patient was given consent for a high-risk pregnancy. DISCUSSION: The course of pregnancy was uneventful, with normal liver function parameters, without pathological bleedings. The patient was treated with doses of enoxaparin adjusted for the patient's weight. In the 34th week, owing to increasing concentration of bile acids, the pregnancy ended with a cesarean section. The newborn had 10-point APGAR score.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study enrolled 30 WD patients and 20 age-matched healthy controls. Neurological symptoms were scored using the modified Young Scale. The hepatic function indices, serum and urinary copper content, and serum iron content were determined. All study objects received the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and SWI test of the brain. The values of corrected phase (CP) were calculated on SWI. The relationship between CP values and the clinical status were evaluated. RESULTS: The serum iron content of WD patients was higher than the normal. The CP values of substantia nigra, caudate nucleus, and globus pallidus of WD were lower than the normal values, while the CP value of substantia nigra was the lowest. No correlations were determined between the CP values and the iron and copper parameters. There was negative correlation between the scores of dysarthria and the CP values of the globus pallidus. There was negative correlation between the scores of tremor and the CP values of caudate nucleus. Some regions, which had high signals on T2-weighted image, had low signals on SWI. CONCLUSIONS: There might be abnormal iron metabolism in patients with WD. The decreased CP values might reflect a deposition of both copper and iron. SWI may be more sensitive than the ordinary MRI. The mineral deposition may contribute to the neural symptoms.",

                    "abstract": "Patients with neurologic Wilson disease (NWD) may worsen on treatment, but there is no study evaluating the role of oxidative stress. We report the role of plasma glutathione (GSH), total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the worsening of NWD following treatment. Fifty-one treatment-naive NWD patients were subjected to detailed clinical evaluation. The severity of NWD was noted, and dystonia was measured by Burke-Fahn-Marsden (BFM) score. Their hematological, serum chemistry, ultrasound abdomen and cranial MRI changes were noted. Plasma GSH, TAC and MDA, serum free copper (Cu) and 24-h urinary Cu were measured at admission and at 3 and 6 months after treatment. The patients were considered worsened if there was one or more grade deterioration in severity scale, >10 % deterioration in BFM score or appearance of new neurologic signs. The median age of the patients was 11 (5-37) years, and 12 were females. Following treatment, 25 patients improved, 12 worsened, and 14 had stationary course. The worsened group at 3 months had lower GSH (1.99 +- 0.17 vs. 2.30 +- 0.30 mg/dl; P = 0.004) and TAC (1.59 +- 0.12 vs. 1.82 +- 0.17 mmol Trolox equivalent/L; P = 0.001) and higher MDA (5.24 +- 0.22 vs. 4.34 +- 0.46 nmol/ml; P < 0.001) levels compared to the improved group. These changes were associated with increased serum free Cu (41.81 +- 3.31 vs. 35.62 +- 6.40 microg/dl; P = 0.02) and 24-h urinary Cu (206.42 +- 41.61 vs. 121.99 +- 23.72 microg/24 h; P < 0.001) in the worsened compared to the improved group. All the patients having worsening were on penicillamine. Worsening following chelating treatment in NWD may be due to oxidative stress which is induced by increased serum free Cu. These results may have future therapeutic implication and needs further study.",

                    "abstract": "Drug-induced liver injury after liver transplant occurs in 1.7% of patients. Tacrolimus is an effective immunosuppressant that is used to treat acute rejection. Although rare, it can cause toxicity, which is demonstrated by cholestatic liver injury. Here, we present a case of a young male patient who was diagnosed with Wilson disease, had penicillaminechelating therapy, and underwent living related liver transplant. Within 1 month posttransplant, he developed deranged, predominantly cholestatic pattern liver function tests. Laboratory parameters showed total bilirubin of 1.12 mg/ dL, alanine aminotransferase of 553 IU/L, gammaglutamyltransferase of 624 IU/L, and tacrolimus level of 10.2 ng/mL. After thorough evaluation, a liver biopsy was performed. Liver biopsy showed hepatocellular necrosis with centrilobular cholestasis without any evidence of graft rejection. However, with normal level of tacrolimus, the biopsy was suggestive of drug-induced liver injury. Thus, tacrolimus dose was reduced, resulting in improved liver function tests and patient discharge from the hospital. Tacrolimus is an effective immunosuppressant after liver transplant and has the ability to treat early acute rejection. The patient's liver biopsy showed hepatocellular necrosis with centrilobular cholestasis without any evidence of graft rejection. Cholestatic liver injury after tacrolimus usually resolves after dose reduction or by switching to another agent. With demonstrated tacrolimus-induced toxicity in liver transplant recipients, despite normal serum levels, transplant physicians should keep high index of suspicion regarding toxicity in the posttransplant setting.",

We report radiological changes in four patients with WDN who worsen after penicillamine. METHODS: WDN was diagnosed on the basis of clinical, KF ring, serum ceruloplasmin and 24h urinary copper. Hematological, biochemical and cranial MRI were repeated at the time of clinical deterioration following chelating treatment. RESULTS: Four WDN patients had neurological deterioration within 4-8 weeks of penicillamine therapy. This was associated with new lesions in white matter, thalamus, pons and mid brain and these lesions showed diffusion restriction. The neurologic deterioration was associated with increased free serum copper and malanodialdehyde and reduced glutathione. Clinical conditions stabilized after few weeks of penicillamine discontinuation. CONCLUSION: Neurological worsening was associated with new lesions on MRI which revealed diffusion restriction. Increased free copper induced oxidative stress may be responsible for these changes.",

This case report contributes to existing knowledge by highlighting the unusual manifestation of Wilson disease with significant neurological symptoms. PATIENT CONCERNS: The patient, pseudonym John Smith, presented with prominent neurological symptoms, including tremors, dystonia, and psychiatric manifestations. Clinical findings corroborated copper accumulation in the brain, prompting a thorough diagnostic investigation. DIAGNOSES: Genetic analysis revealed two ATP7B mutations, confirming the primary diagnosis of Wilson disease. This case underscores the importance of recognizing atypical neurological presentations in the context of this rare genetic disorder. INTERVENTIONS: Chelation therapy, initiated promptly upon diagnosis, targeted copper overload. The intervention led to notable improvements in neurological symptoms and psychiatric manifestations. The dosage and duration of treatment were adjusted based on regular monitoring. OUTCOMES: Regular follow-up revealed a positive trajectory, with reduced tremors and improved overall well-being. Genetic testing, coupled with clinical assessments, contributed to monitoring treatment efficacy and optimizing therapeutic interventions. LESSONS: The main takeaway lessons from this case include the significance of a comprehensive diagnostic approach, personalized therapeutic interventions, and the imperative to acknowledge the diverse clinical spectrum of Wilson disease. Early recognition and tailored treatment contribute to favorable outcomes in cases with atypical neurological presentations.",

There are few data on long-term outcomes and survival from large cohorts; we studied these features in a well-characterized Austrian cohort of patients with Wilson disease. METHODS: We analyzed data from 229 patients diagnosed with Wilson disease from 1961 through 2013; 175 regularly attended a Wilson disease outpatient clinic and/or their physicians were contacted for information on disease and treatment status and outcomes. For 53 patients lost during the follow-up period, those that died and reasons for their death were identified from the Austrian death registry. RESULTS: The mean observation period was 14.8 +- 11.4 years (range, 0.5-52.0 years), resulting in 3116 patient-years. Of the patients, 61% presented with hepatic disease, 27% with neurologic symptoms, and 10% were diagnosed by family screening at presymptomatic stages. Patients with a hepatic presentation were diagnosed younger (21.2 +- 12.0 years) than patients with neurologic disease (28.8 +- 12.0; P < .001). In 2% of patients, neither symptoms nor onset of symptoms could be determined with certainty. Most patients stabilized (35%) or improved on chelation therapy (26% fully recovered, 24% improved), but 15% deteriorated; 8% required a liver transplant, and 7.4% died within the observation period (71% of deaths were related to Wilson disease). A lower proportion of patients with Wilson disease survived for 20 years (92%) than healthy Austrians (97%), adjusted for age and sex (P = .03). Cirrhosis at diagnosis was the best predictor of death (odds ratio, 6.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-31.03; P = .013) and need for a liver transplant (odds ratio, 07; 95% confidence interval, 0.016-0.307; P < .001). Only 84% of patients with cirrhosis survived 20 years after diagnosis (compared with healthy Austrians, P =.008). CONCLUSION: Overall, patients who receive adequate care for Wilson disease have a good long-term prognosis. However, cirrhosis increases the risk of death and liver disease. Early diagnosis, at a precirrhotic stage, might increase survival times and reduce the need for a liver transplant.",

Auxiliary partial orthotopic LT (APOLT) has been performed successfully in end-stage WD patients, which expands the donor pool. METHODS: Atp7bmice were used as experimental model of WD. Eight- and 20-week-old mice were used as different timepoints to perform APOLT. Serum copper, tissue copper, serum ceruloplasmin (CP), and liver histological examination were observed after operation. RESULTS: Hepatic and serum copper levels in Atp7b mice decreased after APOLT, and copper metabolism disorder of WD mice was relieved at both early and late stages. The progression of pathology in the native liver was delayed only when transplantation was performed at an early stage. CONCLUSIONS: Auxiliary partial orthotopic LT can significantly improve copper metabolism disorder in the Atp7b mice, and early transplantation may prevent the disease progression.",

The patient, as a result of neurologic symptoms that included tremor walking and speaking problems and low serum ceruloplasmin level of 7 mg/dL, was diagnosed with Wilson disease, and a liver biopsy was performed. Chronic necroinflammatory disease activity was 4/18, and the patient received chelation treatment. His hepatic functions were normal. The donor was the patient's 57-year-old father whose liver function tests were also normal. The graft-to-recipient weight ratio was 1% using a left lobe graft. After transplant, serum ceruloplasmin levels on day 15 and month 1 were 14 and 19 mg/dL. At month 1, liver function tests were normal. Doppler ultrasonography showed normal vascular flow of the native liver and the graft. The patient's neurologic symptoms were progressively reduced. Progressive neurologic deterioration with no hepatic insufficiency is considered a suitable indication for auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplant; this procedure is suggested before the neurologic and liver failure symptoms of Wilson disease occur.",

The patient, as a result of neurologic symptoms that included tremor walking and speaking problems and low serum ceruloplasmin level of 7 mg/dL, was diagnosed with Wilson disease, and a liver biopsy was performed. Chronic necroinflammatory disease activity was 4/18, and the patient received chelation treatment. His hepatic functions were normal. The donor was the patient's 57-year-old father whose liver function tests were also normal. The graft-to-recipient weight ratio was 1% using a left lobe graft. After transplant, serum ceruloplasmin levels on day 15 and month 1 were 14 and 19 mg/dL. At month 1, liver function tests were normal. Doppler ultrasonography showed normal vascular flow of the native liver and the graft. The patient's neurologic symptoms were progressively reduced. Progressive neurologic deterioration with no hepatic insufficiency is considered a suitable indication for auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplant; this procedure is suggested before the neurologic and liver failure symptoms of Wilson disease occur.",

Chelating agents (D-penicillamine, trientine) are used as first-line therapies for symptomatic patients, but there are few data from large cohorts. We assessed the safety of D-penicillamine and trientine therapy and outcomes of patients with Wilson disease. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of data on 380 patients with Wilson disease from tertiary care centers in Germany and Austria, and 25 additional patients from the EUROWILSON registry. Chelator-based treatment regimens were analyzed for their effect on neurologic and hepatic symptoms and for adverse events that led to discontinuation of therapy (Kaplan-Meier estimation; data were collected for a mean of 13.3 y after therapy began). RESULTS: Changes in medication were common, resulting in analysis of 471 chelator monotherapies (326 patients receiving D-penicillamine and 141 receiving trientine). Nine of 326 patients treated with D-penicillamine and 3 of 141 patients given trientine underwent liver transplantation. Adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment were more frequent among those receiving D-penicillamine than trientine (P = .039). Forty-eight months after therapy, hepatic deterioration was reported in only 4 of 333 patients treated initially with a chelating agent. Hepatic improvements were observed in more than 90%, and neurologic improvements were observed in more than 55%, of therapy-naive patients, and values did not differ significantly between treatments. However, neurologic deterioration was observed less frequently in patients given D-penicillamine first (6 of 295) than those given trientine first (4 of 38; P = .018). CONCLUSIONS: Chelating agents are effective therapies for most patients with Wilson disease; D-penicillamine and trientine produce comparable outcomes, although D-penicillamine had a higher rate of adverse events. Few patients receiving chelation therapy had neurologic deterioration, which occurred more frequently in patients who received trientine.",

The study describes the development and validation of a novel assay termed circulating single-molecule amplification and resequencing technology (cSMART) for counting single allelic molecules in plasma. Here we demonstrate the suitability of cSMART for NIPT, with Wilson Disease (WD) as proof of concept. METHODS: We used Sanger and whole-exome sequencing to identify familial ATP7B (ATPase, Cu(++) transporting, beta polypeptide) gene mutations. For cSMART, single molecules were tagged with unique barcodes and circularized, and alleles were targeted and replicated by inverse PCR. The unique single allelic molecules were identified by sequencing and counted, and the percentage of mutant alleles in the original maternal plasma sample was used to determine fetal genotypes. RESULTS: Four families with WD pedigrees consented to the study. Using Sanger and whole-exome sequencing, we mapped the pathogenic ATP7B mutations in each pedigree and confirmed the proband's original diagnosis of WD. After validation of cSMART with defined plasma models mimicking fetal inheritance of paternal, maternal, or both parental mutant alleles, we retrospectively showed in second pregnancies that the fetal genotypes assigned by invasive testing and NIPT were concordant. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a reliable and accurate NIPT assay that correctly diagnosed the fetal genotypes in 4 pregnancies at risk for WD. This novel technology has potential as a universal strategy for NIPT of other monogenic disorders, since it requires only knowledge of the parental pathogenic mutations.",

Brain accumulation of copper may cause neuropsychiatric symptoms. Trientine (triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride) is a copper-chelating agent used to treat patients with WD. Trientine has been considered an option for initial treatment and maintentance therapy of WD due to its safety profile. CASE PRESENTATION: A 40 year old female with a recent diagnosis of WD was started on treatment with trientine for her WD. Within one month she developed profound bloody diarrhea unresponsive to medical treatment. Trientine was discontinued and a colonoscopy with biopsy showed moderately active ileitis and moderate to severe pancolitis, consistent with a drug induced mucosal injury. The colitis improved immediately upon withdrawal of trientine, and recurred when medication was rechallenged because of worsened WD symptoms. After second compulsory discontinuation of trientine, she remained on zinc therapy for her WD and her colitis resolved by time. CONCLUSION: Drug induced colitis is a very rare side effect of trientine. Although trientine therapy is well tolerated and less side effects are reported with this medication than penicillamine, colitis can occur during trientine treatment. Zinc therapy may be an effective alternative for treatment of WD in patients experiencing side effects from chelation therapy.",

The suspicion should be high in patients presenting with extrapyramidal disorders or with liver diseases or of unknown origin. For diagnosis, in many patients a combination of tests reflecting disturbed copper metabolism may be needed. Not a single test is per se specific and, thus, a range of tests has to be applied (presence or absence of Kayser-Fleischer rings or neurologic symptoms, serum ceruloplasmin, liver copper content, urinary copper excretion, mutation analysis; rated -1 to 4 depending on the test) and clinical symptoms. A diagnostic sum score of >= 4 confirms the diagnosis.",

The success of tandem mass spectrometry is due to important advances in hardware, software and clinical applications during the last 25 years. MS/MS permits a very rapid measurement of many metabolites in different biological specimens by using filter paper spots or directly on biological fluids. Its use in NBS give us the chance to identify possible treatable metabolic disorders even when asymptomatic and the benefits gained by this type of screening is now recognized worldwide. Today the use of MS/MS for second-tier tests and confirmatory testing is promising especially in the early detection of new disorders such as some lysosomal storage disorders, ADA and PNP SCIDs, X-adrenoleucodistrophy (X-ALD), Wilson disease, guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency (GAMT), and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

Three of the 14 prospective cases resulted in a spontaneous abortion, and one pregnancy was electively terminated. Our results do not support the hypothesis of teratogenicity based on earlier case reports of congenital anomalies.

The incidence for HAT is increased in patients with risk factors (vascular reconstructions, coagulation disorders and acute rejection episodes amongst others). Early retransplantation improves the prognosis for patients, but owing to lack of donors, surgical and interventional radiologic attempts to restore the patency of hepatic artery are made. The prognosis for the liver and the patient can also be improved by the development of collateral circulation. CASE REPORT: We describe a case of a 30-year-old woman with hepatic failure owing to Wilson disease. Liver transplantation with the use of vascular conduit made of donor's iliac arteries was complicated by an early HAT. Heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation was confirmed in the patient. Despite surgical and radiologic attempts to restore patency and despite treatment with fractioned heparin and aspirin, the hepatic artery remained occluded. Retransplantation was not considered, even though the patient was planning a pregnancy. After 1 year of observation of stable liver function, conversion from mycophenolate mofetil to azathioprine treatment, the patient was given consent for a high-risk pregnancy. DISCUSSION: The course of pregnancy was uneventful, with normal liver function parameters, without pathological bleedings. The patient was treated with doses of enoxaparin adjusted for the patient's weight. In the 34th week, owing to increasing concentration of bile acids, the pregnancy ended with a cesarean section. The newborn had 10-point APGAR score.",

                    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Wilson disease (WD) is a hepatoneurological disorder caused by mutations in the copper-transporter, ATP7B. Copper accumulation in the liver is a hallmark of WD. Current therapy is based on copper chelation, which decreases the manifestations of liver disease, but often worsens neurological symptoms. We demonstrate that in Atp7b(-/-) mice, an animal model of WD, liver function can be significantly improved without copper chelation. Analysis of transcriptional and metabolic changes in samples from WD patients and Atp7b(-/-) mice identified dysregulation of nuclear receptors (NRs), especially the liver X receptor (LXR)/retinoid X receptor heterodimer, as an important event in WD pathogenesis. Treating Atp7b(-/-) mice with the LXR agonist, T0901317, ameliorated disease manifestations despite significant copper overload. Genetic markers of liver fibrosis and inflammatory cytokines were significantly decreased, lipid profiles normalized, and liver function and histology were improved. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the major role of an altered NR function in the pathogenesis of WD and suggest that modulation of NR activity should be explored as a supplementary approach to improving liver function in WD.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: In Wilson Disease (WD), copper accumulates in the liver and brain causing disease. Bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) is a potent copper chelator that may be associated with a lower risk of inducing paradoxical neurological worsening than conventional therapy for neurologic WD. To better understand the mode of action of TTM, we investigated its effects on copper absorption and biliary excretion. METHODS: In a double-blind randomized setting, hepatic 64Cu activity was examined after orally administered 64Cu by PET/CT in 16 healthy volunteers before and after seven days of TTM treatment (15 mg/d) or placebo. Oral 64Cu was administered one hour after the final TTM dose. Changes in hepatic 64Cu activity reflected changes in intestinal 64Cu uptake. Additionally, in four patients with WD, the distribution of 64Cu in venous blood, liver, gallbladder, kidney, and brain was followed after i.v. 64Cu dosing for up to 68 hours before and after seven days of TTM (15 mg/day), using PET/MRI. Increased gallbladder 64Cu activity was taken as evidence of increased biliary 64Cu excretion. RESULTS: In healthy volunteers, TTM reduced intestinal 64Cu uptake by 82% 15 hours after the oral 64Cu dose. In patients with WD, gallbladder 64Cu activity was negligible before and after TTM, while TTM effectively retained 64Cu in the blood, significantly reduced hepatic 64Cu activity at all time-points and significantly reduced cerebral 64Cu activity two hours after the intravenous 64Cu dose. CONCLUSIONS: While we did not show an increase in biliary excretion of 64Cu following TTM administration, we demonstrated that TTM effectively inhibited most intestinal 64Cu uptake and retained 64Cu in the blood stream, limiting the exposure of 64Cu to organs like the liver and the brain. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: Bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) is an investigational copper chelator being developed for the treatment of Wilson disease. In animal models of Wilson disease, TTM has been shown to facilitate biliary copper excretion. In the present human study, TTM surprisingly did not facilitate biliary copper excretion but instead reduced intestinal copper uptake to a clinically significant degree. Our study builds on our understanding of human copper metabolism and the mechanism of action of TTM.",

This study included 691 newly diagnosed WD patients, 34 asymptomatic cases, and 127 healthy controls. The entire sample was assessed for serum levels of BUN, Cr, and UA. We found that the levels of BUN and Cr in WD patients who had neurological manifestations were higher (p < 0.001). In contrast, those patients presenting with a combined neurological and hepatic condition showed the lowest serum levels of UA (p = 0.026). There are differences in renal impairment between the endo-phenotypes of WD. Renal impairment can reflect differential copper deposition in organs other than the liver. ",

In this study, we evaluated the histopathologic findings of explanted livers in Wilson disease, with special emphasis on copper histochemistry. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study group was recruited by reviewing archived histopathology reports and the liver transplant clinic patient records retrospectively for patients who had liver transplant for Wilson disease between January 2010 and June 2015, at Turgut Ozal Medical Center. Archival slides were reevaluated. When needed, relevant clinical and laboratory data were obtained from patient medical records. RESULTS: During the selected period, there were 33 patients fitting the study criteria (22 male, 11 female, mean age of 22 +- 11 y). All patients had mild to moderate septal inflammation. We found that 29 patients (88%) showed glycogenated hepatocyte nuclei and 27 patients (79%) showed nuclear pleomorphism. Other histopathologic findings were cholestasis (48%) and macrovesicular steatosis (39%). There was no special finding in hilar regions except for 2 patients who had recanalized portal vein thrombosis. In terms of copper histochemistry, 2 copper stains, Timm silver sulfide and rhodanine, were performed in all cases, with orcein staining only done for 25 of the cases. Positivity rates for these copper stains were 85%, 82%, and 36%. Periodic acid-Schiff-diastase- and periodic acid-Schiff-positive granules were detected in 7 of 33 patients (21%). Iron deposition was seen in 12 patients (focal and/or minimal in 11, more than focal in 1). There was no dysplasia or malignancy in any of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: On routine hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides, detection of glycogenated hepatocyte nuclei and the finding of the nuclear pleomorphism should alert the pathologist for the possibility of Wilson disease, especially with cryptogenic liver disease.

                    "abstract": "Two copper-transporting ATPases are essential for mammalian copper homeostasis: ATP7A, which mediates copper uptake in the gastrointestinal tract and copper delivery to the brain, and ATP7B, which mediates copper excretion by the liver into bile. Mutations in ATP7A may cause three distinct X-linked conditions in infants, children, or adolescents: Menkes disease, occipital horn syndrome (OHS), and a newly identified allelic variant restricted to motor neurons called X-linked distal hereditary motor neuropathy. These three disorders show variable neurological findings and ages of onset. Menkes disease presents in the first several months of life with failure to thrive, developmental delay, and seizures. OHS features more subtle developmental delays, dysautonomia, and connective tissue abnormalities beginning in early childhood. ATP7A-related distal motor neuropathy presents even later, often not until adolescence or early adulthood, and involves a neurological phenotype that resembles Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 2. These disorders may be treatable through copper replacement or ATP7A gene therapy. In contrast, mutations in ATP7B cause a single known phenotype, Wilson disease, an autosomal recessive trait that results from copper overload rather than deficiency. Dysarthria, dystonia, tremor, gait abnormalities, and psychiatric problems may be presenting symptoms, at ages from 10 to 40 years. Excellent treatment options exist for Wilson disease, based on copper chelation. In the past 2 years (2012-2013), three new autosomal recessive copper metabolism conditions have been recognized: 1) Huppke-Brendel syndrome caused by mutations in an acetyl CoA transporter needed for acetylation of one or more copper proteins, 2) CCS deficiency caused by mutations in the copper chaperone to SODI, and 3) MEDNIK syndrome, which revealed that mutations in the sigma1A subunit of adaptor protein complex 1 (AP-1) have detrimental effects on trafficking of ATP7A and ATP7B.",

Iron brain disorders are divided into genetic neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA, neuroferritinopathy, and aceruloplasminemia), genetic systemic iron accumulation with neurologic features (hemochromatosis), and acquired diseases associated with iron excess (superficial siderosis) or iron deficiency (restless leg syndrome).

The aim of this study was to investigate central corneal changes and in particular to assess the parameters of corneal subbasal nerve plexus (SBNP) in patients affected by WD, using corneal confocal microscopy (CCM). METHODS: A total of 24 patients affected by WD and 24 healthy control subjects were included in this cross-sectional comparative study. One eye of each subject was examined to quantify different corneal parameters. Mean cell diameter and mean cell density of the epithelium; number of fibers (NF), nerve fiber length density (NFLD), number of branchings (NBr), number of beadings (NBe), and fiber tortuosity (FT) of the SBNP; mean cell density of keratocytes of the anterior, medium, and posterior stroma; and mean cell density, polimegatism, and pleomorphism of the endothelium, and central corneal sensitivity were analyzed. RESULTS: Wilson disease induced significant alterations in SBNP, and corneal epithelium. The NFLD (P < 0.0001), NF (P = 0.001), NBe (P = 0.025), and NBr (P < 0.0001) were significantly lower, whereas FT (P < 0.0001) was significantly higher in WD subjects compared to controls.

The prognostic models such as Nazer's model, revised Kings College Model, and pediatric end-stage liver disease/model for end-stage liver disease (PELD/MELD) score were compared.

We report the role of plasma glutathione (GSH), total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the worsening of NWD following treatment. Fifty-one treatment-naive NWD patients were subjected to detailed clinical evaluation. The severity of NWD was noted, and dystonia was measured by Burke-Fahn-Marsden (BFM) score. Their hematological, serum chemistry, ultrasound abdomen and cranial MRI changes were noted. Plasma GSH, TAC and MDA, serum free copper (Cu) and 24-h urinary Cu were measured at admission and at 3 and 6 months after treatment. The patients were considered worsened if there was one or more grade deterioration in severity scale, >10 % deterioration in BFM score or appearance of new neurologic signs. The median age of the patients was 11 (5-37) years, and 12 were females. Following treatment, 25 patients improved, 12 worsened, and 14 had stationary course. The worsened group at 3 months had lower GSH (1.99 +- 0.17 vs. 2.30 +- 0.30 mg/dl; P = 0.004) and TAC (1.59 +- 0.12 vs. 1.82 +- 0.17 mmol Trolox equivalent/L; P = 0.001) and higher MDA (5.24 +- 0.22 vs. 4.34 +- 0.46 nmol/ml; P < 0.001) levels compared to the improved group. These changes were associated with increased serum free Cu (41.81 +- 3.31 vs. 35.62 +- 6.40 microg/dl; P = 0.02) and 24-h urinary Cu (206.42 +- 41.61 vs. 121.99 +- 23.72 microg/24 h; P < 0.001) in the worsened compared to the improved group. All the patients having worsening were on penicillamine. Worsening following chelating treatment in NWD may be due to oxidative stress which is induced by increased serum free Cu. These results may have future therapeutic implication and needs further study.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The severity of Wilson's disease (WD) is linked to free copper accumulating in the liver and brain. Exchangeable copper (CuEXC) is a new technique to determine plasmatic copper and is useful in the diagnosis of WD. It is hypothesized that it may also enable a good evaluation of extra-hepatic involvement and its severity. METHODS: Forty-eight newly diagnosed WD patients were prospectively evaluated using hepatic, neurological, ophthalmological and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scores. Three phenotypic presentations were distinguished: pre-symptomatic, hepatic and extra-hepatic. CuEXC was determined in addition to standard copper assays before decoppering therapy. Correlations between biological parameters and the different scores were determined and compared in the hepatic and extra-hepatic groups. RESULTS: Extra-hepatic patients had significantly higher CuEXC values than those with the hepatic form (P < 0.0001). The overall ability of CuEXC to separate the two forms was satisfactory, with an area under the curve of 0.883 (95% confidence interval 0.771-0.996) and an optimal threshold for extra-hepatic diagnosis of 2.08 mumol/l (sensitivity 85.7%; specificity 94.1%). In extra-hepatic patients, CuEXC was the only biological marker to be positively correlated with the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Score (r = 0.45, P = 0.016), the Kayser-Fleischer ring score (r = 0.46, P = 0.014) and the brain MRI score (r = 0.38, P = 0.048), but it was not correlated with the hepatic score. CONCLUSIONS: Exchangeable copper determination is useful when diagnosing WD as a value >2.08 mumol/l is indicative of the severity of the extra-hepatic involvement. In the case of purely hepatic presentation, atypical or mild neurological signs, it should encourage physicians to search for lesions in the brain and eyes.",

Their liver, kidney and brain tissues were subjected for Cu, glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) assay. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine, bilirubin and transaminases were measured. GSH, TAC and MDA levels were correlated with the markers of respective organ dysfunction. Administration of CuSO4 resulted in increased free Cu and MDA level, and decrease GSH and TAC levels in group-II and III compared with group-I. In experimental groups, the reduction in TAC and GSH levels was maximum in liver tissue followed by brain and kidney; whereas increase in MDA level was highest in liver followed by brain and kidney at 30, 60 and 90 days. TAC and GSH levels in the liver inversely correlated with serum transaminases and bilirubin, and tissue free Cu, and positively correlated with MDA levels. Free Cu level in kidney tissue and BUN inversely correlated with TAC and GSH, and positively with MDA level. Grip-strength, rotarod and Y-maze findings were inversely correlated with brain free Cu and MDA levels and positively with GSH and TAC levels.

As excess copper (Cu) is known to induce oxidative stress and apoptosis, and is characteristic for the human pathology Wilson disease, we investigated the effect of OSIP108 on Cu-induced toxicity in yeast. We found that OSIP108 increased yeast viability in the presence of toxic Cu concentrations, and decreased the prevalence of Cu-induced apoptotic markers. Next, we translated these results to the human hepatoma HepG2 cell line, demonstrating anti-apoptotic activity of OSIP108 in this cell line. In addition, we found that OSIP108 did not affect intracellular Cu levels in HepG2 cells, but preserved HepG2 mitochondrial ultrastructure. As Cu is known to induce acid sphingomyelinase activity of HepG2 cells, we performed a sphingolipidomic analysis of OSIP108-treated HepG2 cells. We demonstrated that OSIP108 decreased the levels of several sphingoid bases and ceramide species. Moreover, exogenous addition of the sphingoid base dihydrosphingosine abolished the protective effect of OSIP108 against Cu-induced cell death in yeast. These findings indicate the potential of OSIP108 to prevent Cu-induced apoptosis, possibly via its effects on sphingolipid homeostasis. ",

Within the WD cohort, correlations of BMD with WD disease parameters, lab results, type of treatment and known osteoporosis risk factors were analysed. METHODS: Hip and lumbar spine absolute BMD and T-score were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Osteoporosis and osteopenia were defined as a T-score <= -2.5, and between -1 and -2.5, respectively. RESULTS: There were significantly more subjects with abnormal T-scores in the WD population (58.8%) than in the control population (45.3%) (chi(2) = 6.65, df = 2, p = 0.036), as there were 50.0% osteopenic and 8.8% osteoporotic WD patients, vs. 41.2% and 4.1%, respectively, in the controls. Especially L2-L4 spine BMD measurements (BMD and T-scores) differed significantly between the WD population and matched controls. L2-L4 spine BMD for WD patients was on average 0.054 g/cm(2) (5.1%) lower than in matched normal controls (0.995 +- 0.156 vs 1.050 +- 0.135; p = 0.002). We found no significant correlation between BMD values and any of the WD disease parameters (e.g. the severity of liver disease), lab results, type of treatment or known osteoporosis risk factors. Duration of D-penicillamine treatment was negatively correlated with femoral BMD value, but in a clinically irrelevant manner, compared to age and gender. Importantly, BMD remained significantly lower in WD patients (n = 89) vs. controls after excluding WD patients with cirrhosis (p = 0.009).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with skin biopsies were selected from 408 liver transplant recipients from January 1990 to December 2012 at Baskent University in Ankara, Turkey. Demographic and clinical findings including age, sex, primary liver disease, immunosuppressive therapy, and the time between transplant and cutaneous lesions were examined. RESULTS: There were 38 patients who had skin biopsy after liver transplantation. The mean age at transplantation was 30.5 years. The primary liver disease was hepatocellular carcinoma second to viral hepatitis in 15 patients, Wilson disease in 7 patients, cryptogenic cirrhosis in 3, familial hypercholesterolemia in 3 patients, and 1 each patients of Byler disease, Caroli disease, tyrosinemia, Budd-Chiari syndrome, congenital hepatic fibrosis, alcoholic cirrhosis, and biliary atresia. The primary disease in 3 patients were unknown. The histologic diagnosis included precancerous and cancerous lesions (n=4), infectious diseases (n=4); xanthomatous lesions (n=4); vasculopathic lesions (n=4); melanocytic lesions (n=4); benign adnexial tumors (n=2); skin atrophy (n=2); calcinosis cutis (n=2), keratinous cyst (n=2), neutrophilic dermatosis (n=2), perivascular dermatitis (n=2) and miscellaneous lesions (n=6). CONCLUSIONS: We presented the cutaneous manifestations in liver transplant recipients. The most common skin lesion in these patients were precancerous and cancerous lesions, infectious, xanthomatous, and melanocytic lesions. The findings emphasize the importance of dermatologic screening in these patients that can provide early diagnosis and a better quality of life.",

Detecting mutations and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the ATP7B gene in Turkish pediatric WD patients (n=32) and controls (n=52) is the aim of this research. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For screening mutations and SNPs of the ATP7B gene, sequencing was performed. RESULTS: Mutations were determined in the ATP7B gene in 23 out of the 32 pediatric patients. The mutation detection rate in the ATP7B gene of the pediatric Turkish WD patients was 71.875%. Fifteen different mutations were determined in the ATP7B gene. These mutations were distributed throughout the ATP7B gene and were as follows: 2 deletion, 1 insertion, 3 nonsense, and 9 missense mutations. Four of these, including c.3111delC (1 deletion) and c.2363C>T, c.3733C>A, and c.3451C>T (3 missense) mutations, were detected in the Turkish WD patients. Eleven polymorphisms were detected in both groups. Among these, c.3727G>A (SNP) was reported in the Wilson Disease Mutation Database by our group. Nine out of the thirty-two pediatric Turkish WD patients had no mutations in the ATP7B gene. CONCLUSION: To find the cause of WD in pediatric patients who have no mutation in ATP7B, additional research is necessary.",

These diseases are accompanied by a wide range of systemic manifestations (cardiopathies, endocrinopathies, skeletal deformities, and skin abnormalities). DEVELOPMENT: This study reviews current knowledge of the most common forms of autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia in order to provide tips that may facilitate diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: A thorough assessment of clinical phenotype (pure cerebellar or cerebellar-plus syndrome, with or without systemic manifestations), laboratory tests (vitamin E, acanthocytosis, albumin, cholesterol, phytanic acid, lactic acid, creatine kinase, cholestanol, coenzyme Q10, alpha-fetoprotein, copper, ceruloplasmin, chitotriosidase), nerve conduction studies (presence and type of neuropathy), and an magnetic resonance imaging study (presence of cerebellar atrophy, presence and location of signal alterations) may help establish a suspected diagnosis, which should be confirmed by detecting the underlying genetic mutation. A positive genetic test result is necessary to determine prognosis and provide adequate genetic counselling, and will also permit appropriate treatment of some entities (abetalipoproteinaemia, ataxia with vitamin E deficiency, Refsum disease, cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, Niemann-Pick disease type C, Wilson disease). Without a genetic diagnosis, conducting basic research and therapeutic trials will not be possible.",

                    "abstract": "The normal functioning of brain is intimately as well as intricately interrelated with normal functioning of the liver. Liver plays a critical role of not only providing vital nutrients to the brain but also of detoxifying the splanchnic blood. Compromised liver function leads to insufficient detoxification thus allowing neurotoxins (such as ammonia, manganese, and other chemicals) to enter the cerebral circulation. In addition, portosystemic shunts, which are common accompaniments of advanced liver disease, facilitate free passage of neurotoxins into the cerebral circulation. The problem is compounded further by additional variables such as gastrointestinal tract bleeding, malnutrition, and concurrent renal failure, which are often associated with liver cirrhosis. Neurologic damage in chronic liver disease and liver cirrhosis seems to be multifactorial primarily attributable to the following: brain accumulation of ammonia, manganese, and lactate; altered permeability of the blood-brain barrier; recruitment of monocytes after microglial activation; and neuroinflammation, that is, direct effects of circulating systemic proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor, IL-1beta, and IL-6. Radiologist should be aware of the conundrum of neurologic complications that can be encountered in liver disease, which include hepatic encephalopathy, hepatocerebral degeneration, hepatic myelopathy, cirrhosis-related parkinsonism, cerebral infections, hemorrhage, and osmotic demyelination. In addition, neurologic complications can be exclusive to certain disorders, for example, Wilson disease, alcoholism (Wernicke encephalopathy, alcoholic cerebellar degeneration, Marchiafava-Bignami disease, etc). Radiologist should be aware of their varied clinical presentation and radiological appearances as the diagnosis is not always straightforward. ",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease were included in our study. Inclusion criteria were: presence of liver steatosis on ultrasound in patients with waist circumference over 94 cm in men and over 80 cm in women and with serologic elements of metabolic syndrome. Exclusion criteria were: chronic viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson disease, hemochromatosis, regular alcohol consumption. Body mass index, waist circumference, fasting plasma glucose, serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels and serum ALT were determined. On liver biopsy specimens, performed in each patient, the NASH score, representing the sum of fibrosis, steatosis, lobular inflammation and ballooning, was calculated. RESULTS: Necroinflammation was mild in 15 patients, medium in 19 patients and severe in five patients. Mild fibrosis was present in four cases, medium in 14 cases, severe in six, and two patients were diagnosed with cirrhosis. We found statistically significant correlation between waist circumference and the grade of histological activity, the presence of diabetes and both fibrosis grade and histological activity, and the serum ALT and histological activity. CONCLUSIONS: Noninvasive assessment of the severity of hepatic histological changes in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease could be made by anthropometric parameters or by serologic components of metabolic syndrome, but it is not an accurate method to identify patients with high-risk for disease progression. These noninvasive parameters cannot replace liver biopsy.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The severity of Wilson's disease (WD) is linked to free copper accumulating in the liver and brain. Exchangeable copper (CuEXC) is a new technique to determine plasmatic copper and is useful in the diagnosis of WD. It is hypothesized that it may also enable a good evaluation of extra-hepatic involvement and its severity. METHODS: Forty-eight newly diagnosed WD patients were prospectively evaluated using hepatic, neurological, ophthalmological and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scores. Three phenotypic presentations were distinguished: pre-symptomatic, hepatic and extra-hepatic. CuEXC was determined in addition to standard copper assays before decoppering therapy. Correlations between biological parameters and the different scores were determined and compared in the hepatic and extra-hepatic groups. RESULTS: Extra-hepatic patients had significantly higher CuEXC values than those with the hepatic form (P < 0.0001). The overall ability of CuEXC to separate the two forms was satisfactory, with an area under the curve of 0.883 (95% confidence interval 0.771-0.996) and an optimal threshold for extra-hepatic diagnosis of 2.08 mumol/l (sensitivity 85.7%; specificity 94.1%). In extra-hepatic patients, CuEXC was the only biological marker to be positively correlated with the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Score (r = 0.45, P = 0.016), the Kayser-Fleischer ring score (r = 0.46, P = 0.014) and the brain MRI score (r = 0.38, P = 0.048), but it was not correlated with the hepatic score. CONCLUSIONS: Exchangeable copper determination is useful when diagnosing WD as a value >2.08 mumol/l is indicative of the severity of the extra-hepatic involvement. In the case of purely hepatic presentation, atypical or mild neurological signs, it should encourage physicians to search for lesions in the brain and eyes.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study enrolled 30 WD patients and 20 age-matched healthy controls. Neurological symptoms were scored using the modified Young Scale. The hepatic function indices, serum and urinary copper content, and serum iron content were determined. All study objects received the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and SWI test of the brain. The values of corrected phase (CP) were calculated on SWI. The relationship between CP values and the clinical status were evaluated. RESULTS: The serum iron content of WD patients was higher than the normal. The CP values of substantia nigra, caudate nucleus, and globus pallidus of WD were lower than the normal values, while the CP value of substantia nigra was the lowest. No correlations were determined between the CP values and the iron and copper parameters. There was negative correlation between the scores of dysarthria and the CP values of the globus pallidus. There was negative correlation between the scores of tremor and the CP values of caudate nucleus. Some regions, which had high signals on T2-weighted image, had low signals on SWI. CONCLUSIONS: There might be abnormal iron metabolism in patients with WD. The decreased CP values might reflect a deposition of both copper and iron. SWI may be more sensitive than the ordinary MRI. The mineral deposition may contribute to the neural symptoms.",

                    "abstract": "The normal functioning of brain is intimately as well as intricately interrelated with normal functioning of the liver. Liver plays a critical role of not only providing vital nutrients to the brain but also of detoxifying the splanchnic blood. Compromised liver function leads to insufficient detoxification thus allowing neurotoxins (such as ammonia, manganese, and other chemicals) to enter the cerebral circulation. In addition, portosystemic shunts, which are common accompaniments of advanced liver disease, facilitate free passage of neurotoxins into the cerebral circulation. The problem is compounded further by additional variables such as gastrointestinal tract bleeding, malnutrition, and concurrent renal failure, which are often associated with liver cirrhosis. Neurologic damage in chronic liver disease and liver cirrhosis seems to be multifactorial primarily attributable to the following: brain accumulation of ammonia, manganese, and lactate; altered permeability of the blood-brain barrier; recruitment of monocytes after microglial activation; and neuroinflammation, that is, direct effects of circulating systemic proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor, IL-1beta, and IL-6. Radiologist should be aware of the conundrum of neurologic complications that can be encountered in liver disease, which include hepatic encephalopathy, hepatocerebral degeneration, hepatic myelopathy, cirrhosis-related parkinsonism, cerebral infections, hemorrhage, and osmotic demyelination. In addition, neurologic complications can be exclusive to certain disorders, for example, Wilson disease, alcoholism (Wernicke encephalopathy, alcoholic cerebellar degeneration, Marchiafava-Bignami disease, etc). Radiologist should be aware of their varied clinical presentation and radiological appearances as the diagnosis is not always straightforward. ",

Hereditary defects in copper metabolism result in disorders with a severe clinical course such as Wilson disease and Menkes disease. In Wilson disease, copper accumulation leads to liver cirrhosis and neurological impairments. A lack in genotype-phenotype correlation in Wilson disease points toward the influence of environmental factors or modifying genes. In a number of Non-Wilsonian forms of copper metabolism, the underlying genetic defects remain elusive. Several pure bred dog populations are affected with copper-associated hepatitis showing similarities to human copper metabolism disorders. Gene-mapping studies in these populations offer the opportunity to discover new genes involved in copper metabolism. Furthermore, due to the relatively large body size and long life-span of dogs they are excellent models for development of new treatment strategies. One example is the recent use of canine organoids for disease modeling and gene therapy of copper storage disease. This review addresses the opportunities offered by canine genetics for discovery of genes involved in copper metabolism disorders. Further, possibilities for the use of dogs in development of new treatment modalities for copper storage disorders, including gene repair in patient-derived hepatic organoids, are highlighted. ",

In fact, several pediatric liver diseases are precursors of adult chronic hepatopathies, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The prevalence of liver diseases in children is unknown. In the USA, every year, 15,000 children are hospitalized for liver diseases, but these disorders continue to be under-recognized or diagnosed late. The main reason is due to the frequent absence of symptoms in the vast majority of liver diseases, especially in the early stages. In the last few decades several advances have been made in understanding the pathogenesis of liver diseases, permitting the discovery of new therapeutic targets to treat liver diseases, thus improving the natural history of these disorders. In this article we discuss the most recent advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of the most frequent pediatric liver diseases. ",

The disease expression is highly variable, ranging from totally asymptomatic subjects to patients with severe liver disease or movement disorders. Thus, it is difficult to define in which patient Wilson disease has to be considered as diagnosis. The suspicion should be high in patients presenting with extrapyramidal disorders or with liver diseases or of unknown origin. For diagnosis, in many patients a combination of tests reflecting disturbed copper metabolism may be needed. Not a single test is per se specific and, thus, a range of tests has to be applied (presence or absence of Kayser-Fleischer rings or neurologic symptoms, serum ceruloplasmin, liver copper content, urinary copper excretion, mutation analysis; rated -1 to 4 depending on the test) and clinical symptoms. A diagnostic sum score of >= 4 confirms the diagnosis.",

RECENT FINDINGS: The list of known mutations causing Wilson disease continues to grow, but advances in genetic testing may soon make it feasible to routinely perform genetic testing on individuals suspected of having Wilson disease. SUMMARY: Wilson disease is a rare genetic disorder with protean manifestations that should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any individual presenting with unexplained neurologic, psychiatric, or hepatic dysfunction. Appropriate diagnostic testing should be expeditiously performed and treatment promptly initiated and maintained since failure to diagnose and treat Wilson disease will result in progressive and ultimately irreversible damage to the neurologic and other systems.",

Methods: Forty patients with WD, including 20 with cerebral type and 20 with hepatic type, and 20 age-matched healthy controls in the First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University between Jul 2013 and May 2016 were enrolled.All study subjects underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) of the brain.Six regions of interest (ROIs) were chosen.The values of fractional anisotropy (FA), lambda in ROIs were determined on DTI, FA and fiber volumes between ROIs were also determined on DTI.The values of amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and regional homogeneity (REHO) in ROIs were determined on rs-fMRI.The values of corrected phase (CP) were calculated on SWI.The copper and iron content were measured.The difference of imaging and metal metrics between cerebral type and hepatic type WD were evaluated. Results: DTI metrics differed between patients with the cerebral and hepatic types of WD.ALFF values in the caudate nucleus, and thalamus were lower (P=0.037, 0.040), and REHO values in the caudate nucleus were lower (P=0.029), in patients of cerebral type than in hepatic type patients.CP values of the right caudate nucleus and left putamen in cerebral type WD patients were lower than in hepatic type patients (P=0.020, 0.23). The serum iron content of hepatic type WD patients was higher than the normal (P=0.013), and the urine copper content was higher than the cerebral type patients (P=0.021). Conclusions: Metal deposition and damage to the structure and functional activity in the brain may occur in hepatic type WD patients.The structural and functional activity damage of the brain in hepatic type is less severe than that in cerebral type patients, while the metal deposition is not significant different between hepatic and cerebral type.",

                    "abstract": "AIM: To evaluate transient elastography (TE) as a noninvasive tool in staging liver fibrosis compared with liver biopsy and morphometry in children with different chronic liver diseases. METHODS: A total of 90 children [50 with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV), 20 with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and 20 with Wilson disease] were included in the study and underwent liver stiffness measurement (LSM) using TE. Liver biopsies were evaluated for fibrosis, qualitatively, by Ishak score and quantitatively by fibrosis area fraction (FAF) using digital image analysis (morphometry). LSM was correlated with fibrosis and other studied variables using spearman correlation. A stepwise multiple regression analysis was also performed to examine independent factors associated with LSM. Different cut-off values of LSM were calculated for predicting individual fibrosis stages using receiver-operating characteristic curve. Cut-off values with optimal clinical performance (optimal sensitivity and specificity simultaneously) were selected. RESULTS: The majority of HCV group had minimal activity (80%) and no/mild fibrosis (72%). On the other hand, the majority of AIH group had mild to moderate activity (70%) and moderate to severe fibrosis (95%) and all Wilson disease group had mild to moderate activity (100%) and moderate to severe fibrosis (100%). LSM correlated significantly with both FAF and Ishak scores and the correlation appeared better with the latter (r = 0.839 vs 0.879, P < 0.0001 for both). LSM discriminated individual stages of fibrosis with high performance. Sensitivity ranged from 81.4% to 100% and specificity ranged from 75.0% to 97.2%. When we compared LSM values for the same stage of fibrosis, they varied according to the different etiologies. Higher values were in AIH (16.15 +- 7.23 kPa) compared to Wilson disease (8.30 +- 0.84 kPa) and HCV groups (7.43 +- 1.73 kPa). Multiple regression analysis revealed that Ishak fibrosis stage was the only independent variable associated with higher LSM (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: TE appears reliable in distinguishing different stages of liver fibrosis in children. However, its values vary according to the disease type. For that, a disease-specific estimation of cut-off values for fibrosis staging is worthy.",

A multiplex PCR-based NGS assay to identify mutations in the ATP7B gene for routine molecular diagnosis of Wilson disease was evaluated in comparison with the gold standard direct Sanger sequencing. DESIGN AND METHODS: Five multiplex PCRs to amplify the partial promoter, 5' untranslated and the entire coding regions of the ATP7B gene were designed. Indexed paired-end libraries were generated from the pooled amplicons using Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation Kit and subjected to NGS on the MiSeq platform. DNA from the peripheral blood of 12 patients with Wilson disease, 2 B-lymphocyte cell lines and 3 external quality assurance samples were sequenced by the MiSeq and Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: Complete coverage was achieved across the targeted bases without any drop-out sequences. The observed read depth in a single run with 20 samples was >100X. Comparison of the NGS results against Sanger sequencing data on a panel of clinical specimens, cell lines and European Molecular Genetics Quality Networks (EMQN) quality assurance samples showed 100% concordance in identifying pathogenic mutations. CONCLUSION: With the capability of generating relatively higher throughput in a short time period, the NGS assay is a viable alternative to Sanger sequencing for detecting ATP7B mutations causally linked to Wilson disease in the clinical diagnostic laboratory.",

We report radiological changes in four patients with WDN who worsen after penicillamine. METHODS: WDN was diagnosed on the basis of clinical, KF ring, serum ceruloplasmin and 24h urinary copper. Hematological, biochemical and cranial MRI were repeated at the time of clinical deterioration following chelating treatment. RESULTS: Four WDN patients had neurological deterioration within 4-8 weeks of penicillamine therapy. This was associated with new lesions in white matter, thalamus, pons and mid brain and these lesions showed diffusion restriction. The neurologic deterioration was associated with increased free serum copper and malanodialdehyde and reduced glutathione. Clinical conditions stabilized after few weeks of penicillamine discontinuation. CONCLUSION: Neurological worsening was associated with new lesions on MRI which revealed diffusion restriction. Increased free copper induced oxidative stress may be responsible for these changes.",

This study aimed to characterize the toxic milk mouse from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) (tx-j) mouse model of WD according to changes over time in hepatic copper concentrations, methionine metabolism, global DNA methylation, and gene expression from gestational day 17 (fetal) to adulthood (28 weeks). METHODS: Included liver histology and relevant biochemical analyses including hepatic copper quantification, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) liver levels, qPCR for transcript levels of genes relevant to methionine metabolism and liver damage, and DNA dot blot for global DNA methylation. RESULTS: Hepatic copper was lower in tx-j fetuses but higher in weanling (three weeks) and adult tx-j mice compared to controls. S-adenosylhomocysteinase transcript levels were significantly lower at all time points, except at three weeks, correlating negatively with copper levels and with consequent changes in the SAM:SAH methylation ratio and global DNA methylation. CONCLUSION: Compared to controls, methionine metabolism including S-adenosylhomocysteinase gene expression is persistently different in the tx-j mice with consequent alterations in global DNA methylation in more advanced stages of liver disease. The inhibitory effect of copper accumulation on S-adenosylhomocysteinase expression is associated with progressively abnormal methionine metabolism and decreased methylation capacity and DNA global methylation.",

ATP7B, encoding a copper transporter P-ATPase was identified as the causative gene of WD. Mutations in the ATP7B gene lead to the defection of the transmembrane transporter so that it can not metabolize copper effectively. We reported the clinical and molecular features of three unrelated and non-consanguineous WD patients. We performed molecular genetic analysis of the ATP7B gene in all cases by DNA sequencing, and revealed 7 novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 8 well known mutations. Among them, that novel SNP (c. -520 C>T) and two well known mutations (c. 2310 C>G/p. Leu700Leu, c. 2333 G>T/A/p. Arg778Leu/Gln) coexisted in all patients and they were heterozygous and homozygous in the youngest case, respectively, indicating that they may be correlated to the pathogenesis and potentially used as a genetic biomarker for early WD diagnosis.

                    "abstract": "AIMS: In Wilson disease (WD), T2/T2*-weighted (T2*w) MRI frequently shows hypointensity in the basal ganglia that is suggestive of paramagnetic deposits. It is currently unknown whether this hypointensity is related to copper or iron deposition. We examined the neuropathological correlates of this MRI pattern, particularly in relation to iron and copper concentrations. METHODS: Brain slices from nine WD and six control cases were investigated using a 7T-MRI system. High-resolution T2*w images were acquired and R2* parametric maps were reconstructed using a multigradient recalled echo sequence. R2* was measured in the globus pallidus (GP) and the putamen. Corresponding histopathological sections containing the lentiform nucleus were examined using Turnbull iron staining, and double staining combining Turnbull with immunohistochemistry for macrophages or astrocytes. Quantitative densitometry of the iron staining as well as copper and iron concentrations were measured in the GP and putamen and correlated with R2* values. RESULTS: T2*w hypointensity in the GP and/or putamen was apparent in WD cases and R2* values correlated with quantitative densitometry of iron staining. In WD, iron and copper concentrations were increased in the putamen compared to controls. R2* was correlated with the iron concentration in the GP and putamen, whereas no correlation was observed for the copper concentration. Patients with more pronounced pathological severity in the putamen displayed increased iron concentration, which correlated with an elevated number of iron-containing macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: T2/T2*w hypointensity observed in vivo in the basal ganglia of WD patients is related to iron rather than copper deposits.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) increases the risk of complications and mortality after liver transplantation. The incidence for HAT is increased in patients with risk factors (vascular reconstructions, coagulation disorders and acute rejection episodes amongst others). Early retransplantation improves the prognosis for patients, but owing to lack of donors, surgical and interventional radiologic attempts to restore the patency of hepatic artery are made. The prognosis for the liver and the patient can also be improved by the development of collateral circulation. CASE REPORT: We describe a case of a 30-year-old woman with hepatic failure owing to Wilson disease. Liver transplantation with the use of vascular conduit made of donor's iliac arteries was complicated by an early HAT. Heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation was confirmed in the patient. Despite surgical and radiologic attempts to restore patency and despite treatment with fractioned heparin and aspirin, the hepatic artery remained occluded. Retransplantation was not considered, even though the patient was planning a pregnancy. After 1 year of observation of stable liver function, conversion from mycophenolate mofetil to azathioprine treatment, the patient was given consent for a high-risk pregnancy. DISCUSSION: The course of pregnancy was uneventful, with normal liver function parameters, without pathological bleedings. The patient was treated with doses of enoxaparin adjusted for the patient's weight. In the 34th week, owing to increasing concentration of bile acids, the pregnancy ended with a cesarean section. The newborn had 10-point APGAR score.",

METHODS: With the help of the developed scoring systems were used to assess the degree of liver dysfunction and the degree of disruption of the structure of the liver and the severity of portal hypertension. RESULTS: The results of the diagnostic methods 252 children aged 1 to 17 years (mean age of 11.8+-3,5) with Wilson disease (WD), autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), chronic hepatitis C (CHC) were analyzed; 48 patients underwent liver transplantation. In children with WD, AIHand CHC liverfunction reduced by 41.3+-12.9% to 28.8+-12.5% and 19.1+-7.8% respectively. Structure of the liver in children with WD, AIH and CHC was disturbed by 25.0+-8.1% to 20.4+-9.2% and 6.8+-4.4% respectively. Thefunction and structure violations of the liver more pronounced in liver cirrhosis. The use of the developed scoring systems to monitor the severity of liver damage in the dynamics and evaluation of the effectiveness of the therapy is demonstrated. The degree of liver dysfunction is directly dependent on the degree of its structure. Abnormal liverfunction >=40% and >=40% of its structure with treatment failure can be used as a criterion of indicationsfor elective liver transplantation with its chronic diseases in children. CONCLUSION: Developed a point system to determine liver function and a point system to determine disruption of the structure of the liver and the severity of portal hypertension in children can serve as an objective criterion for assessing the severity of liver disease, monitoring their changes in the dynamics with the assessment of the effectiveness of the therapy and making decisions about the need for routine liver transplantation in its chronic illnesses in children.",

Fifty-four patients with WDN and 36 healthy matched controls were included. Their severity, Burke-Fahn-Marsden (BFM) scores, blood counts, hemoglobin, serum chemistry, ceruloplasmin, and free copper and 24-h urinary copper were measured. Cranial MRI findings were noted. Serum active caspase-3, XIAP, TNF-alpha, IL-8, and plasma glutathione and MDA were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), flow cytometry, and spectrophotometer respectively.

XIAP levels were correlated with neurological severity (r = -0.40), BFM (r = -0.51), serum Cu (r = -0.42), and ceruloplasmin (r = 0.34). The XIAP level positively correlated with survival (GSH) and inversely with death signals (TNF-alpha, IL-8, MDA and free serum Cu) whereas active caspase-3 positively correlated with death (TNF-alpha, IL-8, serum Cu, MDA) and inversely with survival signal (GSH).

We report the role of plasma glutathione (GSH), total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the worsening of NWD following treatment. Fifty-one treatment-naive NWD patients were subjected to detailed clinical evaluation. The severity of NWD was noted, and dystonia was measured by Burke-Fahn-Marsden (BFM) score. Their hematological, serum chemistry, ultrasound abdomen and cranial MRI changes were noted. Plasma GSH, TAC and MDA, serum free copper (Cu) and 24-h urinary Cu were measured at admission and at 3 and 6 months after treatment. The patients were considered worsened if there was one or more grade deterioration in severity scale, >10 % deterioration in BFM score or appearance of new neurologic signs. The median age of the patients was 11 (5-37) years, and 12 were females. Following treatment, 25 patients improved, 12 worsened, and 14 had stationary course. The worsened group at 3 months had lower GSH (1.99 +- 0.17 vs. 2.30 +- 0.30 mg/dl; P = 0.004) and TAC (1.59 +- 0.12 vs. 1.82 +- 0.17 mmol Trolox equivalent/L; P = 0.001) and higher MDA (5.24 +- 0.22 vs. 4.34 +- 0.46 nmol/ml; P < 0.001) levels compared to the improved group.

All the patients having worsening were on penicillamine. Worsening following chelating treatment in NWD may be due to oxidative stress which is induced by increased serum free Cu.

The success of tandem mass spectrometry is due to important advances in hardware, software and clinical applications during the last 25 years. MS/MS permits a very rapid measurement of many metabolites in different biological specimens by using filter paper spots or directly on biological fluids. Its use in NBS give us the chance to identify possible treatable metabolic disorders even when asymptomatic and the benefits gained by this type of screening is now recognized worldwide. Today the use of MS/MS for second-tier tests and confirmatory testing is promising especially in the early detection of new disorders such as some lysosomal storage disorders, ADA and PNP SCIDs, X-adrenoleucodistrophy (X-ALD), Wilson disease, guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency (GAMT), and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The new challenge for the future will be reducing the false positive rate by using second-tier tests, avoiding false negative results by using new specific biomarkers and introducing new treatable disorders in NBS programs.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease were included in our study. Inclusion criteria were: presence of liver steatosis on ultrasound in patients with waist circumference over 94 cm in men and over 80 cm in women and with serologic elements of metabolic syndrome. Exclusion criteria were: chronic viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson disease, hemochromatosis, regular alcohol consumption. Body mass index, waist circumference, fasting plasma glucose, serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels and serum ALT were determined. On liver biopsy specimens, performed in each patient, the NASH score, representing the sum of fibrosis, steatosis, lobular inflammation and ballooning, was calculated. RESULTS: Necroinflammation was mild in 15 patients, medium in 19 patients and severe in five patients. Mild fibrosis was present in four cases, medium in 14 cases, severe in six, and two patients were diagnosed with cirrhosis. We found statistically significant correlation between waist circumference and the grade of histological activity, the presence of diabetes and both fibrosis grade and histological activity, and the serum ALT and histological activity. CONCLUSIONS: Noninvasive assessment of the severity of hepatic histological changes in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease could be made by anthropometric parameters or by serologic components of metabolic syndrome, but it is not an accurate method to identify patients with high-risk for disease progression. These noninvasive parameters cannot replace liver biopsy.",

Fifty-four patients with WDN and 36 healthy matched controls were included. Their severity, Burke-Fahn-Marsden (BFM) scores, blood counts, hemoglobin, serum chemistry, ceruloplasmin, and free copper and 24-h urinary copper were measured. Cranial MRI findings were noted. Serum active caspase-3, XIAP, TNF-alpha, IL-8, and plasma glutathione and MDA were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), flow cytometry, and spectrophotometer respectively.

In the patients with WDN, active caspase-3 (0.55 +- 0.11 vs 0.38 +- 0.06 ng/ml), TNF-alpha (76.05 +- 29.01 vs 36.05 +- 21.01 pg/ml), IL-8 (590.19 +- 89.19 vs 193.43 +- 71.01 pg/ml), and MDA (4.92 +- 0.39 vs 3.43 +- 0.21 nmol/ml) levels were increased whereas XIAP (84.66 +- 10.39 vs 95.76 +- 10.11 ng/ml) and glutathione (GSH) (2.03 +- 0.29 vs 2.98 +- 0.27 mg/dl) levels were decreased compared to controls. Active caspase-3 was correlated with neurological severity (r = 0.48), BFM score (r = 0.37), ceruloplasmin (r = -0.39), hemoglobin (r = -0.34), and serum Cu (r = 0.39). XIAP levels were correlated with neurological severity (r = -0.40), BFM (r = -0.51), serum Cu (r = -0.42), and ceruloplasmin (r = 0.34). The XIAP level positively correlated with survival (GSH) and inversely with death signals (TNF-alpha, IL-8, MDA and free serum Cu) whereas active caspase-3 positively correlated with death (TNF-alpha, IL-8, serum Cu, MDA) and inversely with survival signal (GSH). Serum active caspase-3 level increased in WDN and positively correlated with the severity of disease, death signals (TNF, IL-8, MDA, and free Cu) and inversely with GSH and XIAP.",

We hereby present a series of four cases of sclerosing cholangitis masquerading as Wilson disease. True Wilson disease cases had significantly lower ceruloplasmin (6 vs. 16 mg/dL) and higher 24-hour urinary copper (322.3 vs. 74.5 mug/day) as compared to mimickers. Initial low serum ceruloplasmin levels normalized in mimickers on follow up, and this may used as a diagnostic indicator. Standard Wilson disease diagnostic criteria thus need further modification especially in developing countries to help avoid mismanagement.",

In the absence of some of the typical features, diagnosis of WD is difficult and is based on the combination of clinical, biochemical and genetic testing. The aim of this study was to illustrate the complexity of the approach to WD in daily clinical practice. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of patients with WD, including the clinical presentation, histological and biochemical findings, and follow up after treatment. We also carried out genetic testing, and the Leipzig diagnostic score was applied. RESULTS: We included 15 patients. Four were symptomatic, with liver (n=1), neurological (n=1), psychiatric (n=1) and mixed clinical manifestations (n=1), and 11 were presymptomatic, with elevated transaminases (n=8) and family study (n=3). We observed Kayser-Fleischer ring in 2 patients, both without neurologic symptoms. Ceruloplasmin <= 5 mg/dL was present in 73%, and 24-hour urinary Cu> 100 mug in 40%. Liver Cu was >250 mug/g.d.t. in 85% of the patients. The final diagnosis of WD was given by genetic testing (ATP7B gene mutations) in 5 patients with minimal disease features, including one symptomatic patient (psychiatric symptoms). We identified 5 previously reported mutations (p.M645R, p.R827W, p.H1069Q, p.P768L and p.G869R) and 3 unpublished mutations (p.L1313R, p.I1311T and p.A1179D); the most frequent mutation was p.M645R. After treatment, biochemical parameters (transaminases, urinary cooper) and symptoms improved, except in patients with neurological and psychiatric manifestations. CONCLUSIONS: Our series illustrates the important role of genetic testing in the diagnosis of WD. The identification of the p.M645R mutation in most of our patients should be kept in mind in the molecular analysis of the ATP7B gene in our region.",

METHODS: We analyzed the admission characteristics in 61 children <18 years with WD and ALF. Factors associated with mortality on univariate Cox regression analysis were analyzed by forward stepwise Cox hazards regression. The prognostic models such as Nazer's model, revised Kings College Model, and pediatric end-stage liver disease/model for end-stage liver disease (PELD/MELD) score were compared. RESULTS: Of the 145 children < 18 years with WD, 61 experienced ALF of whom 33 (54%) died, including 22/27 (81.5%) with encephalopathy and 11/34 (32.4%) without encephalopathy.

Prognostic factors significant for mortality included encephalopathy, international normalized ratio, total proteins, total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, serum creatinine, and white blood cell count. Forward stepwise Cox proportional hazards regression identified encephalopathy (hazard ratio 2.88; CI 1.1-7.4) and total bilirubin (hazard ratio 1.05; CI: 1.02-1.09) as predictors of outcome.

Liver-directed gene therapy has recently become an option for treatment of haemophilias and is likely to become one of the favoured therapeutic strategies for inherited metabolic liver diseases in the near future. In this review, we present the different gene therapy vectors and strategies for liver-targeting, including gene editing. We highlight the current development of viral and nonviral gene therapy for a number of inherited metabolic liver diseases including urea cycle defects, organic acidaemias, Crigler-Najjar disease, Wilson disease, glycogen storage disease Type Ia, phenylketonuria and maple syrup urine disease. We describe the main limitations and open questions for further gene therapy development: immunogenicity, inflammatory response, genotoxicity, gene therapy administration in a fibrotic liver. The follow-up of a constantly growing number of gene therapy treated patients allows better understanding of its benefits and limitations and provides strategies to design safer and more efficacious treatments. Undoubtedly, liver-targeting gene therapy offers a promising avenue for innovative therapies with an unprecedented potential to address the unmet needs of patients suffering from inherited metabolic diseases.",

Hereditary defects in copper metabolism result in disorders with a severe clinical course such as Wilson disease and Menkes disease. In Wilson disease, copper accumulation leads to liver cirrhosis and neurological impairments. A lack in genotype-phenotype correlation in Wilson disease points toward the influence of environmental factors or modifying genes. In a number of Non-Wilsonian forms of copper metabolism, the underlying genetic defects remain elusive. Several pure bred dog populations are affected with copper-associated hepatitis showing similarities to human copper metabolism disorders. Gene-mapping studies in these populations offer the opportunity to discover new genes involved in copper metabolism. Furthermore, due to the relatively large body size and long life-span of dogs they are excellent models for development of new treatment strategies. One example is the recent use of canine organoids for disease modeling and gene therapy of copper storage disease. This review addresses the opportunities offered by canine genetics for discovery of genes involved in copper metabolism disorders. Further, possibilities for the use of dogs in development of new treatment modalities for copper storage disorders, including gene repair in patient-derived hepatic organoids, are highlighted. ",

Genetic analysis of ATP7B gene detected two heterozygous disease causing mutations (c.2621C>T/p.A874V and c.3809A>G/p.N1270S), and parental origins were determined. Persistent elevation of serum aminotransferase in this infant was normalized after zinc therapy.

AIMS: Describe a common founder pathogenic variant among Bukharan Jews and to assess its prevalence, clinical features, and outcome. METHODS: The cohort consisted of patients of Bukharan Jewish descent diagnosed with Wilson disease at a tertiary pediatric medical center in 2013-2018. Clinical and genetic data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Six patients from 4 unrelated families who were homozygous for the c.3784G>T p.(Val1262Phe) pathogenic variant in ATP7B were identified. Five presented with elevated aminotransferase levels, and one, with acute liver failure. Mean age at diagnosis was 8.7 years (5-12.5). Serum ceruloplasmin level was extremely low in all patients (1.9-7 mg/dL; mean 3.2(. The variant was identified in a heterozygous state in 5/153 Bukharan Jews; 2/33 from our local exome database and 3/120 healthy unrelated Bukharan Jews in another cohort, for an estimated carrier frequency of ~1:30. CONCLUSIONS: We report a common founder pathogenic variant in the ATP7B gene among Bukharan Jews associated with severe early-onset Wilson disease. Given the clinical severity, high frequency of the variant, and being a treatable disease, its inclusion in pre-symptomatic screening in the Bukharan Jewish community should be considered. Furthermore, WD should be part of future genetic newborn screening programs in Israel and worldwide, to enable early treatment and prevention of future life-threatening complications.",

Establishing the diagnosis is straightforward if the major clinical and laboratory features are present. However, clinical phenotypes are highly varied and early, proper diagnosis can be challenging. AIM: The aim of our study was to analyze clinical presentations and diagnostic tests of Polish pediatric patients with WD. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed medical history of 156 patients with confirmed diagnosis of WD treated at our Institute from 1996 till March 2016. RESULTS: The mean age at onset of symptoms was 10.15+-4.23 years of age. Hepatic presentation was the most common one (94.23%) with either liver failure (16.03%) or more frequently increased transaminases (78.2%). In 90.26% cases ceruloplasmin serum concentration was <=0,2 g/l, in 51.93% patients basal urinary copper excretion was >100 mug/24 h. Mutation analysis was performed in 155 (99.36%) cases. The most common mutation was p.H1069Q. CONCLUSIONS: Wilson disease can present with only significantly increased transaminases activity and hepatomegaly or liver failure, but neurological symptoms are very rare in children. Diagnostic approach is challenging due to wide spectrum of clinical presentations in a high variable degree of severity. Genetic screening is supportive, ceruloplasmin and urinary copper excretion are valuable tests in the majority of patients but do not allow to exclude WD.",

MATERIAL/METHODS: A prospective analysis of 45 obese children initially diagnosed with liver pathology (elevated serum ALT activity and/or ultrasonographic liver brightness and/or hepatomegaly) was conducted. The diagnosis of NAFLD was established in the children with elevated serum ALT activity and liver steatosis on ultrasound examination. Viral hepatitis, autoimmune, metabolic liver diseases (Wilson disease, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, cystic fibrosis) and drug and toxin-induced liver injury were excluded in all children. The degree of liver steatosis was graded according to Saverymuttu scale and the total liver lipids concentration was assessed using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS). RESULTS: Serum fetuin A concentration was significantly higher in examined children compared to the control group (n=30) (p=0.00002). Higher serum fetuin A concentration was also observed in children with NAFLD (n=19) in comparison to the controls (p=0.000026). Additionally, higher BMI values, waist circumferences, ALT and GGT activity, intensity of liver steatosis on ultrasound and total concentration of lipids in the liver in (1)H MRS were found in children with NAFLD compared to the rest of the examined obese patients (n=26). There was not found any correlation of the investigated glycoprotein with any other assessed parameters both in children with NAFLD and obese children without NAFLD. CONCLUSION: Higher serum fetuin A concentration found in children with NAFLD compared to the control group support the hypothesis that atherosclerotic processes may develop faster in hepatopatic obese patients.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The severity of Wilson's disease (WD) is linked to free copper accumulating in the liver and brain. Exchangeable copper (CuEXC) is a new technique to determine plasmatic copper and is useful in the diagnosis of WD. It is hypothesized that it may also enable a good evaluation of extra-hepatic involvement and its severity. METHODS: Forty-eight newly diagnosed WD patients were prospectively evaluated using hepatic, neurological, ophthalmological and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scores. Three phenotypic presentations were distinguished: pre-symptomatic, hepatic and extra-hepatic. CuEXC was determined in addition to standard copper assays before decoppering therapy. Correlations between biological parameters and the different scores were determined and compared in the hepatic and extra-hepatic groups. RESULTS: Extra-hepatic patients had significantly higher CuEXC values than those with the hepatic form (P < 0.0001). The overall ability of CuEXC to separate the two forms was satisfactory, with an area under the curve of 0.883 (95% confidence interval 0.771-0.996) and an optimal threshold for extra-hepatic diagnosis of 2.08 mumol/l (sensitivity 85.7%; specificity 94.1%). In extra-hepatic patients, CuEXC was the only biological marker to be positively correlated with the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Score (r = 0.45, P = 0.016), the Kayser-Fleischer ring score (r = 0.46, P = 0.014) and the brain MRI score (r = 0.38, P = 0.048), but it was not correlated with the hepatic score. CONCLUSIONS: Exchangeable copper determination is useful when diagnosing WD as a value >2.08 mumol/l is indicative of the severity of the extra-hepatic involvement. In the case of purely hepatic presentation, atypical or mild neurological signs, it should encourage physicians to search for lesions in the brain and eyes.",

This study aimed to characterize the toxic milk mouse from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) (tx-j) mouse model of WD according to changes over time in hepatic copper concentrations, methionine metabolism, global DNA methylation, and gene expression from gestational day 17 (fetal) to adulthood (28 weeks). METHODS: Included liver histology and relevant biochemical analyses including hepatic copper quantification, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) liver levels, qPCR for transcript levels of genes relevant to methionine metabolism and liver damage, and DNA dot blot for global DNA methylation. RESULTS: Hepatic copper was lower in tx-j fetuses but higher in weanling (three weeks) and adult tx-j mice compared to controls. S-adenosylhomocysteinase transcript levels were significantly lower at all time points, except at three weeks, correlating negatively with copper levels and with consequent changes in the SAM:SAH methylation ratio and global DNA methylation. CONCLUSION: Compared to controls, methionine metabolism including S-adenosylhomocysteinase gene expression is persistently different in the tx-j mice with consequent alterations in global DNA methylation in more advanced stages of liver disease. The inhibitory effect of copper accumulation on S-adenosylhomocysteinase expression is associated with progressively abnormal methionine metabolism and decreased methylation capacity and DNA global methylation.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Wilson disease (WD) is an inherited disorder that causes copper (Cu) accumulation, leading to mainly liver, neurological and/or psychiatric manifestations. In the absence of some of the typical features, diagnosis of WD is difficult and is based on the combination of clinical, biochemical and genetic testing. The aim of this study was to illustrate the complexity of the approach to WD in daily clinical practice. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of patients with WD, including the clinical presentation, histological and biochemical findings, and follow up after treatment. We also carried out genetic testing, and the Leipzig diagnostic score was applied. RESULTS: We included 15 patients. Four were symptomatic, with liver (n=1), neurological (n=1), psychiatric (n=1) and mixed clinical manifestations (n=1), and 11 were presymptomatic, with elevated transaminases (n=8) and family study (n=3). We observed Kayser-Fleischer ring in 2 patients, both without neurologic symptoms. Ceruloplasmin <= 5 mg/dL was present in 73%, and 24-hour urinary Cu> 100 mug in 40%. Liver Cu was >250 mug/g.d.t. in 85% of the patients. The final diagnosis of WD was given by genetic testing (ATP7B gene mutations) in 5 patients with minimal disease features, including one symptomatic patient (psychiatric symptoms). We identified 5 previously reported mutations (p.M645R, p.R827W, p.H1069Q, p.P768L and p.G869R) and 3 unpublished mutations (p.L1313R, p.I1311T and p.A1179D); the most frequent mutation was p.M645R. After treatment, biochemical parameters (transaminases, urinary cooper) and symptoms improved, except in patients with neurological and psychiatric manifestations. CONCLUSIONS: Our series illustrates the important role of genetic testing in the diagnosis of WD. The identification of the p.M645R mutation in most of our patients should be kept in mind in the molecular analysis of the ATP7B gene in our region.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: In Wilson Disease (WD), copper accumulates in the liver and brain causing disease. Bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) is a potent copper chelator that may be associated with a lower risk of inducing paradoxical neurological worsening than conventional therapy for neurologic WD. To better understand the mode of action of TTM, we investigated its effects on copper absorption and biliary excretion. METHODS: In a double-blind randomized setting, hepatic 64Cu activity was examined after orally administered 64Cu by PET/CT in 16 healthy volunteers before and after seven days of TTM treatment (15 mg/d) or placebo. Oral 64Cu was administered one hour after the final TTM dose. Changes in hepatic 64Cu activity reflected changes in intestinal 64Cu uptake. Additionally, in four patients with WD, the distribution of 64Cu in venous blood, liver, gallbladder, kidney, and brain was followed after i.v. 64Cu dosing for up to 68 hours before and after seven days of TTM (15 mg/day), using PET/MRI. Increased gallbladder 64Cu activity was taken as evidence of increased biliary 64Cu excretion. RESULTS: In healthy volunteers, TTM reduced intestinal 64Cu uptake by 82% 15 hours after the oral 64Cu dose. In patients with WD, gallbladder 64Cu activity was negligible before and after TTM, while TTM effectively retained 64Cu in the blood, significantly reduced hepatic 64Cu activity at all time-points and significantly reduced cerebral 64Cu activity two hours after the intravenous 64Cu dose. CONCLUSIONS: While we did not show an increase in biliary excretion of 64Cu following TTM administration, we demonstrated that TTM effectively inhibited most intestinal 64Cu uptake and retained 64Cu in the blood stream, limiting the exposure of 64Cu to organs like the liver and the brain. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: Bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) is an investigational copper chelator being developed for the treatment of Wilson disease. In animal models of Wilson disease, TTM has been shown to facilitate biliary copper excretion. In the present human study, TTM surprisingly did not facilitate biliary copper excretion but instead reduced intestinal copper uptake to a clinically significant degree. Our study builds on our understanding of human copper metabolism and the mechanism of action of TTM.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Variation in care is more common in settings in which evidence-based approaches are limited. The aims of the present study were to describe consensus and variability in approaches taken by pediatric hepatologists in the management of Wilson disease (WD) in children. METHOD: International case-centered, Internet-based survey of pediatric hepatologists. Survey cases were developed by consensus of the authors and were intended to identify variation in the care of children with WD. RESULTS: One hundred eleven of 253 clinicians responded (44%). Of these, 84% of North American and 41% of European participants used guidelines published in their respective region. Although consensus existed on the first-line diagnostic tools (serum ceruloplasmin and baseline 24-hour urinary copper excretion), survey participants did not agree on how much liver copper content was required for diagnosis: 57% considered >250 mug/g dry weight to be consistent with WD, whereas 25% considered >50 mug/g to be diagnostic. Overall, 50% of practitioners perform genetic testing in all suspected cases, and 81% perform genetic testing once they know the genotype of an index patient. For initial treatment of fulminant WD, 51% of participants chose chelation and 15% chose immediate transplantation; 47% chose listing for transplantation followed by monitoring using a disease-severity score, and then carrying out transplantation only when the score reached a critical cut-off. To treat mildly affected siblings of index patients, 43% of practitioners chose zinc. Most reported that they use chelation to treat patients with hepatic dysfunction; however, 29% of North American participants chose not to use D-penicillamine as primary therapy. CONCLUSIONS: From an international perspective, pediatric hepatologists vary in the approaches they use in the care for children with WD. Regional preferences and accessibility to treatments may generate variation. Unwarranted variation, however, may also contribute to differences in outcome and should be targeted to improve quality of care.",

Identification of novel hepatocyte-specific biomarkers could provide important prognostic information and better pathogenesis classification. We tested the hypothesis that hepatocyte-selective biomarkers are released after subjecting isolated mouse hepatocytes to Fas-ligand-mediated apoptosis. Proteomic analysis of hepatocyte culture medium identified the mitochondrial matrix protein carbamoyl phosphate synthetase-1 (CPS1) among the most readily detected proteins that are released by apoptotic hepatocytes. CPS1 was also detected in mouse serum upon acute challenge with Fas-ligand or acetaminophen and in hepatocytes upon hypoosmotic stress, independent of hepatocyte caspase activation. Furthermore, CPS1 was observed in sera of mice chronically fed the hepatotoxin 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine. Mouse CPS1 detectability was similar in serum and plasma, and its half-life was 126 +- 9 min. Immune staining showed that CPS1 localized to mouse hepatocytes but not ductal cells. Analysis of a few serum samples from patients with acute liver failure (ALF) due to acetaminophen, Wilson disease, or ischemia showed readily detectable CPS1 that was not observed in several patients with chronic viral hepatitis or in control donors. Notably, CPS1 rapidly decreased to undetectable levels in sera of patients with acetaminophen-related ALF who ultimately recovered, while alanine aminotransferase levels remained elevated. Therefore, CPS1 becomes readily detectable upon hepatocyte apoptotic and necrotic death in culture or in vivo. Its abundance and short serum half-life, compared with alanine aminotransferase, suggest that it may be a useful prognostic biomarker in human and mouse liver injury. ",

As excess copper (Cu) is known to induce oxidative stress and apoptosis, and is characteristic for the human pathology Wilson disease, we investigated the effect of OSIP108 on Cu-induced toxicity in yeast. We found that OSIP108 increased yeast viability in the presence of toxic Cu concentrations, and decreased the prevalence of Cu-induced apoptotic markers. Next, we translated these results to the human hepatoma HepG2 cell line, demonstrating anti-apoptotic activity of OSIP108 in this cell line. In addition, we found that OSIP108 did not affect intracellular Cu levels in HepG2 cells, but preserved HepG2 mitochondrial ultrastructure. As Cu is known to induce acid sphingomyelinase activity of HepG2 cells, we performed a sphingolipidomic analysis of OSIP108-treated HepG2 cells. We demonstrated that OSIP108 decreased the levels of several sphingoid bases and ceramide species. Moreover, exogenous addition of the sphingoid base dihydrosphingosine abolished the protective effect of OSIP108 against Cu-induced cell death in yeast. These findings indicate the potential of OSIP108 to prevent Cu-induced apoptosis, possibly via its effects on sphingolipid homeostasis. ",

Phenotypic diversity of the disease can lead to delayed diagnosis. We describe a case of WD in a 10-year-old boy presenting with 3 months of increasingly intense, spasmodic lower extremity muscle cramps. Physical examination revealed tenderness on calf palpation and dark flat lesions over his ankles, knees, and elbows. Initial testing revealed creatine kinase of 302 IU/L (normal 24-248 IU/L), hemoglobin of 8.9 g/dL (11.5-15.5 g/dL), aspartate aminotransferase of 114 IU/L (16-52 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase of 54 IU/L (2-30 IU/L), and myoglobinuria.

Additional laboratory tests revealed a prothrombin time of 21.3 seconds (11.8-15.5 seconds), total bilirubin of 1.4 mg/dL (<1 mg/dL), direct bilirubin of 0.5 mg/dL (<0.3 mg/dL), albumin of 2.1 g/dL (3.1-4.6 g/dL), a reticulocyte percentage of 4.5% (0.5%-2.5%), a negative Coombs direct antibody test, ceruloplasmin of 3 mg/dL (21-51 mg/dL), and 24-h urine copper of 393 mug/24 h (15-60 mug/24 h). Liver biopsy showed patchy advanced fibrosis, mild inflammation, positive staining for copper, and a tissue copper concentration of 768 microg/g (10-35 mug/g). Brain MRI revealed symmetric intrinsic T1 shortening within bilateral basal ganglia. Trientene therapy was initiated for WD.

Musculoskeletal involvement in WD is uncommon and typically defined as bone demineralization, arthropathy, or hypokalemic muscle weakness.

Phenotypic diversity of the disease can lead to delayed diagnosis. We describe a case of WD in a 10-year-old boy presenting with 3 months of increasingly intense, spasmodic lower extremity muscle cramps. Physical examination revealed tenderness on calf palpation and dark flat lesions over his ankles, knees, and elbows. Initial testing revealed creatine kinase of 302 IU/L (normal 24-248 IU/L), hemoglobin of 8.9 g/dL (11.5-15.5 g/dL), aspartate aminotransferase of 114 IU/L (16-52 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase of 54 IU/L (2-30 IU/L), and myoglobinuria. Extensive evaluation of his myopathy, including MRI and muscle biopsy, was negative. Additional laboratory tests revealed a prothrombin time of 21.3 seconds (11.8-15.5 seconds), total bilirubin of 1.4 mg/dL (<1 mg/dL), direct bilirubin of 0.5 mg/dL (<0.3 mg/dL), albumin of 2.1 g/dL (3.1-4.6 g/dL), a reticulocyte percentage of 4.5% (0.5%-2.5%), a negative Coombs direct antibody test, ceruloplasmin of 3 mg/dL (21-51 mg/dL), and 24-h urine copper of 393 mug/24 h (15-60 mug/24 h). Liver biopsy showed patchy advanced fibrosis, mild inflammation, positive staining for copper, and a tissue copper concentration of 768 microg/g (10-35 mug/g). Brain MRI revealed symmetric intrinsic T1 shortening within bilateral basal ganglia. Trientene therapy was initiated for WD. Symptoms and laboratory abnormalities resolved and remain normal at 21 months' follow-up. Musculoskeletal involvement in WD is uncommon and typically defined as bone demineralization, arthropathy, or hypokalemic muscle weakness.

The diagnosis of WD was made 8 months earlier based on abnormal copper metabolism parameters and was confirmed by genetic testing. Initially, the patient presented with akathisia, sialorrhea, oromandibular dystonia (occasionally grimacing) and slight dysarthria. The patient's symptoms diminished after treatment with d-penicillamine was initiated. No further deterioration was observed after copper-chelating therapy was started. The authors diagnosed acute focal dystonia induced by clomipramine. Botulinum toxin and intensive rehabilitation was initiated; complete regression of hand dystonia was observed.

The study describes the development and validation of a novel assay termed circulating single-molecule amplification and resequencing technology (cSMART) for counting single allelic molecules in plasma. Here we demonstrate the suitability of cSMART for NIPT, with Wilson Disease (WD) as proof of concept. METHODS: We used Sanger and whole-exome sequencing to identify familial ATP7B (ATPase, Cu(++) transporting, beta polypeptide) gene mutations. For cSMART, single molecules were tagged with unique barcodes and circularized, and alleles were targeted and replicated by inverse PCR. The unique single allelic molecules were identified by sequencing and counted, and the percentage of mutant alleles in the original maternal plasma sample was used to determine fetal genotypes. RESULTS: Four families with WD pedigrees consented to the study. Using Sanger and whole-exome sequencing, we mapped the pathogenic ATP7B mutations in each pedigree and confirmed the proband's original diagnosis of WD. After validation of cSMART with defined plasma models mimicking fetal inheritance of paternal, maternal, or both parental mutant alleles, we retrospectively showed in second pregnancies that the fetal genotypes assigned by invasive testing and NIPT were concordant. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a reliable and accurate NIPT assay that correctly diagnosed the fetal genotypes in 4 pregnancies at risk for WD. This novel technology has potential as a universal strategy for NIPT of other monogenic disorders, since it requires only knowledge of the parental pathogenic mutations.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Surgical management of tremor has evolved over the years with Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) gradually supplanting lesioning as the mainstay in treatment. In this article, the largest of its kind from our country, we present our experience in the use of lesioning in the management of patients with multietiological tremors. These include not only common indications like Parkinson disease and essential tremor but also rare causes such as Pantothenate kinase associated neurodegeneration (PKAN), multiple sclerosis (MS) and Wilson disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with medically refractory tremor who underwent surgery were included in the analysis. A comprehensive clinical and radiological evaluation was performed which was repeated 3 months postoperatively and at successive visits. Video documentation of was obtained at all visits. RESULTS: A total of 21 patients (18 men, 3 women) with an average age 37.7 years (range 21-65 years) underwent stereotactic thalamotomy/subthalamotomy at our institute between 2008 and 2013, for the treatment of medically refractory tremor of varying etiologies. The mean preoperative duration of symptoms was 11 years (range 10 months to 34 years). The median time to onset of improvement was 2 months (range 1 week to 8 months). Analyzing the improvement on the modified FTM scale, in part 1 the scores improved from 21.7 to 1.5, the part II subset improved from an average of 9.2 to 3.2 while the part III subset improved from an average of 14.1 to 4.1 postoperatively. This implied an excellent response in tremor while the other 2 components had a very good response. DISCUSSION: In this study we have for the first time objectively analyzed the tremor improvement with a modified FTM scale and have produced excellent results. We have also shown that tremor of various etiologies respond extremely well to lesioning surgery. While DBS continues to remain the treatment of choice in various types of bilateral tremor, lesioning is very successful in a carefully selected cohort of patients. We are of the opinion that in predominantly unilateral tremor or when the patient cannot afford DBS especially in a country like ours, lesioning surgery is an important tool in the armamentarium of the functional neurosurgeon.",

Natural copper comprises two stable isotopes, (63)Cu and (65)Cu, and 5 principal radioisotopes for molecular imaging applications ((60)Cu, (61)Cu, (62)Cu, and (64)Cu) and in vivo targeted radiation therapy ((64)Cu and (67)Cu). The two potential ways to produce Cu radioisotopes concern the use of the cyclotron or the reactor. A noncopper target is used to produce noncarrier-added Cu thanks to a chemical separation from the target material using ion exchange chromatography achieving a high amount of radioactivity with the lowest possible amount of nonradioactive isotopes. In recent years, Cu isotopes have been linked to antibodies, proteins, peptides, and nanoparticles for preclinical and clinical research; pathological conditions that influence Cu metabolism such as Menkes syndrome, Wilson disease, inflammation, tumor growth, metastasis, angiogenesis, and drug resistance have been studied. We aim to discuss all Cu radioisotopes application focusing on (64)Cu and in particular its form (64)CuCl2 that seems to be the most promising for its half-life, radiation emissions, and stability with chelators, allowing several applications in oncological and nononcological fields.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Variation in care is more common in settings in which evidence-based approaches are limited. The aims of the present study were to describe consensus and variability in approaches taken by pediatric hepatologists in the management of Wilson disease (WD) in children. METHOD: International case-centered, Internet-based survey of pediatric hepatologists. Survey cases were developed by consensus of the authors and were intended to identify variation in the care of children with WD. RESULTS: One hundred eleven of 253 clinicians responded (44%). Of these, 84% of North American and 41% of European participants used guidelines published in their respective region. Although consensus existed on the first-line diagnostic tools (serum ceruloplasmin and baseline 24-hour urinary copper excretion), survey participants did not agree on how much liver copper content was required for diagnosis: 57% considered >250 mug/g dry weight to be consistent with WD, whereas 25% considered >50 mug/g to be diagnostic. Overall, 50% of practitioners perform genetic testing in all suspected cases, and 81% perform genetic testing once they know the genotype of an index patient. For initial treatment of fulminant WD, 51% of participants chose chelation and 15% chose immediate transplantation; 47% chose listing for transplantation followed by monitoring using a disease-severity score, and then carrying out transplantation only when the score reached a critical cut-off. To treat mildly affected siblings of index patients, 43% of practitioners chose zinc. Most reported that they use chelation to treat patients with hepatic dysfunction; however, 29% of North American participants chose not to use D-penicillamine as primary therapy. CONCLUSIONS: From an international perspective, pediatric hepatologists vary in the approaches they use in the care for children with WD. Regional preferences and accessibility to treatments may generate variation. Unwarranted variation, however, may also contribute to differences in outcome and should be targeted to improve quality of care.",

                    "abstract": "Drug-induced liver injury after liver transplant occurs in 1.7% of patients. Tacrolimus is an effective immunosuppressant that is used to treat acute rejection. Although rare, it can cause toxicity, which is demonstrated by cholestatic liver injury. Here, we present a case of a young male patient who was diagnosed with Wilson disease, had penicillaminechelating therapy, and underwent living related liver transplant. Within 1 month posttransplant, he developed deranged, predominantly cholestatic pattern liver function tests. Laboratory parameters showed total bilirubin of 1.12 mg/ dL, alanine aminotransferase of 553 IU/L, gammaglutamyltransferase of 624 IU/L, and tacrolimus level of 10.2 ng/mL. After thorough evaluation, a liver biopsy was performed. Liver biopsy showed hepatocellular necrosis with centrilobular cholestasis without any evidence of graft rejection. However, with normal level of tacrolimus, the biopsy was suggestive of drug-induced liver injury. Thus, tacrolimus dose was reduced, resulting in improved liver function tests and patient discharge from the hospital. Tacrolimus is an effective immunosuppressant after liver transplant and has the ability to treat early acute rejection. The patient's liver biopsy showed hepatocellular necrosis with centrilobular cholestasis without any evidence of graft rejection. Cholestatic liver injury after tacrolimus usually resolves after dose reduction or by switching to another agent. With demonstrated tacrolimus-induced toxicity in liver transplant recipients, despite normal serum levels, transplant physicians should keep high index of suspicion regarding toxicity in the posttransplant setting.",

We aimed to determine what proportion of an Irish population had a low ceruloplasmin level, whether low measurements were appropriately followed-up and what were the clinical outcomes. We conducted a retrospective review of all serum ceruloplasmin measurements between August 2003 and October 2009 in a large tertiary referral centre in Southern Ireland. Clinical data, serum ceruloplasmin, liver function tests, urinary copper and liver biopsy reports were all recorded where available. 1573 patients had a serum ceruloplasmin measurement during the 7-year study period. 96 patients (6.1%) had a ceruloplasmin level < 0.2g/L and of these only 3 patients had Wilson disease. There was only 1 new diagnosis. Only 27 patients (28.1%) had some form of confirmatory testing performed. In our centre's experience, the positive predictive value of a significantly low ceruloplasmin level is 11.1% (95% CI 2.91-30.3%). In practice a low serum ceruloplasmin measurement is often not followed by appropriate confirmatory testing. Measuring serum ceruloplasmin as a singular diagnostic test for Wilson disease or as part of the battery of unselected liver screening tests is inappropriate and low-yield.",

METHODS: Included liver histology and relevant biochemical analyses including hepatic copper quantification, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) liver levels, qPCR for transcript levels of genes relevant to methionine metabolism and liver damage, and DNA dot blot for global DNA methylation. RESULTS: Hepatic copper was lower in tx-j fetuses but higher in weanling (three weeks) and adult tx-j mice compared to controls. S-adenosylhomocysteinase transcript levels were significantly lower at all time points, except at three weeks, correlating negatively with copper levels and with consequent changes in the SAM:SAH methylation ratio and global DNA methylation. CONCLUSION: Compared to controls, methionine metabolism including S-adenosylhomocysteinase gene expression is persistently different in the tx-j mice with consequent alterations in global DNA methylation in more advanced stages of liver disease. The inhibitory effect of copper accumulation on S-adenosylhomocysteinase expression is associated with progressively abnormal methionine metabolism and decreased methylation capacity and DNA global methylation.",

Here, we describe a 45-year-old woman who presented with an incidental hepatocellular carcinoma at the time of transplant. The patient had severe neurologic manifestations of Wilson disease pretransplant, including dysarthria, hyperreflexia, asymmetrical ataxia, tremor, bradyphrenia, and shuffling gait. She underwent successful transplant from a hepatic and surgical standpoint, but her postoperative course was marked by protracted mutism, hypophonia, and fluctuating akinesia and immobility that did not respond promptly to withdrawal of calcineurin inhibitors or pramipexole but did respond robustly to amantadine. At 9 months posttransplant, there was marked neurologic improvement, and, at 18 months, she exhibited subtle memory and organizational difficulties but was fully ambulatory and otherwise completely functional. Our experience suggests that even patients with severe neurologic Wilson disease may recover after transplant, albeit slowly, demonstrating the need for a multidisciplinary approach, including pre- and posttransplant neurologic and neuropsychiatric consultations.",

Although rare, it can cause toxicity, which is demonstrated by cholestatic liver injury. Here, we present a case of a young male patient who was diagnosed with Wilson disease, had penicillaminechelating therapy, and underwent living related liver transplant. Within 1 month posttransplant, he developed deranged, predominantly cholestatic pattern liver function tests. Laboratory parameters showed total bilirubin of 1.12 mg/ dL, alanine aminotransferase of 553 IU/L, gammaglutamyltransferase of 624 IU/L, and tacrolimus level of 10.2 ng/mL. After thorough evaluation, a liver biopsy was performed. Liver biopsy showed hepatocellular necrosis with centrilobular cholestasis without any evidence of graft rejection. However, with normal level of tacrolimus, the biopsy was suggestive of drug-induced liver injury. Thus, tacrolimus dose was reduced, resulting in improved liver function tests and patient discharge from the hospital. Tacrolimus is an effective immunosuppressant after liver transplant and has the ability to treat early acute rejection. The patient's liver biopsy showed hepatocellular necrosis with centrilobular cholestasis without any evidence of graft rejection. Cholestatic liver injury after tacrolimus usually resolves after dose reduction or by switching to another agent. With demonstrated tacrolimus-induced toxicity in liver transplant recipients, despite normal serum levels, transplant physicians should keep high index of suspicion regarding toxicity in the posttransplant setting.",

There are few data on long-term outcomes and survival from large cohorts; we studied these features in a well-characterized Austrian cohort of patients with Wilson disease. METHODS: We analyzed data from 229 patients diagnosed with Wilson disease from 1961 through 2013; 175 regularly attended a Wilson disease outpatient clinic and/or their physicians were contacted for information on disease and treatment status and outcomes. For 53 patients lost during the follow-up period, those that died and reasons for their death were identified from the Austrian death registry. RESULTS: The mean observation period was 14.8 +- 11.4 years (range, 0.5-52.0 years), resulting in 3116 patient-years. Of the patients, 61% presented with hepatic disease, 27% with neurologic symptoms, and 10% were diagnosed by family screening at presymptomatic stages. Patients with a hepatic presentation were diagnosed younger (21.2 +- 12.0 years) than patients with neurologic disease (28.8 +- 12.0; P < .001). In 2% of patients, neither symptoms nor onset of symptoms could be determined with certainty. Most patients stabilized (35%) or improved on chelation therapy (26% fully recovered, 24% improved), but 15% deteriorated; 8% required a liver transplant, and 7.4% died within the observation period (71% of deaths were related to Wilson disease). A lower proportion of patients with Wilson disease survived for 20 years (92%) than healthy Austrians (97%), adjusted for age and sex (P = .03). Cirrhosis at diagnosis was the best predictor of death (odds ratio, 6.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-31.03; P = .013) and need for a liver transplant (odds ratio, 07; 95% confidence interval, 0.016-0.307; P < .001). Only 84% of patients with cirrhosis survived 20 years after diagnosis (compared with healthy Austrians, P =.008). CONCLUSION: Overall, patients who receive adequate care for Wilson disease have a good long-term prognosis. However, cirrhosis increases the risk of death and liver disease. Early diagnosis, at a precirrhotic stage, might increase survival times and reduce the need for a liver transplant.",

A liver transplant is the most viable option for the management of such patients. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is helpful in improving the liver biochemistry profile, thereby, increasing their likelihood of undergoing a liver transplant METHOD: The study was conducted over a period of 3 years (January 2018 to December 2021). Indications mainly consisted of ALF with hepatic encephalopathy, worsening liver parameters in spite of medical management, and candidacy for undergoing a liver transplant. Plasma exchange was performed daily or alternatively until the patient recovered, succumbed, or was stable enough to undergo a transplant. Biochemical parameters serum bilirubin, ALT, AST serum ammonia serum urea, serum creatinine were recorded before and after TPE sessions. RESULTS: The study group comprised 14 patients of which a total of 28 TPE was performed. There were a total of 5 cases of cryptogenic ALF, 4 of Wilson disease, 2 cases each of infection-related ALF and autoimmune hepatitis, and a single case of drug-induced hepatitis. A total of 5 out of 14 patients underwent a liver transplant and amongst the 9 who did not undergo a transplant, 4 patients expired due to septic shock syndrome; the remaining 5 were discharged in a stable condition following TPE sessions. The disease-free survival was 78.9% and the transplant-free survival was 35.71%. CONCLUSION: TPE plays a crucial role in improving the biochemistry profile of the liver in children with liver failure.",

Underlying liver diseases were Wilson disease (6/14), autoimmune liver disease (3/14), biliary atresia (2/14) and progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 (1/14), and unknown etiology (2/14). The majority were living donor liver transplants (86%). Of the living donors, 42% (5/12) were Buddhist priests. There were three immediate deaths and two late deaths. The 3-month survival was 78%, and overall survival was 64%. Living donor transplants carried a higher success rate (92%) compared to diseased donor transplants (0%; 2/2). CONCLUSIONS: Initial experience of pediatric liver transplant program of Sri Lanka is promising despite being established in a free healthcare system amidst the crisis circumstances.",

Liver transplantation is an effective treatment for fulminant cases for patients with chronic liver disease. Reports on the outcome of neuropsychiatric symptoms after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) are limited. AIM: To assess the course of neuropsychiatric and hepatic symptoms after liver transplantation for Wilson disease METHODS: Nineteen patients with Wilson disease received liver transplantation and were followed prospectively from 2005 to 2010 for the development of hepatic, neurological and psychiatric symptoms. RESULTS: Eight patients (all female) were transplanted for acute liver failure and eleven patients for chronic liver failure. Patient survival rates one and five yr after transplantation were 78% and 65%, respectively. Of the surviving patients, hepatic symptom scores improved in all patients and neurological symptom scores improved in all but one patient after OLT compared to the time of initial diagnosis and compared to pre-OLT status. Psychiatric symptoms showed moderate improvements. CONCLUSION: Survival after OLT for Wilson disease with end-stage liver disease is excellent. Overall, neuropsychiatric symptoms improved after transplantation, substantiating arguments for widening of the indication for liver transplantation in symptomatic neurologic Wilson disease patients with stable liver function.",

Liver-directed gene therapy has recently become an option for treatment of haemophilias and is likely to become one of the favoured therapeutic strategies for inherited metabolic liver diseases in the near future. In this review, we present the different gene therapy vectors and strategies for liver-targeting, including gene editing. We highlight the current development of viral and nonviral gene therapy for a number of inherited metabolic liver diseases including urea cycle defects, organic acidaemias, Crigler-Najjar disease, Wilson disease, glycogen storage disease Type Ia, phenylketonuria and maple syrup urine disease. We describe the main limitations and open questions for further gene therapy development: immunogenicity, inflammatory response, genotoxicity, gene therapy administration in a fibrotic liver. The follow-up of a constantly growing number of gene therapy treated patients allows better understanding of its benefits and limitations and provides strategies to design safer and more efficacious treatments. Undoubtedly, liver-targeting gene therapy offers a promising avenue for innovative therapies with an unprecedented potential to address the unmet needs of patients suffering from inherited metabolic diseases.",

This study investigated whether a change in magnetic susceptibility can be detected using quantitative susceptibility mapping of the brain in patients with WD compared with healthy controls. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven patients with WD (6 with the neurological form, 5 with the hepatic form) and 10 age-matched healthy controls who gave informed consent were examined at 7 T in a whole-body scanner (MAGNETOM; Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) using a 24-channel phased array coil (Nova Medical). For imaging, a 3-dimensional spoiled gradient multiecho sequence (repetition time, 40 milliseconds; echo time, 9.76/19.19/28.62 milliseconds; bandwidth, 150 hertz per pixel; voxel size, 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.8 mm) was used. The susceptibility of selected regions (substantia nigra, red nucleus, pallidum, putamen, caudate nucleus) was analyzed in susceptibility maps. RESULTS: The patients with WD showed significantly increased susceptibility (P value, 0.001-0.05) in all analyzed regions compared with healthy controls. This was evident not only in patients with a neurological syndrome but also, with lower values, in patients with isolated hepatic manifestations. The distribution patterns of copper accumulation were different between the patients with neurological and non-neurological manifestations of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: In neurologically symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with WD, we found increased magnetic susceptibility in the brain tissue using quantitative susceptibility mapping.",

However, in a subset of patients focal liver lesions may develop, presenting with a wide range of imaging features. The majority of focal liver lesions in patients with WD are benign nodules, but there are reports that have described malignant liver tumors or dysplastic nodules in these patients. Because of the possibility of malignant transformation of liver nodules, major concerns have been raised with respect to the management and follow-up of patients with WD in whom focal liver lesions have been identified. The assessment of liver involvement in patients with WD is generally performed with ultrasonography. However, ultrasonography conveys limited specificity so that magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is often performed to improve lesion characterization. This review was performed to illustrate the spectrum of MR imaging features of focal liver lesions that develop in patients with WD. It is assumed that familiarity with the MR imaging presentation of focal liver lesions in WD may help clarify the actual nature of hepatic nodules in patients with this condition.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study enrolled 30 WD patients and 20 age-matched healthy controls. Neurological symptoms were scored using the modified Young Scale. The hepatic function indices, serum and urinary copper content, and serum iron content were determined. All study objects received the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and SWI test of the brain. The values of corrected phase (CP) were calculated on SWI. The relationship between CP values and the clinical status were evaluated. RESULTS: The serum iron content of WD patients was higher than the normal. The CP values of substantia nigra, caudate nucleus, and globus pallidus of WD were lower than the normal values, while the CP value of substantia nigra was the lowest. No correlations were determined between the CP values and the iron and copper parameters. There was negative correlation between the scores of dysarthria and the CP values of the globus pallidus. There was negative correlation between the scores of tremor and the CP values of caudate nucleus. Some regions, which had high signals on T2-weighted image, had low signals on SWI. CONCLUSIONS: There might be abnormal iron metabolism in patients with WD. The decreased CP values might reflect a deposition of both copper and iron. SWI may be more sensitive than the ordinary MRI. The mineral deposition may contribute to the neural symptoms.",

These diseases are accompanied by a wide range of systemic manifestations (cardiopathies, endocrinopathies, skeletal deformities, and skin abnormalities). DEVELOPMENT: This study reviews current knowledge of the most common forms of autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia in order to provide tips that may facilitate diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: A thorough assessment of clinical phenotype (pure cerebellar or cerebellar-plus syndrome, with or without systemic manifestations), laboratory tests (vitamin E, acanthocytosis, albumin, cholesterol, phytanic acid, lactic acid, creatine kinase, cholestanol, coenzyme Q10, alpha-fetoprotein, copper, ceruloplasmin, chitotriosidase), nerve conduction studies (presence and type of neuropathy), and an magnetic resonance imaging study (presence of cerebellar atrophy, presence and location of signal alterations) may help establish a suspected diagnosis, which should be confirmed by detecting the underlying genetic mutation. A positive genetic test result is necessary to determine prognosis and provide adequate genetic counselling, and will also permit appropriate treatment of some entities (abetalipoproteinaemia, ataxia with vitamin E deficiency, Refsum disease, cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, Niemann-Pick disease type C, Wilson disease). Without a genetic diagnosis, conducting basic research and therapeutic trials will not be possible.",

                    "abstract": "The normal functioning of brain is intimately as well as intricately interrelated with normal functioning of the liver. Liver plays a critical role of not only providing vital nutrients to the brain but also of detoxifying the splanchnic blood. Compromised liver function leads to insufficient detoxification thus allowing neurotoxins (such as ammonia, manganese, and other chemicals) to enter the cerebral circulation. In addition, portosystemic shunts, which are common accompaniments of advanced liver disease, facilitate free passage of neurotoxins into the cerebral circulation. The problem is compounded further by additional variables such as gastrointestinal tract bleeding, malnutrition, and concurrent renal failure, which are often associated with liver cirrhosis. Neurologic damage in chronic liver disease and liver cirrhosis seems to be multifactorial primarily attributable to the following: brain accumulation of ammonia, manganese, and lactate; altered permeability of the blood-brain barrier; recruitment of monocytes after microglial activation; and neuroinflammation, that is, direct effects of circulating systemic proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor, IL-1beta, and IL-6.

                    "abstract": "The normal functioning of brain is intimately as well as intricately interrelated with normal functioning of the liver. Liver plays a critical role of not only providing vital nutrients to the brain but also of detoxifying the splanchnic blood. Compromised liver function leads to insufficient detoxification thus allowing neurotoxins (such as ammonia, manganese, and other chemicals) to enter the cerebral circulation. In addition, portosystemic shunts, which are common accompaniments of advanced liver disease, facilitate free passage of neurotoxins into the cerebral circulation. The problem is compounded further by additional variables such as gastrointestinal tract bleeding, malnutrition, and concurrent renal failure, which are often associated with liver cirrhosis. Neurologic damage in chronic liver disease and liver cirrhosis seems to be multifactorial primarily attributable to the following: brain accumulation of ammonia, manganese, and lactate; altered permeability of the blood-brain barrier; recruitment of monocytes after microglial activation; and neuroinflammation, that is, direct effects of circulating systemic proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor, IL-1beta, and IL-6. Radiologist should be aware of the conundrum of neurologic complications that can be encountered in liver disease, which include hepatic encephalopathy, hepatocerebral degeneration, hepatic myelopathy, cirrhosis-related parkinsonism, cerebral infections, hemorrhage, and osmotic demyelination.

We report the experience of albumin dialysis in acute liver failure (ALF) caused by WD in children. METHODS: Chart review of children admitted for ALF secondary to acute WD and treated by the molecular adsorbents and recirculating system. Measures of copper level in blood and within the circuit during molecular adsorbents recirculating system (MARS) sessions were performed. Clinical and biological assessments after MARS session were reported. RESULTS: Four children, with a median age of 12.3 years, were treated from 2004 to 2009 for a severe ALF associated with acute renal failure, haemolysis, and severe cholestasis. All of the children had a new Wilson index >12. A total of 14 MARS sessions were performed, for a median duration of 7.5 hours. Tolerance was good, except for 1 child who experienced haemorrhage because of vascular injury following insertion of the dialysis catheter. A neurological improvement or stabilisation was noted in all of the children along with an improvement in the Fisher index and ammonia level after MARS treatment. MARS was able to remove copper, to decrease the serum copper level of 28% in mean, and to decrease the bilirubin and creatinin levels >25%. All of the children were subsequently underwent liver transplants with a good outcome without disability. CONCLUSIONS: MARS is able to remove copper and to stabilise children with ALF secondary to WD, allowing bridging to LT.",

Methods: Forty patients with WD, including 20 with cerebral type and 20 with hepatic type, and 20 age-matched healthy controls in the First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University between Jul 2013 and May 2016 were enrolled.All study subjects underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) of the brain.Six regions of interest (ROIs) were chosen.The values of fractional anisotropy (FA), lambda in ROIs were determined on DTI, FA and fiber volumes between ROIs were also determined on DTI.The values of amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and regional homogeneity (REHO) in ROIs were determined on rs-fMRI.The values of corrected phase (CP) were calculated on SWI.The copper and iron content were measured.The difference of imaging and metal metrics between cerebral type and hepatic type WD were evaluated. Results: DTI metrics differed between patients with the cerebral and hepatic types of WD.ALFF values in the caudate nucleus, and thalamus were lower (P=0.037, 0.040), and REHO values in the caudate nucleus were lower (P=0.029), in patients of cerebral type than in hepatic type patients.CP values of the right caudate nucleus and left putamen in cerebral type WD patients were lower than in hepatic type patients (P=0.020, 0.23). The serum iron content of hepatic type WD patients was higher than the normal (P=0.013), and the urine copper content was higher than the cerebral type patients (P=0.021). Conclusions: Metal deposition and damage to the structure and functional activity in the brain may occur in hepatic type WD patients.The structural and functional activity damage of the brain in hepatic type is less severe than that in cerebral type patients, while the metal deposition is not significant different between hepatic and cerebral type.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease were included in our study. Inclusion criteria were: presence of liver steatosis on ultrasound in patients with waist circumference over 94 cm in men and over 80 cm in women and with serologic elements of metabolic syndrome. Exclusion criteria were: chronic viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson disease, hemochromatosis, regular alcohol consumption. Body mass index, waist circumference, fasting plasma glucose, serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels and serum ALT were determined. On liver biopsy specimens, performed in each patient, the NASH score, representing the sum of fibrosis, steatosis, lobular inflammation and ballooning, was calculated. RESULTS: Necroinflammation was mild in 15 patients, medium in 19 patients and severe in five patients. Mild fibrosis was present in four cases, medium in 14 cases, severe in six, and two patients were diagnosed with cirrhosis. We found statistically significant correlation between waist circumference and the grade of histological activity, the presence of diabetes and both fibrosis grade and histological activity, and the serum ALT and histological activity. CONCLUSIONS: Noninvasive assessment of the severity of hepatic histological changes in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease could be made by anthropometric parameters or by serologic components of metabolic syndrome, but it is not an accurate method to identify patients with high-risk for disease progression. These noninvasive parameters cannot replace liver biopsy.",

We report the role of plasma glutathione (GSH), total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the worsening of NWD following treatment. Fifty-one treatment-naive NWD patients were subjected to detailed clinical evaluation. The severity of NWD was noted, and dystonia was measured by Burke-Fahn-Marsden (BFM) score. Their hematological, serum chemistry, ultrasound abdomen and cranial MRI changes were noted. Plasma GSH, TAC and MDA, serum free copper (Cu) and 24-h urinary Cu were measured at admission and at 3 and 6 months after treatment. The patients were considered worsened if there was one or more grade deterioration in severity scale, >10 % deterioration in BFM score or appearance of new neurologic signs. The median age of the patients was 11 (5-37) years, and 12 were females. Following treatment, 25 patients improved, 12 worsened, and 14 had stationary course.

Establishing the diagnosis is straightforward if the major clinical and laboratory features are present. However, clinical phenotypes are highly varied and early, proper diagnosis can be challenging. AIM: The aim of our study was to analyze clinical presentations and diagnostic tests of Polish pediatric patients with WD. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed medical history of 156 patients with confirmed diagnosis of WD treated at our Institute from 1996 till March 2016. RESULTS: The mean age at onset of symptoms was 10.15+-4.23 years of age. Hepatic presentation was the most common one (94.23%) with either liver failure (16.03%) or more frequently increased transaminases (78.2%). In 90.26% cases ceruloplasmin serum concentration was <=0,2 g/l, in 51.93% patients basal urinary copper excretion was >100 mug/24 h. Mutation analysis was performed in 155 (99.36%) cases. The most common mutation was p.H1069Q. CONCLUSIONS: Wilson disease can present with only significantly increased transaminases activity and hepatomegaly or liver failure, but neurological symptoms are very rare in children. Diagnostic approach is challenging due to wide spectrum of clinical presentations in a high variable degree of severity. Genetic screening is supportive, ceruloplasmin and urinary copper excretion are valuable tests in the majority of patients but do not allow to exclude WD.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Wilson disease is rare, found in 3 of 100,000 people (0.03%). Ceruloplasmin is often ordered to evaluate liver enzyme elevations. Because Wilson disease often presents before middle-age, the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease recommends screening patients between the ages of 3 and 55 years with liver abnormalities of uncertain cause. We evaluate guideline adherence and the clinical and economic impact of current clinical use of ceruloplasmin. METHODS: We reviewed all ceruloplasmin measurements at a clinical laboratory that serves a large primary care network, specialty clinics, and a 600-bed tertiary referral center between January 1, 2003, and December 12, 2011. RESULTS: Ceruloplasmin was measured 5325 times in 5023 unique patients, resulting in 8 (0.16%) new Wilson disease diagnoses. Ceruloplasmin's positive predictive value was 8.4% (95% confidence interval, 7.7-9.3) and false-positive rate was 98.1% (95% confidence interval, 96.2-99.1). A total of 1109 ceruloplasmin levels (20.8%) were ordered in the 1066 patients aged more than 55 years (none with Wilson disease). A \"shotgun\" approach to liver disease diagnosis was found: Ceruloplasmin was ordered on the same day as hepatitis B (81.0%), hepatitis C (76.0%), autoimmune hepatitis (75.1%), and hemochromatosis (73.1%). Of 424 positive ceruloplasmin results, 91% were not pursued further. CONCLUSIONS: Guideline adherence restricts ceruloplasmin use to a population with a higher pre-test probability of Wilson disease: patients with chronic liver disease aged 3 to 55 years who have been tested for common causes of liver disease. The majority of the serum ceruloplasmin was measured in patients not indicated by the guidelines, resulting in poor test performance and wasted healthcare resources. Our data on ceruloplasmin use could serve as a touchstone for broader discussions on rational clinical decision making.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-six patients participated in the study, 35 with WD and 41 with NWD. The two groups were divided into two subgroups according to the presence of cholestasis. At the time of diagnosis, age, sex, biochemical test results, serum ceruloplasmin, baseline 24-h urinary copper levels, liver biopsy histological findings, liver copper levels, and Child-Pugh scores were obtained from medical records. Copper content in liver tissue and copper levels in urine were measured by atomic absorption spectrometry. Cut-off values for differentiation of WD from NWD were determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: A liver copper cut-off value of 98 microg/g indicated WD with 91% sensitivity and 65.4% specificity (area under the curve =0.838, 95% CI: 0.749-0.927).

A larger scale study is warranted to re-evaluate liver copper and 24-h urinary copper cut-offs for children with suspected WD.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Wilson disease is a genetic copper storage disorder that causes hepatic and neurologic symptoms. Chelating agents (D-penicillamine, trientine) are used as first-line therapies for symptomatic patients, but there are few data from large cohorts. We assessed the safety of D-penicillamine and trientine therapy and outcomes of patients with Wilson disease. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of data on 380 patients with Wilson disease from tertiary care centers in Germany and Austria, and 25 additional patients from the EUROWILSON registry. Chelator-based treatment regimens were analyzed for their effect on neurologic and hepatic symptoms and for adverse events that led to discontinuation of therapy (Kaplan-Meier estimation; data were collected for a mean of 13.3 y after therapy began). RESULTS: Changes in medication were common, resulting in analysis of 471 chelator monotherapies (326 patients receiving D-penicillamine and 141 receiving trientine). Nine of 326 patients treated with D-penicillamine and 3 of 141 patients given trientine underwent liver transplantation. Adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment were more frequent among those receiving D-penicillamine than trientine (P = .039). Forty-eight months after therapy, hepatic deterioration was reported in only 4 of 333 patients treated initially with a chelating agent. Hepatic improvements were observed in more than 90%, and neurologic improvements were observed in more than 55%, of therapy-naive patients, and values did not differ significantly between treatments. However, neurologic deterioration was observed less frequently in patients given D-penicillamine first (6 of 295) than those given trientine first (4 of 38; P = .018). CONCLUSIONS: Chelating agents are effective therapies for most patients with Wilson disease; D-penicillamine and trientine produce comparable outcomes, although D-penicillamine had a higher rate of adverse events. Few patients receiving chelation therapy had neurologic deterioration, which occurred more frequently in patients who received trientine.",

METHODS: 34 WD patients with neurological manifestation with a median age of 14 years were included. Their Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, movement disorders and laboratory findings were noted. Cranial MRI in T1, T2, FLAIR and DW sequences were done. Outcome at 6 months was categorized into improved (>1 grade improvement), static or worsening. RESULTS: MRI was abnormal in all and revealed involvement of putamen in 29 (85.3%), caudate in 23 (67.6%), brainstem and globus pallidus in 21 (61.8%) each, thalamus in 20 (58.8%), cerebral cortex in 9 (26.5%), subcortical white matter in 8 (23.5%), and cerebellum in 2 (5.9%) patients. The overall sensitivity of T2 and FLAIR was 97.1% each, DWI 38.2% and T1 31.4%. None had contrast enhancement and 4 had reduced ADC value. Choreoathetosis correlated with thalamic, pallidal and putaminal lesions; MMSE with subcortical white mater. MRI load correlated with age, tremor, psychiatric disorder, choreoathetosis, and severity of WD. At 6 months 9 (26.5%) patients improved, 18 (52.9%) remained static and 6 (17.6%) deteriorated. CONCLUSION: In neurologic WD, putaminal involvement is the commonest; T2 and FLAIR sequences have similar sensitivity and number of MRI lesions correlated with disease severity but not with outcome.",

We report the experience of albumin dialysis in acute liver failure (ALF) caused by WD in children. METHODS: Chart review of children admitted for ALF secondary to acute WD and treated by the molecular adsorbents and recirculating system. Measures of copper level in blood and within the circuit during molecular adsorbents recirculating system (MARS) sessions were performed. Clinical and biological assessments after MARS session were reported. RESULTS: Four children, with a median age of 12.3 years, were treated from 2004 to 2009 for a severe ALF associated with acute renal failure, haemolysis, and severe cholestasis. All of the children had a new Wilson index >12. A total of 14 MARS sessions were performed, for a median duration of 7.5 hours. Tolerance was good, except for 1 child who experienced haemorrhage because of vascular injury following insertion of the dialysis catheter. A neurological improvement or stabilisation was noted in all of the children along with an improvement in the Fisher index and ammonia level after MARS treatment. MARS was able to remove copper, to decrease the serum copper level of 28% in mean, and to decrease the bilirubin and creatinin levels >25%. All of the children were subsequently underwent liver transplants with a good outcome without disability. CONCLUSIONS: MARS is able to remove copper and to stabilise children with ALF secondary to WD, allowing bridging to LT.",

AIM: To prospectively evaluate once-daily trientine as therapy for Wilson disease. METHODS:  STUDY GROUP: eight patients (seven males) aged 22-71 years with stable Wilson disease treated from 4 to 50 years. Patients were monitored for 3 months then for 12 months on a single daily dose of trientine (15 mg/kg). RESULTS: All patients remained clinically well. ALT and AST fluctuated in some, but none required treatment stoppages or side effects. Liver synthetic function was unchanged. Mean 24-h urine copper and zinc excretions at end of treatment were 313.4 +- 191.7 and 2,214 +- 1,346 mug, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Once-daily trientine should be explored further for possible maintenance therapy for WD. Single daily dose may improve adherence to therapy. Larger trials and longer-term follow-up will establish the safety and treatment efficacy of this once-daily treatment regimen for WD (registration: NCT01472874).",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Current guidelines favor the use of chelating agents (d-penicillamine, trientine) in first line therapy of symptomatic Wilson disease patients. Development of chelator induced immunological adverse events are a concern especially under d-penicillamine therapy. This study assessed the prevalence of co-existing or therapy-related immune-mediated diseases in Wilson disease patients, and evaluated the role of antinuclear antibodies in therapy monitoring. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 235 Wilson disease patients. Medical regimens were classified and analyzed in relation to adverse events and antinuclear antibody courses. RESULTS: Coexisting immune-mediated diseases were evident in 19/235 (8.1%) patients, of which 13/235 (5.5%) had pre-existing autoimmune diseases. Six patients (2.6%) developed an autoimmune disease under therapy, all of them under long-term d-penicillamine treatment. Data relating to antinuclear antibody courses during treatment and adverse events were available for patients treated with d-penicillamine (n = 91), trientine (n = 58), and zinc salts (n = 58). No significant increase in antinuclear antibody titers in patients treated with d-penicillamine (16/91; 17.6%), trientine (12/58; 20.7%), and zinc (7/58; 12.1%) were found. CONCLUSION: Under long-term d-penicillamine therapy a minority of patients developed immune-mediated disease. Elevations in antinuclear antibodies were found frequently, but no correlations were evident between increases in antinuclear antibodies and the development of immune-mediated diseases or medical regimes. Thus, the value of antinuclear antibodies for monitoring adverse events under chelator therapy seems to be limited.",

                    "abstract": "The normal functioning of brain is intimately as well as intricately interrelated with normal functioning of the liver. Liver plays a critical role of not only providing vital nutrients to the brain but also of detoxifying the splanchnic blood. Compromised liver function leads to insufficient detoxification thus allowing neurotoxins (such as ammonia, manganese, and other chemicals) to enter the cerebral circulation. In addition, portosystemic shunts, which are common accompaniments of advanced liver disease, facilitate free passage of neurotoxins into the cerebral circulation. The problem is compounded further by additional variables such as gastrointestinal tract bleeding, malnutrition, and concurrent renal failure, which are often associated with liver cirrhosis. Neurologic damage in chronic liver disease and liver cirrhosis seems to be multifactorial primarily attributable to the following: brain accumulation of ammonia, manganese, and lactate; altered permeability of the blood-brain barrier; recruitment of monocytes after microglial activation; and neuroinflammation, that is, direct effects of circulating systemic proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor, IL-1beta, and IL-6. Radiologist should be aware of the conundrum of neurologic complications that can be encountered in liver disease, which include hepatic encephalopathy, hepatocerebral degeneration, hepatic myelopathy, cirrhosis-related parkinsonism, cerebral infections, hemorrhage, and osmotic demyelination. In addition, neurologic complications can be exclusive to certain disorders, for example, Wilson disease, alcoholism (Wernicke encephalopathy, alcoholic cerebellar degeneration, Marchiafava-Bignami disease, etc). Radiologist should be aware of their varied clinical presentation and radiological appearances as the diagnosis is not always straightforward. ",

RESULTS: Four WDN patients had neurological deterioration within 4-8 weeks of penicillamine therapy. This was associated with new lesions in white matter, thalamus, pons and mid brain and these lesions showed diffusion restriction. The neurologic deterioration was associated with increased free serum copper and malanodialdehyde and reduced glutathione. Clinical conditions stabilized after few weeks of penicillamine discontinuation. CONCLUSION: Neurological worsening was associated with new lesions on MRI which revealed diffusion restriction. Increased free copper induced oxidative stress may be responsible for these changes.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder of hepatic copper metabolism. Clinical manifestations of WD include neurologic, hepatic and psychiatric symptoms. Most WD patients with the neuropsychiatric form, and some with the hepatic and presymptomatic forms have both hypointense and hyperintense lesions in basal ganglia on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which can be iron and copper accumulation. It has been established that T2* and susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) are highly sensitive in demonstrating brain iron accumulation, showing decreased signal intensity. Hypointense globus pallidus (GP) signal has been described on T2-, T2*-weighted images and on SWI as typical MRI lesion for patients with neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA). We investigated whether WD patients have MRI changes suggesting iron accumulation using T2*-weighted and VEN_BOLD SWI imaging protocols. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Standard MRI with additional sequences (T2*-weighted and VEN_BOLD SWI) was performed in consecutively admitted, clinically stable, and treated patients. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients entered the study. Hypointensity in the GP was observed on T2*-weighted images in 10 pa-tients. Using the VEN_BOLD SWI technique, we found hypointense signal in GP in 20 patients. CONCLUSIONS: MRI data suggest not only copper but also iron accumulation in GP in WD patients.",

                    "abstract": "AIMS: In Wilson disease (WD), T2/T2*-weighted (T2*w) MRI frequently shows hypointensity in the basal ganglia that is suggestive of paramagnetic deposits. It is currently unknown whether this hypointensity is related to copper or iron deposition. We examined the neuropathological correlates of this MRI pattern, particularly in relation to iron and copper concentrations. METHODS: Brain slices from nine WD and six control cases were investigated using a 7T-MRI system. High-resolution T2*w images were acquired and R2* parametric maps were reconstructed using a multigradient recalled echo sequence. R2* was measured in the globus pallidus (GP) and the putamen. Corresponding histopathological sections containing the lentiform nucleus were examined using Turnbull iron staining, and double staining combining Turnbull with immunohistochemistry for macrophages or astrocytes. Quantitative densitometry of the iron staining as well as copper and iron concentrations were measured in the GP and putamen and correlated with R2* values. RESULTS: T2*w hypointensity in the GP and/or putamen was apparent in WD cases and R2* values correlated with quantitative densitometry of iron staining. In WD, iron and copper concentrations were increased in the putamen compared to controls. R2* was correlated with the iron concentration in the GP and putamen, whereas no correlation was observed for the copper concentration. Patients with more pronounced pathological severity in the putamen displayed increased iron concentration, which correlated with an elevated number of iron-containing macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: T2/T2*w hypointensity observed in vivo in the basal ganglia of WD patients is related to iron rather than copper deposits.",

METHODS: 34 WD patients with neurological manifestation with a median age of 14 years were included.

Outcome at 6 months was categorized into improved (>1 grade improvement), static or worsening. RESULTS: MRI was abnormal in all and revealed involvement of putamen in 29 (85.3%), caudate in 23 (67.6%), brainstem and globus pallidus in 21 (61.8%) each, thalamus in 20 (58.8%), cerebral cortex in 9 (26.5%), subcortical white matter in 8 (23.5%), and cerebellum in 2 (5.9%) patients. The overall sensitivity of T2 and FLAIR was 97.1% each, DWI 38.2% and T1 31.4%. None had contrast enhancement and 4 had reduced ADC value. Choreoathetosis correlated with thalamic, pallidal and putaminal lesions; MMSE with subcortical white mater. MRI load correlated with age, tremor, psychiatric disorder, choreoathetosis, and severity of WD. At 6 months 9 (26.5%) patients improved, 18 (52.9%) remained static and 6 (17.6%) deteriorated.

                    "abstract": "Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal-recessive disorder of hepatic copper metabolism that has tremendous variability in its presentation. Phenotypic diversity of the disease can lead to delayed diagnosis. We describe a case of WD in a 10-year-old boy presenting with 3 months of increasingly intense, spasmodic lower extremity muscle cramps. Physical examination revealed tenderness on calf palpation and dark flat lesions over his ankles, knees, and elbows. Initial testing revealed creatine kinase of 302 IU/L (normal 24-248 IU/L), hemoglobin of 8.9 g/dL (11.5-15.5 g/dL), aspartate aminotransferase of 114 IU/L (16-52 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase of 54 IU/L (2-30 IU/L), and myoglobinuria. Extensive evaluation of his myopathy, including MRI and muscle biopsy, was negative. Additional laboratory tests revealed a prothrombin time of 21.3 seconds (11.8-15.5 seconds), total bilirubin of 1.4 mg/dL (<1 mg/dL), direct bilirubin of 0.5 mg/dL (<0.3 mg/dL), albumin of 2.1 g/dL (3.1-4.6 g/dL), a reticulocyte percentage of 4.5% (0.5%-2.5%), a negative Coombs direct antibody test, ceruloplasmin of 3 mg/dL (21-51 mg/dL), and 24-h urine copper of 393 mug/24 h (15-60 mug/24 h). Liver biopsy showed patchy advanced fibrosis, mild inflammation, positive staining for copper, and a tissue copper concentration of 768 microg/g (10-35 mug/g). Brain MRI revealed symmetric intrinsic T1 shortening within bilateral basal ganglia. Trientene therapy was initiated for WD. Symptoms and laboratory abnormalities resolved and remain normal at 21 months' follow-up. Musculoskeletal involvement in WD is uncommon and typically defined as bone demineralization, arthropathy, or hypokalemic muscle weakness. In patients with unexplained musculoskeletal symptoms and hepatic abnormalities, a diagnosis of WD should be considered and appropriate evaluation initiated. ",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Bilateral hypertrophic olivary degeneration on brain MRI has been reported in a few metabolic, genetic and neurodegenerative disorders, including mitochondrial disorders. In this report, we sought to analyse whether bilateral symmetrical inferior olivary nucleus hypertrophy is specifically associated with mitochondrial disorders in children. METHODS: This retrospective study included 125 children (mean age, 7.6 +- 5 years; male:female, 2.6:1) diagnosed with various metabolic and genetic disorders during 2005-2012. The routine MRI sequences (T1 weighted, T2 weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery sequences) were analysed for the presence of bilateral symmetrical olivary hypertrophy and central tegmental tract or dentate nuclei signal changes. The other imaging findings and the final diagnoses were noted. RESULTS: The cohort included patients with Leigh and Leigh-like syndrome (n = 25), other mitochondrial diseases (n = 25), Wilson disease (n = 40), Type 1 glutaric aciduria (n = 14), maple syrup urine disease (n = 13), giant axonal neuropathy (n = 5) and L-2 hydroxy glutaric aciduria (n = 3). Bilateral inferior olivary nucleus hypertrophy was noted in 10 patients, all of whom belonged to the Leigh and Leigh-like syndrome group. CONCLUSION: Bilateral hypertrophic olivary degeneration on MRI is relatively often, but not routinely, seen in children with Leigh and Leigh-like syndrome. Early detection of this finding by radiologists and physicians may facilitate targeted metabolic testing in these children. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: This article highlights the occurrence of bilateral hypertrophic olivary nucleus degeneration on MRI in children with Leigh and Leigh-like syndrome, compared with other metabolic disorders.",

METHODS: A total of 90 children [50 with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV), 20 with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and 20 with Wilson disease] were included in the study and underwent liver stiffness measurement (LSM) using TE. Liver biopsies were evaluated for fibrosis, qualitatively, by Ishak score and quantitatively by fibrosis area fraction (FAF) using digital image analysis (morphometry). LSM was correlated with fibrosis and other studied variables using spearman correlation. A stepwise multiple regression analysis was also performed to examine independent factors associated with LSM. Different cut-off values of LSM were calculated for predicting individual fibrosis stages using receiver-operating characteristic curve. Cut-off values with optimal clinical performance (optimal sensitivity and specificity simultaneously) were selected. RESULTS: The majority of HCV group had minimal activity (80%) and no/mild fibrosis (72%). On the other hand, the majority of AIH group had mild to moderate activity (70%) and moderate to severe fibrosis (95%) and all Wilson disease group had mild to moderate activity (100%) and moderate to severe fibrosis (100%). LSM correlated significantly with both FAF and Ishak scores and the correlation appeared better with the latter (r = 0.839 vs 0.879, P < 0.0001 for both). LSM discriminated individual stages of fibrosis with high performance. Sensitivity ranged from 81.4% to 100% and specificity ranged from 75.0% to 97.2%. When we compared LSM values for the same stage of fibrosis, they varied according to the different etiologies. Higher values were in AIH (16.15 +- 7.23 kPa) compared to Wilson disease (8.30 +- 0.84 kPa) and HCV groups (7.43 +- 1.73 kPa). Multiple regression analysis revealed that Ishak fibrosis stage was the only independent variable associated with higher LSM (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: TE appears reliable in distinguishing different stages of liver fibrosis in children. However, its values vary according to the disease type. For that, a disease-specific estimation of cut-off values for fibrosis staging is worthy.",

A multiplex PCR-based NGS assay to identify mutations in the ATP7B gene for routine molecular diagnosis of Wilson disease was evaluated in comparison with the gold standard direct Sanger sequencing. DESIGN AND METHODS: Five multiplex PCRs to amplify the partial promoter, 5' untranslated and the entire coding regions of the ATP7B gene were designed. Indexed paired-end libraries were generated from the pooled amplicons using Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation Kit and subjected to NGS on the MiSeq platform. DNA from the peripheral blood of 12 patients with Wilson disease, 2 B-lymphocyte cell lines and 3 external quality assurance samples were sequenced by the MiSeq and Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: Complete coverage was achieved across the targeted bases without any drop-out sequences. The observed read depth in a single run with 20 samples was >100X. Comparison of the NGS results against Sanger sequencing data on a panel of clinical specimens, cell lines and European Molecular Genetics Quality Networks (EMQN) quality assurance samples showed 100% concordance in identifying pathogenic mutations. CONCLUSION: With the capability of generating relatively higher throughput in a short time period, the NGS assay is a viable alternative to Sanger sequencing for detecting ATP7B mutations causally linked to Wilson disease in the clinical diagnostic laboratory.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: The earliest characteristic alterations of the liver pathology in Wilson disease (WD) include steatosis, which is sometimes indistinguishable from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Steatosis in WD may reflect copper-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. A genetic polymorphism in rs738409, in the patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3 gene (PNPLA3), is strongly associated with appearance of in NAFLD. This study evaluated the role of PNPLA3 and hepatic copper content for development of steatosis in patients with WD. METHODS: Liver biopsies obtained at diagnosis and the PNPLA3 genotype were analyzed in 98 Caucasian patients with WD (male: 52 [53.1%]; mean age: 27.6 years [CI 95%: 24.8-30.4, range: 5.8-61.5]). Steatosis was graded as percentage of lipid containing hepatocytes by an expert hepatopathologist unaware of the results of genetic testing. RESULTS: Moderate/severe steatosis (>33% of hepatocytes) was observed in 28 patients (pediatric: n=13/26 [50.0%], adult: n=15/72 [20.8%]; p=0.01). Forty-six patients (46.9%; pediatric: n=7, adult: n=39; p=0.022) had cirrhosis. Multivariate logistic regression identified PNPLA3 G allele (OR: 2.469, CI 95%: 1.203-5.068; p=0.014) and pediatric age (OR: 4.348; 1.577-11.905; p=0.004) as independent variables associated with moderate/severe steatosis. In contrast, hepatic copper content did not impact on moderate/severe steatosis (OR: 1.000, CI 95%: 1.000-1.001; p=0.297). CONCLUSIONS: Steatosis is common in WD and the PNPLA3 G allele contributes to its pathogenesis. The role of hepatic copper concentration and ATP7B mutations in steatosis development deserve further investigations.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Wilson disease (WD) may present from early childhood up to the eighth decade, presenting with variable hepatic and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Establishing the diagnosis is straightforward if the major clinical and laboratory features are present. However, clinical phenotypes are highly varied and early, proper diagnosis can be challenging. AIM: The aim of our study was to analyze clinical presentations and diagnostic tests of Polish pediatric patients with WD. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed medical history of 156 patients with confirmed diagnosis of WD treated at our Institute from 1996 till March 2016. RESULTS: The mean age at onset of symptoms was 10.15+-4.23 years of age. Hepatic presentation was the most common one (94.23%) with either liver failure (16.03%) or more frequently increased transaminases (78.2%). In 90.26% cases ceruloplasmin serum concentration was <=0,2 g/l, in 51.93% patients basal urinary copper excretion was >100 mug/24 h. Mutation analysis was performed in 155 (99.36%) cases. The most common mutation was p.H1069Q. CONCLUSIONS: Wilson disease can present with only significantly increased transaminases activity and hepatomegaly or liver failure, but neurological symptoms are very rare in children. Diagnostic approach is challenging due to wide spectrum of clinical presentations in a high variable degree of severity. Genetic screening is supportive, ceruloplasmin and urinary copper excretion are valuable tests in the majority of patients but do not allow to exclude WD.",

We report the vulnerability of liver, kidney and brain to different dose of copper sulfate (CuSO4) induced oxidative stress at different time duration. Fifty-four male Wistar rats (weight range=205+-10g) were equally divided into three groups. CuSO4 was administered orally to the experimental groups (Group-II and III) up to 90 days in a dose of 100 and 200mg/Kg body weight per day. Saline water was given to the control group (Group-I). At the end of 30, 60 and 90 days of administration, neurobehavioral studies were done and six rats from each group were sacrificed. Their liver, kidney and brain tissues were subjected for Cu, glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) assay. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine, bilirubin and transaminases were measured. GSH, TAC and MDA levels were correlated with the markers of respective organ dysfunction. Administration of CuSO4 resulted in increased free Cu and MDA level, and decrease GSH and TAC levels in group-II and III compared with group-I. In experimental groups, the reduction in TAC and GSH levels was maximum in liver tissue followed by brain and kidney; whereas increase in MDA level was highest in liver followed by brain and kidney at 30, 60 and 90 days. TAC and GSH levels in the liver inversely correlated with serum transaminases and bilirubin, and tissue free Cu, and positively correlated with MDA levels. Free Cu level in kidney tissue and BUN inversely correlated with TAC and GSH, and positively with MDA level. Grip-strength, rotarod and Y-maze findings were inversely correlated with brain free Cu and MDA levels and positively with GSH and TAC levels. The oxidative stress was highest in liver followed by brain and kidney after oral CuSO4 exposure in a rat model. These levels correlated with the respective organ dysfunction and tissue free Cu concentration.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: In recent years, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, which enable high throughput sample processing at relatively lower costs, are adopted in both research and clinical settings. A multiplex PCR-based NGS assay to identify mutations in the ATP7B gene for routine molecular diagnosis of Wilson disease was evaluated in comparison with the gold standard direct Sanger sequencing. DESIGN AND METHODS: Five multiplex PCRs to amplify the partial promoter, 5' untranslated and the entire coding regions of the ATP7B gene were designed. Indexed paired-end libraries were generated from the pooled amplicons using Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation Kit and subjected to NGS on the MiSeq platform. DNA from the peripheral blood of 12 patients with Wilson disease, 2 B-lymphocyte cell lines and 3 external quality assurance samples were sequenced by the MiSeq and Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: Complete coverage was achieved across the targeted bases without any drop-out sequences. The observed read depth in a single run with 20 samples was >100X. Comparison of the NGS results against Sanger sequencing data on a panel of clinical specimens, cell lines and European Molecular Genetics Quality Networks (EMQN) quality assurance samples showed 100% concordance in identifying pathogenic mutations. CONCLUSION: With the capability of generating relatively higher throughput in a short time period, the NGS assay is a viable alternative to Sanger sequencing for detecting ATP7B mutations causally linked to Wilson disease in the clinical diagnostic laboratory.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Liver transplantation (LT) has emerged as a lifesaving modality for many liver diseases in children. Pediatric LT is an established treatment in the Western world but is relatively a new procedure in resource-limited countries like Pakistan. The study aims to highlight the outcomes and survival of pediatric recipients from the first pediatric liver transplant center in Pakistan. METHOD: A retrospective analysis of pediatric LT was done from 2012 to 2019. The study was conducted in the Hepatobiliary and liver transplant department of Shifa International Hospital (SIH), Islamabad. A detailed analysis for indications for pediatric LT, survival, and complications was done. RESULTS: Forty-five patients under 18 years of age underwent Living donor liver transplant (LDLT) in SIH. Median age was 9 years and M:F of 2:1. Cryptogenic liver disease followed by Wilson disease were the two most common indications of LT. The majority of patients had chronic liver disease 34 (75%) while 11 (24%) had acute liver failure. The right lobe graft was the most common type of graft 19 (42.2%). Thirty days, 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival was 77.8%, 75.6%, 73.3%, and 60.6% respectively. Mortality was highest in patients with biliary atresia 4 (33%). Causes of death included pulmonary embolism, sepsis, surgical complications, and acute kidney injury. Mean survival was 88.850 months (+-7.899) (CI 73.369-104.331). CONCLUSION: Pediatric LDLT has offered disease-free survival for patients. Survival can improve further with nutritional rehabilitation and anticipation and management of post-operative complications.",

                    "abstract": "The normal functioning of brain is intimately as well as intricately interrelated with normal functioning of the liver. Liver plays a critical role of not only providing vital nutrients to the brain but also of detoxifying the splanchnic blood. Compromised liver function leads to insufficient detoxification thus allowing neurotoxins (such as ammonia, manganese, and other chemicals) to enter the cerebral circulation. In addition, portosystemic shunts, which are common accompaniments of advanced liver disease, facilitate free passage of neurotoxins into the cerebral circulation. The problem is compounded further by additional variables such as gastrointestinal tract bleeding, malnutrition, and concurrent renal failure, which are often associated with liver cirrhosis. Neurologic damage in chronic liver disease and liver cirrhosis seems to be multifactorial primarily attributable to the following: brain accumulation of ammonia, manganese, and lactate; altered permeability of the blood-brain barrier; recruitment of monocytes after microglial activation; and neuroinflammation, that is, direct effects of circulating systemic proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor, IL-1beta, and IL-6. Radiologist should be aware of the conundrum of neurologic complications that can be encountered in liver disease, which include hepatic encephalopathy, hepatocerebral degeneration, hepatic myelopathy, cirrhosis-related parkinsonism, cerebral infections, hemorrhage, and osmotic demyelination. In addition, neurologic complications can be exclusive to certain disorders, for example, Wilson disease, alcoholism (Wernicke encephalopathy, alcoholic cerebellar degeneration, Marchiafava-Bignami disease, etc). Radiologist should be aware of their varied clinical presentation and radiological appearances as the diagnosis is not always straightforward. ",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The severity of Wilson's disease (WD) is linked to free copper accumulating in the liver and brain. Exchangeable copper (CuEXC) is a new technique to determine plasmatic copper and is useful in the diagnosis of WD. It is hypothesized that it may also enable a good evaluation of extra-hepatic involvement and its severity. METHODS: Forty-eight newly diagnosed WD patients were prospectively evaluated using hepatic, neurological, ophthalmological and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scores. Three phenotypic presentations were distinguished: pre-symptomatic, hepatic and extra-hepatic. CuEXC was determined in addition to standard copper assays before decoppering therapy. Correlations between biological parameters and the different scores were determined and compared in the hepatic and extra-hepatic groups. RESULTS: Extra-hepatic patients had significantly higher CuEXC values than those with the hepatic form (P < 0.0001). The overall ability of CuEXC to separate the two forms was satisfactory, with an area under the curve of 0.883 (95% confidence interval 0.771-0.996) and an optimal threshold for extra-hepatic diagnosis of 2.08 mumol/l (sensitivity 85.7%; specificity 94.1%). In extra-hepatic patients, CuEXC was the only biological marker to be positively correlated with the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Score (r = 0.45, P = 0.016), the Kayser-Fleischer ring score (r = 0.46, P = 0.014) and the brain MRI score (r = 0.38, P = 0.048), but it was not correlated with the hepatic score. CONCLUSIONS: Exchangeable copper determination is useful when diagnosing WD as a value >2.08 mumol/l is indicative of the severity of the extra-hepatic involvement. In the case of purely hepatic presentation, atypical or mild neurological signs, it should encourage physicians to search for lesions in the brain and eyes.",

We report the vulnerability of liver, kidney and brain to different dose of copper sulfate (CuSO4) induced oxidative stress at different time duration. Fifty-four male Wistar rats (weight range=205+-10g) were equally divided into three groups. CuSO4 was administered orally to the experimental groups (Group-II and III) up to 90 days in a dose of 100 and 200mg/Kg body weight per day. Saline water was given to the control group (Group-I). At the end of 30, 60 and 90 days of administration, neurobehavioral studies were done and six rats from each group were sacrificed. Their liver, kidney and brain tissues were subjected for Cu, glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) assay. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine, bilirubin and transaminases were measured. GSH, TAC and MDA levels were correlated with the markers of respective organ dysfunction. Administration of CuSO4 resulted in increased free Cu and MDA level, and decrease GSH and TAC levels in group-II and III compared with group-I. In experimental groups, the reduction in TAC and GSH levels was maximum in liver tissue followed by brain and kidney; whereas increase in MDA level was highest in liver followed by brain and kidney at 30, 60 and 90 days. TAC and GSH levels in the liver inversely correlated with serum transaminases and bilirubin, and tissue free Cu, and positively correlated with MDA levels. Free Cu level in kidney tissue and BUN inversely correlated with TAC and GSH, and positively with MDA level.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: In Wilson Disease (WD), copper accumulates in the liver and brain causing disease. Bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) is a potent copper chelator that may be associated with a lower risk of inducing paradoxical neurological worsening than conventional therapy for neurologic WD. To better understand the mode of action of TTM, we investigated its effects on copper absorption and biliary excretion. METHODS: In a double-blind randomized setting, hepatic 64Cu activity was examined after orally administered 64Cu by PET/CT in 16 healthy volunteers before and after seven days of TTM treatment (15 mg/d) or placebo. Oral 64Cu was administered one hour after the final TTM dose. Changes in hepatic 64Cu activity reflected changes in intestinal 64Cu uptake. Additionally, in four patients with WD, the distribution of 64Cu in venous blood, liver, gallbladder, kidney, and brain was followed after i.v. 64Cu dosing for up to 68 hours before and after seven days of TTM (15 mg/day), using PET/MRI. Increased gallbladder 64Cu activity was taken as evidence of increased biliary 64Cu excretion. RESULTS: In healthy volunteers, TTM reduced intestinal 64Cu uptake by 82% 15 hours after the oral 64Cu dose. In patients with WD, gallbladder 64Cu activity was negligible before and after TTM, while TTM effectively retained 64Cu in the blood, significantly reduced hepatic 64Cu activity at all time-points and significantly reduced cerebral 64Cu activity two hours after the intravenous 64Cu dose. CONCLUSIONS: While we did not show an increase in biliary excretion of 64Cu following TTM administration, we demonstrated that TTM effectively inhibited most intestinal 64Cu uptake and retained 64Cu in the blood stream, limiting the exposure of 64Cu to organs like the liver and the brain. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: Bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) is an investigational copper chelator being developed for the treatment of Wilson disease. In animal models of Wilson disease, TTM has been shown to facilitate biliary copper excretion. In the present human study, TTM surprisingly did not facilitate biliary copper excretion but instead reduced intestinal copper uptake to a clinically significant degree. Our study builds on our understanding of human copper metabolism and the mechanism of action of TTM.",

Their main mode of action is thought to be through the facilitation of urinary copper excretion. In a recent study, TRI was noninferior to PEN despite lower 24-hour urinary copper excretion than PEN. We tested whether TRI and/or PEN also inhibit intestinal copper absorption. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Sixteen healthy volunteers were examined with positron emission tomography (PET)/CT 1 and 15 hours after an oral Copper-64 ( 64 Cu) dose. They then received 7 days of either PEN or TRI (trientine tetrahydrochloride), after which the 64 Cu PET/CT scans were repeated. Venous blood samples were also collected. Pretreatment to posttreatment changes of the hepatic 64 Cu uptake reflect the effect of drugs on intestinal absorption. 64 Cu activity was normalized to dose and body weight and expressed as the mean standard uptake value. TRI (n=8) reduced hepatic 64 Cu activity 1 hour after 64 Cu dose from 6.17 (4.73) to 1.47 (2.97) standard uptake value, p <0.02, and after 15 hours from 14.24 (3.09) to 6.19 (3.43), p <0.02, indicating strong inhibition of intestinal 64 Cu absorption. PEN (n=8) slightly reduced hepatic standard uptake value at 15 hours, from 16.30 (5.63) to 12.17 (1.44), p <0.04. CONCLUSIONS: In this mechanistic study, we show that TRI inhibits intestinal copper absorption, in addition to its cupriuretic effect. In contrast, PEN has modest effects on the intestinal copper absorption. This may explain why TRI and PEN are equally effective although urinary copper excretion is lower with TRI. The study questions whether the same therapeutic targets for 24-hour urinary excretion apply to both drugs.",

Predictors of such deterioration have not been evaluated. This study documents frequency and predictors of deterioration following treatment in WD. METHODS: 59 consecutive patients with neurologic WD and 4 asymptomatic siblings were prospectively evaluated. Their clinical, laboratory, ultrasound abdomen and cranial MRI findings with and without worsening were compared. Patients were treated with oral penicillamine and/or zinc and followed up at 1, 3 and 6 months or earlier if needed. Deterioration was defined by >10% worsening in baseline Burke-Fahn-Marsden score or appearance of new neurological sign. RESULTS: Patients' median age was 13 years and 13 were females. 19 patients (30.2%) worsened following treatment; 10 within 1 month, 7 in 1-3 months, and 2 after 3 months of treatment. Deterioration was associated with drooling, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly and evidence of chronic liver disease. None of the asymptomatic patients following zinc therapy deteriorated. CONCLUSIONS: In the deteriorating group, withdrawal of penicillamine resulted in improvement/stabilization in 11 patients, 2 improved by trientine therapy and 4 continued to deteriorate till 3 months. 30.2% patients with WD deteriorated following penicillamine, especially those with chronic liver disease, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia.",

The disease expression is highly variable, ranging from totally asymptomatic subjects to patients with severe liver disease or movement disorders. Thus, it is difficult to define in which patient Wilson disease has to be considered as diagnosis. The suspicion should be high in patients presenting with extrapyramidal disorders or with liver diseases or of unknown origin. For diagnosis, in many patients a combination of tests reflecting disturbed copper metabolism may be needed. Not a single test is per se specific and, thus, a range of tests has to be applied (presence or absence of Kayser-Fleischer rings or neurologic symptoms, serum ceruloplasmin, liver copper content, urinary copper excretion, mutation analysis; rated -1 to 4 depending on the test) and clinical symptoms. A diagnostic sum score of >= 4 confirms the diagnosis.",

In this study, we evaluated the histopathologic findings of explanted livers in Wilson disease, with special emphasis on copper histochemistry. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study group was recruited by reviewing archived histopathology reports and the liver transplant clinic patient records retrospectively for patients who had liver transplant for Wilson disease between January 2010 and June 2015, at Turgut Ozal Medical Center. Archival slides were reevaluated. When needed, relevant clinical and laboratory data were obtained from patient medical records. RESULTS: During the selected period, there were 33 patients fitting the study criteria (22 male, 11 female, mean age of 22 +- 11 y). All patients had mild to moderate septal inflammation. We found that 29 patients (88%) showed glycogenated hepatocyte nuclei and 27 patients (79%) showed nuclear pleomorphism. Other histopathologic findings were cholestasis (48%) and macrovesicular steatosis (39%). There was no special finding in hilar regions except for 2 patients who had recanalized portal vein thrombosis. In terms of copper histochemistry, 2 copper stains, Timm silver sulfide and rhodanine, were performed in all cases, with orcein staining only done for 25 of the cases. Positivity rates for these copper stains were 85%, 82%, and 36%. Periodic acid-Schiff-diastase- and periodic acid-Schiff-positive granules were detected in 7 of 33 patients (21%). Iron deposition was seen in 12 patients (focal and/or minimal in 11, more than focal in 1). There was no dysplasia or malignancy in any of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: On routine hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides, detection of glycogenated hepatocyte nuclei and the finding of the nuclear pleomorphism should alert the pathologist for the possibility of Wilson disease, especially with cryptogenic liver disease.

Neurologic diseases related to disorders of metabolism of copper and iron are reviewed. Copper disorders are divided into two classes: ATP7A- or ATP7B-related inherited copper transport disorders (Menkes disease, occipital horn syndrome, ATP7A-related distal motor neuropathy, and Wilson disease) and acquired diseases associated with copper deficiency or copper excess. Iron brain disorders are divided into genetic neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA, neuroferritinopathy, and aceruloplasminemia), genetic systemic iron accumulation with neurologic features (hemochromatosis), and acquired diseases associated with iron excess (superficial siderosis) or iron deficiency (restless leg syndrome). The main features of cadmium, lead, aluminum, mercury, and manganese toxicity are summarized. ",

Here, we describe a 45-year-old woman who presented with an incidental hepatocellular carcinoma at the time of transplant. The patient had severe neurologic manifestations of Wilson disease pretransplant, including dysarthria, hyperreflexia, asymmetrical ataxia, tremor, bradyphrenia, and shuffling gait. She underwent successful transplant from a hepatic and surgical standpoint, but her postoperative course was marked by protracted mutism, hypophonia, and fluctuating akinesia and immobility that did not respond promptly to withdrawal of calcineurin inhibitors or pramipexole but did respond robustly to amantadine. At 9 months posttransplant, there was marked neurologic improvement, and, at 18 months, she exhibited subtle memory and organizational difficulties but was fully ambulatory and otherwise completely functional. Our experience suggests that even patients with severe neurologic Wilson disease may recover after transplant, albeit slowly, demonstrating the need for a multidisciplinary approach, including pre- and posttransplant neurologic and neuropsychiatric consultations.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Wilson disease is caused by pathogenic variants in the ATP7B gene which encodes a copper-transporting ATPase. AIMS: Describe a common founder pathogenic variant among Bukharan Jews and to assess its prevalence, clinical features, and outcome. METHODS: The cohort consisted of patients of Bukharan Jewish descent diagnosed with Wilson disease at a tertiary pediatric medical center in 2013-2018. Clinical and genetic data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Six patients from 4 unrelated families who were homozygous for the c.3784G>T p.(Val1262Phe) pathogenic variant in ATP7B were identified. Five presented with elevated aminotransferase levels, and one, with acute liver failure. Mean age at diagnosis was 8.7 years (5-12.5). Serum ceruloplasmin level was extremely low in all patients (1.9-7 mg/dL; mean 3.2(. The variant was identified in a heterozygous state in 5/153 Bukharan Jews; 2/33 from our local exome database and 3/120 healthy unrelated Bukharan Jews in another cohort, for an estimated carrier frequency of ~1:30. CONCLUSIONS: We report a common founder pathogenic variant in the ATP7B gene among Bukharan Jews associated with severe early-onset Wilson disease. Given the clinical severity, high frequency of the variant, and being a treatable disease, its inclusion in pre-symptomatic screening in the Bukharan Jewish community should be considered. Furthermore, WD should be part of future genetic newborn screening programs in Israel and worldwide, to enable early treatment and prevention of future life-threatening complications.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To assess the serum fetuin A concentration as a potential marker of subclinical atherosclerosis in obese children with NAFLD. MATERIAL/METHODS: A prospective analysis of 45 obese children initially diagnosed with liver pathology (elevated serum ALT activity and/or ultrasonographic liver brightness and/or hepatomegaly) was conducted. The diagnosis of NAFLD was established in the children with elevated serum ALT activity and liver steatosis on ultrasound examination. Viral hepatitis, autoimmune, metabolic liver diseases (Wilson disease, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, cystic fibrosis) and drug and toxin-induced liver injury were excluded in all children. The degree of liver steatosis was graded according to Saverymuttu scale and the total liver lipids concentration was assessed using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS). RESULTS: Serum fetuin A concentration was significantly higher in examined children compared to the control group (n=30) (p=0.00002). Higher serum fetuin A concentration was also observed in children with NAFLD (n=19) in comparison to the controls (p=0.000026). Additionally, higher BMI values, waist circumferences, ALT and GGT activity, intensity of liver steatosis on ultrasound and total concentration of lipids in the liver in (1)H MRS were found in children with NAFLD compared to the rest of the examined obese patients (n=26). There was not found any correlation of the investigated glycoprotein with any other assessed parameters both in children with NAFLD and obese children without NAFLD. CONCLUSION: Higher serum fetuin A concentration found in children with NAFLD compared to the control group support the hypothesis that atherosclerotic processes may develop faster in hepatopatic obese patients.",

METHODS: Included liver histology and relevant biochemical analyses including hepatic copper quantification, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) liver levels, qPCR for transcript levels of genes relevant to methionine metabolism and liver damage, and DNA dot blot for global DNA methylation. RESULTS: Hepatic copper was lower in tx-j fetuses but higher in weanling (three weeks) and adult tx-j mice compared to controls. S-adenosylhomocysteinase transcript levels were significantly lower at all time points, except at three weeks, correlating negatively with copper levels and with consequent changes in the SAM:SAH methylation ratio and global DNA methylation. CONCLUSION: Compared to controls, methionine metabolism including S-adenosylhomocysteinase gene expression is persistently different in the tx-j mice with consequent alterations in global DNA methylation in more advanced stages of liver disease. The inhibitory effect of copper accumulation on S-adenosylhomocysteinase expression is associated with progressively abnormal methionine metabolism and decreased methylation capacity and DNA global methylation.",

                    "abstract": "AIMS: In Wilson disease (WD), T2/T2*-weighted (T2*w) MRI frequently shows hypointensity in the basal ganglia that is suggestive of paramagnetic deposits. It is currently unknown whether this hypointensity is related to copper or iron deposition. We examined the neuropathological correlates of this MRI pattern, particularly in relation to iron and copper concentrations. METHODS: Brain slices from nine WD and six control cases were investigated using a 7T-MRI system. High-resolution T2*w images were acquired and R2* parametric maps were reconstructed using a multigradient recalled echo sequence. R2* was measured in the globus pallidus (GP) and the putamen. Corresponding histopathological sections containing the lentiform nucleus were examined using Turnbull iron staining, and double staining combining Turnbull with immunohistochemistry for macrophages or astrocytes. Quantitative densitometry of the iron staining as well as copper and iron concentrations were measured in the GP and putamen and correlated with R2* values. RESULTS: T2*w hypointensity in the GP and/or putamen was apparent in WD cases and R2* values correlated with quantitative densitometry of iron staining. In WD, iron and copper concentrations were increased in the putamen compared to controls. R2* was correlated with the iron concentration in the GP and putamen, whereas no correlation was observed for the copper concentration. Patients with more pronounced pathological severity in the putamen displayed increased iron concentration, which correlated with an elevated number of iron-containing macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: T2/T2*w hypointensity observed in vivo in the basal ganglia of WD patients is related to iron rather than copper deposits.",

RESULTS: Hepatic copper was lower in tx-j fetuses but higher in weanling (three weeks) and adult tx-j mice compared to controls. S-adenosylhomocysteinase transcript levels were significantly lower at all time points, except at three weeks, correlating negatively with copper levels and with consequent changes in the SAM:SAH methylation ratio and global DNA methylation. CONCLUSION: Compared to controls, methionine metabolism including S-adenosylhomocysteinase gene expression is persistently different in the tx-j mice with consequent alterations in global DNA methylation in more advanced stages of liver disease. The inhibitory effect of copper accumulation on S-adenosylhomocysteinase expression is associated with progressively abnormal methionine metabolism and decreased methylation capacity and DNA global methylation.",

                    "abstract": "AIM: To evaluate transient elastography (TE) as a noninvasive tool in staging liver fibrosis compared with liver biopsy and morphometry in children with different chronic liver diseases. METHODS: A total of 90 children [50 with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV), 20 with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and 20 with Wilson disease] were included in the study and underwent liver stiffness measurement (LSM) using TE. Liver biopsies were evaluated for fibrosis, qualitatively, by Ishak score and quantitatively by fibrosis area fraction (FAF) using digital image analysis (morphometry). LSM was correlated with fibrosis and other studied variables using spearman correlation. A stepwise multiple regression analysis was also performed to examine independent factors associated with LSM. Different cut-off values of LSM were calculated for predicting individual fibrosis stages using receiver-operating characteristic curve. Cut-off values with optimal clinical performance (optimal sensitivity and specificity simultaneously) were selected. RESULTS: The majority of HCV group had minimal activity (80%) and no/mild fibrosis (72%). On the other hand, the majority of AIH group had mild to moderate activity (70%) and moderate to severe fibrosis (95%) and all Wilson disease group had mild to moderate activity (100%) and moderate to severe fibrosis (100%). LSM correlated significantly with both FAF and Ishak scores and the correlation appeared better with the latter (r = 0.839 vs 0.879, P < 0.0001 for both). LSM discriminated individual stages of fibrosis with high performance. Sensitivity ranged from 81.4% to 100% and specificity ranged from 75.0% to 97.2%. When we compared LSM values for the same stage of fibrosis, they varied according to the different etiologies. Higher values were in AIH (16.15 +- 7.23 kPa) compared to Wilson disease (8.30 +- 0.84 kPa) and HCV groups (7.43 +- 1.73 kPa). Multiple regression analysis revealed that Ishak fibrosis stage was the only independent variable associated with higher LSM (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: TE appears reliable in distinguishing different stages of liver fibrosis in children. However, its values vary according to the disease type. For that, a disease-specific estimation of cut-off values for fibrosis staging is worthy.",

Although rare, it can cause toxicity, which is demonstrated by cholestatic liver injury. Here, we present a case of a young male patient who was diagnosed with Wilson disease, had penicillaminechelating therapy, and underwent living related liver transplant. Within 1 month posttransplant, he developed deranged, predominantly cholestatic pattern liver function tests. Laboratory parameters showed total bilirubin of 1.12 mg/ dL, alanine aminotransferase of 553 IU/L, gammaglutamyltransferase of 624 IU/L, and tacrolimus level of 10.2 ng/mL. After thorough evaluation, a liver biopsy was performed. Liver biopsy showed hepatocellular necrosis with centrilobular cholestasis without any evidence of graft rejection. However, with normal level of tacrolimus, the biopsy was suggestive of drug-induced liver injury. Thus, tacrolimus dose was reduced, resulting in improved liver function tests and patient discharge from the hospital. Tacrolimus is an effective immunosuppressant after liver transplant and has the ability to treat early acute rejection. The patient's liver biopsy showed hepatocellular necrosis with centrilobular cholestasis without any evidence of graft rejection. Cholestatic liver injury after tacrolimus usually resolves after dose reduction or by switching to another agent. With demonstrated tacrolimus-induced toxicity in liver transplant recipients, despite normal serum levels, transplant physicians should keep high index of suspicion regarding toxicity in the posttransplant setting.",

Hemolytic anemia in WD occurs in up to 17% of patients at some point during their illness. AIM: To screen for WD among children presenting with hemolytic anemia. METHODOLOGY: Twenty cases (mean age, 8.8 +- 3.9 y) with Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia, attending the hematology clinic of children hospital, Cairo University, were screened for WD by serum ceruloplasmin level, 24 hours urinary copper before and after D-penicillamine challenge test, and slit-lamp examination for detecting Kayser-Fleischer rings. RESULTS: No case had low ceruloplasmin, whereas bilateral Kayser-Fleischer rings was detected in 5% of our cases. Urinary copper was elevated in 5% before and in 40% after D-penicillamine challenge test. According to the scoring system used, 1 case had definite WD and 7 cases were likely to have WD. These 8 (40%) cases were referred to as group B. Group B had a significantly lower hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and reticulocytes (P=0.04, 0.001, 0.04, and 0.04, respectively) and a significantly higher urinary copper after penicillamine (P=0.000) when compared with group A (unlikely WD).

However, the toxic effect of copper on serum aspartate and alanine aminotransferase levels remains to be clarified as a prerequisite for diagnostic tests. The clinical records of 33 cases were analyzed to clarify the natural history of Wilson disease. Phenotypes were simplified into hepatic, acute, and neurologic. The bio-low stage of both enzymes was less than 40 IU/L, the bio-moderate stage was intermediate between 40 and 200 IU/L, and the bio-high stage was more than 200 IU/L of either or both enzymes. Rebounded enzyme levels at the recovery period from anemia were presumed to be the chronic baselines when pre-anemic enzyme levels were not available in the acute phenotype. We investigated whether these enzyme levels may provide information useful for screening patients. The natural history of chronic Wilson disease consisted of the first increasing and second decreasing phases. The clinical courses of a 4-year-old boy and 12-year-old girl were representative of the 2 phases, respectively. All but one patient were in the decreasing phase. Negative correlations were obtained between age and enzyme level in the decreasing phase. The hepatic phenotype may be a prototype found throughout the 2 phases, and acute and neurologic phenotypes may be major complications in the bio-moderate and bio-low stages of the decreasing phase, respectively. Biochemical staging may provide a better understanding of Wilson disease when combined with phenotypes. Bio-high stage patients should be referred to a medical center for diagnosis.",

Methods: Forty patients with WD, including 20 with cerebral type and 20 with hepatic type, and 20 age-matched healthy controls in the First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University between Jul 2013 and May 2016 were enrolled.All study subjects underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) of the brain.Six regions of interest (ROIs) were chosen.The values of fractional anisotropy (FA), lambda in ROIs were determined on DTI, FA and fiber volumes between ROIs were also determined on DTI.The values of amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and regional homogeneity (REHO) in ROIs were determined on rs-fMRI.The values of corrected phase (CP) were calculated on SWI.The copper and iron content were measured.The difference of imaging and metal metrics between cerebral type and hepatic type WD were evaluated. Results: DTI metrics differed between patients with the cerebral and hepatic types of WD.ALFF values in the caudate nucleus, and thalamus were lower (P=0.037, 0.040), and REHO values in the caudate nucleus were lower (P=0.029), in patients of cerebral type than in hepatic type patients.CP values of the right caudate nucleus and left putamen in cerebral type WD patients were lower than in hepatic type patients (P=0.020, 0.23). The serum iron content of hepatic type WD patients was higher than the normal (P=0.013), and the urine copper content was higher than the cerebral type patients (P=0.021). Conclusions: Metal deposition and damage to the structure and functional activity in the brain may occur in hepatic type WD patients.The structural and functional activity damage of the brain in hepatic type is less severe than that in cerebral type patients, while the metal deposition is not significant different between hepatic and cerebral type.",

However, WD is usually prone to neglect and misdiagnosis at an early stage. We reported a rare WD pedigree, and the clinical features, laboratory tests, and gene mutations were analyzed in detail. PATIENT CONCERNS: The patient was a 17-year-old and 136-cm-tall girl who presented with limb weakness, combined with multi-organ disorders including blind eye, epilepsy, and hypopituitarism. DIAGNOSES: Clinical tests showed a low serum ceruloplasmin level, high urinary copper excretion and Kayser-Fleischer (K-F) rings. She carried a compound heterozygous mutations in ATP7B gene (c.2828G>A and c.3884C>T). Her younger brother, as an asymptomatic patient, manifested with elevation of transaminases but without neurological and hepatic symptoms. They were diagnosed as WD finally. INTERVENTIONS: They were treated with sodium dimercaptosulphonate, supplemented with zinc gluconate, vitamin B6, vitamin C, as well as restriction of dietary copper. OUTCOMES: The urinary copper excretion and serum transaminase level decreased gradually. The abnormal signals in brainstem and basal ganglia were also remarkably decreased after 4-year of de-copper treatment. LESSONS: As to the patients with complicated clinical manifestations, the extrapyramidal symptom and basal ganglia signals should be concerned. The serum ceruloplasmin detection and ATP7B gene mutation screening are necessary.",

The study describes the development and validation of a novel assay termed circulating single-molecule amplification and resequencing technology (cSMART) for counting single allelic molecules in plasma. Here we demonstrate the suitability of cSMART for NIPT, with Wilson Disease (WD) as proof of concept. METHODS: We used Sanger and whole-exome sequencing to identify familial ATP7B (ATPase, Cu(++) transporting, beta polypeptide) gene mutations. For cSMART, single molecules were tagged with unique barcodes and circularized, and alleles were targeted and replicated by inverse PCR. The unique single allelic molecules were identified by sequencing and counted, and the percentage of mutant alleles in the original maternal plasma sample was used to determine fetal genotypes. RESULTS: Four families with WD pedigrees consented to the study. Using Sanger and whole-exome sequencing, we mapped the pathogenic ATP7B mutations in each pedigree and confirmed the proband's original diagnosis of WD. After validation of cSMART with defined plasma models mimicking fetal inheritance of paternal, maternal, or both parental mutant alleles, we retrospectively showed in second pregnancies that the fetal genotypes assigned by invasive testing and NIPT were concordant. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a reliable and accurate NIPT assay that correctly diagnosed the fetal genotypes in 4 pregnancies at risk for WD. This novel technology has potential as a universal strategy for NIPT of other monogenic disorders, since it requires only knowledge of the parental pathogenic mutations.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study enrolled 30 WD patients and 20 age-matched healthy controls. Neurological symptoms were scored using the modified Young Scale. The hepatic function indices, serum and urinary copper content, and serum iron content were determined. All study objects received the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and SWI test of the brain. The values of corrected phase (CP) were calculated on SWI. The relationship between CP values and the clinical status were evaluated. RESULTS: The serum iron content of WD patients was higher than the normal. The CP values of substantia nigra, caudate nucleus, and globus pallidus of WD were lower than the normal values, while the CP value of substantia nigra was the lowest. No correlations were determined between the CP values and the iron and copper parameters. There was negative correlation between the scores of dysarthria and the CP values of the globus pallidus. There was negative correlation between the scores of tremor and the CP values of caudate nucleus. Some regions, which had high signals on T2-weighted image, had low signals on SWI. CONCLUSIONS: There might be abnormal iron metabolism in patients with WD. The decreased CP values might reflect a deposition of both copper and iron. SWI may be more sensitive than the ordinary MRI. The mineral deposition may contribute to the neural symptoms.",

The suspicion should be high in patients presenting with extrapyramidal disorders or with liver diseases or of unknown origin. For diagnosis, in many patients a combination of tests reflecting disturbed copper metabolism may be needed. Not a single test is per se specific and, thus, a range of tests has to be applied (presence or absence of Kayser-Fleischer rings or neurologic symptoms, serum ceruloplasmin, liver copper content, urinary copper excretion, mutation analysis; rated -1 to 4 depending on the test) and clinical symptoms.

Hemolytic anemia in WD occurs in up to 17% of patients at some point during their illness. AIM: To screen for WD among children presenting with hemolytic anemia. METHODOLOGY: Twenty cases (mean age, 8.8 +- 3.9 y) with Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia, attending the hematology clinic of children hospital, Cairo University, were screened for WD by serum ceruloplasmin level, 24 hours urinary copper before and after D-penicillamine challenge test, and slit-lamp examination for detecting Kayser-Fleischer rings. RESULTS: No case had low ceruloplasmin, whereas bilateral Kayser-Fleischer rings was detected in 5% of our cases. Urinary copper was elevated in 5% before and in 40% after D-penicillamine challenge test. According to the scoring system used, 1 case had definite WD and 7 cases were likely to have WD. These 8 (40%) cases were referred to as group B. Group B had a significantly lower hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and reticulocytes (P=0.04, 0.001, 0.04, and 0.04, respectively) and a significantly higher urinary copper after penicillamine (P=0.000) when compared with group A (unlikely WD). CONCLUSION: WD is not uncommon in children with hemolytic anemia after exclusion of other common causes.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Wilson disease is rare, found in 3 of 100,000 people (0.03%). Ceruloplasmin is often ordered to evaluate liver enzyme elevations. Because Wilson disease often presents before middle-age, the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease recommends screening patients between the ages of 3 and 55 years with liver abnormalities of uncertain cause. We evaluate guideline adherence and the clinical and economic impact of current clinical use of ceruloplasmin. METHODS: We reviewed all ceruloplasmin measurements at a clinical laboratory that serves a large primary care network, specialty clinics, and a 600-bed tertiary referral center between January 1, 2003, and December 12, 2011. RESULTS: Ceruloplasmin was measured 5325 times in 5023 unique patients, resulting in 8 (0.16%) new Wilson disease diagnoses. Ceruloplasmin's positive predictive value was 8.4% (95% confidence interval, 7.7-9.3) and false-positive rate was 98.1% (95% confidence interval, 96.2-99.1). A total of 1109 ceruloplasmin levels (20.8%) were ordered in the 1066 patients aged more than 55 years (none with Wilson disease). A \"shotgun\" approach to liver disease diagnosis was found: Ceruloplasmin was ordered on the same day as hepatitis B (81.0%), hepatitis C (76.0%), autoimmune hepatitis (75.1%), and hemochromatosis (73.1%). Of 424 positive ceruloplasmin results, 91% were not pursued further. CONCLUSIONS: Guideline adherence restricts ceruloplasmin use to a population with a higher pre-test probability of Wilson disease: patients with chronic liver disease aged 3 to 55 years who have been tested for common causes of liver disease. The majority of the serum ceruloplasmin was measured in patients not indicated by the guidelines, resulting in poor test performance and wasted healthcare resources. Our data on ceruloplasmin use could serve as a touchstone for broader discussions on rational clinical decision making.",

The success of tandem mass spectrometry is due to important advances in hardware, software and clinical applications during the last 25 years. MS/MS permits a very rapid measurement of many metabolites in different biological specimens by using filter paper spots or directly on biological fluids. Its use in NBS give us the chance to identify possible treatable metabolic disorders even when asymptomatic and the benefits gained by this type of screening is now recognized worldwide. Today the use of MS/MS for second-tier tests and confirmatory testing is promising especially in the early detection of new disorders such as some lysosomal storage disorders, ADA and PNP SCIDs, X-adrenoleucodistrophy (X-ALD), Wilson disease, guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency (GAMT), and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The new challenge for the future will be reducing the false positive rate by using second-tier tests, avoiding false negative results by using new specific biomarkers and introducing new treatable disorders in NBS programs.",

                    "abstract": "AIM: To evaluate transient elastography (TE) as a noninvasive tool in staging liver fibrosis compared with liver biopsy and morphometry in children with different chronic liver diseases. METHODS: A total of 90 children [50 with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV), 20 with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and 20 with Wilson disease] were included in the study and underwent liver stiffness measurement (LSM) using TE. Liver biopsies were evaluated for fibrosis, qualitatively, by Ishak score and quantitatively by fibrosis area fraction (FAF) using digital image analysis (morphometry). LSM was correlated with fibrosis and other studied variables using spearman correlation. A stepwise multiple regression analysis was also performed to examine independent factors associated with LSM. Different cut-off values of LSM were calculated for predicting individual fibrosis stages using receiver-operating characteristic curve. Cut-off values with optimal clinical performance (optimal sensitivity and specificity simultaneously) were selected. RESULTS: The majority of HCV group had minimal activity (80%) and no/mild fibrosis (72%). On the other hand, the majority of AIH group had mild to moderate activity (70%) and moderate to severe fibrosis (95%) and all Wilson disease group had mild to moderate activity (100%) and moderate to severe fibrosis (100%). LSM correlated significantly with both FAF and Ishak scores and the correlation appeared better with the latter (r = 0.839 vs 0.879, P < 0.0001 for both). LSM discriminated individual stages of fibrosis with high performance. Sensitivity ranged from 81.4% to 100% and specificity ranged from 75.0% to 97.2%. When we compared LSM values for the same stage of fibrosis, they varied according to the different etiologies. Higher values were in AIH (16.15 +- 7.23 kPa) compared to Wilson disease (8.30 +- 0.84 kPa) and HCV groups (7.43 +- 1.73 kPa). Multiple regression analysis revealed that Ishak fibrosis stage was the only independent variable associated with higher LSM (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: TE appears reliable in distinguishing different stages of liver fibrosis in children. However, its values vary according to the disease type. For that, a disease-specific estimation of cut-off values for fibrosis staging is worthy.",

Detecting mutations and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the ATP7B gene in Turkish pediatric WD patients (n=32) and controls (n=52) is the aim of this research. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For screening mutations and SNPs of the ATP7B gene, sequencing was performed. RESULTS: Mutations were determined in the ATP7B gene in 23 out of the 32 pediatric patients. The mutation detection rate in the ATP7B gene of the pediatric Turkish WD patients was 71.875%. Fifteen different mutations were determined in the ATP7B gene. These mutations were distributed throughout the ATP7B gene and were as follows: 2 deletion, 1 insertion, 3 nonsense, and 9 missense mutations. Four of these, including c.3111delC (1 deletion) and c.2363C>T, c.3733C>A, and c.3451C>T (3 missense) mutations, were detected in the Turkish WD patients. Eleven polymorphisms were detected in both groups. Among these, c.3727G>A (SNP) was reported in the Wilson Disease Mutation Database by our group. Nine out of the thirty-two pediatric Turkish WD patients had no mutations in the ATP7B gene. CONCLUSION: To find the cause of WD in pediatric patients who have no mutation in ATP7B, additional research is necessary.",

Exclusion criteria were: chronic viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson disease, hemochromatosis, regular alcohol consumption. Body mass index, waist circumference, fasting plasma glucose, serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels and serum ALT were determined. On liver biopsy specimens, performed in each patient, the NASH score, representing the sum of fibrosis, steatosis, lobular inflammation and ballooning, was calculated.

We found statistically significant correlation between waist circumference and the grade of histological activity, the presence of diabetes and both fibrosis grade and histological activity, and the serum ALT and histological activity.

We report radiological changes in four patients with WDN who worsen after penicillamine. METHODS: WDN was diagnosed on the basis of clinical, KF ring, serum ceruloplasmin and 24h urinary copper. Hematological, biochemical and cranial MRI were repeated at the time of clinical deterioration following chelating treatment. RESULTS: Four WDN patients had neurological deterioration within 4-8 weeks of penicillamine therapy. This was associated with new lesions in white matter, thalamus, pons and mid brain and these lesions showed diffusion restriction. The neurologic deterioration was associated with increased free serum copper and malanodialdehyde and reduced glutathione. Clinical conditions stabilized after few weeks of penicillamine discontinuation. CONCLUSION: Neurological worsening was associated with new lesions on MRI which revealed diffusion restriction. Increased free copper induced oxidative stress may be responsible for these changes.",

We aimed to determine what proportion of an Irish population had a low ceruloplasmin level, whether low measurements were appropriately followed-up and what were the clinical outcomes. We conducted a retrospective review of all serum ceruloplasmin measurements between August 2003 and October 2009 in a large tertiary referral centre in Southern Ireland. Clinical data, serum ceruloplasmin, liver function tests, urinary copper and liver biopsy reports were all recorded where available. 1573 patients had a serum ceruloplasmin measurement during the 7-year study period. 96 patients (6.1%) had a ceruloplasmin level < 0.2g/L and of these only 3 patients had Wilson disease. There was only 1 new diagnosis. Only 27 patients (28.1%) had some form of confirmatory testing performed. In our centre's experience, the positive predictive value of a significantly low ceruloplasmin level is 11.1% (95% CI 2.91-30.3%). In practice a low serum ceruloplasmin measurement is often not followed by appropriate confirmatory testing. Measuring serum ceruloplasmin as a singular diagnostic test for Wilson disease or as part of the battery of unselected liver screening tests is inappropriate and low-yield.",

AIM: To prospectively evaluate once-daily trientine as therapy for Wilson disease. METHODS:  STUDY GROUP: eight patients (seven males) aged 22-71 years with stable Wilson disease treated from 4 to 50 years. Patients were monitored for 3 months then for 12 months on a single daily dose of trientine (15 mg/kg). RESULTS: All patients remained clinically well. ALT and AST fluctuated in some, but none required treatment stoppages or side effects. Liver synthetic function was unchanged. Mean 24-h urine copper and zinc excretions at end of treatment were 313.4 +- 191.7 and 2,214 +- 1,346 mug, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Once-daily trientine should be explored further for possible maintenance therapy for WD. Single daily dose may improve adherence to therapy. Larger trials and longer-term follow-up will establish the safety and treatment efficacy of this once-daily treatment regimen for WD (registration: NCT01472874).",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Surgical management of tremor has evolved over the years with Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) gradually supplanting lesioning as the mainstay in treatment. In this article, the largest of its kind from our country, we present our experience in the use of lesioning in the management of patients with multietiological tremors. These include not only common indications like Parkinson disease and essential tremor but also rare causes such as Pantothenate kinase associated neurodegeneration (PKAN), multiple sclerosis (MS) and Wilson disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with medically refractory tremor who underwent surgery were included in the analysis. A comprehensive clinical and radiological evaluation was performed which was repeated 3 months postoperatively and at successive visits. Video documentation of was obtained at all visits. RESULTS: A total of 21 patients (18 men, 3 women) with an average age 37.7 years (range 21-65 years) underwent stereotactic thalamotomy/subthalamotomy at our institute between 2008 and 2013, for the treatment of medically refractory tremor of varying etiologies. The mean preoperative duration of symptoms was 11 years (range 10 months to 34 years). The median time to onset of improvement was 2 months (range 1 week to 8 months). Analyzing the improvement on the modified FTM scale, in part 1 the scores improved from 21.7 to 1.5, the part II subset improved from an average of 9.2 to 3.2 while the part III subset improved from an average of 14.1 to 4.1 postoperatively. This implied an excellent response in tremor while the other 2 components had a very good response. DISCUSSION: In this study we have for the first time objectively analyzed the tremor improvement with a modified FTM scale and have produced excellent results. We have also shown that tremor of various etiologies respond extremely well to lesioning surgery. While DBS continues to remain the treatment of choice in various types of bilateral tremor, lesioning is very successful in a carefully selected cohort of patients. We are of the opinion that in predominantly unilateral tremor or when the patient cannot afford DBS especially in a country like ours, lesioning surgery is an important tool in the armamentarium of the functional neurosurgeon.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present study is to estimate autoantibody (auto-AB) frequency, clinical characteristics, and 21-day outcome of participants in the Pediatric Acute Liver Failure Study Group (PALFSG) by antinuclear antibody, smooth muscle antibody, and liver-kidney microsomal (LKM) antibody status. METHODS: Auto-ABs were determined at local and/or central laboratories. Subjects were assigned to autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), indeterminate, and other diagnoses groups. RESULTS: Between 1999 and 2010, 986 subjects were enrolled in the PALFSG. At least 1 auto-AB result was available for 722 (73.2%). At least 1 auto-AB was positive for 202 (28.0%). Diagnoses for auto-AB+ subjects were AIH (63), indeterminate (75), and other (64). Auto-ABs were more common in Wilson disease (12/32, 37.5%) compared with other known diagnoses (52/253, 20.6%, P = 0.03). LKM+ subjects were younger (median 2.4 vs 9.1 years, P < 0.001) and more likely to undergo liver transplantation (53.3% vs 31.4% P = 0.02) than other auto-AB+/LKM- subjects. Steroid treatment of subjects who were auto-AB+ was not significantly associated with survival and the subgroup with known diagnoses other than AIH had a higher risk of death. CONCLUSIONS: Auto-ABs are common in children with acute liver failure, occurring in 28%. Auto-AB+ subjects have similar outcomes to auto-AB negative subjects. LKM+ children are younger and more likely to undergo liver transplantation compared with other auto-AB+ subjects. Although auto-AB may indicate a treatable condition, positivity does not eliminate the need for a complete diagnostic evaluation because auto-ABs are present in other conditions. The significance of auto-AB in pediatric acute liver failure remains uncertain, but LKM+ appears to identify a unique population of children who merit further study.",

DIAGNOSES: Clinical tests showed a low serum ceruloplasmin level, high urinary copper excretion and Kayser-Fleischer (K-F) rings. She carried a compound heterozygous mutations in ATP7B gene (c.2828G>A and c.3884C>T). Her younger brother, as an asymptomatic patient, manifested with elevation of transaminases but without neurological and hepatic symptoms. They were diagnosed as WD finally. INTERVENTIONS: They were treated with sodium dimercaptosulphonate, supplemented with zinc gluconate, vitamin B6, vitamin C, as well as restriction of dietary copper. OUTCOMES: The urinary copper excretion and serum transaminase level decreased gradually. The abnormal signals in brainstem and basal ganglia were also remarkably decreased after 4-year of de-copper treatment. LESSONS: As to the patients with complicated clinical manifestations, the extrapyramidal symptom and basal ganglia signals should be concerned. The serum ceruloplasmin detection and ATP7B gene mutation screening are necessary.",

DIAGNOSES: Clinical tests showed a low serum ceruloplasmin level, high urinary copper excretion and Kayser-Fleischer (K-F) rings. She carried a compound heterozygous mutations in ATP7B gene (c.2828G>A and c.3884C>T). Her younger brother, as an asymptomatic patient, manifested with elevation of transaminases but without neurological and hepatic symptoms. They were diagnosed as WD finally. INTERVENTIONS: They were treated with sodium dimercaptosulphonate, supplemented with zinc gluconate, vitamin B6, vitamin C, as well as restriction of dietary copper. OUTCOMES: The urinary copper excretion and serum transaminase level decreased gradually. The abnormal signals in brainstem and basal ganglia were also remarkably decreased after 4-year of de-copper treatment. LESSONS: As to the patients with complicated clinical manifestations, the extrapyramidal symptom and basal ganglia signals should be concerned. The serum ceruloplasmin detection and ATP7B gene mutation screening are necessary.",

The incidence for HAT is increased in patients with risk factors (vascular reconstructions, coagulation disorders and acute rejection episodes amongst others). Early retransplantation improves the prognosis for patients, but owing to lack of donors, surgical and interventional radiologic attempts to restore the patency of hepatic artery are made. The prognosis for the liver and the patient can also be improved by the development of collateral circulation. CASE REPORT: We describe a case of a 30-year-old woman with hepatic failure owing to Wilson disease. Liver transplantation with the use of vascular conduit made of donor's iliac arteries was complicated by an early HAT. Heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation was confirmed in the patient. Despite surgical and radiologic attempts to restore patency and despite treatment with fractioned heparin and aspirin, the hepatic artery remained occluded. Retransplantation was not considered, even though the patient was planning a pregnancy. After 1 year of observation of stable liver function, conversion from mycophenolate mofetil to azathioprine treatment, the patient was given consent for a high-risk pregnancy. DISCUSSION: The course of pregnancy was uneventful, with normal liver function parameters, without pathological bleedings. The patient was treated with doses of enoxaparin adjusted for the patient's weight. In the 34th week, owing to increasing concentration of bile acids, the pregnancy ended with a cesarean section. The newborn had 10-point APGAR score.",

Methods: Forty patients with WD, including 20 with cerebral type and 20 with hepatic type, and 20 age-matched healthy controls in the First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University between Jul 2013 and May 2016 were enrolled.All study subjects underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) of the brain.Six regions of interest (ROIs) were chosen.The values of fractional anisotropy (FA), lambda in ROIs were determined on DTI, FA and fiber volumes between ROIs were also determined on DTI.The values of amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and regional homogeneity (REHO) in ROIs were determined on rs-fMRI.The values of corrected phase (CP) were calculated on SWI.The copper and iron content were measured.The difference of imaging and metal metrics between cerebral type and hepatic type WD were evaluated. Results: DTI metrics differed between patients with the cerebral and hepatic types of WD.ALFF values in the caudate nucleus, and thalamus were lower (P=0.037, 0.040), and REHO values in the caudate nucleus were lower (P=0.029), in patients of cerebral type than in hepatic type patients.CP values of the right caudate nucleus and left putamen in cerebral type WD patients were lower than in hepatic type patients (P=0.020, 0.23). The serum iron content of hepatic type WD patients was higher than the normal (P=0.013), and the urine copper content was higher than the cerebral type patients (P=0.021). Conclusions: Metal deposition and damage to the structure and functional activity in the brain may occur in hepatic type WD patients.The structural and functional activity damage of the brain in hepatic type is less severe than that in cerebral type patients, while the metal deposition is not significant different between hepatic and cerebral type.",

In this report, we sought to analyse whether bilateral symmetrical inferior olivary nucleus hypertrophy is specifically associated with mitochondrial disorders in children. METHODS: This retrospective study included 125 children (mean age, 7.6 +- 5 years; male:female, 2.6:1) diagnosed with various metabolic and genetic disorders during 2005-2012. The routine MRI sequences (T1 weighted, T2 weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery sequences) were analysed for the presence of bilateral symmetrical olivary hypertrophy and central tegmental tract or dentate nuclei signal changes. The other imaging findings and the final diagnoses were noted. RESULTS: The cohort included patients with Leigh and Leigh-like syndrome (n = 25), other mitochondrial diseases (n = 25), Wilson disease (n = 40), Type 1 glutaric aciduria (n = 14), maple syrup urine disease (n = 13), giant axonal neuropathy (n = 5) and L-2 hydroxy glutaric aciduria (n = 3). Bilateral inferior olivary nucleus hypertrophy was noted in 10 patients, all of whom belonged to the Leigh and Leigh-like syndrome group. CONCLUSION: Bilateral hypertrophic olivary degeneration on MRI is relatively often, but not routinely, seen in children with Leigh and Leigh-like syndrome. Early detection of this finding by radiologists and physicians may facilitate targeted metabolic testing in these children. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: This article highlights the occurrence of bilateral hypertrophic olivary nucleus degeneration on MRI in children with Leigh and Leigh-like syndrome, compared with other metabolic disorders.",

                    "abstract": "Copper is an essential yet toxic metal and its overload causes Wilson disease, a disorder due to mutations in copper transporter ATP7B. To remove excess copper into the bile, ATP7B traffics toward canalicular area of hepatocytes. However, the trafficking mechanisms of ATP7B remain elusive. Here, we show that, in response to elevated copper, ATP7B moves from the Golgi to lysosomes and imports metal into their lumen. ATP7B enables lysosomes to undergo exocytosis through the interaction with p62 subunit of dynactin that allows lysosome translocation toward the canalicular pole of hepatocytes. Activation of lysosomal exocytosis stimulates copper clearance from the hepatocytes and rescues the most frequent Wilson-disease-causing ATP7B mutant to the appropriate functional site. Our findings indicate that lysosomes serve as an important intermediate in ATP7B trafficking, whereas lysosomal exocytosis operates as an integral process in copper excretion and hence can be targeted for therapeutic approaches to combat Wilson disease.

Because Wilson disease often presents before middle-age, the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease recommends screening patients between the ages of 3 and 55 years with liver abnormalities of uncertain cause. We evaluate guideline adherence and the clinical and economic impact of current clinical use of ceruloplasmin. METHODS: We reviewed all ceruloplasmin measurements at a clinical laboratory that serves a large primary care network, specialty clinics, and a 600-bed tertiary referral center between January 1, 2003, and December 12, 2011. RESULTS: Ceruloplasmin was measured 5325 times in 5023 unique patients, resulting in 8 (0.16%) new Wilson disease diagnoses. Ceruloplasmin's positive predictive value was 8.4% (95% confidence interval, 7.7-9.3) and false-positive rate was 98.1% (95% confidence interval, 96.2-99.1). A total of 1109 ceruloplasmin levels (20.8%) were ordered in the 1066 patients aged more than 55 years (none with Wilson disease).

Of 424 positive ceruloplasmin results, 91% were not pursued further. CONCLUSIONS: Guideline adherence restricts ceruloplasmin use to a population with a higher pre-test probability of Wilson disease: patients with chronic liver disease aged 3 to 55 years who have been tested for common causes of liver disease. The majority of the serum ceruloplasmin was measured in patients not indicated by the guidelines, resulting in poor test performance and wasted healthcare resources.

Indications mainly consisted of ALF with hepatic encephalopathy, worsening liver parameters in spite of medical management, and candidacy for undergoing a liver transplant. Plasma exchange was performed daily or alternatively until the patient recovered, succumbed, or was stable enough to undergo a transplant. Biochemical parameters serum bilirubin, ALT, AST serum ammonia serum urea, serum creatinine were recorded before and after TPE sessions. RESULTS: The study group comprised 14 patients of which a total of 28 TPE was performed. There were a total of 5 cases of cryptogenic ALF, 4 of Wilson disease, 2 cases each of infection-related ALF and autoimmune hepatitis, and a single case of drug-induced hepatitis. A total of 5 out of 14 patients underwent a liver transplant and amongst the 9 who did not undergo a transplant, 4 patients expired due to septic shock syndrome; the remaining 5 were discharged in a stable condition following TPE sessions. The disease-free survival was 78.9% and the transplant-free survival was 35.71%.

A liver transplant is the most viable option for the management of such patients. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is helpful in improving the liver biochemistry profile, thereby, increasing their likelihood of undergoing a liver transplant METHOD: The study was conducted over a period of 3 years (January 2018 to December 2021). Indications mainly consisted of ALF with hepatic encephalopathy, worsening liver parameters in spite of medical management, and candidacy for undergoing a liver transplant. Plasma exchange was performed daily or alternatively until the patient recovered, succumbed, or was stable enough to undergo a transplant. Biochemical parameters serum bilirubin, ALT, AST serum ammonia serum urea, serum creatinine were recorded before and after TPE sessions. RESULTS: The study group comprised 14 patients of which a total of 28 TPE was performed. There were a total of 5 cases of cryptogenic ALF, 4 of Wilson disease, 2 cases each of infection-related ALF and autoimmune hepatitis, and a single case of drug-induced hepatitis. A total of 5 out of 14 patients underwent a liver transplant and amongst the 9 who did not undergo a transplant, 4 patients expired due to septic shock syndrome; the remaining 5 were discharged in a stable condition following TPE sessions. The disease-free survival was 78.9% and the transplant-free survival was 35.71%. CONCLUSION: TPE plays a crucial role in improving the biochemistry profile of the liver in children with liver failure.",

                    "abstract": "AIM: To evaluate transient elastography (TE) as a noninvasive tool in staging liver fibrosis compared with liver biopsy and morphometry in children with different chronic liver diseases. METHODS: A total of 90 children [50 with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV), 20 with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and 20 with Wilson disease] were included in the study and underwent liver stiffness measurement (LSM) using TE. Liver biopsies were evaluated for fibrosis, qualitatively, by Ishak score and quantitatively by fibrosis area fraction (FAF) using digital image analysis (morphometry). LSM was correlated with fibrosis and other studied variables using spearman correlation. A stepwise multiple regression analysis was also performed to examine independent factors associated with LSM. Different cut-off values of LSM were calculated for predicting individual fibrosis stages using receiver-operating characteristic curve. Cut-off values with optimal clinical performance (optimal sensitivity and specificity simultaneously) were selected. RESULTS: The majority of HCV group had minimal activity (80%) and no/mild fibrosis (72%). On the other hand, the majority of AIH group had mild to moderate activity (70%) and moderate to severe fibrosis (95%) and all Wilson disease group had mild to moderate activity (100%) and moderate to severe fibrosis (100%). LSM correlated significantly with both FAF and Ishak scores and the correlation appeared better with the latter (r = 0.839 vs 0.879, P < 0.0001 for both). LSM discriminated individual stages of fibrosis with high performance. Sensitivity ranged from 81.4% to 100% and specificity ranged from 75.0% to 97.2%. When we compared LSM values for the same stage of fibrosis, they varied according to the different etiologies. Higher values were in AIH (16.15 +- 7.23 kPa) compared to Wilson disease (8.30 +- 0.84 kPa) and HCV groups (7.43 +- 1.73 kPa). Multiple regression analysis revealed that Ishak fibrosis stage was the only independent variable associated with higher LSM (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: TE appears reliable in distinguishing different stages of liver fibrosis in children. However, its values vary according to the disease type. For that, a disease-specific estimation of cut-off values for fibrosis staging is worthy.",

This study aimed to investigate ultrasonic backscatter properties of the myocardium in Wilson disease patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared cardiologically asymptomatic Wilson disease patients (W group) (n=18) with age-matched (26.7+-9.6 years) healthy controls (C group) (n=15). Diagnosis of Wilson disease was made on the basis of clinical manifestations, family history, and laboratory findings and confirmed by liver biopsy. Transthoracic echocardiographic quantitative texture analysis was performed on data from the septum and left ventricular posterior wall, and mean gray level (MGL) histograms at end-diastole (d) and end-systole (s) were obtained after background correction (c). Cyclic variation index (CVI) was calculated using the formula [(cMGLd - cMGLs) / cMGLd] x100. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in sex, age, body mass index, heart rate or blood pressure, and conventional echocardiographic parameters between the 2 groups. The cMGLs value of the posterior wall was higher in the W group than in the C group (30.9+-2.6 vs. 22.2+-2.7, p=0.033). The W group had a significantly lower CVI of the septum than did the C group (-22+-4.4% vs. 43.4 +-12.9%, p<0.001), and there was no significant difference in the CVI of the posterior wall (-67.0+-15.9% vs. 41.7+-18.6%, p=0.32). CONCLUSION: Abnormalities in two-dimensional echocardiographic grey-level distributions were present in Wilson disease patients. These videodensitometric myocardial alterations were significantly lower in Wilson disease patients than in the controls, and this probably represents an early stage of cardiac involvement.",

                    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Wilson disease (WD) is a hepatoneurological disorder caused by mutations in the copper-transporter, ATP7B. Copper accumulation in the liver is a hallmark of WD. Current therapy is based on copper chelation, which decreases the manifestations of liver disease, but often worsens neurological symptoms. We demonstrate that in Atp7b(-/-) mice, an animal model of WD, liver function can be significantly improved without copper chelation. Analysis of transcriptional and metabolic changes in samples from WD patients and Atp7b(-/-) mice identified dysregulation of nuclear receptors (NRs), especially the liver X receptor (LXR)/retinoid X receptor heterodimer, as an important event in WD pathogenesis. Treating Atp7b(-/-) mice with the LXR agonist, T0901317, ameliorated disease manifestations despite significant copper overload. Genetic markers of liver fibrosis and inflammatory cytokines were significantly decreased, lipid profiles normalized, and liver function and histology were improved. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the major role of an altered NR function in the pathogenesis of WD and suggest that modulation of NR activity should be explored as a supplementary approach to improving liver function in WD.

                    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Wilson disease (WD) is a hepatoneurological disorder caused by mutations in the copper-transporter, ATP7B. Copper accumulation in the liver is a hallmark of WD. Current therapy is based on copper chelation, which decreases the manifestations of liver disease, but often worsens neurological symptoms. We demonstrate that in Atp7b(-/-) mice, an animal model of WD, liver function can be significantly improved without copper chelation. Analysis of transcriptional and metabolic changes in samples from WD patients and Atp7b(-/-) mice identified dysregulation of nuclear receptors (NRs), especially the liver X receptor (LXR)/retinoid X receptor heterodimer, as an important event in WD pathogenesis. Treating Atp7b(-/-) mice with the LXR agonist, T0901317, ameliorated disease manifestations despite significant copper overload. Genetic markers of liver fibrosis and inflammatory cytokines were significantly decreased, lipid profiles normalized, and liver function and histology were improved. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the major role of an altered NR function in the pathogenesis of WD and suggest that modulation of NR activity should be explored as a supplementary approach to improving liver function in WD.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Trientine (TRI) and D-penicillamine (PEN) are used to treat copper overload in Wilson disease. Their main mode of action is thought to be through the facilitation of urinary copper excretion. In a recent study, TRI was noninferior to PEN despite lower 24-hour urinary copper excretion than PEN. We tested whether TRI and/or PEN also inhibit intestinal copper absorption. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Sixteen healthy volunteers were examined with positron emission tomography (PET)/CT 1 and 15 hours after an oral Copper-64 ( 64 Cu) dose. They then received 7 days of either PEN or TRI (trientine tetrahydrochloride), after which the 64 Cu PET/CT scans were repeated. Venous blood samples were also collected. Pretreatment to posttreatment changes of the hepatic 64 Cu uptake reflect the effect of drugs on intestinal absorption. 64 Cu activity was normalized to dose and body weight and expressed as the mean standard uptake value. TRI (n=8) reduced hepatic 64 Cu activity 1 hour after 64 Cu dose from 6.17 (4.73) to 1.47 (2.97) standard uptake value, p <0.02, and after 15 hours from 14.24 (3.09) to 6.19 (3.43), p <0.02, indicating strong inhibition of intestinal 64 Cu absorption. PEN (n=8) slightly reduced hepatic standard uptake value at 15 hours, from 16.30 (5.63) to 12.17 (1.44), p <0.04. CONCLUSIONS: In this mechanistic study, we show that TRI inhibits intestinal copper absorption, in addition to its cupriuretic effect. In contrast, PEN has modest effects on the intestinal copper absorption. This may explain why TRI and PEN are equally effective although urinary copper excretion is lower with TRI. The study questions whether the same therapeutic targets for 24-hour urinary excretion apply to both drugs.",

The incidence for HAT is increased in patients with risk factors (vascular reconstructions, coagulation disorders and acute rejection episodes amongst others). Early retransplantation improves the prognosis for patients, but owing to lack of donors, surgical and interventional radiologic attempts to restore the patency of hepatic artery are made. The prognosis for the liver and the patient can also be improved by the development of collateral circulation. CASE REPORT: We describe a case of a 30-year-old woman with hepatic failure owing to Wilson disease. Liver transplantation with the use of vascular conduit made of donor's iliac arteries was complicated by an early HAT. Heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation was confirmed in the patient. Despite surgical and radiologic attempts to restore patency and despite treatment with fractioned heparin and aspirin, the hepatic artery remained occluded. Retransplantation was not considered, even though the patient was planning a pregnancy. After 1 year of observation of stable liver function, conversion from mycophenolate mofetil to azathioprine treatment, the patient was given consent for a high-risk pregnancy. DISCUSSION: The course of pregnancy was uneventful, with normal liver function parameters, without pathological bleedings. The patient was treated with doses of enoxaparin adjusted for the patient's weight. In the 34th week, owing to increasing concentration of bile acids, the pregnancy ended with a cesarean section. The newborn had 10-point APGAR score.",

In fact, several pediatric liver diseases are precursors of adult chronic hepatopathies, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The prevalence of liver diseases in children is unknown. In the USA, every year, 15,000 children are hospitalized for liver diseases, but these disorders continue to be under-recognized or diagnosed late. The main reason is due to the frequent absence of symptoms in the vast majority of liver diseases, especially in the early stages. In the last few decades several advances have been made in understanding the pathogenesis of liver diseases, permitting the discovery of new therapeutic targets to treat liver diseases, thus improving the natural history of these disorders. In this article we discuss the most recent advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of the most frequent pediatric liver diseases. ",

The diagnosis of WD was made 8 months earlier based on abnormal copper metabolism parameters and was confirmed by genetic testing. Initially, the patient presented with akathisia, sialorrhea, oromandibular dystonia (occasionally grimacing) and slight dysarthria. The patient's symptoms diminished after treatment with d-penicillamine was initiated. No further deterioration was observed after copper-chelating therapy was started. The authors diagnosed acute focal dystonia induced by clomipramine. Botulinum toxin and intensive rehabilitation was initiated; complete regression of hand dystonia was observed. Based on the case, the authors suggest that care should be exercised with regard to starting medications that could potentially impact the extrapyramidal system in WD patients. ",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia refers to a large group of diseases affecting the cerebellum and/or its connections, although they may also involve other regions of the nervous system. These diseases are accompanied by a wide range of systemic manifestations (cardiopathies, endocrinopathies, skeletal deformities, and skin abnormalities). DEVELOPMENT: This study reviews current knowledge of the most common forms of autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia in order to provide tips that may facilitate diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: A thorough assessment of clinical phenotype (pure cerebellar or cerebellar-plus syndrome, with or without systemic manifestations), laboratory tests (vitamin E, acanthocytosis, albumin, cholesterol, phytanic acid, lactic acid, creatine kinase, cholestanol, coenzyme Q10, alpha-fetoprotein, copper, ceruloplasmin, chitotriosidase), nerve conduction studies (presence and type of neuropathy), and an magnetic resonance imaging study (presence of cerebellar atrophy, presence and location of signal alterations) may help establish a suspected diagnosis, which should be confirmed by detecting the underlying genetic mutation. A positive genetic test result is necessary to determine prognosis and provide adequate genetic counselling, and will also permit appropriate treatment of some entities (abetalipoproteinaemia, ataxia with vitamin E deficiency, Refsum disease, cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, Niemann-Pick disease type C, Wilson disease). Without a genetic diagnosis, conducting basic research and therapeutic trials will not be possible.",

Brain accumulation of copper may cause neuropsychiatric symptoms. Trientine (triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride) is a copper-chelating agent used to treat patients with WD. Trientine has been considered an option for initial treatment and maintentance therapy of WD due to its safety profile. CASE PRESENTATION: A 40 year old female with a recent diagnosis of WD was started on treatment with trientine for her WD. Within one month she developed profound bloody diarrhea unresponsive to medical treatment. Trientine was discontinued and a colonoscopy with biopsy showed moderately active ileitis and moderate to severe pancolitis, consistent with a drug induced mucosal injury. The colitis improved immediately upon withdrawal of trientine, and recurred when medication was rechallenged because of worsened WD symptoms. After second compulsory discontinuation of trientine, she remained on zinc therapy for her WD and her colitis resolved by time. CONCLUSION: Drug induced colitis is a very rare side effect of trientine. Although trientine therapy is well tolerated and less side effects are reported with this medication than penicillamine, colitis can occur during trientine treatment. Zinc therapy may be an effective alternative for treatment of WD in patients experiencing side effects from chelation therapy.",

We report the experience of albumin dialysis in acute liver failure (ALF) caused by WD in children. METHODS: Chart review of children admitted for ALF secondary to acute WD and treated by the molecular adsorbents and recirculating system. Measures of copper level in blood and within the circuit during molecular adsorbents recirculating system (MARS) sessions were performed. Clinical and biological assessments after MARS session were reported. RESULTS: Four children, with a median age of 12.3 years, were treated from 2004 to 2009 for a severe ALF associated with acute renal failure, haemolysis, and severe cholestasis. All of the children had a new Wilson index >12. A total of 14 MARS sessions were performed, for a median duration of 7.5 hours. Tolerance was good, except for 1 child who experienced haemorrhage because of vascular injury following insertion of the dialysis catheter. A neurological improvement or stabilisation was noted in all of the children along with an improvement in the Fisher index and ammonia level after MARS treatment. MARS was able to remove copper, to decrease the serum copper level of 28% in mean, and to decrease the bilirubin and creatinin levels >25%. All of the children were subsequently underwent liver transplants with a good outcome without disability. CONCLUSIONS: MARS is able to remove copper and to stabilise children with ALF secondary to WD, allowing bridging to LT.",

Alterations of copper metabolism have been associated with changes in coagulation factors. The aim of the present study was the analysis of coagulation factors in WD patients. METHODS: 100 patients attending a tertiary WD outpatient clinic were analyzed in a prospective cross sectional cohort study. Out of peripheral venous blood samples coagulation factors were assessed including: full blood count, INR, partial thromboplastin time (PTT), clotting factors II, V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, von Willebrand factor/-antigen, fibrinogen, antithrombin III, protein S, protein C, activated protein C (APC) resistance. Subgroup analyses of the blood tests were performed for sex, initial clinical presentation, WD treatment and liver function. RESULTS: Subgroup analysis by liver function showed decreased levels of factors II, V, VII and X. Subgroup analysis by gender or clinical course of the disease did not reveal significant coagulation changes. In patients treated with trientine significantly decreased levels of factors II, VII and antithrombin III and increased von Willebrand factor/-antigen levels were detected. Factor VIII levels were significantly reduced in patients receiving zinc. CONCLUSION: Although significant differences of some coagulation parameters in subgroup analysis were found, no clinically relevant alterations of the coagulation system in WD patients could be detected.",

However, WD is usually prone to neglect and misdiagnosis at an early stage. We reported a rare WD pedigree, and the clinical features, laboratory tests, and gene mutations were analyzed in detail. PATIENT CONCERNS: The patient was a 17-year-old and 136-cm-tall girl who presented with limb weakness, combined with multi-organ disorders including blind eye, epilepsy, and hypopituitarism. DIAGNOSES: Clinical tests showed a low serum ceruloplasmin level, high urinary copper excretion and Kayser-Fleischer (K-F) rings. She carried a compound heterozygous mutations in ATP7B gene (c.2828G>A and c.3884C>T). Her younger brother, as an asymptomatic patient, manifested with elevation of transaminases but without neurological and hepatic symptoms. They were diagnosed as WD finally. INTERVENTIONS: They were treated with sodium dimercaptosulphonate, supplemented with zinc gluconate, vitamin B6, vitamin C, as well as restriction of dietary copper. OUTCOMES: The urinary copper excretion and serum transaminase level decreased gradually. The abnormal signals in brainstem and basal ganglia were also remarkably decreased after 4-year of de-copper treatment. LESSONS: As to the patients with complicated clinical manifestations, the extrapyramidal symptom and basal ganglia signals should be concerned. The serum ceruloplasmin detection and ATP7B gene mutation screening are necessary.",

Alterations of copper metabolism have been associated with changes in coagulation factors. The aim of the present study was the analysis of coagulation factors in WD patients. METHODS: 100 patients attending a tertiary WD outpatient clinic were analyzed in a prospective cross sectional cohort study. Out of peripheral venous blood samples coagulation factors were assessed including: full blood count, INR, partial thromboplastin time (PTT), clotting factors II, V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, von Willebrand factor/-antigen, fibrinogen, antithrombin III, protein S, protein C, activated protein C (APC) resistance. Subgroup analyses of the blood tests were performed for sex, initial clinical presentation, WD treatment and liver function. RESULTS: Subgroup analysis by liver function showed decreased levels of factors II, V, VII and X. Subgroup analysis by gender or clinical course of the disease did not reveal significant coagulation changes. In patients treated with trientine significantly decreased levels of factors II, VII and antithrombin III and increased von Willebrand factor/-antigen levels were detected. Factor VIII levels were significantly reduced in patients receiving zinc. CONCLUSION: Although significant differences of some coagulation parameters in subgroup analysis were found, no clinically relevant alterations of the coagulation system in WD patients could be detected.",

The diagnosis of WD was made 8 months earlier based on abnormal copper metabolism parameters and was confirmed by genetic testing. Initially, the patient presented with akathisia, sialorrhea, oromandibular dystonia (occasionally grimacing) and slight dysarthria. The patient's symptoms diminished after treatment with d-penicillamine was initiated. No further deterioration was observed after copper-chelating therapy was started. The authors diagnosed acute focal dystonia induced by clomipramine. Botulinum toxin and intensive rehabilitation was initiated; complete regression of hand dystonia was observed. Based on the case, the authors suggest that care should be exercised with regard to starting medications that could potentially impact the extrapyramidal system in WD patients. ",

Brain accumulation of copper may cause neuropsychiatric symptoms. Trientine (triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride) is a copper-chelating agent used to treat patients with WD. Trientine has been considered an option for initial treatment and maintentance therapy of WD due to its safety profile. CASE PRESENTATION: A 40 year old female with a recent diagnosis of WD was started on treatment with trientine for her WD. Within one month she developed profound bloody diarrhea unresponsive to medical treatment. Trientine was discontinued and a colonoscopy with biopsy showed moderately active ileitis and moderate to severe pancolitis, consistent with a drug induced mucosal injury. The colitis improved immediately upon withdrawal of trientine, and recurred when medication was rechallenged because of worsened WD symptoms. After second compulsory discontinuation of trientine, she remained on zinc therapy for her WD and her colitis resolved by time. CONCLUSION: Drug induced colitis is a very rare side effect of trientine. Although trientine therapy is well tolerated and less side effects are reported with this medication than penicillamine, colitis can occur during trientine treatment. Zinc therapy may be an effective alternative for treatment of WD in patients experiencing side effects from chelation therapy.",

CONCLUSIONS: A thorough assessment of clinical phenotype (pure cerebellar or cerebellar-plus syndrome, with or without systemic manifestations), laboratory tests (vitamin E, acanthocytosis, albumin, cholesterol, phytanic acid, lactic acid, creatine kinase, cholestanol, coenzyme Q10, alpha-fetoprotein, copper, ceruloplasmin, chitotriosidase), nerve conduction studies (presence and type of neuropathy), and an magnetic resonance imaging study (presence of cerebellar atrophy, presence and location of signal alterations) may help establish a suspected diagnosis, which should be confirmed by detecting the underlying genetic mutation. A positive genetic test result is necessary to determine prognosis and provide adequate genetic counselling, and will also permit appropriate treatment of some entities (abetalipoproteinaemia, ataxia with vitamin E deficiency, Refsum disease, cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, Niemann-Pick disease type C, Wilson disease). Without a genetic diagnosis, conducting basic research and therapeutic trials will not be possible.",

Excess copper-derived oxidants contribute to the progression of Wilson disease, and oxidative stress induces accumulation of abnormal proteins. It is known that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays an important role in proper protein folding, and that accumulation of misfolded proteins disturbs ER homeostasis resulting in ER stress. However, copper-induced ER homeostasis disturbance has not been fully clarified. We treated human hepatoma cell line (Huh7) and immortalized-human hepatocyte cell line (OUMS29) with copper and chemical chaperones, including 4-phenylbutyrate and ursodeoxycholic acid. We examined copper-induced oxidative stress, ER stress and apoptosis by immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblot analyses. Furthermore, we examined the effects of copper on carcinogenesis. Excess copper induced not only oxidative stress but also ER stress. Furthermore, excess copper induced DNA damage and reduced cell proliferation. Chemical chaperones reduced this copper-induced hepatotoxicity. Excess copper induced hepatotoxicity via ER stress. We also confirmed the abnormality of ultra-structure of the ER of hepatocytes in patients with Wilson disease. These findings show that ER stress plays a pivotal role in Wilson disease, and suggests that chemical chaperones may have beneficial effects in the treatment of Wilson disease.",

                    "abstract": "The normal functioning of brain is intimately as well as intricately interrelated with normal functioning of the liver. Liver plays a critical role of not only providing vital nutrients to the brain but also of detoxifying the splanchnic blood. Compromised liver function leads to insufficient detoxification thus allowing neurotoxins (such as ammonia, manganese, and other chemicals) to enter the cerebral circulation. In addition, portosystemic shunts, which are common accompaniments of advanced liver disease, facilitate free passage of neurotoxins into the cerebral circulation. The problem is compounded further by additional variables such as gastrointestinal tract bleeding, malnutrition, and concurrent renal failure, which are often associated with liver cirrhosis. Neurologic damage in chronic liver disease and liver cirrhosis seems to be multifactorial primarily attributable to the following: brain accumulation of ammonia, manganese, and lactate; altered permeability of the blood-brain barrier; recruitment of monocytes after microglial activation; and neuroinflammation, that is, direct effects of circulating systemic proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor, IL-1beta, and IL-6. Radiologist should be aware of the conundrum of neurologic complications that can be encountered in liver disease, which include hepatic encephalopathy, hepatocerebral degeneration, hepatic myelopathy, cirrhosis-related parkinsonism, cerebral infections, hemorrhage, and osmotic demyelination. In addition, neurologic complications can be exclusive to certain disorders, for example, Wilson disease, alcoholism (Wernicke encephalopathy, alcoholic cerebellar degeneration, Marchiafava-Bignami disease, etc). Radiologist should be aware of their varied clinical presentation and radiological appearances as the diagnosis is not always straightforward. ",

An association between WD and sleep problems is not commonly recognized, and sleep complaints are often overlooked. Daytime hypersomnolence is even more rarely reported in this population. We report a case of WD and hypersomnolence objectively confirmed by a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). Consequently, we suggest that increased awareness, assessment, and treatment of sleep disorders, including daytime sleepiness, may help improve patients' quality of life.",

Within the WD cohort, correlations of BMD with WD disease parameters, lab results, type of treatment and known osteoporosis risk factors were analysed. METHODS: Hip and lumbar spine absolute BMD and T-score were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Osteoporosis and osteopenia were defined as a T-score <= -2.5, and between -1 and -2.5, respectively. RESULTS: There were significantly more subjects with abnormal T-scores in the WD population (58.8%) than in the control population (45.3%) (chi(2) = 6.65, df = 2, p = 0.036), as there were 50.0% osteopenic and 8.8% osteoporotic WD patients, vs. 41.2% and 4.1%, respectively, in the controls. Especially L2-L4 spine BMD measurements (BMD and T-scores) differed significantly between the WD population and matched controls. L2-L4 spine BMD for WD patients was on average 0.054 g/cm(2) (5.1%) lower than in matched normal controls (0.995 +- 0.156 vs 1.050 +- 0.135; p = 0.002). We found no significant correlation between BMD values and any of the WD disease parameters (e.g. the severity of liver disease), lab results, type of treatment or known osteoporosis risk factors. Duration of D-penicillamine treatment was negatively correlated with femoral BMD value, but in a clinically irrelevant manner, compared to age and gender. Importantly, BMD remained significantly lower in WD patients (n = 89) vs. controls after excluding WD patients with cirrhosis (p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that WD is intrinsically associated with bone demineralisation.",

The diagnosis of WD was made 8 months earlier based on abnormal copper metabolism parameters and was confirmed by genetic testing. Initially, the patient presented with akathisia, sialorrhea, oromandibular dystonia (occasionally grimacing) and slight dysarthria. The patient's symptoms diminished after treatment with d-penicillamine was initiated. No further deterioration was observed after copper-chelating therapy was started. The authors diagnosed acute focal dystonia induced by clomipramine. Botulinum toxin and intensive rehabilitation was initiated; complete regression of hand dystonia was observed. Based on the case, the authors suggest that care should be exercised with regard to starting medications that could potentially impact the extrapyramidal system in WD patients. ",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Trientine (TRI) and D-penicillamine (PEN) are used to treat copper overload in Wilson disease. Their main mode of action is thought to be through the facilitation of urinary copper excretion. In a recent study, TRI was noninferior to PEN despite lower 24-hour urinary copper excretion than PEN. We tested whether TRI and/or PEN also inhibit intestinal copper absorption. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Sixteen healthy volunteers were examined with positron emission tomography (PET)/CT 1 and 15 hours after an oral Copper-64 ( 64 Cu) dose. They then received 7 days of either PEN or TRI (trientine tetrahydrochloride), after which the 64 Cu PET/CT scans were repeated. Venous blood samples were also collected. Pretreatment to posttreatment changes of the hepatic 64 Cu uptake reflect the effect of drugs on intestinal absorption. 64 Cu activity was normalized to dose and body weight and expressed as the mean standard uptake value. TRI (n=8) reduced hepatic 64 Cu activity 1 hour after 64 Cu dose from 6.17 (4.73) to 1.47 (2.97) standard uptake value, p <0.02, and after 15 hours from 14.24 (3.09) to 6.19 (3.43), p <0.02, indicating strong inhibition of intestinal 64 Cu absorption. PEN (n=8) slightly reduced hepatic standard uptake value at 15 hours, from 16.30 (5.63) to 12.17 (1.44), p <0.04. CONCLUSIONS: In this mechanistic study, we show that TRI inhibits intestinal copper absorption, in addition to its cupriuretic effect. In contrast, PEN has modest effects on the intestinal copper absorption. This may explain why TRI and PEN are equally effective although urinary copper excretion is lower with TRI. The study questions whether the same therapeutic targets for 24-hour urinary excretion apply to both drugs.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Trientine (TRI) and D-penicillamine (PEN) are used to treat copper overload in Wilson disease. Their main mode of action is thought to be through the facilitation of urinary copper excretion. In a recent study, TRI was noninferior to PEN despite lower 24-hour urinary copper excretion than PEN. We tested whether TRI and/or PEN also inhibit intestinal copper absorption. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Sixteen healthy volunteers were examined with positron emission tomography (PET)/CT 1 and 15 hours after an oral Copper-64 ( 64 Cu) dose. They then received 7 days of either PEN or TRI (trientine tetrahydrochloride), after which the 64 Cu PET/CT scans were repeated. Venous blood samples were also collected. Pretreatment to posttreatment changes of the hepatic 64 Cu uptake reflect the effect of drugs on intestinal absorption. 64 Cu activity was normalized to dose and body weight and expressed as the mean standard uptake value. TRI (n=8) reduced hepatic 64 Cu activity 1 hour after 64 Cu dose from 6.17 (4.73) to 1.47 (2.97) standard uptake value, p <0.02, and after 15 hours from 14.24 (3.09) to 6.19 (3.43), p <0.02, indicating strong inhibition of intestinal 64 Cu absorption. PEN (n=8) slightly reduced hepatic standard uptake value at 15 hours, from 16.30 (5.63) to 12.17 (1.44), p <0.04. CONCLUSIONS: In this mechanistic study, we show that TRI inhibits intestinal copper absorption, in addition to its cupriuretic effect. In contrast, PEN has modest effects on the intestinal copper absorption. This may explain why TRI and PEN are equally effective although urinary copper excretion is lower with TRI. The study questions whether the same therapeutic targets for 24-hour urinary excretion apply to both drugs.",

Predictors of such deterioration have not been evaluated. This study documents frequency and predictors of deterioration following treatment in WD. METHODS: 59 consecutive patients with neurologic WD and 4 asymptomatic siblings were prospectively evaluated. Their clinical, laboratory, ultrasound abdomen and cranial MRI findings with and without worsening were compared. Patients were treated with oral penicillamine and/or zinc and followed up at 1, 3 and 6 months or earlier if needed. Deterioration was defined by >10% worsening in baseline Burke-Fahn-Marsden score or appearance of new neurological sign. RESULTS: Patients' median age was 13 years and 13 were females. 19 patients (30.2%) worsened following treatment; 10 within 1 month, 7 in 1-3 months, and 2 after 3 months of treatment. Deterioration was associated with drooling, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly and evidence of chronic liver disease. None of the asymptomatic patients following zinc therapy deteriorated. CONCLUSIONS: In the deteriorating group, withdrawal of penicillamine resulted in improvement/stabilization in 11 patients, 2 improved by trientine therapy and 4 continued to deteriorate till 3 months. 30.2% patients with WD deteriorated following penicillamine, especially those with chronic liver disease, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia.",

                    "abstract": "AIMS: In Wilson disease (WD), T2/T2*-weighted (T2*w) MRI frequently shows hypointensity in the basal ganglia that is suggestive of paramagnetic deposits. It is currently unknown whether this hypointensity is related to copper or iron deposition. We examined the neuropathological correlates of this MRI pattern, particularly in relation to iron and copper concentrations. METHODS: Brain slices from nine WD and six control cases were investigated using a 7T-MRI system. High-resolution T2*w images were acquired and R2* parametric maps were reconstructed using a multigradient recalled echo sequence. R2* was measured in the globus pallidus (GP) and the putamen. Corresponding histopathological sections containing the lentiform nucleus were examined using Turnbull iron staining, and double staining combining Turnbull with immunohistochemistry for macrophages or astrocytes. Quantitative densitometry of the iron staining as well as copper and iron concentrations were measured in the GP and putamen and correlated with R2* values. RESULTS: T2*w hypointensity in the GP and/or putamen was apparent in WD cases and R2* values correlated with quantitative densitometry of iron staining. In WD, iron and copper concentrations were increased in the putamen compared to controls. R2* was correlated with the iron concentration in the GP and putamen, whereas no correlation was observed for the copper concentration. Patients with more pronounced pathological severity in the putamen displayed increased iron concentration, which correlated with an elevated number of iron-containing macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: T2/T2*w hypointensity observed in vivo in the basal ganglia of WD patients is related to iron rather than copper deposits.",

However, in a subset of patients focal liver lesions may develop, presenting with a wide range of imaging features. The majority of focal liver lesions in patients with WD are benign nodules, but there are reports that have described malignant liver tumors or dysplastic nodules in these patients. Because of the possibility of malignant transformation of liver nodules, major concerns have been raised with respect to the management and follow-up of patients with WD in whom focal liver lesions have been identified. The assessment of liver involvement in patients with WD is generally performed with ultrasonography. However, ultrasonography conveys limited specificity so that magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is often performed to improve lesion characterization. This review was performed to illustrate the spectrum of MR imaging features of focal liver lesions that develop in patients with WD. It is assumed that familiarity with the MR imaging presentation of focal liver lesions in WD may help clarify the actual nature of hepatic nodules in patients with this condition.",

The main reason is due to the frequent absence of symptoms in the vast majority of liver diseases, especially in the early stages. In the last few decades several advances have been made in understanding the pathogenesis of liver diseases, permitting the discovery of new therapeutic targets to treat liver diseases, thus improving the natural history of these disorders.

                    "abstract": "The first step in screening for potential Wilson disease is serum ceruloplasmin testing, whereby a level of less than 0.2g/L is suggestive of the disease. We aimed to determine what proportion of an Irish population had a low ceruloplasmin level, whether low measurements were appropriately followed-up and what were the clinical outcomes. We conducted a retrospective review of all serum ceruloplasmin measurements between August 2003 and October 2009 in a large tertiary referral centre in Southern Ireland. Clinical data, serum ceruloplasmin, liver function tests, urinary copper and liver biopsy reports were all recorded where available. 1573 patients had a serum ceruloplasmin measurement during the 7-year study period. 96 patients (6.1%) had a ceruloplasmin level < 0.2g/L and of these only 3 patients had Wilson disease. There was only 1 new diagnosis. Only 27 patients (28.1%) had some form of confirmatory testing performed. In our centre's experience, the positive predictive value of a significantly low ceruloplasmin level is 11.1% (95% CI 2.91-30.3%). In practice a low serum ceruloplasmin measurement is often not followed by appropriate confirmatory testing. Measuring serum ceruloplasmin as a singular diagnostic test for Wilson disease or as part of the battery of unselected liver screening tests is inappropriate and low-yield.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Current guidelines favor the use of chelating agents (d-penicillamine, trientine) in first line therapy of symptomatic Wilson disease patients. Development of chelator induced immunological adverse events are a concern especially under d-penicillamine therapy. This study assessed the prevalence of co-existing or therapy-related immune-mediated diseases in Wilson disease patients, and evaluated the role of antinuclear antibodies in therapy monitoring. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 235 Wilson disease patients. Medical regimens were classified and analyzed in relation to adverse events and antinuclear antibody courses. RESULTS: Coexisting immune-mediated diseases were evident in 19/235 (8.1%) patients, of which 13/235 (5.5%) had pre-existing autoimmune diseases. Six patients (2.6%) developed an autoimmune disease under therapy, all of them under long-term d-penicillamine treatment. Data relating to antinuclear antibody courses during treatment and adverse events were available for patients treated with d-penicillamine (n = 91), trientine (n = 58), and zinc salts (n = 58). No significant increase in antinuclear antibody titers in patients treated with d-penicillamine (16/91; 17.6%), trientine (12/58; 20.7%), and zinc (7/58; 12.1%) were found. CONCLUSION: Under long-term d-penicillamine therapy a minority of patients developed immune-mediated disease. Elevations in antinuclear antibodies were found frequently, but no correlations were evident between increases in antinuclear antibodies and the development of immune-mediated diseases or medical regimes. Thus, the value of antinuclear antibodies for monitoring adverse events under chelator therapy seems to be limited.",

However, there are still uncertainties concerning a possible teratogenic risk. In this case series, we report on the outcome of 20 pregnancies with maternal chelator exposure at least during the first trimester. Of these 20 pregnancies documented by the German Embryotox Project, 14 were prospectively ascertained and 6 were retrospective. No major birth defects were observed. Three of the 14 prospective cases resulted in a spontaneous abortion, and one pregnancy was electively terminated. Our results do not support the hypothesis of teratogenicity based on earlier case reports of congenital anomalies. Therefore our study may contribute to reassure women needing chelation therapy during pregnancy. However, it must be taken into account that the sample size of this case series is too limited to make final conclusions on teratogenic effects.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Variation in care is more common in settings in which evidence-based approaches are limited. The aims of the present study were to describe consensus and variability in approaches taken by pediatric hepatologists in the management of Wilson disease (WD) in children. METHOD: International case-centered, Internet-based survey of pediatric hepatologists. Survey cases were developed by consensus of the authors and were intended to identify variation in the care of children with WD. RESULTS: One hundred eleven of 253 clinicians responded (44%). Of these, 84% of North American and 41% of European participants used guidelines published in their respective region. Although consensus existed on the first-line diagnostic tools (serum ceruloplasmin and baseline 24-hour urinary copper excretion), survey participants did not agree on how much liver copper content was required for diagnosis: 57% considered >250 mug/g dry weight to be consistent with WD, whereas 25% considered >50 mug/g to be diagnostic. Overall, 50% of practitioners perform genetic testing in all suspected cases, and 81% perform genetic testing once they know the genotype of an index patient. For initial treatment of fulminant WD, 51% of participants chose chelation and 15% chose immediate transplantation; 47% chose listing for transplantation followed by monitoring using a disease-severity score, and then carrying out transplantation only when the score reached a critical cut-off. To treat mildly affected siblings of index patients, 43% of practitioners chose zinc. Most reported that they use chelation to treat patients with hepatic dysfunction; however, 29% of North American participants chose not to use D-penicillamine as primary therapy. CONCLUSIONS: From an international perspective, pediatric hepatologists vary in the approaches they use in the care for children with WD. Regional preferences and accessibility to treatments may generate variation. Unwarranted variation, however, may also contribute to differences in outcome and should be targeted to improve quality of care.",

METHODS: With the help of the developed scoring systems were used to assess the degree of liver dysfunction and the degree of disruption of the structure of the liver and the severity of portal hypertension. RESULTS: The results of the diagnostic methods 252 children aged 1 to 17 years (mean age of 11.8+-3,5) with Wilson disease (WD), autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), chronic hepatitis C (CHC) were analyzed; 48 patients underwent liver transplantation. In children with WD, AIHand CHC liverfunction reduced by 41.3+-12.9% to 28.8+-12.5% and 19.1+-7.8% respectively. Structure of the liver in children with WD, AIH and CHC was disturbed by 25.0+-8.1% to 20.4+-9.2% and 6.8+-4.4% respectively. Thefunction and structure violations of the liver more pronounced in liver cirrhosis. The use of the developed scoring systems to monitor the severity of liver damage in the dynamics and evaluation of the effectiveness of the therapy is demonstrated. The degree of liver dysfunction is directly dependent on the degree of its structure. Abnormal liverfunction >=40% and >=40% of its structure with treatment failure can be used as a criterion of indicationsfor elective liver transplantation with its chronic diseases in children. CONCLUSION: Developed a point system to determine liver function and a point system to determine disruption of the structure of the liver and the severity of portal hypertension in children can serve as an objective criterion for assessing the severity of liver disease, monitoring their changes in the dynamics with the assessment of the effectiveness of the therapy and making decisions about the need for routine liver transplantation in its chronic illnesses in children.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Wilson disease (WD) associated acute liver failure (ALF) affects children more than adults. The predictors of mortality and outcome in patients without encephalopathy are not clear. We investigated the ability of prognostic factors and various models including model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) to predict mortality among children with WD and ALF. METHODS: We analyzed the admission characteristics in 61 children <18 years with WD and ALF. Factors associated with mortality on univariate Cox regression analysis were analyzed by forward stepwise Cox hazards regression. The prognostic models such as Nazer's model, revised Kings College Model, and pediatric end-stage liver disease/model for end-stage liver disease (PELD/MELD) score were compared. RESULTS: Of the 145 children < 18 years with WD, 61 experienced ALF of whom 33 (54%) died, including 22/27 (81.5%) with encephalopathy and 11/34 (32.4%) without encephalopathy. The mean age of children with ALF was 9.7 years, 38(62.3%) were boys. Prognostic factors significant for mortality included encephalopathy, international normalized ratio, total proteins, total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, serum creatinine, and white blood cell count. Forward stepwise Cox proportional hazards regression identified encephalopathy (hazard ratio 2.88; CI 1.1-7.4) and total bilirubin (hazard ratio 1.05; CI: 1.02-1.09) as predictors of outcome. The area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of the Nazer index, revised King's College Criteria, and PELD/MELD were 0.74, 0.76, and 0.75, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality in children with WD and ALF is 54% including 81.5% with encephalopathy and 32.4% without encephalopathy. The prognostic models, MELD/PELD score, Nazer index and Kings College Criteria are comparable with a AUC between 0.74-0.76.",

                    "abstract": "Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has become a leading technology used in clinical chemistry and has shown to be particularly sensitive and specific when used in newborn screening (NBS) tests. The success of tandem mass spectrometry is due to important advances in hardware, software and clinical applications during the last 25 years. MS/MS permits a very rapid measurement of many metabolites in different biological specimens by using filter paper spots or directly on biological fluids. Its use in NBS give us the chance to identify possible treatable metabolic disorders even when asymptomatic and the benefits gained by this type of screening is now recognized worldwide. Today the use of MS/MS for second-tier tests and confirmatory testing is promising especially in the early detection of new disorders such as some lysosomal storage disorders, ADA and PNP SCIDs, X-adrenoleucodistrophy (X-ALD), Wilson disease, guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency (GAMT), and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The new challenge for the future will be reducing the false positive rate by using second-tier tests, avoiding false negative results by using new specific biomarkers and introducing new treatable disorders in NBS programs.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Variation in care is more common in settings in which evidence-based approaches are limited. The aims of the present study were to describe consensus and variability in approaches taken by pediatric hepatologists in the management of Wilson disease (WD) in children. METHOD: International case-centered, Internet-based survey of pediatric hepatologists. Survey cases were developed by consensus of the authors and were intended to identify variation in the care of children with WD. RESULTS: One hundred eleven of 253 clinicians responded (44%). Of these, 84% of North American and 41% of European participants used guidelines published in their respective region. Although consensus existed on the first-line diagnostic tools (serum ceruloplasmin and baseline 24-hour urinary copper excretion), survey participants did not agree on how much liver copper content was required for diagnosis: 57% considered >250 mug/g dry weight to be consistent with WD, whereas 25% considered >50 mug/g to be diagnostic. Overall, 50% of practitioners perform genetic testing in all suspected cases, and 81% perform genetic testing once they know the genotype of an index patient. For initial treatment of fulminant WD, 51% of participants chose chelation and 15% chose immediate transplantation; 47% chose listing for transplantation followed by monitoring using a disease-severity score, and then carrying out transplantation only when the score reached a critical cut-off. To treat mildly affected siblings of index patients, 43% of practitioners chose zinc. Most reported that they use chelation to treat patients with hepatic dysfunction; however, 29% of North American participants chose not to use D-penicillamine as primary therapy. CONCLUSIONS: From an international perspective, pediatric hepatologists vary in the approaches they use in the care for children with WD. Regional preferences and accessibility to treatments may generate variation. Unwarranted variation, however, may also contribute to differences in outcome and should be targeted to improve quality of care.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder of hepatic copper metabolism. Clinical manifestations of WD include neurologic, hepatic and psychiatric symptoms. Most WD patients with the neuropsychiatric form, and some with the hepatic and presymptomatic forms have both hypointense and hyperintense lesions in basal ganglia on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which can be iron and copper accumulation. It has been established that T2* and susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) are highly sensitive in demonstrating brain iron accumulation, showing decreased signal intensity. Hypointense globus pallidus (GP) signal has been described on T2-, T2*-weighted images and on SWI as typical MRI lesion for patients with neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA). We investigated whether WD patients have MRI changes suggesting iron accumulation using T2*-weighted and VEN_BOLD SWI imaging protocols. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Standard MRI with additional sequences (T2*-weighted and VEN_BOLD SWI) was performed in consecutively admitted, clinically stable, and treated patients. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients entered the study. Hypointensity in the GP was observed on T2*-weighted images in 10 pa-tients. Using the VEN_BOLD SWI technique, we found hypointense signal in GP in 20 patients. CONCLUSIONS: MRI data suggest not only copper but also iron accumulation in GP in WD patients.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Videodensitometry is a feasible noninvasive ultrasound tissue characterization method allowing early detection of myocardial changes. This study aimed to investigate ultrasonic backscatter properties of the myocardium in Wilson disease patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared cardiologically asymptomatic Wilson disease patients (W group) (n=18) with age-matched (26.7+-9.6 years) healthy controls (C group) (n=15). Diagnosis of Wilson disease was made on the basis of clinical manifestations, family history, and laboratory findings and confirmed by liver biopsy. Transthoracic echocardiographic quantitative texture analysis was performed on data from the septum and left ventricular posterior wall, and mean gray level (MGL) histograms at end-diastole (d) and end-systole (s) were obtained after background correction (c). Cyclic variation index (CVI) was calculated using the formula [(cMGLd - cMGLs) / cMGLd] x100. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in sex, age, body mass index, heart rate or blood pressure, and conventional echocardiographic parameters between the 2 groups. The cMGLs value of the posterior wall was higher in the W group than in the C group (30.9+-2.6 vs. 22.2+-2.7, p=0.033). The W group had a significantly lower CVI of the septum than did the C group (-22+-4.4% vs. 43.4 +-12.9%, p<0.001), and there was no significant difference in the CVI of the posterior wall (-67.0+-15.9% vs. 41.7+-18.6%, p=0.32). CONCLUSION: Abnormalities in two-dimensional echocardiographic grey-level distributions were present in Wilson disease patients. These videodensitometric myocardial alterations were significantly lower in Wilson disease patients than in the controls, and this probably represents an early stage of cardiac involvement.",

Here, we describe a 45-year-old woman who presented with an incidental hepatocellular carcinoma at the time of transplant. The patient had severe neurologic manifestations of Wilson disease pretransplant, including dysarthria, hyperreflexia, asymmetrical ataxia, tremor, bradyphrenia, and shuffling gait. She underwent successful transplant from a hepatic and surgical standpoint, but her postoperative course was marked by protracted mutism, hypophonia, and fluctuating akinesia and immobility that did not respond promptly to withdrawal of calcineurin inhibitors or pramipexole but did respond robustly to amantadine. At 9 months posttransplant, there was marked neurologic improvement, and, at 18 months, she exhibited subtle memory and organizational difficulties but was fully ambulatory and otherwise completely functional. Our experience suggests that even patients with severe neurologic Wilson disease may recover after transplant, albeit slowly, demonstrating the need for a multidisciplinary approach, including pre- and posttransplant neurologic and neuropsychiatric consultations.",

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed pre-symptomatic children receiving zinc gluconate in a single Chinese center specialized in pediatric hepatology. Short-term follow-up data on safety and efficacy were presented, and effects of different zinc dosages were compared. RESULTS: 30 children (21 males) aged 2.7 to 16.8 years were followed for up to 4.4 years; 26 (87%) children had abnormal ALT at baseline. Most patients (73%) received higher than the currently recommended dose of elemental zinc. Zinc gluconate significantly reduced mean ALT (p<0.0001), AST (p<0.0001), GGT (p<0.0001) levels after 1 month, and urinary copper excretion after 6 months (p<0.0054). Mean direct bilirubin levels dropped significantly at 1 month (p = 0.0175), 3 months (p = 0.0010), and 6 months (p = 0.0036). Serum zinc levels gradually increased and reached a significantly higher level after 6 months (p<0.0026), reflecting good compliance with the therapy.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Zinc therapy is considered a good option in Wilson disease (WD), as a first-line treatment in presymptomatic children and a maintenance therapy after the initial chelator therapy. The aim of the study was to determine the practical use of zinc treatment in French pediatric centers. METHODS: A national survey was conducted in the 6 French centers using zinc acetate to treat WD. Clinical and biological parameters, dosage, and outcome were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 26 children were reported to be treated with zinc acetate, alone or in association with chelators. Of the 9 children (35%) who received zinc alone as a first-line therapy, 2 were switched to D-penicillamine because of inefficacy and 7 remained on zinc alone, but serum transaminase levels normalized in only 4 of them. Five children (19%) were initially treated with zinc in association with D-penicillamine (n = 4) or Trientine (n = 1) with good efficacy. Among the 12 children (46%) who received zinc as a maintenance therapy after D-penicillamine, no relapse of hepatic cytolysis occurred during a median follow-up of 5.2 years, but 2 of them were switched to Trientine because of zinc-related adverse effects. Epigastric pain was observed in 4 children, and a gastric perforation occurred in 1 child. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates poor efficacy of zinc as first-line therapy to control liver disease in half presymptomatic children and a high incidence of related gastrointestinal adverse effects in children with WD.",

                    "abstract": "Wilson's disease (WD) or hepatolenticular degeneration, is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by mutations in the Wilson disease protein (ATP7B) gene. It is characterized by impaired copper metabolism leading to its accumulation in various tissues and organs, including the liver and central nervous system, this results in the development of characteristic liver disease and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Liver symptoms usually appear during first three decades of life, while psychiatric symptoms are observed in people who are in their twenties or older.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Wilson disease (WD) is an inherited disorder that causes copper (Cu) accumulation, leading to mainly liver, neurological and/or psychiatric manifestations. In the absence of some of the typical features, diagnosis of WD is difficult and is based on the combination of clinical, biochemical and genetic testing. The aim of this study was to illustrate the complexity of the approach to WD in daily clinical practice. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of patients with WD, including the clinical presentation, histological and biochemical findings, and follow up after treatment. We also carried out genetic testing, and the Leipzig diagnostic score was applied. RESULTS: We included 15 patients. Four were symptomatic, with liver (n=1), neurological (n=1), psychiatric (n=1) and mixed clinical manifestations (n=1), and 11 were presymptomatic, with elevated transaminases (n=8) and family study (n=3). We observed Kayser-Fleischer ring in 2 patients, both without neurologic symptoms. Ceruloplasmin <= 5 mg/dL was present in 73%, and 24-hour urinary Cu> 100 mug in 40%. Liver Cu was >250 mug/g.d.t. in 85% of the patients. The final diagnosis of WD was given by genetic testing (ATP7B gene mutations) in 5 patients with minimal disease features, including one symptomatic patient (psychiatric symptoms). We identified 5 previously reported mutations (p.M645R, p.R827W, p.H1069Q, p.P768L and p.G869R) and 3 unpublished mutations (p.L1313R, p.I1311T and p.A1179D); the most frequent mutation was p.M645R. After treatment, biochemical parameters (transaminases, urinary cooper) and symptoms improved, except in patients with neurological and psychiatric manifestations. CONCLUSIONS: Our series illustrates the important role of genetic testing in the diagnosis of WD. The identification of the p.M645R mutation in most of our patients should be kept in mind in the molecular analysis of the ATP7B gene in our region.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: The earliest characteristic alterations of the liver pathology in Wilson disease (WD) include steatosis, which is sometimes indistinguishable from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Steatosis in WD may reflect copper-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. A genetic polymorphism in rs738409, in the patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3 gene (PNPLA3), is strongly associated with appearance of in NAFLD. This study evaluated the role of PNPLA3 and hepatic copper content for development of steatosis in patients with WD. METHODS: Liver biopsies obtained at diagnosis and the PNPLA3 genotype were analyzed in 98 Caucasian patients with WD (male: 52 [53.1%]; mean age: 27.6 years [CI 95%: 24.8-30.4, range: 5.8-61.5]). Steatosis was graded as percentage of lipid containing hepatocytes by an expert hepatopathologist unaware of the results of genetic testing. RESULTS: Moderate/severe steatosis (>33% of hepatocytes) was observed in 28 patients (pediatric: n=13/26 [50.0%], adult: n=15/72 [20.8%]; p=0.01). Forty-six patients (46.9%; pediatric: n=7, adult: n=39; p=0.022) had cirrhosis. Multivariate logistic regression identified PNPLA3 G allele (OR: 2.469, CI 95%: 1.203-5.068; p=0.014) and pediatric age (OR: 4.348; 1.577-11.905; p=0.004) as independent variables associated with moderate/severe steatosis. In contrast, hepatic copper content did not impact on moderate/severe steatosis (OR: 1.000, CI 95%: 1.000-1.001; p=0.297). CONCLUSIONS: Steatosis is common in WD and the PNPLA3 G allele contributes to its pathogenesis. The role of hepatic copper concentration and ATP7B mutations in steatosis development deserve further investigations.",

Phenotypic diversity of the disease can lead to delayed diagnosis. We describe a case of WD in a 10-year-old boy presenting with 3 months of increasingly intense, spasmodic lower extremity muscle cramps. Physical examination revealed tenderness on calf palpation and dark flat lesions over his ankles, knees, and elbows. Initial testing revealed creatine kinase of 302 IU/L (normal 24-248 IU/L), hemoglobin of 8.9 g/dL (11.5-15.5 g/dL), aspartate aminotransferase of 114 IU/L (16-52 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase of 54 IU/L (2-30 IU/L), and myoglobinuria. Extensive evaluation of his myopathy, including MRI and muscle biopsy, was negative. Additional laboratory tests revealed a prothrombin time of 21.3 seconds (11.8-15.5 seconds), total bilirubin of 1.4 mg/dL (<1 mg/dL), direct bilirubin of 0.5 mg/dL (<0.3 mg/dL), albumin of 2.1 g/dL (3.1-4.6 g/dL), a reticulocyte percentage of 4.5% (0.5%-2.5%), a negative Coombs direct antibody test, ceruloplasmin of 3 mg/dL (21-51 mg/dL), and 24-h urine copper of 393 mug/24 h (15-60 mug/24 h). Liver biopsy showed patchy advanced fibrosis, mild inflammation, positive staining for copper, and a tissue copper concentration of 768 microg/g (10-35 mug/g). Brain MRI revealed symmetric intrinsic T1 shortening within bilateral basal ganglia. Trientene therapy was initiated for WD. Symptoms and laboratory abnormalities resolved and remain normal at 21 months' follow-up. Musculoskeletal involvement in WD is uncommon and typically defined as bone demineralization, arthropathy, or hypokalemic muscle weakness. In patients with unexplained musculoskeletal symptoms and hepatic abnormalities, a diagnosis of WD should be considered and appropriate evaluation initiated. ",

We aimed to determine what proportion of an Irish population had a low ceruloplasmin level, whether low measurements were appropriately followed-up and what were the clinical outcomes. We conducted a retrospective review of all serum ceruloplasmin measurements between August 2003 and October 2009 in a large tertiary referral centre in Southern Ireland. Clinical data, serum ceruloplasmin, liver function tests, urinary copper and liver biopsy reports were all recorded where available. 1573 patients had a serum ceruloplasmin measurement during the 7-year study period. 96 patients (6.1%) had a ceruloplasmin level < 0.2g/L and of these only 3 patients had Wilson disease. There was only 1 new diagnosis. Only 27 patients (28.1%) had some form of confirmatory testing performed. In our centre's experience, the positive predictive value of a significantly low ceruloplasmin level is 11.1% (95% CI 2.91-30.3%). In practice a low serum ceruloplasmin measurement is often not followed by appropriate confirmatory testing. Measuring serum ceruloplasmin as a singular diagnostic test for Wilson disease or as part of the battery of unselected liver screening tests is inappropriate and low-yield.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: The earliest characteristic alterations of the liver pathology in Wilson disease (WD) include steatosis, which is sometimes indistinguishable from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Steatosis in WD may reflect copper-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. A genetic polymorphism in rs738409, in the patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3 gene (PNPLA3), is strongly associated with appearance of in NAFLD. This study evaluated the role of PNPLA3 and hepatic copper content for development of steatosis in patients with WD. METHODS: Liver biopsies obtained at diagnosis and the PNPLA3 genotype were analyzed in 98 Caucasian patients with WD (male: 52 [53.1%]; mean age: 27.6 years [CI 95%: 24.8-30.4, range: 5.8-61.5]). Steatosis was graded as percentage of lipid containing hepatocytes by an expert hepatopathologist unaware of the results of genetic testing. RESULTS: Moderate/severe steatosis (>33% of hepatocytes) was observed in 28 patients (pediatric: n=13/26 [50.0%], adult: n=15/72 [20.8%]; p=0.01). Forty-six patients (46.9%; pediatric: n=7, adult: n=39; p=0.022) had cirrhosis. Multivariate logistic regression identified PNPLA3 G allele (OR: 2.469, CI 95%: 1.203-5.068; p=0.014) and pediatric age (OR: 4.348; 1.577-11.905; p=0.004) as independent variables associated with moderate/severe steatosis. In contrast, hepatic copper content did not impact on moderate/severe steatosis (OR: 1.000, CI 95%: 1.000-1.001; p=0.297). CONCLUSIONS: Steatosis is common in WD and the PNPLA3 G allele contributes to its pathogenesis. The role of hepatic copper concentration and ATP7B mutations in steatosis development deserve further investigations.",

                    "abstract": "Wilson disease is a genetic disease involving copper metabolism disturbances that result in copper accumulations, especially in the liver and brain. Wilson disease can be treated with pharmacologic agents, such as chelators that induce urinary excretion of copper or zinc salts that inhibit copper absorption in the digestive tract. Liver transplant is the only treatment option for Wilson disease when liver failure has occurred. In some patients, that is, in those with Child-Pugh A score, neurologic disease can be seen without hepatic failure. Our recommendation is for these patients to have auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplant. Here, we present a 36-year-old male patient with neurologic disease associated with Wilson disease who had successful related living-donor auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplant using a left lobe. The patient, as a result of neurologic symptoms that included tremor walking and speaking problems and low serum ceruloplasmin level of 7 mg/dL, was diagnosed with Wilson disease, and a liver biopsy was performed. Chronic necroinflammatory disease activity was 4/18, and the patient received chelation treatment. His hepatic functions were normal. The donor was the patient's 57-year-old father whose liver function tests were also normal. The graft-to-recipient weight ratio was 1% using a left lobe graft. After transplant, serum ceruloplasmin levels on day 15 and month 1 were 14 and 19 mg/dL. At month 1, liver function tests were normal. Doppler ultrasonography showed normal vascular flow of the native liver and the graft. The patient's neurologic symptoms were progressively reduced. Progressive neurologic deterioration with no hepatic insufficiency is considered a suitable indication for auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplant; this procedure is suggested before the neurologic and liver failure symptoms of Wilson disease occur.",

                    "abstract": "AIM: To evaluate transient elastography (TE) as a noninvasive tool in staging liver fibrosis compared with liver biopsy and morphometry in children with different chronic liver diseases. METHODS: A total of 90 children [50 with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV), 20 with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and 20 with Wilson disease] were included in the study and underwent liver stiffness measurement (LSM) using TE. Liver biopsies were evaluated for fibrosis, qualitatively, by Ishak score and quantitatively by fibrosis area fraction (FAF) using digital image analysis (morphometry). LSM was correlated with fibrosis and other studied variables using spearman correlation. A stepwise multiple regression analysis was also performed to examine independent factors associated with LSM. Different cut-off values of LSM were calculated for predicting individual fibrosis stages using receiver-operating characteristic curve. Cut-off values with optimal clinical performance (optimal sensitivity and specificity simultaneously) were selected. RESULTS: The majority of HCV group had minimal activity (80%) and no/mild fibrosis (72%). On the other hand, the majority of AIH group had mild to moderate activity (70%) and moderate to severe fibrosis (95%) and all Wilson disease group had mild to moderate activity (100%) and moderate to severe fibrosis (100%). LSM correlated significantly with both FAF and Ishak scores and the correlation appeared better with the latter (r = 0.839 vs 0.879, P < 0.0001 for both). LSM discriminated individual stages of fibrosis with high performance. Sensitivity ranged from 81.4% to 100% and specificity ranged from 75.0% to 97.2%. When we compared LSM values for the same stage of fibrosis, they varied according to the different etiologies. Higher values were in AIH (16.15 +- 7.23 kPa) compared to Wilson disease (8.30 +- 0.84 kPa) and HCV groups (7.43 +- 1.73 kPa). Multiple regression analysis revealed that Ishak fibrosis stage was the only independent variable associated with higher LSM (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: TE appears reliable in distinguishing different stages of liver fibrosis in children. However, its values vary according to the disease type. For that, a disease-specific estimation of cut-off values for fibrosis staging is worthy.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease were included in our study. Inclusion criteria were: presence of liver steatosis on ultrasound in patients with waist circumference over 94 cm in men and over 80 cm in women and with serologic elements of metabolic syndrome. Exclusion criteria were: chronic viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson disease, hemochromatosis, regular alcohol consumption. Body mass index, waist circumference, fasting plasma glucose, serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels and serum ALT were determined. On liver biopsy specimens, performed in each patient, the NASH score, representing the sum of fibrosis, steatosis, lobular inflammation and ballooning, was calculated. RESULTS: Necroinflammation was mild in 15 patients, medium in 19 patients and severe in five patients. Mild fibrosis was present in four cases, medium in 14 cases, severe in six, and two patients were diagnosed with cirrhosis. We found statistically significant correlation between waist circumference and the grade of histological activity, the presence of diabetes and both fibrosis grade and histological activity, and the serum ALT and histological activity. CONCLUSIONS: Noninvasive assessment of the severity of hepatic histological changes in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease could be made by anthropometric parameters or by serologic components of metabolic syndrome, but it is not an accurate method to identify patients with high-risk for disease progression. These noninvasive parameters cannot replace liver biopsy.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with skin biopsies were selected from 408 liver transplant recipients from January 1990 to December 2012 at Baskent University in Ankara, Turkey. Demographic and clinical findings including age, sex, primary liver disease, immunosuppressive therapy, and the time between transplant and cutaneous lesions were examined. RESULTS: There were 38 patients who had skin biopsy after liver transplantation. The mean age at transplantation was 30.5 years. The primary liver disease was hepatocellular carcinoma second to viral hepatitis in 15 patients, Wilson disease in 7 patients, cryptogenic cirrhosis in 3, familial hypercholesterolemia in 3 patients, and 1 each patients of Byler disease, Caroli disease, tyrosinemia, Budd-Chiari syndrome, congenital hepatic fibrosis, alcoholic cirrhosis, and biliary atresia. The primary disease in 3 patients were unknown. The histologic diagnosis included precancerous and cancerous lesions (n=4), infectious diseases (n=4); xanthomatous lesions (n=4); vasculopathic lesions (n=4); melanocytic lesions (n=4); benign adnexial tumors (n=2); skin atrophy (n=2); calcinosis cutis (n=2), keratinous cyst (n=2), neutrophilic dermatosis (n=2), perivascular dermatitis (n=2) and miscellaneous lesions (n=6). CONCLUSIONS: We presented the cutaneous manifestations in liver transplant recipients. The most common skin lesion in these patients were precancerous and cancerous lesions, infectious, xanthomatous, and melanocytic lesions. The findings emphasize the importance of dermatologic screening in these patients that can provide early diagnosis and a better quality of life.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The severity of Wilson's disease (WD) is linked to free copper accumulating in the liver and brain. Exchangeable copper (CuEXC) is a new technique to determine plasmatic copper and is useful in the diagnosis of WD. It is hypothesized that it may also enable a good evaluation of extra-hepatic involvement and its severity. METHODS: Forty-eight newly diagnosed WD patients were prospectively evaluated using hepatic, neurological, ophthalmological and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scores. Three phenotypic presentations were distinguished: pre-symptomatic, hepatic and extra-hepatic. CuEXC was determined in addition to standard copper assays before decoppering therapy. Correlations between biological parameters and the different scores were determined and compared in the hepatic and extra-hepatic groups. RESULTS: Extra-hepatic patients had significantly higher CuEXC values than those with the hepatic form (P < 0.0001). The overall ability of CuEXC to separate the two forms was satisfactory, with an area under the curve of 0.883 (95% confidence interval 0.771-0.996) and an optimal threshold for extra-hepatic diagnosis of 2.08 mumol/l (sensitivity 85.7%; specificity 94.1%). In extra-hepatic patients, CuEXC was the only biological marker to be positively correlated with the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Score (r = 0.45, P = 0.016), the Kayser-Fleischer ring score (r = 0.46, P = 0.014) and the brain MRI score (r = 0.38, P = 0.048), but it was not correlated with the hepatic score. CONCLUSIONS: Exchangeable copper determination is useful when diagnosing WD as a value >2.08 mumol/l is indicative of the severity of the extra-hepatic involvement. In the case of purely hepatic presentation, atypical or mild neurological signs, it should encourage physicians to search for lesions in the brain and eyes.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate hepatobiliary malignancies in Wilson disease patients concerning the clinical course of tumour disease and pathological analysis of tumour tissue. METHODS: Multicenter cohort study of patients with confirmed diagnosis of Wilson disease treated at the Second Department of Neurology, Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology, Warsaw, Poland, the university hospitals Heidelberg, Duesseldorf and Dresden, Germany, and the Department of Hepatology, University Leuven, Belgium. Occurrence, treatment and outcome of hepatobiliary tumours were analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: Of a total of 1186 patients, fourteen developed hepatobiliary malignancies. Eight were hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) and six were intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinomas (ICC). The prevalence of hepatobiliary malignancies in the cohort was 1.2% and the incidence was 0.28 per 1000 person years. Pathological analysis of tumour material showed no abnormal copper concentration. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of hepatobiliary malignancies in Wilson disease is very low, even in cirrhotic patients. As a result of the relevant number of ICC in addition to HCC histological analysis through surgical resection or biopsy should be mandatory when a suspect liver lesion is detected. The influence of copper depletion from Wilson disease-specific medical treatment on tumour activity remains to be elucidated.",

The study describes the development and validation of a novel assay termed circulating single-molecule amplification and resequencing technology (cSMART) for counting single allelic molecules in plasma. Here we demonstrate the suitability of cSMART for NIPT, with Wilson Disease (WD) as proof of concept. METHODS: We used Sanger and whole-exome sequencing to identify familial ATP7B (ATPase, Cu(++) transporting, beta polypeptide) gene mutations. For cSMART, single molecules were tagged with unique barcodes and circularized, and alleles were targeted and replicated by inverse PCR. The unique single allelic molecules were identified by sequencing and counted, and the percentage of mutant alleles in the original maternal plasma sample was used to determine fetal genotypes. RESULTS: Four families with WD pedigrees consented to the study. Using Sanger and whole-exome sequencing, we mapped the pathogenic ATP7B mutations in each pedigree and confirmed the proband's original diagnosis of WD. After validation of cSMART with defined plasma models mimicking fetal inheritance of paternal, maternal, or both parental mutant alleles, we retrospectively showed in second pregnancies that the fetal genotypes assigned by invasive testing and NIPT were concordant. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a reliable and accurate NIPT assay that correctly diagnosed the fetal genotypes in 4 pregnancies at risk for WD. This novel technology has potential as a universal strategy for NIPT of other monogenic disorders, since it requires only knowledge of the parental pathogenic mutations.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate active caspase-3 and X-linked inhibitors of apoptosis protein (XIAP) level in WDN and correlate these with disease severity and markers of death (tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-8, malondialdehyde (MDA), and Cu) and survival signals (glutathione). Fifty-four patients with WDN and 36 healthy matched controls were included. Their severity, Burke-Fahn-Marsden (BFM) scores, blood counts, hemoglobin, serum chemistry, ceruloplasmin, and free copper and 24-h urinary copper were measured. Cranial MRI findings were noted. Serum active caspase-3, XIAP, TNF-alpha, IL-8, and plasma glutathione and MDA were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), flow cytometry, and spectrophotometer respectively. In the patients with WDN, active caspase-3 (0.55 +- 0.11 vs 0.38 +- 0.06 ng/ml), TNF-alpha (76.05 +- 29.01 vs 36.05 +- 21.01 pg/ml), IL-8 (590.19 +- 89.19 vs 193.43 +- 71.01 pg/ml), and MDA (4.92 +- 0.39 vs 3.43 +- 0.21 nmol/ml) levels were increased whereas XIAP (84.66 +- 10.39 vs 95.76 +- 10.11 ng/ml) and glutathione (GSH) (2.03 +- 0.29 vs 2.98 +- 0.27 mg/dl) levels were decreased compared to controls. Active caspase-3 was correlated with neurological severity (r = 0.48), BFM score (r = 0.37), ceruloplasmin (r = -0.39), hemoglobin (r = -0.34), and serum Cu (r = 0.39). XIAP levels were correlated with neurological severity (r = -0.40), BFM (r = -0.51), serum Cu (r = -0.42), and ceruloplasmin (r = 0.34). The XIAP level positively correlated with survival (GSH) and inversely with death signals (TNF-alpha, IL-8, MDA and free serum Cu) whereas active caspase-3 positively correlated with death (TNF-alpha, IL-8, serum Cu, MDA) and inversely with survival signal (GSH).

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Surgical management of tremor has evolved over the years with Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) gradually supplanting lesioning as the mainstay in treatment. In this article, the largest of its kind from our country, we present our experience in the use of lesioning in the management of patients with multietiological tremors. These include not only common indications like Parkinson disease and essential tremor but also rare causes such as Pantothenate kinase associated neurodegeneration (PKAN), multiple sclerosis (MS) and Wilson disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with medically refractory tremor who underwent surgery were included in the analysis. A comprehensive clinical and radiological evaluation was performed which was repeated 3 months postoperatively and at successive visits. Video documentation of was obtained at all visits. RESULTS: A total of 21 patients (18 men, 3 women) with an average age 37.7 years (range 21-65 years) underwent stereotactic thalamotomy/subthalamotomy at our institute between 2008 and 2013, for the treatment of medically refractory tremor of varying etiologies. The mean preoperative duration of symptoms was 11 years (range 10 months to 34 years). The median time to onset of improvement was 2 months (range 1 week to 8 months). Analyzing the improvement on the modified FTM scale, in part 1 the scores improved from 21.7 to 1.5, the part II subset improved from an average of 9.2 to 3.2 while the part III subset improved from an average of 14.1 to 4.1 postoperatively. This implied an excellent response in tremor while the other 2 components had a very good response. DISCUSSION: In this study we have for the first time objectively analyzed the tremor improvement with a modified FTM scale and have produced excellent results. We have also shown that tremor of various etiologies respond extremely well to lesioning surgery. While DBS continues to remain the treatment of choice in various types of bilateral tremor, lesioning is very successful in a carefully selected cohort of patients. We are of the opinion that in predominantly unilateral tremor or when the patient cannot afford DBS especially in a country like ours, lesioning surgery is an important tool in the armamentarium of the functional neurosurgeon.",

Hemolytic anemia in WD occurs in up to 17% of patients at some point during their illness. AIM: To screen for WD among children presenting with hemolytic anemia. METHODOLOGY: Twenty cases (mean age, 8.8 +- 3.9 y) with Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia, attending the hematology clinic of children hospital, Cairo University, were screened for WD by serum ceruloplasmin level, 24 hours urinary copper before and after D-penicillamine challenge test, and slit-lamp examination for detecting Kayser-Fleischer rings. RESULTS: No case had low ceruloplasmin, whereas bilateral Kayser-Fleischer rings was detected in 5% of our cases. Urinary copper was elevated in 5% before and in 40% after D-penicillamine challenge test. According to the scoring system used, 1 case had definite WD and 7 cases were likely to have WD. These 8 (40%) cases were referred to as group B. Group B had a significantly lower hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and reticulocytes (P=0.04, 0.001, 0.04, and 0.04, respectively) and a significantly higher urinary copper after penicillamine (P=0.000) when compared with group A (unlikely WD).

METHODS: This is a retrospective case series of 7 patients with WD with KF rings seen in our institute during the study period (August 2015 to June 2016). All patients underwent slit-lamp examination of the cornea and AS-OCT (Optovue RTVue Premier). In 2 patients, the length of the KF ring was measured using the gray scale of AS-OCT. RESULTS: The KF ring on the gray scale of AS-OCT was visualized as a hyperreflective deep corneal layer at the level of Descemet membrane in all eyes. The OCT color scale revealed the KF ring as a greenish, greenish-yellow, yellow, or yellow-orange band. The gray scale of AS-OCT could easily measure the length of the KF ring in patients 6 and 7. CONCLUSIONS: AS-OCT is an alternative method of evaluating the KF ring in WD, which can be used in combination with slit-lamp examination. The KF ring can be easily measured using the gray scale of AS-OCT. Further studies are required to study the potential advantages of AS-OCT including assessing the density of the KF ring, as a tool to assess response to treatment in WD, in differentiating the KF ring of WD disease from copper deposits in other situations and pigmented corneal rings in non-Wilsonian liver disease.",

Mutations in ATP7A may cause three distinct X-linked conditions in infants, children, or adolescents: Menkes disease, occipital horn syndrome (OHS), and a newly identified allelic variant restricted to motor neurons called X-linked distal hereditary motor neuropathy. These three disorders show variable neurological findings and ages of onset. Menkes disease presents in the first several months of life with failure to thrive, developmental delay, and seizures. OHS features more subtle developmental delays, dysautonomia, and connective tissue abnormalities beginning in early childhood. ATP7A-related distal motor neuropathy presents even later, often not until adolescence or early adulthood, and involves a neurological phenotype that resembles Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 2. These disorders may be treatable through copper replacement or ATP7A gene therapy. In contrast, mutations in ATP7B cause a single known phenotype, Wilson disease, an autosomal recessive trait that results from copper overload rather than deficiency. Dysarthria, dystonia, tremor, gait abnormalities, and psychiatric problems may be presenting symptoms, at ages from 10 to 40 years. Excellent treatment options exist for Wilson disease, based on copper chelation. In the past 2 years (2012-2013), three new autosomal recessive copper metabolism conditions have been recognized: 1) Huppke-Brendel syndrome caused by mutations in an acetyl CoA transporter needed for acetylation of one or more copper proteins, 2) CCS deficiency caused by mutations in the copper chaperone to SODI, and 3) MEDNIK syndrome, which revealed that mutations in the sigma1A subunit of adaptor protein complex 1 (AP-1) have detrimental effects on trafficking of ATP7A and ATP7B.",

Hereditary defects in copper metabolism result in disorders with a severe clinical course such as Wilson disease and Menkes disease. In Wilson disease, copper accumulation leads to liver cirrhosis and neurological impairments. A lack in genotype-phenotype correlation in Wilson disease points toward the influence of environmental factors or modifying genes. In a number of Non-Wilsonian forms of copper metabolism, the underlying genetic defects remain elusive. Several pure bred dog populations are affected with copper-associated hepatitis showing similarities to human copper metabolism disorders. Gene-mapping studies in these populations offer the opportunity to discover new genes involved in copper metabolism. Furthermore, due to the relatively large body size and long life-span of dogs they are excellent models for development of new treatment strategies. One example is the recent use of canine organoids for disease modeling and gene therapy of copper storage disease. This review addresses the opportunities offered by canine genetics for discovery of genes involved in copper metabolism disorders. Further, possibilities for the use of dogs in development of new treatment modalities for copper storage disorders, including gene repair in patient-derived hepatic organoids, are highlighted. ",

Liver transplantation is an effective treatment for fulminant cases for patients with chronic liver disease. Reports on the outcome of neuropsychiatric symptoms after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) are limited. AIM: To assess the course of neuropsychiatric and hepatic symptoms after liver transplantation for Wilson disease METHODS: Nineteen patients with Wilson disease received liver transplantation and were followed prospectively from 2005 to 2010 for the development of hepatic, neurological and psychiatric symptoms. RESULTS: Eight patients (all female) were transplanted for acute liver failure and eleven patients for chronic liver failure. Patient survival rates one and five yr after transplantation were 78% and 65%, respectively. Of the surviving patients, hepatic symptom scores improved in all patients and neurological symptom scores improved in all but one patient after OLT compared to the time of initial diagnosis and compared to pre-OLT status. Psychiatric symptoms showed moderate improvements. CONCLUSION: Survival after OLT for Wilson disease with end-stage liver disease is excellent. Overall, neuropsychiatric symptoms improved after transplantation, substantiating arguments for widening of the indication for liver transplantation in symptomatic neurologic Wilson disease patients with stable liver function.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Wilson disease is a genetic copper storage disorder that causes hepatic and neurologic symptoms. Chelating agents (D-penicillamine, trientine) are used as first-line therapies for symptomatic patients, but there are few data from large cohorts. We assessed the safety of D-penicillamine and trientine therapy and outcomes of patients with Wilson disease. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of data on 380 patients with Wilson disease from tertiary care centers in Germany and Austria, and 25 additional patients from the EUROWILSON registry. Chelator-based treatment regimens were analyzed for their effect on neurologic and hepatic symptoms and for adverse events that led to discontinuation of therapy (Kaplan-Meier estimation; data were collected for a mean of 13.3 y after therapy began). RESULTS: Changes in medication were common, resulting in analysis of 471 chelator monotherapies (326 patients receiving D-penicillamine and 141 receiving trientine). Nine of 326 patients treated with D-penicillamine and 3 of 141 patients given trientine underwent liver transplantation. Adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment were more frequent among those receiving D-penicillamine than trientine (P = .039). Forty-eight months after therapy, hepatic deterioration was reported in only 4 of 333 patients treated initially with a chelating agent. Hepatic improvements were observed in more than 90%, and neurologic improvements were observed in more than 55%, of therapy-naive patients, and values did not differ significantly between treatments. However, neurologic deterioration was observed less frequently in patients given D-penicillamine first (6 of 295) than those given trientine first (4 of 38; P = .018). CONCLUSIONS: Chelating agents are effective therapies for most patients with Wilson disease; D-penicillamine and trientine produce comparable outcomes, although D-penicillamine had a higher rate of adverse events. Few patients receiving chelation therapy had neurologic deterioration, which occurred more frequently in patients who received trientine.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence, profile, outcome, and predictive factors of pediatric acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). METHODS: All children 3 months to 18 years satisfying the Asia Pacific Association for the Study of Liver Diseases definition of ACLF were included. Data were both extracted from records (January 2011 to December 2014) and prospectively collected (January to October 2015). Successful outcome was defined as survival with native liver at 90 days, whereas poor outcome included those who died or received liver transplantation. RESULTS: Of the 499 children with chronic liver disease (CLD), 56 (11.2%) presented as ACLF, with a mean age of 9.35 (+-4.39) years. Wilson disease and autoimmune hepatitis were the commonest underlying CLDs accounting for 24 (42.8%) and 18 (32.1%) cases, respectively. The most frequent events precipitating ACLF were a flare up of the underlying disease in 27 (48.2%) and acute viral hepatitis in 17 (30%). Poor outcome occurred in 22 (39.3%) children: 17 (30.4%) died and 5 (8.9%) received liver transplantation. Poor outcome was associated with grades 3 to 4 hepatic encephalopathy, bilirubin >=17.5, international normalized ratio >=3.5, and presence of 2 or more organ failures. On multivariate analysis, a Chronic Liver Failure-Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score >=10 best predicted mortality (odds ratio 20.45, 95% confidence interval 3.9-106.7). CONCLUSIONS: ACLF is present in 11.2% of childhood CLD, with a 90-day native liver survival of 61%. A Chronic Liver Failure-Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score of >=10 best predicts mortality at day 90.",

METHODS: Auto-ABs were determined at local and/or central laboratories. Subjects were assigned to autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), indeterminate, and other diagnoses groups. RESULTS: Between 1999 and 2010, 986 subjects were enrolled in the PALFSG. At least 1 auto-AB result was available for 722 (73.2%). At least 1 auto-AB was positive for 202 (28.0%). Diagnoses for auto-AB+ subjects were AIH (63), indeterminate (75), and other (64). Auto-ABs were more common in Wilson disease (12/32, 37.5%) compared with other known diagnoses (52/253, 20.6%, P = 0.03). LKM+ subjects were younger (median 2.4 vs 9.1 years, P < 0.001) and more likely to undergo liver transplantation (53.3% vs 31.4% P = 0.02) than other auto-AB+/LKM- subjects. Steroid treatment of subjects who were auto-AB+ was not significantly associated with survival and the subgroup with known diagnoses other than AIH had a higher risk of death. CONCLUSIONS: Auto-ABs are common in children with acute liver failure, occurring in 28%. Auto-AB+ subjects have similar outcomes to auto-AB negative subjects. LKM+ children are younger and more likely to undergo liver transplantation compared with other auto-AB+ subjects. Although auto-AB may indicate a treatable condition, positivity does not eliminate the need for a complete diagnostic evaluation because auto-ABs are present in other conditions. The significance of auto-AB in pediatric acute liver failure remains uncertain, but LKM+ appears to identify a unique population of children who merit further study.",

METHODS: With the help of the developed scoring systems were used to assess the degree of liver dysfunction and the degree of disruption of the structure of the liver and the severity of portal hypertension. RESULTS: The results of the diagnostic methods 252 children aged 1 to 17 years (mean age of 11.8+-3,5) with Wilson disease (WD), autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), chronic hepatitis C (CHC) were analyzed; 48 patients underwent liver transplantation. In children with WD, AIHand CHC liverfunction reduced by 41.3+-12.9% to 28.8+-12.5% and 19.1+-7.8% respectively. Structure of the liver in children with WD, AIH and CHC was disturbed by 25.0+-8.1% to 20.4+-9.2% and 6.8+-4.4% respectively. Thefunction and structure violations of the liver more pronounced in liver cirrhosis. The use of the developed scoring systems to monitor the severity of liver damage in the dynamics and evaluation of the effectiveness of the therapy is demonstrated. The degree of liver dysfunction is directly dependent on the degree of its structure. Abnormal liverfunction >=40% and >=40% of its structure with treatment failure can be used as a criterion of indicationsfor elective liver transplantation with its chronic diseases in children. CONCLUSION: Developed a point system to determine liver function and a point system to determine disruption of the structure of the liver and the severity of portal hypertension in children can serve as an objective criterion for assessing the severity of liver disease, monitoring their changes in the dynamics with the assessment of the effectiveness of the therapy and making decisions about the need for routine liver transplantation in its chronic illnesses in children.",

We report the experience of albumin dialysis in acute liver failure (ALF) caused by WD in children. METHODS: Chart review of children admitted for ALF secondary to acute WD and treated by the molecular adsorbents and recirculating system. Measures of copper level in blood and within the circuit during molecular adsorbents recirculating system (MARS) sessions were performed. Clinical and biological assessments after MARS session were reported. RESULTS: Four children, with a median age of 12.3 years, were treated from 2004 to 2009 for a severe ALF associated with acute renal failure, haemolysis, and severe cholestasis. All of the children had a new Wilson index >12. A total of 14 MARS sessions were performed, for a median duration of 7.5 hours. Tolerance was good, except for 1 child who experienced haemorrhage because of vascular injury following insertion of the dialysis catheter. A neurological improvement or stabilisation was noted in all of the children along with an improvement in the Fisher index and ammonia level after MARS treatment. MARS was able to remove copper, to decrease the serum copper level of 28% in mean, and to decrease the bilirubin and creatinin levels >25%. All of the children were subsequently underwent liver transplants with a good outcome without disability. CONCLUSIONS: MARS is able to remove copper and to stabilise children with ALF secondary to WD, allowing bridging to LT.",

Liver transplantation is an effective treatment for fulminant cases for patients with chronic liver disease. Reports on the outcome of neuropsychiatric symptoms after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) are limited. AIM: To assess the course of neuropsychiatric and hepatic symptoms after liver transplantation for Wilson disease METHODS: Nineteen patients with Wilson disease received liver transplantation and were followed prospectively from 2005 to 2010 for the development of hepatic, neurological and psychiatric symptoms. RESULTS: Eight patients (all female) were transplanted for acute liver failure and eleven patients for chronic liver failure. Patient survival rates one and five yr after transplantation were 78% and 65%, respectively. Of the surviving patients, hepatic symptom scores improved in all patients and neurological symptom scores improved in all but one patient after OLT compared to the time of initial diagnosis and compared to pre-OLT status. Psychiatric symptoms showed moderate improvements. CONCLUSION: Survival after OLT for Wilson disease with end-stage liver disease is excellent. Overall, neuropsychiatric symptoms improved after transplantation, substantiating arguments for widening of the indication for liver transplantation in symptomatic neurologic Wilson disease patients with stable liver function.",

The aim of the study was to determine the practical use of zinc treatment in French pediatric centers. METHODS: A national survey was conducted in the 6 French centers using zinc acetate to treat WD. Clinical and biological parameters, dosage, and outcome were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 26 children were reported to be treated with zinc acetate, alone or in association with chelators. Of the 9 children (35%) who received zinc alone as a first-line therapy, 2 were switched to D-penicillamine because of inefficacy and 7 remained on zinc alone, but serum transaminase levels normalized in only 4 of them. Five children (19%) were initially treated with zinc in association with D-penicillamine (n = 4) or Trientine (n = 1) with good efficacy. Among the 12 children (46%) who received zinc as a maintenance therapy after D-penicillamine, no relapse of hepatic cytolysis occurred during a median follow-up of 5.2 years, but 2 of them were switched to Trientine because of zinc-related adverse effects. Epigastric pain was observed in 4 children, and a gastric perforation occurred in 1 child. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates poor efficacy of zinc as first-line therapy to control liver disease in half presymptomatic children and a high incidence of related gastrointestinal adverse effects in children with WD.",

The diagnosis of WD was made 8 months earlier based on abnormal copper metabolism parameters and was confirmed by genetic testing. Initially, the patient presented with akathisia, sialorrhea, oromandibular dystonia (occasionally grimacing) and slight dysarthria. The patient's symptoms diminished after treatment with d-penicillamine was initiated. No further deterioration was observed after copper-chelating therapy was started. The authors diagnosed acute focal dystonia induced by clomipramine. Botulinum toxin and intensive rehabilitation was initiated; complete regression of hand dystonia was observed. Based on the case, the authors suggest that care should be exercised with regard to starting medications that could potentially impact the extrapyramidal system in WD patients. ",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of human copper metabolism characterized by copper accumulation in the liver due to impaired excretion of copper into the bile. Brain accumulation of copper may cause neuropsychiatric symptoms. Trientine (triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride) is a copper-chelating agent used to treat patients with WD. Trientine has been considered an option for initial treatment and maintentance therapy of WD due to its safety profile. CASE PRESENTATION: A 40 year old female with a recent diagnosis of WD was started on treatment with trientine for her WD. Within one month she developed profound bloody diarrhea unresponsive to medical treatment. Trientine was discontinued and a colonoscopy with biopsy showed moderately active ileitis and moderate to severe pancolitis, consistent with a drug induced mucosal injury. The colitis improved immediately upon withdrawal of trientine, and recurred when medication was rechallenged because of worsened WD symptoms. After second compulsory discontinuation of trientine, she remained on zinc therapy for her WD and her colitis resolved by time. CONCLUSION: Drug induced colitis is a very rare side effect of trientine. Although trientine therapy is well tolerated and less side effects are reported with this medication than penicillamine, colitis can occur during trientine treatment. Zinc therapy may be an effective alternative for treatment of WD in patients experiencing side effects from chelation therapy.",

                    "abstract": "Wilson disease is a genetic disease involving copper metabolism disturbances that result in copper accumulations, especially in the liver and brain. Wilson disease can be treated with pharmacologic agents, such as chelators that induce urinary excretion of copper or zinc salts that inhibit copper absorption in the digestive tract. Liver transplant is the only treatment option for Wilson disease when liver failure has occurred. In some patients, that is, in those with Child-Pugh A score, neurologic disease can be seen without hepatic failure. Our recommendation is for these patients to have auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplant. Here, we present a 36-year-old male patient with neurologic disease associated with Wilson disease who had successful related living-donor auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplant using a left lobe. The patient, as a result of neurologic symptoms that included tremor walking and speaking problems and low serum ceruloplasmin level of 7 mg/dL, was diagnosed with Wilson disease, and a liver biopsy was performed. Chronic necroinflammatory disease activity was 4/18, and the patient received chelation treatment. His hepatic functions were normal. The donor was the patient's 57-year-old father whose liver function tests were also normal. The graft-to-recipient weight ratio was 1% using a left lobe graft. After transplant, serum ceruloplasmin levels on day 15 and month 1 were 14 and 19 mg/dL. At month 1, liver function tests were normal. Doppler ultrasonography showed normal vascular flow of the native liver and the graft. The patient's neurologic symptoms were progressively reduced. Progressive neurologic deterioration with no hepatic insufficiency is considered a suitable indication for auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplant; this procedure is suggested before the neurologic and liver failure symptoms of Wilson disease occur.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Penicillamine is a standard therapy for Wilson disease (WD) but some patients have paradoxical worsening. Predictors of such deterioration have not been evaluated. This study documents frequency and predictors of deterioration following treatment in WD. METHODS: 59 consecutive patients with neurologic WD and 4 asymptomatic siblings were prospectively evaluated. Their clinical, laboratory, ultrasound abdomen and cranial MRI findings with and without worsening were compared. Patients were treated with oral penicillamine and/or zinc and followed up at 1, 3 and 6 months or earlier if needed. Deterioration was defined by >10% worsening in baseline Burke-Fahn-Marsden score or appearance of new neurological sign. RESULTS: Patients' median age was 13 years and 13 were females. 19 patients (30.2%) worsened following treatment; 10 within 1 month, 7 in 1-3 months, and 2 after 3 months of treatment. Deterioration was associated with drooling, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly and evidence of chronic liver disease. None of the asymptomatic patients following zinc therapy deteriorated. CONCLUSIONS: In the deteriorating group, withdrawal of penicillamine resulted in improvement/stabilization in 11 patients, 2 improved by trientine therapy and 4 continued to deteriorate till 3 months. 30.2% patients with WD deteriorated following penicillamine, especially those with chronic liver disease, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia.",

The youngest child with normal liver function reported so far is an 8-mo-old Japanese boy with low ceruloplasmin levels, and the youngest child with elevated aminotransferase ever reported so far is a 9-mo-old Korean boy with confirmed by genetic testing. Here we report an 8-mo-old Chinese boy presented with elevated liver enzymes, and low serum ceruloplasmin level. Genetic analysis of ATP7B gene detected two heterozygous disease causing mutations (c.2621C>T/p.A874V and c.3809A>G/p.N1270S), and parental origins were determined. Persistent elevation of serum aminotransferase in this infant was normalized after zinc therapy. To our best knowledge, this is the youngest patient with elevated liver enzymes ever reported worldwide. We hope that this will raise awareness among pediatricians, leading to earlier diagnosis, timely treatment, and better clinical outcome.",
