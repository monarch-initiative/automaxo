26811510		Republished review: Surgical management of aortic root disease in Marfan syndrome and other congenital disorders associated with aortic root aneurysms.Elective root replacement in Marfan syndrome has improved life expectancy in affected patients. Three forms of surgery are now available: total root replacement (TRR) with a valved conduit, valve sparing root replacement (VSRR) and personalised external aortic root support (PEARS) with a macroporous mesh sleeve. TRR can be performed irrespective of aortic dimensions and a mechanical replacement valve is a secure and near certain means of correcting aortic valve regurgitation but has thromboembolic and bleeding risks. VSRR offers freedom from anticoagulation and attendant risks of bleeding but reoperation for aortic regurgitation runs at 1.3% per annum. A prospective multi-institutional study has found this to be an underestimate of the true rate of valve-related adverse events. PEARS conserves the aortic root anatomy and optimises the chance of maintaining valve function but average follow-up is under 5 years and so the long-term results are yet to be determined. Patients are on average in their 30s and so the cumulative lifetime need for reoperation, and of any valve-related complications, are consequently substantial. With lowering surgical risk of prophylactic root replacement, the threshold for intervention has reduced progressively over 30 years to 4.5 cm and so an increasing number of patients who are not destined to have a dissection are now having root replacement. In evaluation of these three forms of surgery, the number needed to treat to prevent dissection and the balance of net benefit and harm in future patients must be considered. 
34326135		Personalised external aortic root support for elective treatment of aortic root dilation in 200 patients.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In personalised external aortic root support (PEARS), a custom-made, macroporous mesh is used to stabilise a dilated aortic root and prevent dissection, primarily in patients with genetically driven aortopathies. Data are needed on the safety and postoperative incidence of aortic events. METHODS: We present a multicentre cohort study evaluating the first 200 consecutive patients (median age 33 years) undergoing surgery with an intention to perform PEARS for aortic root dilatation in 23 centres between 2004 and 2019. Perioperative outcomes were collected prospectively while clinical follow-up was retrieved retrospectively. Median follow-up was 21.2 months. RESULTS: The main indication was Marfan syndrome (73.5%) and the most frequent concomitant procedure was mitral valve repair (10%). An intervention for myocardial ischaemia or coronary injury was needed in 11 patients, 1 case resulting in perioperative death. No ascending aortic dissections were observed in 596 documented postoperative patient years. Late reoperation was performed in 3 patients for operator failure to achieve complete mesh coverage. Among patients with at least mild aortic regurgitation (AR) preoperatively, 68% had no or trivial AR at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the clinical history of the first 200 patients to undergo PEARS. To date, aortic dissection has not been observed in the restrained part of the aorta, yet long-term follow-up is needed to confirm the potential of PEARS to prevent dissection. While operative mortality is low, the reported coronary complications reflect the learning curve of aortic root surgery in patients with connective tissue disease. PEARS may stabilise or reduce aortic regurgitation.
24395977		Personalised external aortic root support (PEARS) in Marfan syndrome: analysis of 1-9 year outcomes by intention-to-treat in a cohort of the first 30 consecutive patients to receive a novel tissue and valve-conserving procedure, compared with the published results of aortic root replacement.OBJECTIVE: Among people with Marfan syndrome who have a typical aortic root aneurysm, dissection is a characteristic cause of premature death. To pre-empt Type A dissection, composite root replacement with a mechanical valve became the standard of care in the 1980s and 1990s. This is being superseded by valve-sparing aortic root replacement to avoid lifelong anticoagulation. In 2004, a total root and valve-sparing procedure, personalised external aortic support, was introduced. We report here results among the first 30 recipients. METHODS: From cross-sectional digital images, the patient's own aorta is modelled by computer aided design and a replica is made in thermoplastic by rapid prototyping. On this, a personalised support of a macroporous polymer mesh is manufactured. The mesh is positioned around the aorta, closely applied from the aortoventricular junction to beyond the brachiocephalic artery. The operation is performed with a beating heart and usually without cardiopulmonary bypass. RESULTS: Between 2004 and 2011, 30 patients, median age 28 years (IQR 20-44) had this operation and have been prospectively followed for 1.4-8.8 years by February 2013. During a total of 133 patient-years there were no deaths or cerebrovascular, aortic or valve-related events. These early outcomes are better than published results for the more radical extirpative root replacement operations. CONCLUSIONS: The aortic valve, the root architecture, and the blood/endothelia interface are conserved. The perioperative burden is less and there has been freedom from aortic and valvular events. A prospective comparative study is planned.
26134372		Effect of personalized external aortic root support on aortic root motion and distension in Marfan syndrome patients.OBJECTIVE: Personalized external aortic root support (PEARS) is a novel surgical approach with the aim of stabilizing the aortic root size and decreasing risk of dissection in Marfan syndrome patients. A bespoke polymer mesh tailored to each patient's individual aorta shape is produced by modeling and then surgically implanted. The aim of this study is to assess the mechanical effects of PEARS on the aortic root systolic downward motion (an important determinant of aortic wall stress), aortic root distension and on the left ventricle (LV). METHODS/RESULTS: A cohort of 27 Marfan patients had a prophylactic PEARS surgery between 2004 and 2012 with 24 having preoperative and follow-up cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging studies. Systolic downward aortic root motion, aortic root distension, LV volumes/mass and mitral annular systolic excursion before the operation and in the latest follow-up were measured randomly and blinded. After a median follow-up of 50.5 (IQR 25.5-72) months following implantation of PEARS, systolic downward motion of aortic root was significantly decreased (12.6+-3.6mm pre-operation vs 7.9+-2.9mm latest follow-up, p<0.00001). There was a tendency for a decrease in systolic aortic root distension but this was not significant (median 4.5% vs 2%, p=0.35). There was no significant change in LV volumes, ejection fraction, mass and mitral annular systolic excursion in follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: PEARS surgery decreases systolic downward aortic root motion which is an important determinant of longitudinal aortic wall stress. Aortic wall distension and Windkessel function are not significantly impaired in the follow-up after implantation of the mesh which is also supported by the lack of deterioration of LV volumes or mass.

While mutations in human fibrillin-1 lead to ectopia lentis, a major manifestation of Marfan syndrome (MFS), in mice fibrillin-2 can compensate for reduced/lack of fibrillin-1 and maintain the integrity of ocular structures. Here we examine the consequences of a heterozygous dominant-negative mutation in the Fbn1 gene in the ocular system of the mgDeltalpn mouse model for MFS. METHODS: Eyes from mgDeltalpn and wild-type mice at 3 and 6 months of age were analyzed by histology. The ciliary zonule was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: Mutant mice presented a significantly larger distance of the ciliary body to the lens at 3 and 6 months of age when compared to wild-type, and ectopia lentis. Immunofluorescence and SEM corroborated those findings in MFS mice, revealing a disorganized mesh of microfibrils on the floor of the ciliary body. Moreover, mutant mice also had a larger volume of the anterior chamber, possibly due to excess aqueous humor. Finally, losartan treatment had limited efficacy in improving ocular phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast with null or hypomorphic mutations, expression of a dominant-negative form of fibrillin-1 leads to disruption of microfibrils in the zonule of mice. This in turn causes lens dislocation and enlargement of the anterior chamber. Therefore, heterozygous mgDeltalpn mice recapitulate the major ocular phenotypes of MFS and can be instrumental in understanding the development of the disease.
25406424	associate|@CHEMICAL_Glycosaminoglycans|@DISEASE_Marfan_Syndrome	Histology of a Marfan aorta 4.5 years after personalized external aortic root support.In 2008, a 26-year old man had personalized external aortic root support (PEARS) with a macroporous mesh. He was the 16th of 46 patients to have this operation. He had a typical Marfan habitus. His mother died of this disease as did his brother, with an aortic dissection. The patient himself died suddenly 4.5 years after his PEARS operation. At autopsy, there was no blood in the pericardium. The coronary orifices and proximal arteries were normal. His bicuspid aortic valve was minimally regurgitant as it was prior to operation and remained throughout follow-up. Macroscopically the implanted mesh was embedded in the adventitia and not separable from the aortic wall. Microscopically it was fully incorporated with collagen fibres as has been seen in our animal studies. The unsupported aortic arch showed some focal fragmentation of elastic fibres and a mild increase in mucopolysaccharides consistent with Marfan syndrome. These appearances were not present in the supported aortic root, which had the histological appearance of a normal aorta. He was the first patient to die with an implant. The histological appearances suggest the possibility that the incorporated support of the aortic root allowed recovery of the microstructure of the media. 
27032474		Personalized external aortic root support: a review of the current status.Personalized external aortic root support (PEARS) is an emerging technology. It is a pre-emptive operation to halt aortic root expansion and maintain aortic valve function in Marfan syndrome and is also applicable to aortic root aneurysms of other aetiologies. To fully evaluate PEARS, awareness of all those who advise these patients is necessary to ensure that patients are fully informed of the alternative operations, to carefully build experience, to ensure safety and quality and to monitor outcomes. Herein, we present a summary of published methods and outcomes and the arrangements in place for fuller evaluation. 
30963974		Management and Outcomes of Aortic Dissection in Pregnancy with Marfan Syndrome: A Systematic Review.BACKGROUND: In Marfan Syndrome (MFS), aortic dilatation is one of the main cardiovascular manifestations which deteriorate due to the physiological changes during pregnancy. We aimed to assess the up-to-date management and outcomes of aortic root dilation and dissection (AoD) in pregnancy with MFS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A systematic review was conducted and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Original studies published between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2018 and which described the management and/or outcomes of AoD during or after pregnancy in women with MFS were included. Literature searches were conducted. The PubMed search was performed using terms "Marfan Syndrome" [Mesh] and "Pregnancy" [Mesh] whereas the Google Scholar search was for "Marfan" and "Pregnancy", all words anywhere in the article. RESULTS: The literature search yielded 177 articles on PubMed and 13,900 articles on Google Scholar. Assessment of full-text articles for eligibility after removal of duplicates from both databases yielded 12 eligible studies to be included in the final review. CONCLUSION: Women with MFS are at high risk of aortic dissection during pregnancy and women with aortic root 41-45 mm should consider avoiding pregnancy. Guideline-specific management of aortic aneurysms in pregnancy will reduce the risk of dissection. Diagnosis and Management of MFS need a multidisciplinary approach and team that should start working early in pregnancy. Further studies are needed to optimize medical and surgical approaches in addition to preconception counselling in highrisk subjects.
28419245		Support of the aortic wall: a histological study in sheep comparing a macroporous mesh with low-porosity vascular graft of the same polyethylene terephthalate material.OBJECTIVES: Wrapping with various materials was an early treatment for aortic aneurysms. Wrapping with low-porosity vascular grafts has been associated with graft migration and vascular erosion. An alternative is to use a macroporous mesh (MPM) made of the same polymer (polyethylene terephalate). We compared the histological outcome 1 year after wrapping sheep aortas with low-porosity grafts versus MPM fabrics. METHODS: The 2 different fabrics were wrapped around the aorta of 3 sheep. After 1 year the aortas were excised. The 2 wrapped segments of aorta were compared with each other and control aorta. Histological examinations and measurements were made of the layers of the aortic wall in 36 prespecified locations in each of the 3 sheep. RESULTS: Both fabrics were consistently surrounded by foreign body reaction and well-vascularized fibrosis. This was more pronounced with the low-porosity vascular graft material which was poorly incorporated and caused buckling at the transition between wrapped and unwrapped aorta. Conversely, the MPM was fully incorporated, resulting in a composite mesh/biological aortic wall. There was reduction of medial thickness with both materials but it was locally more extreme due to the corrugations in the vascular graft material. The findings were consistent between sampled locations and were similar in the 3 animals. CONCLUSIONS: The different porosity and rigidity of the materials influences their incorporation into the aortic wall. The incorporation of the pliable MPM precludes the complications of migration and erosion which are seen after wrapping with low-porosity prosthetic vascular graft material.
32867844		A contemporary approach to a young female patient with Loeys-Dietz syndrome and an uncomplicated type B aortic dissection: a case report.BACKGROUND: Aortic dissection is a relatively uncommon, but often catastrophic disease that requires early and accurate diagnosis. It often presents in patients with congenital connective tissue disorders. The current aortic surgical techniques are related with serious early and late complications. This case report emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis of aortic root dilatation and the risk of dissection, especially in patients with congenital connective tissue disorders. We present an alternative, contemporary and multidisciplinary approach based on the present state of knowledge. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a rare case of a young female patient with Loeys-Dietz syndrome who was admitted with an uncomplicated aortic dissection (Stanford type B / DeBakey type III) and a dilated aortic root. After a period of close surveillance and extensive vascular imaging, thoracic endovascular aortic repair was deemed to be technically not possible. Medical treatment was optimized and our patient successfully underwent a personalised external aortic root support procedure (PEARS) as a contemporary alternative to existing aortic root surgical techniques. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the importance of interdisciplinary approach, close follow-up and multimodality imaging. The decision to intervene in a chronic type B aortic dissection is still challenging and should be made in experienced centers by an interdisciplinary team. However, if an acute complication occurs, thoracic endovascular aortic repair TEVAR is the method of choice. In all cases optimal medical treatment is important. There is increasing evidence that personalized external aortic root support procedure PEARS is effective in stabilizing the aortic root and preventing its dilatation and dissection not only in patients with Marfan syndrome, but also in other cases of aortic root dilation of other etiologies. Moreover, many publications have reported the additional benefit of reduction or even eradication of aortic regurgitation by improving coaptation of the aortic valve leaflets in dilated aortas.
26311451	treat|@CHEMICAL_Warfarin|@DISEASE_Intracranial_Hemorrhages	[Maternal and fetal outcomes with aortic dissection in pregnant patients with Marfan syndrome].OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical characteristics of aortic dissection in pregnant patients with Marfan syndrome and the maternal and fetal outcomes in cardiovascular surgery. METHODS: Seven pregnant women with Marfan syndrome with aortic dissection were identified, who were treated in Beijing Anzhen Hospital Affiliated to Capital Medical University between January 2012 and September 2014. Patient charts were reviewed for cardiovascular surgery, occurrence of complications, clinical features and the maternal and fetal outcomes. RESULTS: (1) Among 7 patients, 4 cases were diagnosed as type A aortic dissection and 3 were cases diagnosed as type B aortic dissection. The diagnosis mainly depends on CT angiography. New York Heart Association (NYHA) classify into 5 of level II, 1 of level III, 1 of leveI IV. Except for 1 patient with cardiac tamponade lead to heart failure, the remaining 6 cases had no complications. (2) Three patients underwent heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass in second trimester and two patients underwent heart surgery in third trimester. Two patients terminated pregnancy before heart surgery (one of whom underwent artificial abortion, one of whom underwent cesarean section in second trimester). (3) The methods of cardiovascular surgeries were as follow: 3 of Bentall+Sun', 1 of Bentall+Sun'+ right coronary artery bypass grafting, 1 of Bentall, 1 of the whole chest aorta replacement surgery, and 1 of femoral artery catheter chest aorta with membrane mesh stent implantation. The diameter of aortic roots measured during operation were 5 cm in 2 cases, 7 cm in 2 cases and 10 cm in 2 cases respectively. Among the 7 cases, 3 were conducted cesarean sections during cardiovascular surgery, 1 was terminated pregnancy due to intrauterine fetal death after cardiovascular surgery, and 1 was conducted cesarean section due to severe early-onset preeclampsia at 30 weeks of pregnancy after cardiovascular surgery. (4) Among the 7 cases, 3 were conducted cesarean sections during cardiovascular surgery, the order of which was implemented cesarean section under general anesthesia firstly and then operated cardiovascular surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass and heparinization. Two were conducted cardiovascular surgery after termination of pregnancy by early artificial abortion operation or hysterotomy. 1 was conducted Bentall surgery at 18 weeks of pregnancy, after that the patient was receiving warfarin until the fetal brain hemorrhage was examined by ultrasound at 31 weeks of pregnancy; the patient was conducted cesarean section due to intrauterine fetal death. 1 was conducted heart surgery at 24 weeks of pregnancy and continue the pregnancy to 30 weeks, was conducted cesarean section due to severe early-onset preeclampsia at 30 weeks of pregnancy. (5) Among 7 patients, three patients underwent heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass combined with cesarean section. Two patients terminated pregnancy after heart surgery. Two patients terminated pregnancy before heart surgery. Six patients were alive and one patient died of multiple organ failure. (6) 3 cases of newborn with birth body mass between 1 080 to 1 490 g.1 case of birth died after 14 d. 2 cases for newborns were alive without exception. CONCLUSION: Aortic dissection poses serious risk for pregnant women with Marfan syndrome and the fetus, and the mortality rates for both the mother and the fetus are high. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment should be based on maternal and fetal conditions (such as aortic dissection, gestational age). When fetus is mature, cardiovascular surgery should be carried out with cesarean section. A multi-disciplinary team between obstetric and cardiovascular surgery is crucial to the outcome of these critical patients.
35747770		Personalised external aortic root support (PEARS) to stabilise an aortic root aneurysm.Patients with congenitally determined aortic root aneurysms are at risk of aortic valve regurgitation, aortic dissection, rupture and death. Personalised external aortic root support (PEARS) may provide an alternative to aortic root replacement. This was a multi-centre, prospective cohort of all consecutive patients who received ExoVasc mesh implants for a dilated aortic root between 2004 and 2017. Baseline and peri-operative characteristics, as well as early postoperative outcomes are described, and time-related survival and re-operation free survival are estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. From 2004 through 2017, 117 consecutive patients have received ExoVasc mesh implants for aortic root aneurysm. The inclusion criteria were an aortic root/sinus of Valsalva and ascending aorta with asymptomatic dilatation of between 40 and 50 mm in diameter in patients aged 16 years or more. Patients with more than mild aortic regurgitation were excluded. There was one early death. The length of stay was within seven days in 75% of patients. In conclusion, the operation achieves the objectives of valve-sparing root replacement. PEARS may be seen as a low-risk conservative operation, which can be applied earlier on in the disease process, and which is complementary to more invasive procedures, such as valve-sparing root replacement or total root replacement.
24986892		Surgical management of aortic root disease in Marfan syndrome and other congenital disorders associated with aortic root aneurysms.Elective root replacement in Marfan syndrome has improved life expectancy in affected patients. Three forms of surgery are now available: total root replacement (TRR) with a valved conduit, valve sparing root replacement (VSRR) and personalised external aortic root support (PEARS) with a macroporous mesh sleeve. TRR can be performed irrespective of aortic dimensions and a mechanical replacement valve is a secure and near certain means of correcting aortic valve regurgitation but has thromboembolic and bleeding risks. VSRR offers freedom from anticoagulation and attendant risks of bleeding but reoperation for aortic regurgitation runs at 1.3% per annum. A prospective multi-institutional study has found this to be an underestimate of the true rate of valve-related adverse events. PEARS conserves the aortic root anatomy and optimises the chance of maintaining valve function but average follow-up is under 5 years and so the long-term results are yet to be determined. Patients are on average in their 30s and so the cumulative lifetime need for reoperation, and of any valve-related complications, are consequently substantial. With lowering surgical risk of prophylactic root replacement, the threshold for intervention has reduced progressively over 30 years to 4.5 cm and so an increasing number of patients who are not destined to have a dissection are now having root replacement. In evaluation of these three forms of surgery, the number needed to treat to prevent dissection and the balance of net benefit and harm in future patients must be considered.
30243228		Obstetric and cardiac outcomes in women with Marfan syndrome and an aortic root diameter <= 45mm.OBJECTIVE: To assess obstetric and aortic outcomes in women with Marfan Syndrome according to aortic root diameter, in view of recommendations for caesarean delivery when the aortic root diameter is >=40 mm in the 2010 American guidelines versus >45 mm in the 2011 European guidelines. STUDY DESIGN: In this retrospective cohort study conducted at Sainte-Justine Mother and Child Tertiary Hospital, 27 pregnancies in 20 women with Marfan Syndrome as defined by the international criteria, were followed prospectively between 1994 and 2017, after excluding women with prior aortic surgery. Obstetric and aortic outcomes were compared in 2 groups according to aortic root diameter: < 40 mm (21 pregnancies) and 40-45 mm (6 pregnancies). RESULTS: 21/27 women had a vaginal delivery. The caesarean section rate was 23.8% and 16.7% in women with diameter <40 mm and 40-45 mm respectively (p-value = 1), and perinatal outcome was similar across groups. Two women with a prepregnancy aortic root diameter <40 mm developed an acute type B dissection during the third trimester. Both had a family history of aortic dissection. CONCLUSIONS: Vaginal delivery with rigorous pain control and avoidance of Valsalva maneuver may be safely considered in women with Marfan Syndrome and an aortic root diameter <=45 mm. The risk of type B aortic dissection during pregnancy is hard to predict. Other factors such as family history of dissection and descending aorta size may play an important role, and this may modify our counselling.
33061070	associate|@DISEASE_Marfan_Syndrome|@GENE_FBN1	Aortic root surgery in Marfan syndrome.Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant connective disease etiologically related with FBN-1 gene mutation. The altered microfibril protein structure result in characteristic cardiovascular abnormalities including aortic root dilatation, aortic root aneurysms, and aortic dissections. Aortic root aneurysms and subsequent dissection are the major causes of reduced life expectancy in MFS patients. Prophylactic aortic root replacement has improved the survival of patients with MFS. Elective root replacement carries very low mortality and morbidity. Emergency root replacement for dissection is accompanied with higher early mortality and late deaths/interventions. Both the techniques of aortic root replacement, total root replacement (TRR) with a prosthetic valved conduit, and valve-sparing root replacement (VSRR) yield excellent early and late results. Considering the low risk of prosthetic valve-related events, the improved long-term survival, and event-free survival, TRR continues to be a very effective surgical option. VSSR also seems to be a good option for the first 10 to 15 years following surgery in MFS patients. The choice of procedure depends upon available expertise, patients' choice, feasibility of anticoagulation, possibility of pregnancy, and lifestyle of the patient. Aortic root morphology and state of valve cusps also affect the decision making. In recent times, personalized external aortic root support (PEARS) with a macroporous mesh sleeve has also emerged as a promising alternative to aortic root replacement. All these patients need close monitoring for whole life after surgical intervention.
23624982	treat|@CHEMICAL_Polyethylene_Terephthalates|@DISEASE_Marfan_Syndrome	External aortic root support: a histological and mechanical study in sheep.OBJECTIVES: Personalized external aortic root support has completed initial evaluation and has technology appraisal in the UK for patients with Marfan syndrome for use as an alternative to root replacement. Its long-term success in preventing aortic dissection remains uncertain. Here, we report a study in sheep to establish whether the externally supporting mesh, as used clinically, is biologically incorporated. The strength of the resulting mesh/artery composite has been tested. METHODS: The carotid artery of growing sheep (n=6) was enclosed in a mesh sleeve made of a polymer, polyethylene terephthalate. After a predefined interval of 4-6 months, a length of the artery was excised, including the sleeved and unsleeved portions, and was stress tested and examined histologically. RESULTS: One animal died of pneumonia 7 days after implantation. Comparing sleeved with normal segments, the overall thickness was increased and there was a fibrotic sheet in the periarterial space. The overall vessel wall architecture was preserved in all specimens. Although media thickness of ensleeved arteries was smaller and in one animal mild oedema was found in one quadrant of the outer part of the media. There was a significant increase in stiffness and maximum tensile strength of the supported segments compared with normal arterial tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Polyethylene terephthalate mesh, as used for the external support of the dilated aortic root in Marfan syndrome, becomes incorporated in the periadventitial tissue of the carotid artery of sheep. Limited thinning of the media, without any signs of inflammation or medial necrosis, was visible. There was a significantly greater tensile strength in the carotid artery/mesh composite compared with the unsleeved carotid artery.
1922850	treat|@CHEMICAL_Polypropylenes|@DISEASE_Hernia_Inguinal ;treat|@CHEMICAL_Polyethylene_Terephthalates|@DISEASE_Hernia_Inguinal	When to use mesh in inguinal hernia repair.With people living longer today, averaging 73 years old, the type of patients with inguinal hernias are different than in the past. At the present time, to avoid the high incidence of recurrence due to the aged and weakened tissue component of the groin area, we reinforce the posterior wall of the inguinal canal with Mersilene (dacron) mesh. Most surgeons agree to use a prosthetic mesh in recurrent inguinal hernia repairs. Moreover, sometimes it is necessary to use mesh in patients with connective tissue disorders like Ehlers syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and acquired absence of the posterior wall fascia transversalis. Currently, polypropylene and dacron mesh are the most satisfactory, since they are readily available and become well incorporated by connective tissue.
20007995		Manufacturing and placing a bespoke support for the Marfan aortic root: description of the method and technical results and status at one year for the first ten patients.Fatal aortic dissection commonly occurs in Marfan syndrome. Prevention currently relies on elective replacement of the aortic root. We are evaluating the placement of a manufactured, bespoke external support derived from a computer aided design in a prospective study. In the first ten patients, measurements were made consistently of the ascending aorta at the level of closure of the aortic valve cusps from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies taken preoperatively and at fixed intervals thereafter. Before and after images were presented for measurement amongst duplicate images of 37 unoperated Marfan patients to permit assessment of intra-observer measurement reproducibility. All images were presented in random sequence to a radiologist unaware of the research question. The largest difference between the preoperative measurement and that made at least one year after surgery was determined. All patients had surgery as planned without complications and were alive at one year. In eight of the ten patients, the largest observed change was a marked reduction in aortic root diameter. The primary objective of this surgery was achieved in each case, reinforcing the ascending aorta whilst leaving the native aortic valve intact and conserving the blood/endothelium interface.

30165980		External Aortic Root Support to Prevent Aortic Dilatation in Patients With Marfan Syndrome.BACKGROUND: Personalized external aortic root support (PEARS) was introduced in 2004 for prevention of aortic root dilatation in Marfan patients. The individual's aortic root is replicated by 3-dimensional printing. A polymer mesh sleeve is manufactured, which is implanted with the aim to support and stabilize the aortic wall. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess effectiveness of PEARS for prevention of aortic root dilatation in Marfan patients. METHODS: A total of 24 consecutive Marfan patients operated 2004 to 2012 were prospectively monitored with magnetic resonance imaging. Following a pre-defined protocol, baseline and follow-up aorta measurements were made in a blinded random sequence. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 33 +- 13.3 years (range: 16 to 58 years), and the mean aortic root diameter was 45 +- 2.8 mm (range: 41 to 52 mm). Follow-up was 6.3 +- 2.6 years. There was no increase in the aortic root and ascending aorta diameters, but there was a tendency toward reduction: annulus diameter 28.9 +- 2.3 mm to 28.5 +- 2.4 mm (change -0.39 mm, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.05 to 0.27 mm), sinus of Valsalva diameter 44.9 +- 2.9 mm to 44.5 +- 3.0 mm (change -0.37 mm, 95% CI: -1.23 to 0.51 mm), and ascending aorta diameter 32.4 +- 3.6 mm to 32.3 +- 3.7 mm (change -0.10 mm, 95% CI: -0.92 to 0.74 mm). In the same period, the descending aorta diameter increased from 22.9 +- 2.4 mm to 24.2 +- 3.0 mm (change 1.32 mm, 95% CI: 0.70 to 1.94 mm; p < 0.001) with a tendency toward increase in aortic arch diameter 24.1 +- 2.0 mm to 24.5 +- 2.8 mm (change 0.41 mm, 95% CI: -0.56 to 1.37 mm). CONCLUSIONS: PEARS is effective in stabilizing the aortic root and preventing its dilatation. It is a viable alternative for prevention of aortic root dissection in Marfan patients.
