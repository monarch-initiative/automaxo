input_text: Aortic root surgery in Marfan syndrome.Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal
  dominant connective disease etiologically related with FBN-1 gene mutation. The
  altered microfibril protein structure result in characteristic cardiovascular abnormalities
  including aortic root dilatation, aortic root aneurysms, and aortic dissections.
  Aortic root aneurysms and subsequent dissection are the major causes of reduced
  life expectancy in MFS patients. Prophylactic aortic root replacement has improved
  the survival of patients with MFS. Elective root replacement carries very low mortality
  and morbidity. Emergency root replacement for dissection is accompanied with higher
  early mortality and late deaths/interventions. Both the techniques of aortic root
  replacement, total root replacement (TRR) with a prosthetic valved conduit, and
  valve-sparing root replacement (VSRR) yield excellent early and late results. Considering
  the low risk of prosthetic valve-related events, the improved long-term survival,
  and event-free survival, TRR continues to be a very effective surgical option. VSSR
  also seems to be a good option for the first 10 to 15 years following surgery in
  MFS patients. The choice of procedure depends upon available expertise, patients'
  choice, feasibility of anticoagulation, possibility of pregnancy, and lifestyle
  of the patient. Aortic root morphology and state of valve cusps also affect the
  decision making. In recent times, personalized external aortic root support (PEARS)
  with a macroporous mesh sleeve has also emerged as a promising alternative to aortic
  root replacement. All these patients need close monitoring for whole life after
  surgical intervention.
