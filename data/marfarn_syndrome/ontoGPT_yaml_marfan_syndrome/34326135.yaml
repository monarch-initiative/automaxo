input_text: 'Personalised external aortic root support for elective treatment of aortic
  root dilation in 200 patients.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In personalised external
  aortic root support (PEARS), a custom-made, macroporous mesh is used to stabilise
  a dilated aortic root and prevent dissection, primarily in patients with genetically
  driven aortopathies. Data are needed on the safety and postoperative incidence of
  aortic events. METHODS: We present a multicentre cohort study evaluating the first
  200 consecutive patients (median age 33 years) undergoing surgery with an intention
  to perform PEARS for aortic root dilatation in 23 centres between 2004 and 2019.
  Perioperative outcomes were collected prospectively while clinical follow-up was
  retrieved retrospectively. Median follow-up was 21.2 months. RESULTS: The main indication
  was Marfan syndrome (73.5%) and the most frequent concomitant procedure was mitral
  valve repair (10%). An intervention for myocardial ischaemia or coronary injury
  was needed in 11 patients, 1 case resulting in perioperative death. No ascending
  aortic dissections were observed in 596 documented postoperative patient years.
  Late reoperation was performed in 3 patients for operator failure to achieve complete
  mesh coverage. Among patients with at least mild aortic regurgitation (AR) preoperatively,
  68% had no or trivial AR at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the clinical
  history of the first 200 patients to undergo PEARS. To date, aortic dissection has
  not been observed in the restrained part of the aorta, yet long-term follow-up is
  needed to confirm the potential of PEARS to prevent dissection. While operative
  mortality is low, the reported coronary complications reflect the learning curve
  of aortic root surgery in patients with connective tissue disease. PEARS may stabilise
  or reduce aortic regurgitation.'
