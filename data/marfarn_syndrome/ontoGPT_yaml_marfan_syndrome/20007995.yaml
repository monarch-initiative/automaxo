input_text: 'Manufacturing and placing a bespoke support for the Marfan aortic root:
  description of the method and technical results and status at one year for the first
  ten patients.Fatal aortic dissection commonly occurs in Marfan syndrome. Prevention
  currently relies on elective replacement of the aortic root. We are evaluating the
  placement of a manufactured, bespoke external support derived from a computer aided
  design in a prospective study. In the first ten patients, measurements were made
  consistently of the ascending aorta at the level of closure of the aortic valve
  cusps from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies taken preoperatively and at
  fixed intervals thereafter. Before and after images were presented for measurement
  amongst duplicate images of 37 unoperated Marfan patients to permit assessment of
  intra-observer measurement reproducibility. All images were presented in random
  sequence to a radiologist unaware of the research question. The largest difference
  between the preoperative measurement and that made at least one year after surgery
  was determined. All patients had surgery as planned without complications and were
  alive at one year. In eight of the ten patients, the largest observed change was
  a marked reduction in aortic root diameter. The primary objective of this surgery
  was achieved in each case, reinforcing the ascending aorta whilst leaving the native
  aortic valve intact and conserving the blood/endothelium interface.'
