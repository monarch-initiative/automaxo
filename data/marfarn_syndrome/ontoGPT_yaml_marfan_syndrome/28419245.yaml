input_text: 'Support of the aortic wall: a histological study in sheep comparing a
  macroporous mesh with low-porosity vascular graft of the same polyethylene terephthalate
  material.OBJECTIVES: Wrapping with various materials was an early treatment for
  aortic aneurysms. Wrapping with low-porosity vascular grafts has been associated
  with graft migration and vascular erosion. An alternative is to use a macroporous
  mesh (MPM) made of the same polymer (polyethylene terephalate). We compared the
  histological outcome 1 year after wrapping sheep aortas with low-porosity grafts
  versus MPM fabrics. METHODS: The 2 different fabrics were wrapped around the aorta
  of 3 sheep. After 1 year the aortas were excised. The 2 wrapped segments of aorta
  were compared with each other and control aorta. Histological examinations and measurements
  were made of the layers of the aortic wall in 36 prespecified locations in each
  of the 3 sheep. RESULTS: Both fabrics were consistently surrounded by foreign body
  reaction and well-vascularized fibrosis. This was more pronounced with the low-porosity
  vascular graft material which was poorly incorporated and caused buckling at the
  transition between wrapped and unwrapped aorta. Conversely, the MPM was fully incorporated,
  resulting in a composite mesh/biological aortic wall. There was reduction of medial
  thickness with both materials but it was locally more extreme due to the corrugations
  in the vascular graft material. The findings were consistent between sampled locations
  and were similar in the 3 animals. CONCLUSIONS: The different porosity and rigidity
  of the materials influences their incorporation into the aortic wall. The incorporation
  of the pliable MPM precludes the complications of migration and erosion which are
  seen after wrapping with low-porosity prosthetic vascular graft material.'
