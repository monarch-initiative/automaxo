input_text: 'Management and Outcomes of Aortic Dissection in Pregnancy with Marfan
  Syndrome: A Systematic Review.BACKGROUND: In Marfan Syndrome (MFS), aortic dilatation
  is one of the main cardiovascular manifestations which deteriorate due to the physiological
  changes during pregnancy. We aimed to assess the up-to-date management and outcomes
  of aortic root dilation and dissection (AoD) in pregnancy with MFS. PATIENTS AND
  METHODS: A systematic review was conducted and reported according to the Preferred
  Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Original studies
  published between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2018 and which described the
  management and/or outcomes of AoD during or after pregnancy in women with MFS were
  included. Literature searches were conducted. The PubMed search was performed using
  terms "Marfan Syndrome" [Mesh] and "Pregnancy" [Mesh] whereas the Google Scholar
  search was for "Marfan" and "Pregnancy", all words anywhere in the article. RESULTS:
  The literature search yielded 177 articles on PubMed and 13,900 articles on Google
  Scholar. Assessment of full-text articles for eligibility after removal of duplicates
  from both databases yielded 12 eligible studies to be included in the final review.
  CONCLUSION: Women with MFS are at high risk of aortic dissection during pregnancy
  and women with aortic root 41-45 mm should consider avoiding pregnancy. Guideline-specific
  management of aortic aneurysms in pregnancy will reduce the risk of dissection.
  Diagnosis and Management of MFS need a multidisciplinary approach and team that
  should start working early in pregnancy. Further studies are needed to optimize
  medical and surgical approaches in addition to preconception counselling in highrisk
  subjects.'
