38171021	The role of hypermutation and collateral sensitivity in antimicrobial resistance diversity of <i>287</i> populations in MONDO:0009061.Upon diseaseD007239 in the MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061) lung, <i>287</i> rapidly acquires genetic mutations, especially in genes involved in antimicrobial resistance (AMR), often resulting in diverse, treatment-resistant populations. However, the role of bacterial population diversity within the context of chronic diseaseD007239 is still poorly understood. In this study, we found that hypermutator strains of <i>287</i> in the MONDO:0009061 lung undergoing treatment with tobramycin evolved increased sensitivity to tobramycin relative to non-hypermutators within the same population. This finding suggests that antimicrobial treatment may only exert weak selection pressure on <i>287</i> populations in the MONDO:0009061 lung. We further found no evidence for collateral sensitivity in these clinical populations, suggesting that collateral sensitivity may not be a robust, naturally occurring phenomenon for this microbe.
38169295	An <i>in vitro</i> medium for modeling diseaseD064806 associated with MONDO:0009061.MONDO:0009061 is an MONDO:0003847 that disrupts ion transport at mucosal surfaces, leading to mucus accumulation and altered physiology of both the lungs and the intestines, among other organs, with the resulting altered environment contributing to an imbalance of microbial communities. Culture media representative of the MONDO:0009061 airway have been developed and validated; however, no such medium exists for modeling the MONDO:0009061 intestine. Here, we develop and validate a first-generation culture medium inclusive of features that are altered in the MONDO:0009061 colon. Our findings suggest this novel medium, called MONDO:0009061-MiPro, as a maintenance medium for MONDO:0009061 gut microbiome samples and a flexible tool for studying key drivers of MONDO:0009061-associated diseaseD064806.
38206016	The mechanism of action of auranofin analogs in <i>95486</i> revealed by chemogenomic profiling.The 87882 is a group of multidrug-resistant bacteria that can cause diseaseD007239 in the lungs of people with the MONDO:0003847, MONDO:0009061. Specifically, the bacterium 95486 can cause severe diseaseD007239, reducing lung function and leading to a devastating type of HP:0100806, MONDO:0043953. This bacterium currently does not have an accepted antibiotic treatment plan because of the wide range of antibiotic resistance. Here, we further the research on auranofin analogs as antimicrobials by finding the mechanism of action of these potent bactericidal compounds, using a powerful technique called BarSeq, to find the global response of the cell when exposed to an antimicrobial.
38231535	NorA efflux pump mediates <i>1280</i> response to <i>287</i> pyocyanin diseaseD064420.Endogenous transporters protect <i>1280</i> against antibiotics and also contribute to bacterial defense from environmental toxins. We evaluated the effect of overexpression of four efflux pumps, NorA, NorB, NorC, and Tet38, on <i>1280</i> survival following exposure to pyocyanin (PYO) of <i>287</i>, using a well diffusion assay. We measured the PYO-created inhibition zone and found that only an overexpression of NorA reduced <i>1280</i> susceptibility to pyocyanin killing. The MIC<sub>PYO</sub> of the NorA overexpressor increased threefold compared to that of wild-type RN6390 and was reduced 2.5-fold with reserpine, suggesting that increased NorA efflux caused PYO resistance. The PYO-created inhibition zone of a <i>DnorA</i> mutant was consistently larger than that of a plasmid-borne NorA overexpressor. PYO also produced a modest increase in <i>norA</i> expression (1.8-fold at 0.25 ug/mL PYO) that gradually decreased with increasing PYO concentrations. Well diffusion assays carried out using <i>287</i> showed that <i>DnorA</i> mutant was less susceptible to killing by PYO-deficient mutants PA14<i><sub>phzM</sub></i> and PA14<i><sub>phzS</sub></i> than to killing by PA14. NorA overexpression led to reduced killing by all tested <i>287</i>. We evaluated the NorA-PYO interaction using a collection of 22 clinical isolates from adult and pediatric MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061) 9606, which included both <i>1280</i> (CF-SA) and <i>287</i> (CF-PA). We found that when isolated alone, CF-PA and CF-SA expressed varying levels of PYO and <i>norA</i> transcripts, but all four CF-PA/CF-SA pairs isolated concurrently from MONDO:0009061 9606 produced a low level of PYO and low <i>norA</i> transcript levels, respectively, suggesting a partial adaptation of the two bacteria in circumstances of persistent co-colonization.
38217903	diseaseD055370 induced by ozone exposure in female 10090: Potential roles of the gut and lung microbes.Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) is one of the most harmful pollutants affecting health. However, the potential effects of O<sub>3</sub> exposure on microbes in the gut-lung axis related to diseaseD055370 remain elusive. In this study, female 10090 were exposed to 0-, 0.5- and 1-ppm O<sub>3</sub> for 28 days, followed by routine blood tests, lung function tests and histopathological examination of the colon, nasal cavity and lung. 10090 faeces and lungs were collected for 16s rRNA sequencing to assess the overall microbiological profile and screen for key differential enriched microbes (DEMs). The key DEMs in faecal samples were Butyricimonas, Rikenellaceae RC9 and Escherichia-Shigella, whereas those in lung samples were DNF00809, 332102, Bryobacter, Family XII AD3011 group, Sharpea, ncbi76915 and unclassified Phycisphaeraceae. After a search in microbe-disease databases, these key DEMs were found to be associated with MONDO:0005275 such as MONDO:0021117, MONDO:0009061, MONDO:0005249, MONDO:0005002, MONDO:0100130 and MONDO:0004822. Subsequently, we used transcriptomic data from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with exposure conditions similar to those in this study to cross-reference with Comparative Toxicogenomic Database (CTD). ncbi16193 and ncbi20296 were identified as the key causative genes and were validated. The findings of this study suggest that exposure to O<sub>3</sub> leads to significant changes in the microbial composition of the gut and lungs. These changes are associated with increased levels of diseaseD007249 factors in the lungs and diseaseD003072, resulting in an increased risk of MONDO:0005275. Altogether, this study provides novel insights into the role of microbes present in the gut-lung axis in O<sub>3</sub> exposure-induced diseaseD055370.
38201212	Paralogue-Specific Roles of ncbi7341 and SUMO2/3 in Protein Quality Control and Associated Diseases.Small ubiquitin-related modifiers (SUMOs) function as post-translational protein modifications and regulate nearly every aspect of cellular function. While a single ubiquitin protein is expressed across eukaryotic organisms, multiple SUMO paralogues with distinct biomolecular properties have been identified in plants and vertebrates. Five SUMO paralogues have been characterized in 9606, with ncbi7341, ncbi6613 and ncbi6612 being the best studied. ncbi6613 and ncbi6612 share 97% protein sequence homology (and are thus referred to as SUMO2/3) but only 47% homology with ncbi7341. To date, thousands of putative sumoylation substrates have been identified thanks to advanced proteomic techniques, but the identification of ncbi7341- and SUMO2/3-specific modifications and their unique functions in physiology and pathology are not well understood. The SUMO2/3 paralogues play an important role in proteostasis, converging with ubiquitylation to mediate protein degradation. This function is achieved primarily through SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligases (STUbLs), which preferentially bind and ubiquitylate poly-SUMO2/3 modified proteins. Effects of the ncbi7341 paralogue on protein solubility and aggregation independent of STUbLs and proteasomal degradation have also been reported. Consistent with these functions, sumoylation is implicated in multiple 9606 diseases associated with disturbed proteostasis, and a broad range of pathogenic proteins have been identified as ncbi7341 and SUMO2/3 substrates. A better understanding of paralogue-specific functions of ncbi7341 and SUMO2/3 in cellular protein quality control may therefore provide novel insights into disease pathogenesis and therapeutic innovation. This review summarizes current understandings of the roles of sumoylation in protein quality control and associated diseases, with a focus on the specific effects of ncbi7341 and SUMO2/3 paralogues.
38197494	A systematic review of MONDO:0005302 in people living with MONDO:0009061.There is a lack of research that has focused on MONDO:0005302 (MONDO:0005302) in people with MONDO:0009061 (pwCF). Given MONDO:0005302 is associated with diseaseD003072, exploring MONDO:0005302 in the context of living with MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061) is of great importance. The purpose of the current systematic review was to examine MONDO:0005302 in pwCF across the lifespan in terms of its prevalence, its impact on various health outcomes, and treatments for managing MONDO:0005302. This systematic review followed the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Articles reporting studies of any design that focused on MONDO:0005302 in pwCF were included. Studies were excluded if they did not meet this criterion and if they were written in languages other than English. PsycINFO, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases were searched. Search items were based on three concepts: (1) terms related to MONDO:0009061, (2) terms related to MONDO:0005302, and (3) terms related to age. Ten studies were included in this systematic review. Reported prevalence rates of MONDO:0005302 in pwCF ranged from 5.26% to 21.9%. The reported relationships between MONDO:0005302 and MONDO:0009061 and other health outcomes is inconsistent. In terms of treatment considerations, pharmacological interventions and behavioural strategies for managing MONDO:0005302 in the context of living with MONDO:0009061 have been reported as being successful. Additional research is needed to further explore MONDO:0005302 in the MONDO:0009061 population and health variables that may be associated with MONDO:0009061 prognosis.
38191649	A revised nomenclature for the 9446 family of protein kinases.The 9446 family of protein kinases has gained much interest in recent years as they are involved in a variety of cellular processes including regulation of axonal transport and endosomal trafficking, modulation of synaptic functions, memory and learning, and they are centrally placed in several intracellular signalling pathways. Numerous studies have also implicated role of the 9446 kinases in the development and progression of a wide range of MONDO:0005070, MONDO:0009061, and MONDO:0005559. However, parallel discoveries and inaccurate prediction of their kinase activity have resulted in a confusing and misleading nomenclature of these proteins. Herein, a group of international scientists with expertise in 9446 family of protein kinases set forth a novel nomenclature to rectify this problem and ultimately help the scientific community by providing consistent information about these molecules.
38171775	Regulation of Chloride Channels by Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor-Induced a-Defensin 5.Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ncbi1956-TKIs) are used to treat MONDO:0005233 with ncbi1956 mutations. However, first-generation erlotinib and second-generation afatinib often cause MONDO:0001673, which may develop because of the association between ncbi1956-TKIs and the disease160800 or abnormalities in the intestinal microbiota due to disruption of the intestinal immune system. As reports on the effects of ncbi1956-TKIs on intestinal immunity are lacking, we aimed to determine whether the intestinal immune system is involved in the molecular effects of ncbi1956-TKIs on chloride channels using 0025 cells. Initially, we evaluated the association of chloride channels with ncbi1670 (ncbi1670), a marker of intestinal immunity. Erlotinib and afatinib significantly increased the extracellularly secreted ncbi1670 level and ncbi55054 and ncbi7494 transcript levels, indicative of enhanced granule exocytosis. Conversely, intracellular ncbi1670 and ncbi7099 protein expression and ncbi7124 transcript levels decreased significantly, suggesting that ncbi7099 suppression repressed ncbi1670 production. Furthermore, among the chloride channels, ncbi1670 was found to significantly increase the transcript levels of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulators. These results indicate that ncbi1670 plays a significant role in the mechanism of disease160800-mediated MONDO:0001673 induced by ncbi1956-TKIs. Therefore, we successfully elucidated the potential host action of ncbi1670 in MONDO:0005070 therapy for the first time.
38229125	Evaluation of the efficiency of nanomicellar formulation of fat-soluble vitamins in 9606 with MONDO:0009061: the study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: MONDO:0009061 is an MONDO:0003847, which is caused by the ncbi1080 protein defects due to mutations in the ncbi1080 gene. Along with CFTR dysfunction, MONDO:0001684 plays a key role in persistent MONDO:0020598 in MONDO:0009061 9606; therefore, deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) is still a therapeutic challenge. Even with efficient pancreatic enzyme medication and MONDO:0009061-specific vitamins, many 9606 with MONDO:0009061 have fat-soluble vitamins deficiency. The present study aims to evaluate the efficiency of nanomicelle formulation of fat-soluble vitamins in children with MONDO:0009061 in order to achieve the appropriate serum levels of these vitamins. METHODS: This prospective, single-blind control trial will be conducted at the Akbar Children's Hospital in Mashhad, Iran. 9606 with MONDO:0009061 will be enrolled based on the eligibility criteria. The control group will receive the standard formulation of fat-soluble vitamins similar to the routine MONDO:0009061 treatment, and for the intervention group, the nanomicelle formulation of fat-soluble vitamins will be administered for 3 months. The primary outcome of this study is the measurement of serum levels of fat-soluble vitamins. The secondary outcomes are clinical assessment by the Shwachman-Kulczycki score, anthropometrics, and quality of life. Outcomes will be assessed before and after 3 months. DISCUSSION: Due to persistent fat-soluble vitamin deficiency in MONDO:0009061, the nanomicelle formulation could be proposed as a new delivery method of fat-soluble vitamins in the treatment of MONDO:0009061. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials IRCT20220415054541N1. Registered on July 23, 2022.
38233247	Standards for the care of people with MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061); recognising and addressing MONDO:0009061 health issues.This is the third in a series of four papers updating the European MONDO:0009061 Society (ECFS) standards for the care of people with MONDO:0009061. This paper focuses on recognising and addressing MONDO:0009061 health issues. The guidance was produced with wide stakeholder engagement, including people from the MONDO:0009061 community, using an evidence-based framework. Authors contributed sections, and summary statements which were reviewed by a Delphi consultation. Monitoring and treating diseaseD007239, diseaseD007249 and diseaseD018450 remains important, despite the widespread availability of ncbi1080 modulators and their accompanying health improvements. Extrapulmonary MONDO:0009061-specific health issues persist, such as MONDO:0005015, MONDO:0005154, MONDO:0005381, diseaseD007669 and other renal issues, and MONDO:0004565. These health issues require multidisciplinary care with input from the relevant specialists. MONDO:0005070 is more common in people with MONDO:0009061 compared to the general population, and requires regular screening. The MONDO:0009061 life journey requires mental and emotional adaptation to psychosocial and physical challenges, with support from the MONDO:0009061 team and the MONDO:0009061 psychologist. This is particularly important when life gets challenging, with disease progression requiring increased treatments, breathing support and potentially transplantation. Planning for end of life remains a necessary aspect of care and should be discussed openly, honestly, with sensitivity and compassion for the person with MONDO:0009061 and their family. MONDO:0009061 teams should proactively recognise and address MONDO:0009061-specific health issues, and support mental and emotional wellbeing while accompanying people with MONDO:0009061 and their families on their life journey.

38169270	Structural basis for specific inhibition of salicylate synthase from 36809.Blocking iron uptake and metabolism has been emerging as a promising therapeutic strategy for the development of novel antimicrobial compounds. Like all mycobacteria, 36809 (36809) has evolved several countermeasures to scavenge iron from host carrier proteins, including the production of siderophores, which play a crucial role in these processes. In this study, we solved, for the first time, the crystal structure of Mab-SaS, the first enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of siderophores. Moreover, we screened a small, focused library and identified a compound exhibiting a potent inhibitory effect against Mab-SaS (IC<sub>50</sub>   2 uM). Its binding mode was investigated by means of Induced Fit Docking simulations, performed on the crystal structure presented herein. Furthermore, diseaseD064420 data and pharmacokinetic predictions revealed the safety and drug-likeness of this class of compounds. Finally, the crystallographic data were used to optimize the model for future virtual screening campaigns. Taken together, the findings of our study pave the way for the identification of potent Mab-SaS inhibitors, based on both established and unexplored chemotypes.
38169175	ESPEN-ESPGHAN-ECFS guideline on nutrition care for MONDO:0009061.BACKGROUND: Nutritional status is paramount in MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061) and is directly correlated with morbidity and mortality. The first ESPEN-ESPGHAN-ECFS guidelines on nutrition care for infants, children, and adults with MONDO:0009061 were published in 2016. An update to these guidelines is presented. METHODS: The study was developed by an international multidisciplinary working group in accordance with officially accepted standards. Literature since 2016 was reviewed, PICO questions were discussed and the GRADE system was utilized. Statements were discussed and submitted for on-line voting by the Working Group and by all ESPEN members. RESULTS: The Working Group updated the nutritional guidelines including assessment and management at all ages. Supplementation of vitamins and pancreatic enzymes remains largely the same. There are expanded chapters on pregnancy, MONDO:0009061, and MONDO:0009061, MONDO:0005381, nutritional and mineral supplements, and probiotics. There are new chapters on nutrition with highly effective modulator therapies and nutrition after organ transplantation.

38248722	Assessment of Some Risk Factors and Biological Predictors in the diseaseD000094024 in MONDO:0004766 9606.diseaseD000094024 or diseaseD000094025 (diseaseD000094025) refers to the prolongation of symptoms in people who have been diseaseD007239 with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Some meta-analysis studies have shown that 9606 with comorbidities, such as MONDO:0005015, HP:0001513 or MONDO:0005044, have severe complications after diseaseD007239 with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The presence of chronic MONDO:0005087 such as MONDO:0004979, MONDO:0005002, MONDO:0005149 or MONDO:0009061 increases the risk of developing severe forms of the diseaseD000086382. The risk of developing the severe form of diseaseD000086382 was observed in 9606 with MONDO:0004979 being treated with corticosteroids, but also in those hospitalized with severe MONDO:0004979. The biological variables determined in 9606 with diseaseD000094025 diseaseD007239 showed changes, especially in the hematological parameters, but also in some diseaseD007249 markers. The aim of this study was to investigate some biological predictors in diseaseD000094024 in 9606 with MONDO:0004979 and various comorbidities. In the case of 9606 diagnosed with moderate and severe forms of diseaseD000086382, the variation in biological tests has shown high concentrations for serum glucose, lactate dehydrogenase and ncbi1401. Additionally, the calculation of the relative risk (RR) based on the associated comorbidities in 9606 with diseaseD000094025 points to higher values for 9606 with MONDO:0004979, MONDO:0005044, MONDO:0005015 and HP:0001513 (RR moderate/severe form = 0.98/1.52), compared to 9606 with diseaseD000094025 and MONDO:0004979 (RR moderate/severe form = 0.36/0.63). Based on the statistical results, it can be concluded that the ncbi2875 (ALT) activity (<i>p</i> = 0.006) and the age of 9606 (<i>p</i> = 0.001) are the variables that contribute the most to the separation of the four classes of comorbidities considered.
38206973	MRI of MONDO:0001735 in Children with MONDO:0016575 Compared to Children with MONDO:0009061.RATIONALE: MONDO:0016575 (MONDO:0016575) and MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061) are characterized by inherited impaired mucociliary clearance leading to chronic progressive MONDO:0005275 as well as chronic diseaseD000092562 (diseaseD000092562). Both diseases share morphological and functional commonalities on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of lungs and paranasal sinuses, but comparative MRI studies are lacking. OBJECTIVES: Does MONDO:0016575 show different associations of pulmonary with MONDO:0001735 on MRI as well as with lung function tests in infants to adolescents in comparison to children with MONDO:0009061? METHODS: 18 children with MONDO:0016575 (median age 9.5 [3.4-12.7]y, range 0-18y) and 36 age-matched, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator modulator (CFTRm)-naive children with MONDO:0009061 (median age 9.4 [3.4-13.2]y, range 0-18y) underwent same-session chest and paranasal sinus MRI, as well as spirometry (ppFEV1) and multiple breath washout (lung clearance index [LCI] z-score). MONDO:0001735 were assessed using previously validated chest MRI and diseaseD000092562-MRI scoring systems. RESULTS: Mean chest MRI global score was similar in children with MONDO:0016575 and MONDO:0009061 (15.0 [13.5-20.8] vs. 15.0 [9.0-15.0], P=0.601). Consolidations were more prevalent and severe in children with MONDO:0016575 (56% vs. 25% and 1.0 [0.0-2.8] vs. 0.0 [0.0-0.3], respectively; P<0.05). The chest MRI global score correlated moderately with ppFEV1 in both, children with MONDO:0016575 and with MONDO:0009061 (r=-0.523 and -0.687, P<0.01), and with LCI in MONDO:0009061 (r=0.650, P<0.001) but not in MONDO:0016575 (r=0.353, P=0.196). diseaseD000092562-MRI sum score and mucopyocele subscore were lower in children with MONDO:0016575 than with MONDO:0009061 (27.5 [26.3-32.0] vs. 37.0 [37.8-40.0] and 2.0 [0.0-2.0] vs. 7.5 [4.8-9.0], respectively; P<0.01). diseaseD000092562-MRI sum score did not correlate with chest MRI scores in MONDO:0016575 (r=0.075 to 0.157, P=0.557-0.788), while it correlated moderately with MRI morphology score in MONDO:0009061 (r=0.437, P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: MRI detects differences in MONDO:0001735 between children with MONDO:0016575 and with MONDO:0009061. MONDO:0005275 does not correlate with diseaseD000092562 in MONDO:0016575 but in MONDO:0009061.
38173934	"Club cell ncbi12912 regulates the goblet cell transcriptional network and pro-ncbi100508689 effects of ncbi16176<b>Introduction:</b> Club cells are precursors for mucus-producing goblet cells. Interleukin 1b (ncbi16176) is an diseaseD007249 mediator with pro-ncbi100508689 activities that increases the number of mucus-producing goblet cells. ncbi16176-mediated ncbi100508689 production in MONDO:0004991 cells requires activation of the ncbi1385 (ncbi1385). Whether the pro-ncbi100508689 activities of ncbi16176 require club cell ncbi12912 is unknown. <b>Methods:</b> We challenged male 10090 with conditional loss of club cell <i>ncbi12912</i> and wild type littermates with intra-airway ncbi16176 or vehicle. Secondarily, we studied 9606 ""club cell-like"" 1556 cells. <b>Results:</b> ncbi16176 increased whole lung mRNA of secreted (<i>ncbi17833, ncbi74180</i>) and tethered (<i>ncbi17829, ncbi140474</i>) mucins independent of genotype. However, loss of club cell ncbi12912 increased whole lung mRNA of <i>member RAS oncogene family (ncbi19340)</i>, decreased mRNA of the <i>muscarinic receptor 3 (ncbi12671)</i> and prevented ncbi16176 mediated increases in <i>purinergic receptor P2Y, (ncbi18442)</i> mRNA. ncbi16176 increased the density of goblet cells containing neutral mucins in wildtype 10090 but not in 10090 with loss of club cell ncbi12912. These findings suggested that club cell ncbi12912 regulated ncbi100508689 secretion. Loss of club cell ncbi1385 also prevented ncbi16176-mediated impairments in airway mechanics. Four days of pharmacologic ncbi1385 inhibition in 1556 cells increased mRNA abundance of <i>ncbi3170 (ncbi3170)</i>, a repressor of goblet cell expansion, and decreased mRNA expression of <i>ncbi25803 (ncbi25803)</i>, a driver of goblet cell expansion. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that ncbi1385 directly bound to the promoter region of <i>ncbi3170</i>, but not to the promoter region of <i>ncbi25803</i>. Treatment of 1556 cells with ncbi3553 increased cAMP levels, providing a direct link between ncbi3553 and ncbi1385 signaling. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our findings suggest that club cell ncbi1385 regulates the pro-ncbi100508689 properties of ncbi3553 through pathways likely involving ncbi3170."
38191360	The clinical characteristics of non-MONDO:0004822 9606 with positive serum MONDO:0005070 markers: a retrospective study.BACKGROUND: Serum MONDO:0005070 markers (STM), extensively used for the diagnosis, monitoring and prognostic assessment of MONDO:0005070, can be increased in some non-malignant MONDO:0005275. To date, there is a paucity of studies regarding the clinical characteristics of non-MONDO:0004822 9606 with positive STMs. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical characteristics and indicators of MONDO:0004822 with positive STMs. METHODS: The clinical data of 377 MONDO:0004822 9606 was retrospectively collected from January 2017 to December 2019 from Beijing Chaoyang Hospital. 9606 were divided into the STM negative group, the single STM positive group and the  2 STMs positive group according to the number of the positive STMs. The clinical characteristics are described and compared separately. The multivariate logistic regression analysis model was used to investigate the indicators regarding positive STMs. RESULTS: 9606 in the  2 STMs positive group were older (P = 0.015), had higher mMRC scores (P < 0.001) and developed higher fever (P = 0.027). Additionally, these 9606 also had lower ncbi213/Globulin Ratio (A/G), ncbi213 (ncbi213), prealbumin (PAB) (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, respectively) and higher CRP, ESR and Fbg (P < 0.001, P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). Age (OR 1.022, 95%CI 1.003-1.042; P = 0.026) and the number of affected lobes (OR 1.443, 95%CI 1.233-1.690; P < 0.001) were independently associated with one and   2 positive STMs in MONDO:0004822 9606. CONCLUSION: The  2 positive STMs are associated with a higher diseaseD007249 status and severer radiologic manifestations in MONDO:0004822 9606.
38169359	[MONDO:0009061 carrier screening: a Health technology assessment.].This project of Health technology assessment was aimed at defining the impacts of offering a MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061) carrier screening to the general population, compared to the current situation, where the test is offered to individuals at high-risk to give birth to a child with MONDO:0009061. Results revealed: i) a lack of robust and updated data; ii) a return on investment up to six years from the screening's introduction, despite important economic and organizational efforts; iii) a general positive attitude of healthcare professionals, 9606 with MONDO:0009061, families and general population; iv) possible issues related to the social impact.
38188360	Low-intensity ultrasound activates transmembrane chloride flow through ncbi1080.Ultrasound has been demonstrated to activate mechanosensitive channels, which is considered the main mechanism of ultrasound neuromodulation. Currently, all channels that have been shown to be sensitive to ultrasound are cation channels. In addition to cation channels, anion channels also play indispensable roles in neural function. However, there have been no research on ultrasound regulation of anion channels until now. If anion channels can be activated by ultrasound as well, they will inevitably lead to more versatility in ultrasound neuromodulation. ncbi1080 (ncbi1080) has been demonstrated to be a mechanically sensitive channel, mediating anionic transmembrane flow. To identify that ncbi1080 is sensitive to ultrasound, ncbi1080 was exogenously expressed in 0063 cells and was stimulated by low intensity ultrasound. Outward currents in ncbi1080-expressed 0063 cells were observed by using whole-cell patch clamp when ultrasound (0.8 MHz, 0.20 MPa) was delivered to these cells. These currents were abolished when the ncbi1080 inhibitor (GlyH101) was applied to the solution or chloride ions was cleared from the solution. Meanwhile, the amplitude of these currents increased when the ncbi1080 agonist (Forskolin) was applied. These results suggest that ultrasound stimuli can activate the ncbi1080 to mediate transmembrane flowing of chloride ions at the single cell level. These findings may expand the application of ultrasound in the neuromodulation field.
38214500	Inhibition of polymorphic MexXY-OprM efflux system in 287 clinical isolates by Berberine derivatives.The MexXY-OprM multidrug efflux pump (EP) in aminoglycosides resistant 287 is one of the major resistance mechanisms, which is often overexpressed in strains isolated from diseaseD002908 such as MONDO:0009061 [1-3]. In this research, we focused on the design of potential efflux pumps inhibitors, targeting MexY, the inner membrane component, in an allosteric site. Berberine [4] has been considered as lead molecule since we previously demonstrated its effectiveness in targeting MexY in laboratory reference strains [5,6]. Since this protein is often present in polymorphic variants in clinical strains, we sequenced and modeled all the mutated forms and we synthesized and evaluated by computational techniques, some berberine derivatives carrying an aromatic functionalization in its 13-C ring position. These compounds were tested in vitro against clinical 287 strains for antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity. In conclusion, the results demonstrated the importance of the aromatic moiety functionalization in exerting the EP inhibitory activity in synergy with the aminoglycoside tobramycin. More, we found that aminoacidic composition of MexY in different strains must be considered for predicting potential binding site and affects the different activity of berberine derivatives. Finally, the antibiofilm effect of these new EPIs is promising, particularly for o-CH3-berberine derivative.
38179878	Impact of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor on lipid and fat-soluble vitamin levels and association with body mass index.INTRODUCTION: ncbi1080 (ncbi1080) modulators improve gastrointestinal absorption of nutrients and may result in changes in body mass index (BMI), serum lipids, and fat-soluble vitamin levels. We hypothesized that serum lipids and vitamin levels would increase with ncbi1080 modulator therapy and that greater increase in lipids and vitamin levels would be related to greater increase in BMI. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed to evaluate the impact of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) on nutritional parameters, serum lipids, and fat-soluble vitamin levels. Pre-ETI values (<2 years prior) and post-ETI values (>1 month after) were compared. Linear regression was used to evaluate whether change in BMI is associated with the change in lipid and/or vitamin levels and whether modulator duration is associated with the degree of rise in lipid and/or vitamin levels. RESULTS: Adults and adolescents with MONDO:0009061 (n = 137) were evaluated before and 31-300 days after starting ETI. Median BMI (adults 21.9 vs. 23.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> ; adolescents 48 vs. 63 percentile) increased after initiation of ETI. Total cholesterol (126 vs. 154 mg/dL), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (63 vs. 78 mg/dL), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (84 vs. 102 mg/dL), and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (43 vs. 49 mg/dL) increased after ETI, while triglycerides and very low density lipoprotein did not change. Median values for vitamin D (34.5 vs. 38.0 ng/mL) and vitamin A (40.1 vs. 47.9 ug/dL) increased, while vitamin E did not change significantly. There was no significant correlation between BMI change or duration of modulator therapy with vitamin levels or lipid changes. CONCLUSION: After initiation of ETI therapy, serum lipids increased in our population, but most values remained within the normal range. Vitamins A and D levels increased post-ETI and no changes were noted in vitamin E. No significant correlation between the degree of BMI change and the magnitude of increase in lipids or vitamin levels was found.
38228208	Structural MONDO:0005359 in 10116 liver with diethylnitrosamine-induced MONDO:0021178.Growing evidence confirms associations between glycogen metabolic re-wiring and the development of MONDO:0007256. Previous studies showed that glycogen structure changes abnormally in MONDO:0005154 such as MONDO:0009061, MONDO:0005015, etc. However, few studies focus on glycogen molecular structural characteristics during MONDO:0007256 development, which is worthy of further exploration. In this study, a 10116 model with MONDO:0100192 induced by diethylnitrosamine (DEN) was successfully constructed, and diseaseC565485 structure was characterized. Compared with glycogen structure in the healthy 10116 liver, glycogen chain length distribution (CLD) shifts towards a short region. In contrast, glycogen particles were mainly present in small-sized b particles in DEN-damaged MONDO:0021074 10116 liver. Comparative transcriptomic analysis revealed significant expression changes of genes and pathways involved in MONDO:0100192. A combination of transcriptomic analysis, RT-qPCR, and western blot showed that the two genes, Gsy1 encoding glycogen synthase and ncbi288333 encoding glycogen branching enzyme, were significantly altered and might be responsible for the structural MONDO:0005359 in MONDO:0100192. Taken together, this study confirmed that MONDO:0100192 led to structural MONDO:0005359, which provided clues to the future development of novel drug targets for potential therapeutics of MONDO:0100192.
38197521	ncbi207 activator SC79 stimulates antibacterial nitric oxide generation in 9606 nasal epithelial cells in vitro.BACKGROUND: The role of ncbi207 in nasal immunity is unstudied. ncbi207 phosphorylates and activates ncbi4846 (ncbi4846) expressed in epithelial ciliated cells. Nitric oxide (NO) production by ciliated cells can have antibacterial and antiviral effects. Increasing nasal NO may be a useful antipathogen strategy in diseaseD000092562 (diseaseD000092562). We previously showed that small-molecule ncbi207 activator C4IC induces nasal cell NO production and suppresses ncbi3576 via the transcription factor ncbi4780. We hypothesized that SC79 NO production may additionally have antibacterial effects. METHODS: NO production was measured using fluorescent dye DAF-FM. We tested effects of SC79 during co-culture of 287 with primary nasal epithelial cells, using CFU counting and live-dead staining to quantify bacterial killing. Pharmacology determined the mechanism of SC79-induced NO production and tested dependence on ncbi207. RESULTS: SC79 induced dose-dependent, ncbi207-dependent NO production in nasal epithelial cells. The NO production required ncbi4846 and ncbi207. The NO released into the airway surface liquid killed 287. No diseaseD064420 (LDH release) or diseaseD007249 effects (IL8 transcription) were observed over 24 h. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data suggest multiple immune pathways are stimulated by SC79, with antipathogen effects. This in vitro pilot study suggests that a small-molecule ncbi207 activator may have clinical utility in diseaseD000092562 or respiratory other diseaseD007239 settings, warranting future in vivo studies.
38168711	Inference of MONDO:0005550 transmission through a relaxed bottleneck using multiple genomes per host.In recent times, pathogen genome sequencing has become increasingly used to investigate MONDO:0005550 outbreaks. When genomic data is sampled densely enough amongst diseaseD007239 individuals, it can help resolve who diseaseD007239 whom. However, transmission analysis cannot rely solely on a phylogeny of the genomes but must account for the within-host evolution of the pathogen, which blurs the relationship between phylogenetic and transmission trees. When only a single genome is sampled for each host, the uncertainty about who diseaseD007239 whom can be quite high. Consequently, transmission analysis based on multiple genomes of the same pathogen per host has a clear potential for delivering more precise results, even though it is more laborious to achieve. Here we present a new methodology that can use any number of genomes sampled from a set of individuals to reconstruct their transmission network. Furthermore, we remove the need for the assumption of a complete transmission bottleneck. We use simulated data to show that our method becomes more accurate as more genomes per host are provided, and that it can infer key MONDO:0005550 parameters such as the size of the transmission bottleneck, within-host growth rate, basic reproduction number and sampling fraction. We demonstrate the usefulness of our method in applications to real datasets from an outbreak of 287 amongst MONDO:0009061 9606 and a nosocomial outbreak of 573.
38219353	Different forms of MONDO:0000266: A pictorial essay.MONDO:0000266 is a group of diseaseD000785 affecting the lungs. The form of the disease mainly depends on the immune status of the 9606 and underlying conditions. diseaseD055744 usually affects immunocompromised 9606 - angio-invasive and airway-invasive forms are possible. MONDO:0005657 usually appears in mildly immunosuppressed or immunocompetent 9606 with underlying structural lung changes and may have diverse forms: simple aspergilloma, diseaseD055744, chronic MONDO:0000266, subacute diseaseD055744, MONDO:0005657 nodules and endobronchial aspergilloma. MONDO:0015243 is a hyper-reactivity reaction to 5052 species, and usually develops in MONDO:0004979 and MONDO:0009061 9606. The aim of this article is to comprehensively overview different forms of MONDO:0005657, their symptoms and underlying conditions and to present imaging findings.
38248425	A Path towards Timely diseaseD053717 Diagnosis: Proof-of-Concept Study on Pyocyanin Sensing with Cu-Mg Doped Graphene Oxide.In response to the urgent requirement for rapid, precise, and cost-effective detection in intensive care units (ICUs) for ventilated 9606, as well as the need to overcome the limitations of traditional detection methods, researchers have turned their attention towards advancing novel technologies. Among these, biosensors have emerged as a reliable platform for achieving accurate and early diagnoses. In this study, we explore the possibility of using Pyocyanin analysis for early detection of pathogens in diseaseD053717 (diseaseD053717) and lower MONDO:0024355 in ventilated 9606. To achieve this, we developed an electrochemical sensor utilizing a graphene oxide-copper oxide-doped MgO (<i>GO</i> - <i>Cu</i> - <i>Mgo</i>) (GCM) catalyst for Pyocyanin detection. Pyocyanin is a virulence factor in the phenazine group that is produced by <i>287</i> strains, leading to diseaseD007239 such as MONDO:0005249, MONDO:0100338, and MONDO:0009061. We additionally investigated the use of DNA aptamers for detecting Pyocyanin as a biomarker of <i>287</i>, a common causative agent of diseaseD053717. The results of this study indicated that electrochemical detection of Pyocyanin using a GCM catalyst shows promising potential for various applications, including clinical diagnostics and drug discovery.
38195272	Lung Transplantation in 9606 with MONDO:0009061: A Complex Task, A Changing Target.
38251347	A Novel Inhibitor against the Biofilms of MONDO:0006042.MONDO:0006042 (MONDO:0006042), previously classified as environmental microbes, have emerged as opportunistic pathogens causing MONDO:0024355 in immunocompromised hosts. The formation of the biofilm empowers MONDO:0006042 pathogens to escape from the immune response and antibiotic action, leading to treatment failures. NF1001 is a novel thiopeptide antibiotic first-in-class compound with potent activity against planktonic/replicating and biofilm forms of various MONDO:0006042 species. It is potent against both drug-sensitive and -resistant MONDO:0006042. It has demonstrated a concentration-dependent killing of replicating and intracellularly growing MONDO:0006042, and has inhibited and reduced the viability of MONDO:0006042 in biofilms. Combination studies using standard-of-care (SoC) drugs for MONDO:0006042 exhibited synergetic/additive effects, but no antagonism against both planktonic and biofilm populations of <i>36809</i> and <i>1764</i>. In summary, the activity of NF1001 alone or in combination with SoC drugs projects NF1001 as a promising candidate for the treatment of difficult-to-treat MONDO:0005275 (MONDO:0005180) and MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061) in 9606.
38168439	Strain-level characterization of health-associated bacterial consortia that colonize the 9606 gut during infancy.BACKGROUND: The 9606 gut microbiome develops rapidly during infancy, a key window of development coinciding with maturation of the adaptive immune system. However, little is known of the microbiome growth dynamics over the first few months of life and whether there are any generalizable patterns across 9606 populations. We performed metagenomic sequencing on stool samples (n=94) from a cohort of infants (n=15) at monthly intervals in the first six months of life, augmenting our dataset with seven published studies for a total of 4,441 metagenomes from 1,162 infants. RESULTS: Strain-level <i>de novo</i> analysis was used to identify 592 of the most abundant organisms in the infant gut microbiome. Previously unrecognized consortia were identified which exhibited highly correlated abundances across samples and were composed of diverse species spanning multiple genera. Analysis of a cohort of infants with MONDO:0009061 identified one such novel consortium of diverse <i>Enterobacterales</i> which was positively correlated with HP:0004324. While all studies showed an increased community stability during the first year of life, microbial dynamics varied widely in the first few months of life, both by study and by individual. CONCLUSION: By augmenting published metagenomic datasets with data from a newly established cohort we were able to identify novel groups of organisms that are correlated with measures of robust 9606 development. We hypothesize that the presence of these groups may impact 9606 health in aggregate in ways that individual species may not in isolation.
38233941	Lung clearance index short-term variability in MONDO:0009061: a pre-post pulmonary exacerbation study.BACKGROUND: Multiple Breath washout (MBW) represents an important tool to detect early a possible pulmonary exacerbation especially in MONDO:0009061. Lung clearance index (LCI) is the most commonly reported multiple breath washout (MBW) index and in the last years was used as management measure for evaluation. Our aim was to analyze clinical utility of LCI index variability in pulmonary exacerbation in CF after intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy. METHODS: A single-center study was conducted at CF Unit of Bambino Ges  9606's Hospital among hospitalized > 3 years 9606 for pulmonary exacerbations and treated with antibiotic IV treatment for 14 days. MBW and spirometry were evaluated within 72 h of admission to hospital and at the end of hospitalization. Descriptive analysis was conducted and correlations between quantitative variables were investigated. RESULTS: Fifty-seven 9606 (M22/F35) with an average age 18.56 (  8.54) years were enrolled. LCI2.5 was significantly reduced at the end of antibiotic treatment in both pediatric and adult populations with an average reduction of -6,99%; 37/57 9606 denoted an improvement, 20/57 are stable or worsened in LCI2.5 values and 4/57 (7.02%) had a significant deterioration (> 15%) at end of treatment. On the contrary a significative elevation of FEV1 and FVC were found, respectively of + 7,30% and of + 5,46%. A positive good correlection among LCI 2.5 and Scond (rho = + 0,615, p = 0.000) and LCI 2.5 and Sacin (rho = + 0,649, p = 0.000) and a negative strong correlation between FEV1 and LCI 2.5 were found in post treatment period. A similar modification of LCI 2.5 and FEV1 was noticed in both adult and pediatric population. CONCLUSIONS: LCI may have a role in the routine clinical care of both adult and pediatric CF 9606 as a good tool to assess response to IV antibiotic end-therapy in the same way as FEV1.
38179880	MONDO:0007745 leads to elevated bilirubin after initiation of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor in people with MONDO:0009061.Nine people with MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061) were found to have isolated elevations in serum total bilirubin after starting elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) that were associated with MONDO:0007745. In longitudinal examination, total bilirubin levels increased substantially after initiation of ETI without elevations in liver transaminases in those with this syndrome. Because elevated bilirubin levels in MONDO:0007745 are benign, ETI was able to be continued in these individuals. Genetic testing for this relatively common syndrome should be strongly considered for MONDO:0009061 experiencing isolated MONDO:0024288 after starting ETI, since appropriate diagnosis may help MONDO:0009061 avoid unnecessary interruption in this therapy with significant health benefits in MONDO:0009061.
38186649	Efficacy and safety profile of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor triple therapy on MONDO:0009061: a systematic review and single arm meta-analysis.<b>Background:</b> Elexacaftor-Tezacaftor-Ivacaftor (ELE/TEZ/IVA) is believed to be an effective and well-tolerated treatment for MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061), but the exact efficacy and safety profile are still unknown. <b>Objective:</b> This study aimed to clarify the extent of functional restoration when 9606 are given with triple combination treatment and demonstrate the prevalence of adverse events, to evaluate the overall profile of ELE/TEZ/IVA on MONDO:0009061. <b>Methods:</b> A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane Library. Random effects single-arm meta-analysis was performed to decipher the basal characteristics of MONDO:0009061, the improvement and safety profile after ELE/TEZ/IVA treatment. <b>Results:</b> A total 53 studies were included in this analysis. For all the 9606 in included studies. 4 weeks after ELE/TEZ/IVA treatment, the increasement of percentage of predicted Forced Expiratory Volume in the first second (ppFEV<sub>1</sub>) was 9.23% (95%CI, 7.77%-10.70%), the change of percentage of predicted Forced Vital Capacity (ppFVC) was 7.67% (95%CI, 2.15%-13.20%), and the absolute change of MONDO:0009061 Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) score was 21.46 points (95%CI, 18.26-24.67 points). The Sweat chloride (SwCl) was significantly decreased with the absolute change of -41.82 mmol/L (95%CI, -44.38 to -39.25 mmol/L). 24 weeks after treatment, the increasement of ppFEV<sub>1</sub> was 12.57% (95%CI, 11.24%-13.90%), the increasement of ppFVC was 10.44% (95%CI, 7.26%-13.63%), and the absolute change of CFQ-R score was 19.29 points (95%CI, 17.19-21.39 points). The SwCl was significantly decreased with the absolute change of -51.53 mmol/L (95%CI, -56.12 to -46.94 mmol/L).

The body mass index increased by 1.23 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (95%CI, 0.89-1.57 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). As for adverse events, 0.824 (95%CI, 0.769-0.879) occurred during ELE/TEZ/IVA period, while the incidence of severe adverse events was 0.066 (95%CI, 0.028-0.104). <b>Conclusion:</b> ELE/TEZ/IVA is a highly effective strategy and relatively safe for MONDO:0009061 9606 and needs to be sustained to achieve better efficacy. <b>Systematic Review Registration:</b> Identifier: CRD42023441840.
38220475	Preventive service utilization among adults with MONDO:0009061 covered by private insurance is comparable to the general population.BACKGROUND: As the life expectancy of the MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061) population is lengthening with modulator therapies, diligent age-appropriate screening and preventive care are increasingly vital for long-term health and wellbeing. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis comparing rates of receiving age- and sex-appropriate preventive services by commercially insured adult people with MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061) and adults without MONDO:0009061 from the general population (GP) via the Truven Health MarketScan database (2012-2018). RESULTS: We captured 25,369 adults with MONDO:0009061 and 488,534 adults from the GP in the United States. Comparing these groups, we found that 43% versus 39% received an annual preventive visit, 28% versus 28% were screened for MONDO:0021697, 38% versus 37% received pap smears every 3 years (21-29-year-old females), 33% versus 31% received pap smears every 5 years (30-64-year-old females), 55% versus 44% received mammograms, 23% versus 21% received colonoscopies, and 21% versus 20% received HP:0003119 screening (all screening rates expressed per 100 person-years). In age-stratified analysis, 18-27-year-old MONDO:0009061 had a lower rate of annual preventive visits compared to adults in the same age group of the GP (27% versus 42%). CONCLUSIONS: We discovered a comparable-to-superior rate of preventive service utilization in adults with MONDO:0009061 relative to the GP, except in young adulthood from 18-27 years. Our findings establish the importance of meeting the primary care needs of adults with MONDO:0009061 and call for development of strategies to improve preventive service delivery to young adults.
38184455	MONDO:0005979 post MONDO:0001358 in 9606 with MONDO:0009061. A 7-year single centre retrospective review.MONDO:0001358 (MONDO:0001358) is a treatment used to manage haemoptysis. We performed a 7-year review of MONDO:0001358 procedures for haemoptysis at our MONDO:0009061 centre aiming to evaluate the incidence and outcomes of 9606 with MONDO:0005979 post-MONDO:0001358. Our review suggests that whilst MONDO:0001358 is an effective method for controlling life-threatening haemoptysis, 9606 are at risk of developing MONDO:0005979 with long term residual symptoms, and therefore careful consideration should be given in offering MONDO:0001358, especially to otherwise well 9606 with chronic small volume haemoptysis and managing teams should have a low threshold to image symptomatic 9606.
38203285	The Effect of Complex Alleles of the <i>ncbi1080</i> Gene on the Clinical Manifestations of MONDO:0009061 and the Effectiveness of Targeted Therapy.The authors of this article analyzed the available literature with the results of studying the prevalence of complex alleles of the <i>ncbi1080</i> gene among 9606 with MONDO:0009061, and their pathogenicity and influence on targeted therapy with ncbi1080 modulators. MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061) is a multisystemic MONDO:0003847 caused by a defect in the expression of the ncbi1080 protein, and more than 2000 genetic variants are known. Clinically significant variants are divided into seven classes. Information about the frequency of complex alleles appears in a number of registers, along with the traditional presentation of data on genetic variants. Complex alleles (those with the presence of more than two nucleotide variants on one allele) can complicate the diagnosis of the disease, and change the clinical manifestations of MONDO:0009061 and the response to treatment, since each variant in the complex allele can contribute to the functional activity of the ncbi1080 protein, changing it both in terms of increasing and decreasing function. The role of complex alleles is often underestimated, and their frequency has not been studied. At the moment, characteristic frequently encountered complex alleles have been found for several populations of 9606 with MONDO:0009061, but the prevalence and pathogenicity of newly detected complex alleles require additional research. In this review, more than 35 complex alleles of the <i>ncbi1080</i> gene from existing research studies were analyzed, and an analysis of their influence on the manifestations of the disease and the effectiveness of ncbi1080 modulators was also described.
38213378	Severe diseaseD000082882 in an Adult MONDO:0009061 9606.diseaseD000082882 is the most common MONDO:0005453. diseaseD000082882 are prone to accelerated degenerative changes and aortopathies. These changes often manifest in adulthood as severe MONDO:0042981 or mixed diseaseD000082862. MONDO:0009061 9606 are at high risk of adverse surgical outcomes. As survival in MONDO:0009061 continues to increase, managing comorbidities including severe MONDO:0042981 requires consideration. The relatively non-invasive transcatheter aortic valve replacement has been posed as an intervention for high-risk 9606 with severe symptomatic MONDO:0042981. However, traditional randomized trials have excluded 9606 with diseaseD000082882. Herein we present an extremely rare association of severe diseaseD000082882 in an adult MONDO:0009061 9606. Furthermore, we discuss the clinical course and a multi-disciplinary approach for the management of this rare scenario.
38203723	Exploring the Mechanism of Activation of ncbi1080 by Curcuminoids: An Ensemble Docking Study.Curcumin, a major constituent of turmeric (<i>136217</i> L.), has beneficial effects against several diseases. In MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061), this compound improves 9606' symptoms by recovering the activity of a number of mutants of the ncbi1080 (ncbi1080). Despite holding promise in the treatment of MONDO:0009061, the curcumin binding site in ncbi1080 and the molecular mechanism of activation of this channel are still unknown. The results of this study, based on docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, allow us to propose that curcumin binds the closed ATP-free ncbi1080 near the nucleotide-binding domain 1 (NBD1)/ICl1/ICl4 interface. The bound ligand, once approached by the nucleotide-binding domain 2 (NBD2) during transient channel opening, lays at a multiple interdomain cross point. Thereafter, curcumin can bridge NBD1 and NBD2, and also ICL1/ICL4 and ICL2/ICL3, finally tightening the same interdomain interactions that normally uphold the open conformation in the wild-type ATP-bound ncbi1080. The proposed binding site is compatible with biochemical observations made in previous ncbi1080-curcumin interaction studies. These findings provide a framework for the design of novel drugs that activate ncbi1080 mutants characterized by defects in ATP binding and/or NBD dimerization or even lacking NBD2.
38184167	Impact of MONDO:0008383 and Seropositivity on the Risk of MONDO:0004822.BACKGROUND: Despite the coexistence of MONDO:0004822 and MONDO:0008383 (MONDO:0008383) and the poor prognosis associated with the combination of conditions, no longitudinal studies that comprehensively evaluated whether 9606 with MONDO:0008383 have a higher risk of MONDO:0004822 compared with those without MONDO:0004822 have been published. Whether seropositivity is associated with an increased risk of MONDO:0004822 in MONDO:0008383 is the subject of ongoing controversy. RESEARCH QUESTION: Does MONDO:0008383 influence the development of MONDO:0004822? Is seropositivity associated with an increased risk of MONDO:0004822 in MONDO:0008383? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The incidence of MONDO:0004822 was compared between individuals with MONDO:0008383 (n=50,651; 35,879 seropositive MONDO:0008383 [SPRA] and 14,772 seronegative MONDO:0008383 [SNRA]) and 1:5 age- and sex-matched controls (n=253,255) enrolled between 2010 and 2017 in the Korean National Health Insurance Service database. The participants were followed from 1 year after MONDO:0008383 diagnosis or the corresponding index date to the date of MONDO:0004822 incidence, censored date, or December 2019. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of MONDO:0004822 at 9 years of follow-up was approximately 7% in participants with MONDO:0008383. During a median follow-up of 4.3 years (interquartile range, 2.6-6.3 years), participants with MONDO:0008383 showed a 2.12-fold higher risk of developing MONDO:0004822 compared with matched controls even after adjusting for potential confounders related to MONDO:0004822 development (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.00-2.25), In an analysis of MONDO:0008383 serologic status using a fully adjusted model, participants with SPRA and those with SNRA showed 2.34-fold (95% CI, 2.20-2.49) and 1.56-fold (95% CI, 1.40-1.73) increased risks, respectively, compared with matched controls. INTERPRETATION: Individuals with MONDO:0008383 had approximately twice the risk of developing MONDO:0004822 than matched controls even after adjusting for potential confounders. The increased risk was more evident in individuals with SPRA than in those with SNRA, implying that diseaseD007249 plays a major role in the development of MONDO:0008383-MONDO:0004822.
38186087	Two rare variants that affect the same amino acid in ncbi100754506 have distinct responses to ivacaftor.Some residues in the ncbi100754506 (ncbi100754506) channel are the site of more than one ncbi100754506 variant that cause MONDO:0009061. Here, we investigated the function of variant#1080#p.S1159F and variant#1080#p.S1159P, two variants associated with different clinical phenotypes, which affect the same pore-lining residue in transmembrane segment 12 that are both strongly potentiated by ivacaftor when expressed in HL93<sup>-</sup> bronchial epithelial cells. To study the single-channel behaviour of ncbi100754506, we applied the patch-clamp technique to 0213 cells heterologously expressing ncbi100754506 variants incubated at 27oC to enhance channel residence at the plasma membrane. variant#1080#p.S1159F- and variant#1080#p.S1159P-ncbi100754506 formed Cl<sup>-</sup> channels activated by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation and gated by ATP that exhibited thermostability at 37oC. Both variants modestly reduced the single-channel conductance of ncbi100754506. By severely attenuating channel gating, variant#1080#p.S1159F- and variant#1080#p.S1159P-ncbi100754506 reduced the open probability (P<sub>o</sub> ) of wild-type ncbi100754506 by  75% at ATP (1 mM); variant#1080#p.S1159F-ncbi100754506 caused the greater decrease in P<sub>o</sub> consistent with its more severe clinical phenotype. Ivacaftor (10-100 nM) doubled the P<sub>o</sub> of both ncbi100754506 variants without restoring P<sub>o</sub> values to wild-type levels, but concomitantly, ivacaftor decreased current flow through open channels. For variant#1080#p.S1159F-ncbi100754506, the reduction of current flow was marked at high (supersaturated) ivacaftor concentrations (0.5-1 uM) and voltage-independent, identifying an additional detrimental action of elevated ivacaftor concentrations. In conclusion, variant#1080#p.S1159F and variant#1080#p.S1159P are gating variants, which also affect ncbi100754506 processing and conduction, but not stability, necessitating the use of combinations of ncbi100754506 modulators to optimally restore their channel activity. KEY POINTS: Dysfunction of the ion channel ncbi100754506 (ncbi100754506) causes the MONDO:0003847 disease MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061). This study investigated two rare pathogenic ncbi100754506 variants, variant#1080#p.S1159F and variant#1080#p.S1159P, which affect the same amino acid in ncbi100754506, to understand the molecular basis of disease and response to the ncbi100754506-targeted therapy ivacaftor. Both rare variants diminished ncbi100754506 function by modestly reducing current flow through the channel and severely inhibiting ATP-dependent channel gating with variant#1080#p.S1159F exerting the stronger adverse effect, which correlates with its association with more severe disease. Ivacaftor potentiated channel gating by both rare variants without restoring their activity to wild-type levels, but concurrently reduced current flow through open channels, particularly those of variant#1080#p.S1159F-ncbi100754506. Our data demonstrate that variant#1080#p.S1159F and variant#1080#p.S1159P cause CFTR dysfunction by multiple mechanisms that require combinations of ncbi100754506-targeted therapies to fully restore channel function.
38173511	Plasma levels of chemokines decrease during elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor therapy in adults with MONDO:0009061.BACKGROUND: MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061) is associated with dysregulated immune responses, exaggerated diseaseD007249 and diseaseD000088562. ncbi1080 (ncbi1080) modulator therapies directly target the underlying protein defects and resulted in significant clinical benefits for people with MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061). This study analysed the effects of triple ncbi1080 modulator therapy elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) on MONDO:0009061-associated diseaseD007249, especially systemic chemokines. METHODS: A bead-based immunoassay was used to quantify proinflammatory chemokines (ncbi3576, ncbi3627, ncbi6356, ncbi6361, ncbi6352, ncbi79109, ncbi79109, ncbi6368, ncbi4283, ncbi6374, GROa, ncbi6373) in plasma samples from MONDO:0009061 collected before, at three, and at six months after starting ETI therapy. RESULTS: Fifty-one MONDO:0009061 (47 % female; mean age 32   10.4 years) were included. At baseline, 67 % were already receiving ncbi1080 modulator therapy with tezacaftor/ivacaftor or lumacaftor/ivacaftor. After initiation of ETI therapy there was a significant improvement in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (+12.7 points, p < 0.001) and a significant decrease in sweat chloride levels (-53.6 %, p < 0.001). After 6 months' treatment with ETI therapy there were significant decreases in plasma levels of ncbi6368 (-68.2 %, p = 0.018), GROa (-17.7 %, p = 0.013), ncbi6374 (-16.3 %, p = 0.034) and ncbi6373 (-3.4 %, p = 0.032). ncbi3576 exhibited a reduction that did not reach statistical significance (-17.8 %, p = 0.057); levels of other assessed cytokines did not change significantly from baseline. CONCLUSIONS: ETI appears to affect a distinct group of chemokines that are predominately associated with diseaseD007249, demonstrating the anti-diseaseD007249 properties of ETI therapy.
38218661	Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor improves diseaseD000092562 detected by magnetic resonance imaging in children with MONDO:0009061 on long-term therapy with lumacaftor/ivacaftor.INTRODUCTION: Previous studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated early onset and progression of diseaseD000092562 (diseaseD000092562) from infancy to school age, and response to lumacaftor/ivacaftor (LUM/IVA) therapy in children with MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061). However, the effect of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA) on diseaseD000092562 detected by MRI in children with MONDO:0009061 and at least one variant##p.F508del mutation, and potential incremental effects of ELX/TEZ/IVA compared to LUM/IVA in variant##p.F508del homozygous children have not been studied. METHODS: 30 children with MONDO:0009061 with at least one variant##p.F508del mutation underwent three longitudinal paranasal sinus MRI before (MRI1), without (n = 16) or with LUM/IVA therapy (n = 14, MRI2), and with ELX/TEZ/IVA therapy (MRI3, mean age at therapy initiation 11.1   3.4y, range 6-16y). MRI were evaluated using the diseaseD000092562-MRI score. RESULTS: After therapy initiation with ELX/TEZ/IVA, the prevalence and in maxillary and sphenoid sinuses the dominance of mucopyoceles decreased (35% vs. 0 %, p<0.001 and 26% vs. 8 %, p < 0.05, respectively). This leads to a reduction in mucopyocele subscore (-3.4   1.9, p < 0.001), and sinus subscores in MRI3 (maxillary sinus: -5.3   3.1, p < 0.001, frontal sinus: -1.0   1.9, p < 0.01, sphenoid subscore: -2.8   3.5, p < 0.001, ethmoid sinus: -1.7   1.9, p < 0.001). The diseaseD000092562-MRI sum score decreased after therapy initiation with ELX/TEZ/IVA by -9.6   5.5 score points (p < 0.001). The strength in reduction of mucopyoceles subscore and diseaseD000092562-MRI sum score was independent of a pretreatment with LUM/IVA from MRI1-MRI2 (p = 0.275-0.999). CONCLUSIONS: ELX/TEZ/IVA therapy leads to improvement of diseaseD000092562 in eligible children with MONDO:0009061. Our data support the role of MRI for comprehensive monitoring of diseaseD000092562 disease severity and response to therapy in children with MONDO:0009061.

38212492	The challenges and promise of sweat sensing.The potential of monitoring biomarkers in sweat for health-related applications has spurred rapid growth in the field of wearable sweat sensors over the past decade. Some of the key challenges have been addressed, including measuring sweat-secretion rate and collecting sufficient sample volumes for real-time, continuous molecular analysis without intense exercise. However, except for assessment of MONDO:0009061 and regional nerve function, the ability to accurately measure analytes of interest and their physiological relevance to health metrics remain to be determined. Although sweat is not a crystal ball into every aspect of 9606 health, we expect sweat measurements to continue making inroads into niche applications involving active sweating, such as hydration monitoring for athletes and physical laborers and later for medical and casual health monitoring of relevant drugs and hormones.
38248793	Laboratory Tools to Predict ncbi1080 Modulator Therapy Effectiveness and to Monitor Disease Severity in MONDO:0009061.The implementation of cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (ncbi1080) modulator drugs into clinical practice has been attaining remarkable therapeutic outcomes for CF, a life-threatening MONDO:0003847. However, there is elevated ncbi1080 allelic heterogeneity, and various individuals carrying (ultra)rare CF genotypes remain without any approved modulator therapy. Novel translational model systems based on individuals' own cells/tissue are now available and can be used to interrogate in vitro ncbi1080 modulator responses and establish correlations of these assessments with clinical features, aiming to provide prediction of therapeutic effectiveness. Furthermore, because CF is a progressive disease, assessment of biomarkers in routine care is fundamental in monitoring treatment effectiveness and disease severity. In the first part of this review, we aimed to focus on the utility of individual-derived in vitro models (such as bronchial/nasal epithelial cells and airway/intestinal organoids) to identify potential responders and expand personalized CF care. Thereafter, we discussed the usage of CF diseaseD007249 biomarkers derived from blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and sputum to routinely monitor treatment effectiveness and disease progression. Finally, we summarized the progress in investigating extracellular vesicles as a robust and reliable source of biomarkers and the identification of microRNAs related to ncbi1080 regulation and MONDO:0009061 as novel biomarkers, which may provide valuable information for disease prognosis.
38199892	Nasal lavage microbiome, but not nasal swab microbiome, correlates with diseaseD007249 in children with MONDO:0009061.BACKGROUND: MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061) is characterized by highly viscous mucus obstructing the lower and upper airways, chronic neutrophil diseaseD007249 and diseaseD007239 resulting not only in MONDO:0005275 but also in paranasal MONDO:0005961. The pathogenesis of MONDO:0009061-associated chronic diseaseD000092562 (diseaseD000092562) is still not well understood, and it remains unclear how the microbiome in the upper airways (UAW) influences MONDO:0001735. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study in pediatric 9606 with MONDO:0009061 under stable disease conditions, we examined the microbiome in relation to diseaseD007249 by comparing nasal swabs (NS) and nasal lavage (NL) as two UAW sampling methods. The microbiota structure of both NS and NL was determined by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. In addition, pro-diseaseD007249 cytokines (ncbi3552, ncbi3569, ncbi3576, ncbi7124) and proteases (ncbi6590, ncbi7076, NE/ncbi5265 complex) as well as ncbi1991 activity were measured in NL. RESULTS: Simultaneous NS and NL samples were collected from 36 9606 with MONDO:0009061 (age range: 7 - 19 years). The microbiome of NS samples was shown to be significantly lower in a-diversity and evenness compared to NL samples. NS samples were particularly found to be colonized with 1279 species. NL microbiome was shown to correlate much better with the diseaseD007249 status than NS microbiome. Especially the detection of 475 in NL was associated with increased diseaseD007249 response. CONCLUSION: Our results show that the NL microbiome reflects diseaseD007249 better than NS and support NL as a promising tool for simultaneous assessment of the UAW microbiome and diseaseD007249 in children with MONDO:0009061.
38183031	Testing a model of benefit-finding and growth in youths with diseaseD000071069.BACKGROUND: The experience of benefit-finding and growth (BFG), defined as perceiving positive life changes resulting from adversity, is increasingly studied among youths with diseaseD000071069 (diseaseD000071069). However, empirical evidence is scarce for explaining individual differences in BFG. The study aimed to test a model of BFG, including an interplay of personal and environmental factors and coping processes. METHODS: A sample of N = 498 youths (12-21 years) recruited from three German patient registries for diseaseD000071069 (type 1 diabetes: n = 388, juvenile idiopathic arthritis: n = 82, cystic fibrosis: n = 28) completed a questionnaire including self-reported optimism, social support from parents and peers, coping strategies, and BFG. The model was created to reflect the theoretical assumptions of the Life Crisis and Personal Growth model and current empirical evidence. Structural equation modeling was conducted to evaluate the incremental explanatory power of optimism, peer group integration, parental support, acceptance, cognitive reappraisal, and seeking social support over and above sociodemographic and disease-related characteristics. RESULTS: The model (CFI = 0.93; RMSEA = 0.04; SRMR = 0.05) explained 32% of the variance in BFG. Controlling for sociodemographic and disease-related characteristics, acceptance, cognitive reappraisal, and seeking social support were directly and positively linked to BFG. All tested coping strategies significantly mediated the association between optimism and BFG, whereas seeking social support significantly mediated the relation between peer group integration and BFG. DISCUSSION: The study stresses the prominent role of emotion-focused coping strategies and peer group integration in enhancing BFG in youths with diseaseD000071069.

38173971	<i>P. aeruginosa</i> interactions with other microbes in biofilms during co-infection.This review addresses the topic of biofilms, including their development and the interaction between different counterparts. There is evidence that various diseases, such as MONDO:0009061, MONDO:0005441, diseaseD017719, and certain MONDO:0005070, are promoted and aggravated by the presence of polymicrobial biofilms. Biofilms are composed by heterogeneous communities of microorganisms protected by a matrix of polysaccharides. The different types of interactions between microorganisms gives rise to an increased resistance to antimicrobials and to the host's defense mechanisms, with the consequent worsening of disease symptoms. Therefore, diseaseD007239 caused by polymicrobial biofilms affecting different 9606 organs and systems will be discussed, as well as the role of the interactions between the gram-negative bacteria <i>287</i>, which is at the base of major polymicrobial diseaseD007239, and other bacteria, fungi, and viruses in the establishment of 9606 diseaseD007239 and diseases. Considering that polymicrobial biofilms are key to bacterial pathogenicity, it is fundamental to evaluate which microbes are involved in a certain disease to convey an appropriate and efficacious antimicrobial therapy.
38179886	Comparison of particles in exhaled air and multiple breath washout for assessment of small airway function in children with MONDO:0009061.BACKGROUND: The introduction of modulator therapy for MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061) has led to an increased interest in the detection of small MONDO:0005002 (diseaseD056151) as sensitive marker of treatment response. The particles in exhaled air (PExA) method, which records exhaled particle mass (PEx ng/L) and number (PExNR), detects diseaseD056151 in adult 9606. Our primary aim was to investigate if PExA outcomes in children with MONDO:0009061 are different when compared to controls and associated with more severe disease. Secondary aims were to assess feasibility and repeatability of PExA in children with MONDO:0009061 and to correlate PExA to multiple breath nitrogen washout (MBNW) as an established marker of diseaseD056151. METHODS: Thirteen healthy children (HC), 17 children with MONDO:0009061 with normal lung function (MONDO:0009061N) (FEV<sub>1</sub> z-score   -1.64) and six with airway obstruction (MONDO:0009061) (FEV<sub>1</sub> z-score < -1.64) between 8 and 18 years performed MBNW followed by PExA and spirometry. Children with MONDO:0009061 repeated the measurements after 3 months. RESULTS: PEx ng/L and PExNR/L per liter of exhaled breath were similar between the three groups. The lung clearance index (LCI) was significantly higher in both MONDO:0009061-N and MONDO:0009061 compared to HC. All participants, except one, were able to perform PExA. Coefficient of variation for PEx ng/l was (median) 0.38, range 0-1.25 and PExNR/l 0.38, 0-1.09. Correlation between LCI and PEx ng/l was low, r<sub>s</sub> 0.32 (p = .07). CONCLUSION: PExA is feasible in children. In contrast to LCI, PExA did not differentiate healthy children from children with MONDO:0009061 suggesting it to be a less sensitive tool to detect diseaseD056151.
