28718995		A systematic review of the prevalence and impact of HP:0000020 in MONDO:0009061.This systematic review synthesizes published articles investigating the prevalence, severity and impact of HP:0000020 (HP:0000020), a condition associated with MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061). References were identified through searching Medline, Embase and PubMed using the medical subject headings 'MONDO:0009061' AND 'HP:0000020'. Articles were included if HP:0000020 prevalence was investigated as an outcome. Twelve studies met selection criteria. The prevalence of HP:0000020 ranged from 5% to 76%. Age and gender contributed to this variability. When assessed, HP:0000020 commonly limited airway clearance, exercise and/or spirometry, and had a variable impact on 9606' lives. Worry and embarrassment were features for many; others were less affected. In MONDO:0009061, HP:0000020 is common and can interfere with respiratory care and social well-being. The prevalence, characteristics and impact are poorly understood, which is made worse by inconsistent definitions across studies. Future research is needed to improve approaches to prevention, identification, management and education.
29094071		Clinical diseaseD000092562 outcomes in pediatric 9606 with MONDO:0009061.Objectives: diseaseD000092562 and MONDO:0002436 are common conditions in MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061). Approximately 2-3% of pediatric MONDO:0009061 9606 per year have MONDO:0005961 requiring surgery. It has been well established that there is a significant negative impact on quality of life associated with diseaseD000092562 (diseaseD000092562) in the non-MONDO:0009061 9606 population. However, the impact of diseaseD000092562 on the pediatric MONDO:0009061 population remains uncertain. The purpose of this article is to review the current state of outcome measures for diseaseD000092562 in pediatric MONDO:0009061 9606. Data Sources: PubMed and EMBASE literature review. Methods: PubMed and EMBASE electronic databases were searched using Boolean searches that incorporated mesh headings and plain language for quality of life, symptom evaluation, pediatric 9606, and MONDO:0005961/diseaseD000092562. Studies were included if the study primarily evaluated a pediatric MONDO:0009061-diseaseD000092562 (MONDO:0009061diseaseD000092562) population and the primary outcome measure was quality of life evaluation. Results: The search yielded 34 unique articles. A total of 7 articles met inclusion criteria. Conclusions: Despite the high frequency of diseaseD000092562 in the pediatric MONDO:0009061 9606 population, its impact on quality of life is not well understood. Currently there is a lack of a validated disease specific quality of life instruments available to assess the impact of diseaseD000092562 on the pediatric MONDO:0009061 9606 population. Level of Evidence: 5.
28132082	Positive_Correlation|chemicalD016559|MONDO:0002492; Positive_Correlation|chemicalD016559|MONDO:0005240	High chemicalD016559 blood concentrations early after lung transplantation and the risk of MONDO:0005240.PURPOSE: Lung transplant recipients often develop MONDO:0002492 (MONDO:0002492) evolving into MONDO:0024327 (MONDO:0024327). The immunosuppressant chemicalD016559 might be associated with the emergence of MONDO:0002492. We analyzed the development and recovery of MONDO:0005240 after lung transplantation and related MONDO:0002492 to whole-blood chemicalD016559 trough concentrations and other factors causing MONDO:0005240. METHODS: We retrospectively studied MONDO:0005240 in 186 lung-transplantation 9606 at the UMC Utrecht between 2001 and 2011. Kidney function and whole-blood chemicalD016559 trough concentrations were determined from day 1 to 14 and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperative. diseaseD018746 (diseaseD018746), MONDO:0001881, and nephrotoxic medications were evaluated as covariates for MONDO:0002492. We analyzed MONDO:0100192 and drug-drug interactions. RESULTS: MONDO:0002492 was present in 85 (46%) 9606. chemicalD016559 concentrations were supra-therapeutic in 135 of 186 9606 (73%). MONDO:0002492 in the first week after transplantation was related to supra-therapeutic chemicalD016559 concentrations (OR 1.55; 95% CI 1.06-2.27), >=3 other nephrotoxic drugs (OR 1.96; 95% CI 1.02-3.77), diseaseD007239 (OR 2.48; 95% CI 1.31-4.70), and MONDO:0009061 (OR 2.17; 95% CI 1.16-4.06). Recovery rate of MONDO:0002492 was lower than expected (19%), and the cumulative incidence of severe MONDO:0024327 at 1 year was 15%. CONCLUSIONS: After lung transplantation, MONDO:0002492 is common and often evolves into severe MONDO:0024327, which is a known cause of morbidity and mortality. Supra-therapeutic whole-blood chemicalD016559 trough concentrations are related to the early onset of MONDO:0002492. Conscientious targeting chemicalD016559 blood concentrations might be vital in the early phase after lung transplantation. What is known about this subject?   Lung transplant recipients often develop MONDO:0002492 evolving into MONDO:0024327 increasing both morbidity and mortality.   To date, the pathophysiology of MONDO:0005240 after lung transplantation has not been fully elucidated.   The immunosuppressant chemicalD016559 is difficult to dose, especially in the unstable clinical setting, and is nephrotoxic. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS:   For the first time, supra-therapeutic whole-blood chemicalD016559 trough concentrations are related to the emergence of MONDO:0002492 in the first days after lung transplantation.   Supra-therapeutic whole-blood chemicalD016559 trough concentrations often occur early after lung transplantation.   MONDO:0002492 after lung transplantation shows low recovery rates.
29605218		Six-minute walk test as a determinant of the functional capacity of children and adolescents with MONDO:0009061: A systematic review.MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061) is a multisystem disorder. The involvement of the respiratory system is frequent and culminates in HP:0002098 and diseaseC564972. Functional capacity is an important diagnostic tool, because it reflects the cardiorespiratory status, quality of life and prognosis. This systematic review aims to assess the reproducibility and validity of the six minute walk test (6MWT) to reflect the functional capacity of children and adolescents with MONDO:0009061, and also the correlation between 6MWT and lung function. Searches for articles were performed in eight databases using MeSH/DeCS keywords. A total of 695 articles were found and, after verifying all eligibility criteria, six articles were included for analysis and scoring regarding the methodological quality according to the QUADAS scale (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies). All articles had good methodology (QUADAS between 9 and 11 points). The 6MWT is not correlated with lung function. There is a strong indication that the 6MWT is a reproducible test to assess the functional capacity of children and adolescents with MONDO:0009061. The validity assessment could not be reached because the studies included in this systematic review did not use adequate statistical tools to carry out such an evaluation.
8476292	Association|chemicalD000464|chemicalD014574	Exopolysaccharide production in biofilms: substratum activation of chemicalD000464 gene expression by 287.Reporter gene technology was employed to detect the activity of an chemicalD000464 promoter of 287 when the organism was grown as a biofilm on a Teflon mesh substratum and as planktonic cells in liquid medium. chemicalD000464 biosynthetic activity was determined with a mucoid cell line derived from a MONDO:0009061 isolate and containing an alginate algC promoter fused to a lacZ reporter gene. Reporter activity was demonstrated with chromogenic and fluorogenic substrates for beta-galactosidase. Expression of algC was shown to be upregulated in biofilm cells compared with planktonic cells in liquid medium. Gene up-expression correlated with chemicalD000464 biosynthesis as measured by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, chemicalD014574 accumulation, and chemicalD000464-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The algC promoter was shown to have maximum activity in planktonic cultures during the late lag and early log phases of the cell growth cycle. During a time course experiment, biofilm algC activity exceeded planktonic activity except during the period immediately following inoculation into fresh medium. In continuous-culture experiments, conversion of lacZ substrate was demonstrated microscopically in individual cells by epifluorescence microscopy.
17459673		[Nebulized drugs: the evolution?].The revival of nebulization as a drug delivery route is real. The current delivery systems respond to the new European norms, the new mesh-vibrating nebulizers allow delivering drugs more quickly, other nebulizers, more performant because of less drug losses and of a better lung deposition of the drug, are in progress. Only 12 drugs are commercialized for nebulization. All are available in dispensaries, some requiring a first prescription by a physician working in a hospital (MONDO:0009061 drugs), others requiring a prescription from only some specialists as paediatricians or pulmonologists (bronchodilators). Works are in progress concerning the diameter and shape of the drug particles (nanotechnology) and also concerning the use of nebulized drugs for a systemic effect (vaccines, ncbi3630, chemicalD016572, anticancerous agents, etc.).

34624628		Combined use of rheology and portable low-field NMR in MONDO:0009061 9606.BACKGROUND: As most MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061) 9606 progress to MONDO:0021113, lung functionality assessment is pivotal. We previously developed a test that indirectly monitors airways (diseaseD007249/functional test) by measuring the spin-spin relaxation time (T2m) of the water hydrogens present in MONDO:0009061 sputum. Here the T2m significance in the monitoring of diseaseC563237 was further investigated by studying the correlation of T2m with: 1) sputum viscoelasticity, 2) mucociliary clearability index (diseaseC566784)/HP:0012735 clearability index (HP:0012735) and 3) sputum average mesh-size. METHODS: Sputum samples from 25 consenting MONDO:0009061 subjects were analyzed by rheology tests (elastic modulus G and zero shear viscosity eta0) and Low Field Nuclear Magnetic (LF-NMR) resonance (T2m). diseaseC566784/HP:0012735 were calculated from the rheological parameters. The average mesh-size (xi) of the sputum structure was then evaluated by rheology/LF-NMR, together with FEV1 for each 9606. RESULTS: There was an inverse correlation between G and eta0 versus T2m, indicating that a worsening of the lung condition (T2m-FEV1 drop) is paralleled by an increase in sputum viscoelasticity (G and eta0) favoring mucus stasis/diseaseD007249. A direct correlation was also observed between T2m and diseaseC566784/HP:0012735, showing that T2m provides information as to airway mucus clearing. Moreover, there was a direct correlation between T2m and the average sputum mesh size (xi). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated a correlation between T2m (measured in MONDO:0009061 9606's sputum) and the sputum viscoelasticity/average mesh-size and with diseaseC566784/HP:0012735, parameters related to airway mucus clearing. Thus, the present data strengthen the potential of our test to provide indirect monitoring of MONDO:0005002 course in MONDO:0009061 9606 as T2m depends on mucus solid concentration and nanostructure.
37423579		Nebulization of PEGylated recombinant human deoxyribonuclease I using vibrating membrane nebulizers: A technical feasibility study.Recombinant human deoxyribonuclease I (rhDNase, Pulmozyme ) is the most frequently used mucolytic agent for the symptomatic treatment of diseaseC563237. Conjugation of rhDNase to chemicalD011092 (chemicalD011092) has been shown to greatly prolong its residence time in the lungs and improve its therapeutic efficacy in mice. To present an added value over current rhDNase treatment, PEGylated rhDNase needs to be efficiently and less frequently administrated by aerosolization and possibly at higher concentrations than existing rhDNase. In this study, the effects of PEGylation on the thermodynamic stability of rhDNase was investigated, using linear 20 kDa, linear 30 kDa and 2-armed 40 kDa chemicalD011092. The suitability of PEG30-rhDNase to electrohydrodynamic atomization (electrospraying) as well as the feasibility of using two vibrating mesh nebulizers, the optimized eFlow  Technology nebulizer (eFlow) and Innospire Go, at varying protein concentrations were investigated. PEGylation was shown to destabilize rhDNase upon chemical-induced denaturation and chemicalD000431 exposure. Yet, PEG30-rhDNase was stable enough to withstand aerosolization stresses using the eFlow and Innospire Go nebulizers even at higher concentrations (5 mg of protein per ml) than conventional rhDNase formulation (1 mg/ml). High aerosol output (up to 1.5 ml per min) and excellent aerosol characteristics (up to 83% fine particle fraction) were achieved while preserving protein integrity and enzymatic activity. This work demonstrates the technical feasibility of chemicalD011092-rhDNase nebulization with advanced vibrating membrane nebulizers, encouraging further pharmaceutical and clinical developments of a long-acting PEGylated alternative to rhDNase for treating patients with CF.
19949942		"The prevalence of MONDO:0005298, HP:0000938, and MONDO:0005315 among adults with MONDO:0009061: a systematic literature review with meta-analysis.Observational studies have indicated a high but heterogeneous prevalence of low MONDO:0006946 density for adult 9606 with MONDO:0009061. MONDO:0005154 were also described. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of MONDO:0005298, HP:0000938, and MONDO:0005315 among adult 9606 with MONDO:0009061. A systematic literature review was conducted using electronic databases. The keywords used were ""MONDO:0009061 [MeSH] AND bone density."" Original studies were eligible if they reported the prevalence of MONDO:0005298 and/or HP:0000938 and/or MONDO:0005315 in adult 9606 with MONDO:0009061. A meta-analysis of pooled proportions was performed. Heterogeneity was tested with the Cochran Q statistic, and in the case of heterogeneity a random effect model was used. Of 117 studies, 12 were selected, i.e., that represented a total of 1055 9606. Mean age ranged from 18.5 to 32 years (median: 28.2 years). Mean body mass index ranged from 19.9 to 22.4 (median: 20.7); 53.8% were 9606. The pooled prevalence of MONDO:0005298 in adults with MONDO:0009061 was 23.5% (95% CI, 16.6-31.0). The pooled prevalence of HP:0000938 was 38% (95% CI, 28.2-48.3). The pooled prevalences of radiological diseaseC535781 and MONDO:0005315 were 14% (95% CI, 7.8-21.7) and 19.7% (95% CI, 6.0-38.8), respectively. In conclusion, this systematic literature review with meta-analysis emphasized the high prevalence of HP:0000938 and MONDO:0005298 in young adults with MONDO:0009061. The prevalence of MONDO:0005315 was also high."

The diffusion of many different medical devices for inhalation therapy containing chemicalD006820 has led to an increase in their prescription, also in children. Here, we systematically review the published evidence on the efficacy and safety of chemicalD006820 for the treatment of diseaseC000726767 in childhood. METHODS: Relevant published studies (randomized controlled trials) for the efficacy of chemicalD006820 inhalation in children with diseaseC000726767, MONDO:0004979, MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061), and non-MONDO:0009061 MONDO:0004822 were searched in Pubmed, Scopus, and Web of Knowledge databases by combining the adequate Medical Subject Headings terms and keywords, with no limit for the year of publication. RESULTS: We identified seven relevant publications for diseaseC000726767, one for MONDO:0004979, and five for MONDO:0009061, while we found no clinical trial including children with non-MONDO:0009061 MONDO:0004822. Meta-analysis was not conducted due to the heterogeneity of the included studies. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence of chemicalD006820 efficacy in the treatment of the upper and lower airways is still limited in children. Available data suggest that inhaled HMW-HA could be useful in the treatment of recurrent MONDO:0024355 and chronic or recurrent diseaseD007249 of the middle diseaseD004427 and MONDO:0004971 as well as of the lower airways in MONDO:0009061 in association with hypertonic chemicalD012965 solution. Studies on larger populations and on the different formulations and nebulization methods, especially in pediatric age, are urgently needed.
22856641		New nebulizer technology to monitor adherence and nebulizer performance in MONDO:0009061.Topical delivery of aerosolized therapies is an established treatment for chronic diseaseD007239 and diseaseD007249 in MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061). Recent developments in nebuliser technology have enabled Adaptive Aerosol Delivery (AAD) of mesh generated aerosol particles resulting in more efficient airway deposition than existing jet nebulizers. An additional feature of these new devices is the ability to record and examine the performance of the device by downloading stored data (electronic data capture). In a series of studies we have used this downloading facility to monitor treatment times and examine adherence to nebulizer therapy in our pediatric 9606. We found routine adherence monitoring is possible in busy MONDO:0009061 clinic. We have shown that good adherence to treatment can be maintained in both 9606 chronically diseaseD007239 with 287 on long-term therapy, and in 9606 with first/new growths of 287 on short-term eradication therapy. When adherence was examined from an individual perspective, we demonstrated a wide variation both between and within individual 9606. A further modification of AAD technology, Target Inhalation Mode (TIM) optimises 9606 inhalations through a direct feedback mechanism. This new breathing mode has also been evaluated in our pediatric MONDO:0009061 clinic in a recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) and we have shown that children maintain adherence to treatment through the TIM mouthpiece and average treatment times reduced from 6.9 to 3.7 min when using TIM. This is a new era of aerosol delivery and novel advances in medical devices need to be monitored and assessed rigorously, particularly as new and potentially expensive therapies emerge from translational studies. Electronic data capture enables MONDO:0009061 teams to work in an open partnership with 9606 to achieve the common goals of improving drug delivery and reducing 9606 burden.
22400363		[Inhaled therapies for MONDO:0009061].Inhaled therapies play a significant role in the management of MONDO:0009061 9606. Mucolytic and airway-rehydrating agents improve mucociliary clearance and respiratory functional status. Nebulized antibiotherapy achieve high local concentration, while reducing systemic diseaseD064420. Tolerance to inhaled treatments is good excepting frequent bronchoconstriction which can usually be prevented by prior administration of beta2-mimetics. The majority of treatments are only available in liquid formulations. Thus, nebulization is the most frequently used inhalation mode. Vibrating-mesh nebulizers have significantly reduced inhalation time.
34976079		An Overview on the Upper and Lower Airway Microbiome in MONDO:0009061 9606.BACKGROUND: In MONDO:0009061 9606, the mucus is an excellent place for opportunistic bacteria and pathogens to cover. Chronic diseaseD007239 of upper and lower airways play a critical role in the mortality of MONDO:0009061. This study aimed to introduce the microbiota profiles in 9606 with MONDO:0009061. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, a comprehensive literature search was done for studies on upper and lower airway microbiota in MONDO:0009061 9606. International and national databases were searched for the following MeSH words: microbiota, microbiome, upper airway, lower airway, MONDO:0009061, MONDO:0009061, upper airway microbiome, lower airway microbiome, microbiome pattern in MONDO:0009061, microbiome pattern in MONDO:0009061, upper airway microbiota, lower airway microbiota, and microbiota pattern. RESULTS: Streptococcus spp. are in significantly higher relative abundance in infants and children with MONDO:0009061; however, Pseudomonas spp. are in higher relative abundance in adults with MONDO:0009061. Molecular diagnostic techniques can be remarkably accurate in detecting microbial strains. CONCLUSION: For the detection and isolation of most bacterial species, independent-culture methods in addition to the standard culture method are recommended, and sampling should include both upper and lower airways.
35286625		Effect of chest physiotherapy on MONDO:0009061 sputum nanostructure: an experimental and theoretical approach.MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061) is a disease characterized by the production of viscous mucoid secretions in multiple organs, particularly the airways. The pathological increase of proteins, ncbi100508689 and biological polymers determines their arrangement into a three-dimensional polymeric network, affecting the whole mucus and impairing the muco-ciliary clearance which promotes diseaseD007249 and MONDO:0005113. Thus, to improve the efficacy of the drugs usually applied in MONDO:0009061 therapy (e.g., mucolytics, anti-diseaseD007249 and antibiotics), an in-depth understanding of the mucus nanostructure is of utmost importance. Drug diffusivity inside a gel-like system depends on the ratio between the diffusing drug molecule radius and the mesh size of the network. Based on our previous findings, we propose the combined use of rheology and low field NMR to study the mesh size distribution of the sputum from MONDO:0009061 9606. Specifically, we herein explore the effects of chest physiotherapy on MONDO:0009061 sputum characteristic as evaluated by rheology, low field NMR and the drug penetration through the mucus via mathematical simulation. These data show that chest physiotherapy has beneficial effects on 9606, as it favourably modifies sputum and enhances drug penetration through the respiratory mucus.
16160230		Bio-Health Information: a Preliminary Review of On-line MONDO:0009061 Resources.The aims of this study are to determine, and to better understand, elements that are common across a range of bio-health information resources; and to characterize those resources in terms of search and display functionality. Our ultimate goal is to better define the role of bio-health information in clinical practice and in biological research. This paper reports our first step, which is to compare different web-based resources that describe MONDO:0009061. The resources came from PubMed, Nucleotide, EMBL-EBI, DDBJ, OMIM, MeSH, ICD-10, and the MONDO:0009061 Mutation Database. We found obvious differences in terms of scope and purpose. However, while there were obvious similarities between related resources in terms of content, we also found differences among these resources in terms of display form, specificity of qualifiers, file format and the potential for computer processing. While our work is in its early stages, this study has clarified the nature of bio-health information resources and has allowed us to begin to characterize these resources in terms of their suitability in clinical practice and in biological research.
25267619		Probing biological nanotopology via diffusion of weakly constrained plasmonic nanorods with optical coherence tomography.Biological materials exhibit complex nanotopology, i.e., a composite liquid and solid phase structure that is heterogeneous on the nanoscale. The diffusion of nanoparticles in nanotopological environments can elucidate biophysical changes associated with pathogenesis and disease progression. However, there is a lack of methods that characterize nanoprobe diffusion and translate easily to in vivo studies. Here, we demonstrate a method based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) to depth-resolve diffusion of plasmon-resonant gold nanorods (GNRs) that are weakly constrained by the biological tissue. By using GNRs that are on the size scale of the polymeric mesh, their Brownian motion is minimally hindered by intermittent collisions with local macromolecules. OCT depth-resolves the particle-averaged translational diffusion coefficient (DT) of GNRs within each coherence volume, which is separable from the nonequilibrium motile activities of cells based on the unique polarized light-scattering properties of GNRs. We show how this enables minimally invasive imaging and monitoring of nanotopological changes in a variety of biological models, including extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling as relevant to diseaseD063646, and dehydration of pulmonary mucus as relevant to MONDO:0009061. In 3D ECM models, DT of GNRs decreases with both increasing collagen concentration and cell density. Similarly, DT of GNRs is sensitive to 9606 bronchial-epithelial mucus concentration over a physiologically relevant range. This novel method comprises a broad-based platform for studying heterogeneous nanotopology, as distinct from bulk viscoelasticity, in biological milieu. 
28347790		Key considerations on nebulization of antimicrobial agents to mechanically ventilated 9606.Nebulized antibiotics have an established role in 9606 with MONDO:0009061 or MONDO:0004822. Their potential benefit to treat MONDO:0024355 in mechanically ventilated 9606 is receiving increasing interest. In this consensus statement of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and MONDO:0005550, the body of evidence of the therapeutic utility of aerosolized antibiotics in mechanically ventilated 9606 was reviewed and resulted in the following recommendations: Vibrating-mesh nebulizers should be preferred to jet or ultrasonic nebulizers. To decrease turbulence and limit circuit and tracheobronchial deposition, we recommend: (a) the use of specifically designed respiratory circuits avoiding sharp angles and characterized by smooth inner surfaces, (b) the use of specific ventilator settings during nebulization including use of a volume controlled mode using constant inspiratory flow, tidal volume 8 mL/kg, respiratory frequency 12 to 15 bpm, inspiratory:expiratory ratio 50%, inspiratory pause 20% and positive end-expiratory pressure 5 to 10 cm chemicalD014867 and (c) the administration of a short-acting sedative agent if coordination between the 9606 and the ventilator is not obtained, to avoid 9606's flow triggering and episodes of peak decelerating inspiratory flow. A filter should be inserted on the expiratory limb to protect the ventilator flow device and changed between each nebulization to avoid expiratory flow obstruction. A heat and moisture exchanger and/or conventional heated humidifier should be stopped during the nebulization period to avoid a massive loss of aerosolized particles through trapping and condensation. If these technical requirements are not followed, there is a high risk of treatment failure and adverse events in mechanically ventilated 9606 receiving nebulized antibiotics for MONDO:0005249.
21620782		A randomised controlled trial of breathing modes for adaptive aerosol delivery in children with MONDO:0009061.BACKGROUND: Aerosol delivery is a cornerstone of MONDO:0009061 airways MONDO:0000001 management. New nebulisers have reduced treatment times by utilising mesh technology for aerosol production. We have evaluated a further modification (target inhalation mode (TIM)) that may reduce treatment delivery times further. METHODS: Following a baseline period on tidal breathing mode (TBM), children with MONDO:0009061 on long-term aerosol therapy were randomly allocated to either TIM, which optimises 9606 inhalations through a direct feedback mechanism, or to continue TBM. The primary outcome was nebuliser treatment times with secondary outcomes being adherence and 9606 preference. RESULTS: The ten children allocated TIM reduced their mean (SD) treatment times from 6.9(2.9) to 3.7(2.3) minutes (p<0.001). In contrast, treatment times were unchanged in the ten children allocated TBM. Mean adherence was maintained in the TIM group but declined in 9606 allocated TBM by >5%. All children preferred TIM to TBM. CONCLUSION: TIM reduces nebuliser treatment times and may positively impact on adherence, although longer duration studies are required to examine this.

This article presents an updated review of the relationship between chemicalD014807 and pediatric MONDO:0021113. A literature search was performed in PUBMED using free terms and MESH terms: chemicalD014807, MONDO:0004979, diseaseD015619, and MONDO:0002465. diseaseD003643 in 9606 9606 younger than 18 years and animals, published in English and Spanish until 2017 were included. 507 articles were found, of which 43 were included. Indirect evidence suggests a role of chemicalD014807 and fetal lung maturation. In relation to pediatric pulmonary pathology, studies are scarce and inconclusive. Recent meta-analyses performed with individualized evaluation of the participants shows an important protective role of chemicalD014807 supplementation in the prevention of severe MONDO:0004979 exacerbations and acute MONDO:0005108. In MONDO:0002465, the results are contradictory, with no clear relationship between plasma levels and severity. There is not enough evidence to assess the benefits of chemicalD014807 supplementation in MONDO:0009061 and MONDO:0018076. A direct relationship between the severity of MONDO:0005296 and chemicalD014807 plasma levels has recently been proposed, although the exact mechanisms involved in this association are unknown. Current information suggests that chemicalD014807 supplementation may represent a cost-effective strategy in redu cing important causes of infant morbidity and mortality.
28050369		A Case of diseaseD013530 Caused by 1766, following Herniorrhaphy.Rapidly Growing Mycobacteria (diseaseC538458) are opportunistic pathogens found in the environment. 1766, 1774 and 36809 are the important 9606 pathogens of this group. They cause diseaseD014946, MONDO:0005301 MONDO:0000001, MONDO:0024355 in 9606 with MONDO:0009061 or MONDO:0004822, MONDO:0005381 and MONDO:0003085. diseaseD007239 due to these MONDO:0006042 (MONDO:0006042) are increasingly reported. Post laparoscopic diseaseD014946, mesh site diseaseD007239 and other surgical site diseaseD007239 due to 1766 and 1774 have been reported. Usually diseaseD014946 due to atypical mycobacteria have delayed onset and do not respond to conventional antibiotics. Identification of diseaseC538458 can be done by a set of cumbersome biochemical tests, High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), molecular methods using DNA probes or by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). We here report a case of post-herniorrhaphy diseaseD014946 due to 1766 which was identified by molecular method (diseaseC564468 species system). This case report underscores the importance of examining Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain of all exudates with sterile culture on day one for non fastidious bacteria. Timely identification can lead to prompt therapy of 9606 preventing further complications.

In diseases like MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061), pulmonary mucus exhibits altered features, which hamper clearance mechanisms and drug diffusion, ultimately leading to MONDO:0021113. Effectively modelling the passage through mucus still represents an unmet challenge. An airway MONDO:0009061 mucus model is herein proposed to disassemble the complexity of the mucus barrier following a modular approach. A hydrogel, mainly composed of ncbi100508689 in an chemicalD000464 (chemicalD000464) network, is proposed to specifically model the chemical-physical properties of MONDO:0009061 mucus. The steric retention of pathological mucus was reproduced by targeting its mesh size (approximately 50 nm) and viscoelastic properties. The interactive barrier was reproduced by a composition inspired from the MONDO:0009061 mucus. Optimized mucus models, composed of 3 mg ml-1 chemicalD000464 and 25 mg ml-1 ncbi100508689, exhibited a G' increasing from ~21.2 to 55.2 Pa and a G'' ranging from ~5.26 to 28.8 Pa in the frequency range of 0.1 to 20 Hz. Drug diffusion was tested using three model drugs. The proposed mucus model was able to discriminate between the ncbi100508689-drug interaction and the steric barrier of a mucus layer with respect to the parallel artificial membrane permeability (PAMPA) that models the phospholipidic cell membrane, the state-of-the-art screening tool for passive drug diffusion. The mucus model can be proposed as an in vitro tool for early drug discovery, representing a step forward to model the mucus layer. Additionally, the proposed methodology allows to easily include other molecules present within mucus, as relevant proteins, chemicalD008055 and DNA.

A Systematic Review.MONDO:0009061 is an MONDO:0003847 caused by a mutation in genes for ncbi1080 (ncbi1080) protein. ncbi1080 gene is responsible for the production of sweat, digestive fluids, and mucus, and any mutation in this would lead to the thickening of these secretions. MONDO:0009061 is a multi-organ disorder, but 80% of 9606 suffer from respiratory problems due to chronic diseaseD007239 most commonly caused by 287 (287). Eradication of these diseaseD007239 has become a challenge as 287 has developed resistance to multiple antibiotics. In several studies, chemicalD007501 has been shown to play an integral role in biofilm formation, which is the predominant resistance mechanism used by 287 to combat antibiotics. The increased chemicalD007501 content in MONDO:0009061 9606' sputum samples explains their increased susceptibility to MONDO:0005141. Hence in this review article, we have used the research data available on therapeutic agents that target chemicalD007501 as an adjuvant treatment for chronic MONDO:0005141. We systematically screened three databases using focused words and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms for relevant articles. Further, we applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria and performed a thorough quality appraisal. Thirty shortlisted relevant studies were meticulously reviewed. In our opinion, novel therapeutic approaches targeting chemicalD007501 such as chemicalD007501 chelators, chemicalD005708, and chemicalC000612166 have potent anti-biofilm properties. Future studies and clinical trials using these approaches in the management of chronic MONDO:0005141 might help in decreasing morbidity and mortality in 9606 with MONDO:0009061. Exploring these approaches might also help to combat other resistant organisms whose survival is dependent on chemicalD007501.

DATA SOURCES: Studies identified through a MEDLINE search with the use of MeSH terms chemicalD014812, MONDO:0009061, PIVKA-II (protein induced by vitamin K absence-II), MONDO:0001531 and MONDO:0009061, and MONDO:0005154 and MONDO:0009061. STUDY SELECTION: Six articles published between January 1981 and December 1992 were selected: one general review of chemicalD014812 in infancy and five studies involving clinical trials of chemicalD014812 supplementation or screening for fat-soluble vitamins, chemicalD014812 or PIVKA-II in 9606 with MONDO:0009061. Review articles on nutrition in 9606 with MONDO:0009061, technical reports, letters, comments and case studies not bearing directly on these issues were excluded. DATA EXTRACTION: Findings in these articles were analysed and compared to determine whether routine supplementation in all 9606 with MONDO:0009061 is indicated, whether specific subgroups of these 9606 are susceptible to MONDO:0001244 and areas in which future research is needed. RESULTS: There is no consensus on routine chemicalD014812 supplementation in 9606 with MONDO:0009061. Studies have found a few cases of MONDO:0001244 among the population of people with MONDO:0009061. In addition, various factors--including MONDO:0001106, MONDO:0005154, bowel resection and long-term use of antibiotics--can put some of these 9606 at risk of MONDO:0001244. CONCLUSIONS: Specific indications for routine chemicalD014812 supplementation in all 9606 with MONDO:0009061 have not yet been identified. Pending further studies, it would be prudent to consider routine supplementation in 9606 with MONDO:0009061 and severe noncholestatic and MONDO:0005154, major small-bowel resection, MONDO:0001684 or MONDO:0005275 necessitating frequent use of antibiotics. A stronger body of evidence is needed as a basis for clinical strategies.

Indeed, 287 is the main pathogen in the MONDO:0024355 of these 9606. In this work, we developed sodium colistimethate loaded chemicalD008055 nanoparticles, namely, solid chemicalD008055 nanoparticles (SLN) and nanostructured chemicalD008055 carriers (NLC), as a strategy to enhance the antimicrobial therapy against 287 in MONDO:0009061 9606. The nanoparticles obtained displayed a 200-400 nm size, high drug entrapment (79-94%) and a sustained drug release profile. Moreover, both SLN and NLC presented antimicrobial activity against clinically isolated 287. The integrity of the nanoparticles was not affected by nebulization through a mesh vibrating nebulizer. Moreover, chemicalD008055 nanoparticles appeared to be less toxic than free sodium colistimethate in cell culture. Finally, an in vivo distribution experiment showed that nanoparticles spread homogenously through the lung and there was no migration of chemicalD008055 nanoparticles to other organs, such as liver, spleen or kidneys.
25125326		Probing the size limit for nanomedicine penetration into 87883 and 287 biofilms.Encapsulation of antibiotics into nanoparticles is a potential strategy to eradicate biofilms. To allow further optimization of nanomedicines for biofilm eradication, the influence of the nanoparticle size on the penetration into dense biofilm clusters needs to be investigated. In the present study, the penetration of nanoparticles with diameters ranging from 40 to 550 nm into two biofilms, Burkholderia multivorans LMG 18825 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa LMG 27622, was evaluated using confocal microscopy. Through image analysis, the percentage of particles able to penetrate into dense biofilm clusters was calculated. The size cut off for optimal penetration into biofilm clusters was located around 100-130 nm for both biofilms. The mesh size of the biofilm matrix and the size of the channels in between the bacteria of the clusters are two factors which likely play a role in the exclusion of the larger particles. For 87883, a sharp drop in the penetration into the clusters is seen for particles larger than 130 nm while for 287, a more gradual decrease in penetration could be observed. The overall penetration of the nanoparticles was slightly lower for 287 than for 87883. Based on these results, it could be concluded that nanocarriers of about 100 nm and smaller are good candidates to improve the treatment of chronic pulmonary biofilms in MONDO:0009061 9606. Furthermore, the confocal microscopy method demonstrated here is a useful tool to assess the penetration of nanomedicines in biofilm clusters. Such information is important to optimize nanomedicine formulations for the treatment of diseaseD007239.
19176245	Association|chemicalD011092|MONDO:0009061	"The penetration of fresh undiluted sputum expectorated by MONDO:0009061 9606 by non-adhesive chemicalD011108 nanoparticles.Highly viscoelastic and adhesive sputum has precluded efficient nanoparticle-based drug and gene delivery to the lungs of 9606 with MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061). We sought to determine whether nanoparticles coated with non-mucoadhesive polymers could penetrate MONDO:0009061 sputum, and to use these ""muco-inert particles"" (MIPs) as non-destructive nanoprobes to characterize the sputum microstructure. Particles as large as 200 nm in diameter that were densely coated with low MW chemicalD011092 (chemicalD011092) moved through undiluted MONDO:0009061 sputum with average speeds up to 90-fold faster than similarly-sized uncoated particles. On the other hand, the transport of both coated and uncoated 500 nm particles was strongly hindered. The local viscosity of sputum, encountered by the fastest 10% of 200 nm MIPs, was only 5-fold higher than that of chemicalD014867, whereas the bulk viscosity was 10,000-fold higher at low shear rates. Using measured transport rates of various sized MIPs combined with an obstruction-scaling model, we determined that the average 3D mesh spacing of MONDO:0009061 sputum is approximately 140+/-50 nm (range: 60-300 nm). Taken together, these results demonstrate that nanoparticles up to 200 nm in diameter that do not adhere to MONDO:0009061 sputum can move rapidly through this critical barrier by accessing pores that are filled with a low viscosity fluid. The results also offer hope that desperately needed sputum-penetrating drug- and gene-carrier nanoparticles can be developed for MONDO:0009061."

Activated neutrophils induce diseaseD007249 and severe MONDO:0021178 by releasing diseaseC536657 (diseaseC536657). The backbones of many DAMPs and diseaseC536657 are made of extracellular, cell-free DNA decorated with highly toxic compounds such as elastase, ncbi4353 and citrullinated histones. ncbi1773 is a FDA-approved recombinant 9606 ncbi1773 for the treatment of MONDO:0009061, which cleaves extracellular DNA and may break up cell-free DNA, loosening sticky mucus in the distal airways and reducing diseaseC536657-induced diseaseD064420 on alveolar pneumocytes. The COVIDornase trial intends to define the impact of aerosolized intra-tracheal ncbi1773 administration on the severity and progression of MONDO:0100130 (MONDO:0100130) in diseaseD000086382 9606. This drug might make lung mucus thinner and looser, promoting improved clearance of secretions and reduce extracellular double-stranded DNA-induced hyperinflammation in alveoli, preventing further damage to the lungs. TRIAL DESIGN: COVIDornase is a prospective, randomized, controlled, 2-arm (1:1 ratio), multicentric, open-label clinical trial. 9606: The study will recruit mechanically ventilated 9606 hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) in the recruiting centres (at the time of writing: The Rothschild foundation hospital in Paris, the Strasbourg university hospitals, and Metz-Thionville hospital) who have been diagnosed with diseaseD000086382 and meet MONDO:0100130 criteria. INCLUSION CRITERIA: - Adult 9606 (age >= 18 years old); - Hospitalized in ICU; - With severe diseaseD000086382 and MONDO:0100130 according to Berlin criteria (PaO2/FiO2 < 300 and PEEP > 5 cmH2O); - Intubated for less than 8 days; - With an anticipated duration of mechanical ventilation > 48 hours; - Carrier of an arterial catheter; - For whom 4 PaO2/FiO2 values over the preceding 24 hours are available; NON-INCLUSION CRITERIA: - Known MONDO:0000775 to ncbi1773 or any of its excipients; - Pregnant or breastfeeding status; - 9606 under legal protection. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Intervention 1, Study group ncbi1773 (Pulmozyme , Roche, Switzerland) will be administered by aerosol, at a dose of 2500 IU twice daily, 12 hours apart, for 7 consecutive days, using a vibrating mesh nebulizer (Aerogen Solo , Aerogen, Ireland). The remainder of the management will be performed in accordance with good clinical practice, including mechanical ventilation (protective ventilation, PEEP > 5 cmH2O, tracheal balloon pressure check every 4 hours or automatic device, 30  head of the bed elevation, tidal volume 6-8mL/kg, plateau pressure < 30 cmH2O), neuromuscular blockers if necessary, prone position if PaO2/FiO2 < 150, early enteral nutrition, glycemic control and a sedation protocol based on the RASS score. Intervention 2, Comparator 9606 will receive usual care in accordance with good practice (as detailed above), without aerosols. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome is the occurrence of at least one grade improvement between D0 (inclusion) and D7 in the MONDO:0100130 scale severity (Berlin criteria). For instance from ""severe"" to ""moderate"" or from ""moderate"" to ""mild"". RANDOMISATION: All consecutive 9606 meeting the inclusion criteria will be randomised 1:1 using an eCRF-based, computer-generated randomisation table, either to the ncbi1773 arm or to the control arm. An interim analysis will be performed after inclusion of 20 9606. Inclusions may be stopped at the interim analysis per data safety and monitoring board (DSMB) advice, if statistical analyses conclude on the futility or efficacy of the intervention or by other DSMB decision. BLINDING (MASKING): The 9606 and caregivers will not be blinded to study group assignment. Those assessing the outcomes will be blinded to study group assignment. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): Fifty 9606 will be randomized to each group, 100 9606 in total. TRIAL STATUS: Protocol version number 2, April 29th, 2020. Recruitment is ongoing. The trial started recruitment on the 21st April 2020. We estimate recruitment will finish August 21st 2020.

24675238		"Exploration of the impact of 'mild phenotypes' on median age at diseaseD003643 in the U.K. MONDO:0009061 registry.BACKGROUND: The widespread availability of genetic testing allowing the identification of ""milder"" individuals with MONDO:0009061 coincided with improvements in MONDO:0009061 life expectancy but the relative contribution of case mix to that improved survival is uncertain. METHODS: 9606 in the U.K. MONDO:0009061 registry were divided into 'mild phenotype' defined as MONDO:0004982 and 'typical MONDO:0009061' defined as MONDO:0001684. Distributions of age at diseaseD003643 were compared with Mann-Whitney test. Temporal trends in incidence and prevalence were described. Jonckheere-Terpstra test was used to compare the trend for median age at diseaseD003643 from 2007 to 2010. RESULTS: 9606 with 'mild phenotype' had significantly higher age at diseaseD003643 (32 years, interquartile range 14 years versus 27 years, interquartile range 29 years; Mann-Whitney test p-value = 0.026). The proportion of 9606 with 'mild phenotype' appeared to be increasing (0.128 in 2007, 0.144 in 2010). The trend for increasing age at diseaseD003643 (from 25 years in 2007 to 29 years in 2010, Jonckheere-Terpstra test p-value = 0.012) was independent of the 'mild phenotype' 9606. CONCLUSION: The impact of mild phenotypes on the improvement in the median age at diseaseD003643 among people with MONDO:0009061 was trivial."
28470579		Does probiotic supplementation affect diseaseD018450 and diseaseD007249 in MONDO:0009061: a systematic review of randomized clinical trials.BACKGROUND: 9606 with MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061) usually have abnormal intestinal microbiota due to massive exposure to antibiotics. Probiotics could modify the gut microbiota and hence may affect MONDO:0009061 management. So the aim of present systematic review was evaluation of the efficacy and safety of probiotic supplementation for the management of MONDO:0009061. DATA SOURCES: We searched PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar, Springer Cochrane Library Databases until January 2016 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) performed in pediatric or adult populations related to the study aim. Key words were selected based on Mesh terms. Based on the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist, eligibility of included articles was evaluated. RESULTS: Five studies included in this review represent 188 participants with a follow up period ranging from 1 month to 6 months. The results of the included studies supporting the use of probiotics in management of diseaseD018450 and intestinal calprotectin in 9606 with MONDO:0009061. However the level of evidence was limited. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of high quality RCTs makes it impossible to support a general recommendation about the use of probiotics in the treatment of MONDO:0009061 and diseaseD007249.
28315491		Vibrating-mesh nebulizer maintenance by MONDO:0009061 9606: Results from a French survey.PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Vibrating-mesh nebulizers are widely used at home for MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061) treatment, with a therapeutic efficiency closely linked to the mesh performance. This national study looks at the maintenance at home by MONDO:0009061 9606 and their families of the mesh of the eFlow rapid nebulizer. Ninety-two 9606 from 34 French MONDO:0009061 centers, treated at home with inhaled drugs delivered with a vibrating-mesh nebulizer, answered to a phone standardized questionnaire specifying the different techniques of maintenance of the nebulizer. PRINCIPAL RESULTS: 9606 were aged from 2 to 68 years (58.7% of children). They inhaled a mean of 1.8 nebulizations per day. Maintenance was assumed by 9606 in 36% of the cases. All steps of the theoretical maintenance of a nebulizer were respected in 66% of the cases. The mesh was not cleaned in 45.6%, not disinfected or not thermically disinfected in 32.5%, and not rinsed after chemical disinfection in 45.5% of the case. Only 49% of the 9606 knew the role of the MeshCare  system in the mesh maintenance, and only 39% had already used it when the nebulization duration reached 10 min. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts about education, particularly for the maintenance of the mesh, are needed for MONDO:0009061 9606 using a vibrating-mesh nebulizer at home.
19466909		Inhalation equipment hygiene: a belgian national survey.BACKGROUND: Nebulizers are a potential source of contamination of the respiratory tract. Nevertheless, only a few clear guidelines regarding cleaning and disinfection of nebulizers are available. This survey aims to analyze the common household methods used by MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061) 9606 in Belgium. METHODS: A questionnaire about type of nebulizer, methods, and frequency of cleaning, disinfection, and drying was established by physiotherapists at the Belgian MONDO:0009061 centers. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The Belgian MONDO:0009061 Association sent this questionnaire to all Belgian MONDO:0009061 9606. Of the 903 questionnaires distributed, 379 (42%) were returned. Fifty-two, 40 and 8% of 9606 used a vibrating-mesh nebulizer, jet nebulizer, or ultrasonic device, respectively. Ninety-eight percent of 9606 cleaned their material and soap was used by 35% of 9606. Disinfection was performed by 91% of the 9606 and was daily performed by 57% of 9606. Thermal disinfection (boiling chemicalD014867 or sterilizer), a chemicalD006997-based solution, or chemicalD019342 solution was used by 44, 29, and 25% of 9606, respectively, to disinfect their nebulizers. Thermal disinfection was used by 37 and 53% of 9606 using a classical or vibrating-mesh nebulizer, respectively. After cleaning or disinfection, 91% of the material was dried. The high percentage of Belgian MONDO:0009061 9606 disinfecting their nebulizer proves that they seem aware of the hygiene problem. The lack of unanimous guidelines in Belgium at the time of the study perhaps explains the variety of methods used. The arrival of vibrating-mesh nebulizers has led to a change in disinfection methods.
23633344	Negative_Correlation|chemicalD014031|MONDO:0009061	Nebuliser systems for drug delivery in MONDO:0009061.BACKGROUND: Nebuliser systems are used to deliver medications to control the symptoms and the progression of MONDO:0005275 in people with MONDO:0009061. Many types of nebuliser systems are available for use with various medications; however, there has been no previous systematic review which has evaluated these systems. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate effectiveness, safety, burden of treatment and adherence to nebulised therapy using different nebuliser systems for people with MONDO:0009061. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane MONDO:0009061 and MONDO:0003847 Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We searched the reference lists of each study for additional publications and approached the manufacturers of both nebuliser systems and nebulised medications for published and unpublished data. Date of the most recent search: 15 Oct 2012. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing nebuliser systems including conventional nebulisers, vibrating mesh technology systems, adaptive aerosol delivery systems and ultrasonic nebuliser systems. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion. They also independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. A third author assessed studies where agreement could not be reached. MAIN RESULTS: The search identified 40 studies with 20 of these (1936 participants) included in the review. These studies compared the delivery of chemicalD014031, colistin, dornase alfa, hypertonic chemicalD012965 and other solutions through the different nebuliser systems. This review demonstrates variability in the delivery of medication depending on the nebuliser system used. Conventional nebuliser systems providing higher flows, higher respirable fractions and smaller particles decrease treatment time, increase deposition and may be preferred by people with MONDO:0009061, as compared to conventional nebuliser systems providing lower flows, lower respirable fractions and larger particles. Nebulisers using adaptive aerosol delivery or vibrating mesh technology reduce treatment time to a far greater extent. Deposition (as a percentage of priming dose) is greater than conventional with adaptive aerosol delivery. Vibrating mesh technology systems may give greater deposition than conventional when measuring sputum levels, but lower deposition when measuring serum levels or using gamma scintigraphy. The available data indicate that these newer systems are safe when used with an appropriate priming dose, which may be different to the priming dose used for conventional systems. There is an indication that adherence is maintained or improved with systems which use these newer technologies, but also that some nebuliser systems using vibrating mesh technology may be subject to increased failures. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware of the variability in the performance of different nebuliser systems. Technologies such as adaptive aerosol delivery and vibrating mesh technology have advantages over conventional systems in terms of treatment time, deposition as a percentage of priming dose, 9606 preference and adherence. There is a need for long-term randomised controlled trials of these technologies to determine 9606-focused outcomes (such as quality of life and burden of care), safe and effective dosing levels of medications and clinical outcomes (such as hospitalisations and need for antibiotics) and an economic evaluation of their use.
27812540		Microstructural alterations of sputum in diseaseC563237.The stasis of mucus secretions in the lungs of MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061) 9606 leads to recurrent diseaseD007239 and pulmonary exacerbations, resulting in decreased survival. Prior studies have assessed the biochemical and biophysical features of airway mucus in individuals with MONDO:0009061. However, these measurements are unable to probe mucus structure on microscopic length scales relevant to key players in the progression of MONDO:0009061-related MONDO:0005275, namely, viruses, bacteria, and neutrophils. In this study, we quantitatively determined sputum microstructure based on the diffusion of muco-inert nanoparticle probes in MONDO:0009061 sputum and found that a reduction in sputum mesh pore size is characteristic of MONDO:0009061 9606 with reduced lung function, as indicated by measured FEV1. We also discovered that the effect of ex vivo treatment of MONDO:0009061 sputum with rhDNase I (Pulmozyme) on microstructure is dependent upon the time interval between the most recent inhaled rhDNase I treatment and the sample collection. Microstructure of mucus may serve as a marker for the extent of diseaseC563237 and as a parameter for assessing the effectiveness of mucus-altering agents.
19025706		Aerosol delivery of recombinant 9606 DNase I: in vitro comparison of a vibrating-mesh nebulizer with a jet nebulizer.BACKGROUND: Inhaled recombinant 9606 DNase I (rhDNase) improves clearance of visco-elastic secretions in 9606 with MONDO:0009061. Because of their portability, newer-generation vibrating-mesh nebulizers offer greater convenience for the 9606, but their efficiency in delivering rhDNase has not been determined. METHODS: We compared a newer-generation vibrating-mesh nebulizer (Omron MicroAir) to a Pari LC+ with the Pari ProNeb Ultra compressor (a commonly employed rhDNase administration system). With the Next Generation Pharmaceutical Impactor, we determined aerosol particle distribution. We also measured mass output efficiency, nebulization time, and mass of rhDNase that deposited on a filter during simulated breathing. RESULTS: The mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) and geometric standard deviation (GSD) of aerosol from the MicroAir (MMAD 4.3 microm, GSD 2.8 microm) was equivalent to that from the Pari LC+ (MMAD 4.2 microm, GSD 2.7 microm). During simulated breathing the MicroAir had a higher total mass output efficiency (88%) than the Pari LC+ (68%) (P < .001), and total nebulization time was shorter with the MicroAir (6.1 min vs 7.2 min, P = .03). When nebulized to dryness, the mass of rhDNase delivered to the filter was comparable with the MicroAir (1.30 +/- 0.4 mg) and Pari LC+ (1.21 +/- 0.05 mg). CONCLUSION: The MicroAir could be employed as a portable nebulizer for rhDNase therapy in 9606 with MONDO:0009061.
18830514		Newborn screening: what pediatricians should know.OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on the current situation of neonatal screening worldwide and in Brazil. To define the role of pediatricians in neonatal screening programs. SOURCES: Scientific articles selected by means of searches run on the medical websites MEDLINE, Cochrane, PubMed (MeSH) and MD Consult, using the keywords newborn screening, neonatal, pediatrics, diagnosis, primary care, ethics and their equivalents in Portuguese, in isolation and in combination, in addition to medical textbooks on genetics and MONDO:0019052, published between January 1998 and December 2007, the National Neonatal Screening Program technical standards and routines manual, and Ministry of Health decree 822/2001. SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS: Published data demonstrate a great diversity in the number of diseases included in the neonatal screening programs of different countries. In Brazil, the National Neonatal Screening Program was set up in 2001, to screen for MONDO:0009861, MONDO:0018612, MONDO:0011382 and MONDO:0009061. Screening for a wider range of conditions using mass spectrometry is currently the subject of disagreement and discussion of financial and ethical issues. CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal screening is one of the most important advances for the prevention of pediatric diseases. Nevertheless, implementation is complex, multidisciplinary and dependent on public health policies and, to date, there is no consensus on which diseases should be included. A large number of scientific and ethical questions need to be discussed in order to better define the screening panels to be implemented. Pediatricians have important roles to play in all stages of neonatal screening programs.
37942828		Nebuliser systems for drug delivery in MONDO:0009061.BACKGROUND: Nebuliser systems are used to deliver medications to the lungs, to control the symptoms and the progression of MONDO:0005275 in people with MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061). There are many different nebulised-medications prescribed for people with MONDO:0009061 and there are many different types of nebuliser systems. Some of these nebulised medications are licenced for, and can be taken via only one type of nebuliser system; some are licensed for, and can be taken via more than one type of nebuliser system. This is an update to a previous systematic review. OBJECTIVES: To assess the time efficiency, effectiveness, safety, cost and impact of use (e.g. burden of care, adherence, quality of life (QoL)) of different nebuliser systems, when used with different inhaled medications for people with MONDO:0009061. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane MONDO:0009061 and MONDO:0003847 Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearching of relevant journals and abstract books containing conference proceedings. We searched the reference lists of each study for additional publications and approached the manufacturers of both nebuliser systems and nebulised medications for published and unpublished data. We also searched online trial registries. Date of the most recent search: 9 August 2023. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs comparing nebuliser systems, including conventional nebulisers, vibrating mesh technology (VMT) systems, adaptive aerosol delivery (AAD) systems and ultrasonic nebuliser systems. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion. They also independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. A third review author assessed studies where agreement could not be reached. They assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: The search identified 216 studies with 33 of these (2270 participants) included in the review. These studies compared the delivery of chemicalD014031, colistin, dornase alfa, chemicalD012965 and other solutions through the different nebuliser systems in children and adults with MONDO:0009061. This review demonstrates variability in the delivery of medication depending on the nebuliser system used. The certainty of the evidence ranged from low to very low. Some conventional nebuliser systems providing higher flows, higher respirable fractions, and smaller particles decrease treatment time, increase deposition (the amount of drug reaching the lung), and may be preferred by people with MONDO:0009061, as compared to other conventional nebuliser systems providing lower flows, lower respirable fractions and larger particles. Newer nebuliser systems using AAD, or VMT (or both) reduce treatment time compared to conventional systems. Deposition (as a percentage of priming dose) with AAD is greater than with conventional systems. VMT systems may give greater deposition than conventional systems when measuring sputum levels. The available data indicate that these newer systems are safe when used with an appropriate priming dose, which may be different to the priming dose used for conventional systems. There is an indication that adherence is maintained or improved and that individuals prefer AAD or VMT systems, but also that some nebuliser systems using VMT may be subject to increased system failures. There is limited, unclear evidence on the impact of different nebuliser systems on lung function and a lack of data on the impact of different nebuliser systems on our outcomes of quality of life (QoL), adverse effects, MONDO:0021113 exacerbations and related implications, adherence, satisfaction, cost and device reliability. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Newer technologies e.g. AAD and VMT have advantages over conventional systems in terms of treatment time, deposition as a percentage of priming dose, preference and adherence. Data are lacking for all varieties of medications which are used in MONDO:0009061 care, including different inhaled antibiotics or chemicalD012965, with all delivery (nebuliser system) possibilities. Long-term RCTs are needed to evaluate different nebuliser systems to determine patient-focused outcomes (such as QoL and burden of care), safe and effective dosing levels of a wide variety of medications, clinical outcomes (such as hospitalisations and need for antibiotics), and an economic evaluation of their use. There are insufficient data to establish whether one nebuliser system is better than another overall. Clinicians should be aware of the variability in the performance of different nebuliser systems, compatibility with specific nebulised medication, and they must work with their patients to choose the best nebuliser system for each individual. This is likely to be an ongoing process as the needs and circumstances of each individual change over time.
28741229		Inhaled Antimicrobials for Ventilator-Associated MONDO:0005249: Practical Aspects.Positive experience with inhaled antibiotics in MONDO:0024355 of 9606 with MONDO:0009061 has paved the way for their utilization in mechanically ventilated, critically ill 9606 with lower MONDO:0024355. A successful antibiotic delivery depends upon the size of the generated particle and the elimination of drug impaction in the large airways and the ventilator circuit. Generated droplet size is mainly affected by the type of the nebulizer employed. Currently, jet, ultrasonic, and vibrating mesh nebulizers are marketed; the latter can deliver optimal antibiotic particle size. Promising novel drug-device combinations are able to release drug concentrations of 25- to 300-fold the minimum inhibitory concentration of the targeted pathogens into the pulmonary alveoli. The most important practical steps of nebulization include pre-assessment and preparation of the 9606 (suctioning, sedation, possible bronchodilation, adjustment of necessary ventilator settings); adherence to the procedure (drug preparation, avoidance of unnecessary tubing connections, interruption of heated humidification, removal of heat-moisture exchanger); inspection of the procedure (check for residual in drug chamber, change of expiratory filter, return sedation, and ventilator settings to previous status); and surveillance of the 9606 for adverse events (close monitoring of the 9606 and particularly of peak airway pressure and bronchoconstriction). Practical aspects of nebulization are very important to ensure optimal drug delivery and safe procedure for the 9606. Therefore, the development of an operational checklist is a priority for every department adopting this modality.
24688094	Negative_Correlation|chemicalD012210|diseaseD000013; Association|chemicalC069249|chemicalC088139	A 95486 MurJ (MviN) homolog is essential for cell wall peptidoglycan synthesis and bacterial viability.The cell wall peptidoglycan (PG) of 95486, an opportunistic pathogen, has not yet been characterized. However, the 95486 genome contains homologs of genes encoding PG biosynthetic functions in other bacteria. PG biosynthesis involves the formation of the chemicalC088139-linked N-acetyl glucosamine-N-acetyl muramic acid-pentapeptide, known as chemicalC069249, which is built on the cytosolic face of the cell membrane. chemicalC069249 is then translocated across the membrane and its chemicalD006020 moiety becomes incorporated into the growing cell wall mesh; this translocation step is critical to PG synthesis. We have investigated candidate flippase homologs of the MurJ family in 95486. Our results show that BCAL2764, herein referred to as murJBc, is indispensable for viability. Viable 95486 could only be obtained through a conditional mutagenesis strategy by placing murJBc under the control of a chemicalD012210-inducible promoter. Under chemicalD012210 depletion, the conditional strain stopped growing and individual cells displayed diseaseD000013 consistent with a defect in PG synthesis. Bacterial cells unable to express MurJBc underwent cell lysis, while partial MurJBc depletion sensitized the mutant to the action of chemicalD047090 antibiotics. Depletion of MurJBc caused accumulation of PG precursors consistent with the notion that this protein plays a role in chemicalC069249 flipping to the periplasmic compartment. Reciprocal complementation experiments of conditional murJ mutants in 95486 and 562 with plasmids expressing MurJ from each strain indicated that MurJBc and MurJEc are functional homologs. Together, our results are consistent with the notion that MurJBc is a PG lipid II flippase in 95486. 
19466906	Negative_Correlation|chemicalD014031|MONDO:0009061	Changes in performance of the Pari eFlow rapid and Pari LC Plus during 6 months use by MONDO:0009061 9606.BACKGROUND: Nebulized antibiotics are important in the treatment of MONDO:0009061. The Pari eFlow rapid with vibrating mesh is often used off-label for the administration of chemicalD014031 (chemicalD014031) because of a reduced nebulization time and easier handling compared to a classic nebulizer-compressor combination. Mesh technology may be vulnerable, however. Therefore, we investigated particle size distribution and output as well as changes in the performance of the eFlow before and after 6 months of use, in comparison with the Pari LC Plus nebulizer plus Turboboy compressor. METHODS: Size distributions in the aerosols and nebulization times for chemicalD014031 were measured with laser diffraction technique; delivered doses by weighing. RESULTS: New eFlows produce considerably larger droplets (X(50) = 3.5 mum) from chemicalD014031 than new LC Plus nebulizers (X(50) = 2.8 mum). After use, the X(50) increases for both systems (to 3.7 and 3.3 mum, respectively). The relative span of the size distribution {(X(90)-X(10))/X(50)} changes from 1.26 to 1.28 mum for eFlow and from 2.19 to 2.45 mum for LC Plus. The total nebulization time doubles for LC Plus, whereas in 51% of all experiments the eFlow switched off after 10 min, resulting in incomplete dose delivery. For the eFlow, changes during use are related to clogging of orifices. Once being clogged, only replacement of the mesh restores the original performance. CONCLUSIONS: New eFlows produce larger droplets and in a narrower size range compared to new LC Plus nebulizers for chemicalD014031, and therefore both devices are not equivalent. Theoretically a larger portion of the aerosol from eFlow is likely to be deposited in the upper airways. The performance of both tested nebulizers decreases after 6 months of use. For the eFlow, timely replacement of the mesh is necessary. These in vitro results underscore the importance of registration studies of new drug-device combinations.
6817037	Cotreatment|chemicalC005095|chemicalD005976	Comparative ultrastructure of a mucoid strain of 287 isolated from MONDO:0009061 9606 and its spontaneous non-mucoid mutant.The ultrastructure of a mucoid strain of 287 of MONDO:0009061 origin and its spontaneous non-mucoid variant was compared by transmission electron microscopy. Negatively-stained preparations of the mucoid strain obtained from plate cultures demonstrated dense, fibrous material projecting from the cell. No such material was observed in thin-sections or in negatively-strained preparations from liquid cultures. Thin-sections of chemicalD000431-precipitated extracellular material from liquid cultures of the mucoid-strain revealed a cottony mesh of thin electron dense fibres. The non-mucoid strain did not produce such material. When prefixed with chemicalD005976/chemicalC005095 mixture, cells of both strains demonstrated electron dense intracellular and extracellular chemicalC005095-stainable structures. The internal complexes were frequently associated with the nucleoid or cell membrane and were replaced by electron transparent areas in cells prefixed with chemicalD005976 alone. Aeruginocins of the R-type were observed in chemicalD016685 induced cultures of both strains. Bacteriophages with 'claw-shaped' tail-tips were observed in the mucoid strain. Crystalline material was produced by the mucoid strain but only when plated on certain media.
37734235		Comparison of chemicalD000583 lung delivery between AKITA  and eFlow rapid  nebulizers in healthy controls and patients with MONDO:0009061: A randomized cross-over trial.INTRODUCTION: Nebulization plays a key role in the treatment of MONDO:0009061. The Favorite function couple to jet nebulizers (AKITA ) emerged recently. The aim of this study was to assess the efficiency of the lung delivery by the AKITA  by comparing the urinary concentration of chemicalD000583 after nebulization with the AKITA  and the eFlow rapid , in healthy subjects and patients with MONDO:0009061 (PwCF). METHOD: The two samples (healthy subjects and PwCF) were randomized (cross-over 1:1) for two nebulizations (500 mg of chemicalD000583 diluted in 4 mL of normal saline solution), with the AKITA  and with the eFlow rapid . The primary endpoint was the amount of urinary excretion of chemicalD000583 over 24 h. The constant of elimination (Ke) was calculated based on the maximal cumulative urinary chemicalD000583 excretion plotted over time. RESULTS: The total amount of urinary chemicalD000583 excretion was greater when AKITA  was used in PwCF (11.7 mg (8.2-14.1) vs 6.1 mg (3.7-13.3); p = 0.02) but not different in healthy subjects (14.5 mg (11.7-18.5) vs 12.4 mg (8.0-17.1); p = 0.12). The duration of the nebulization was always shorter with eFlow rapid  than with AKITA  (PwCF: 6.5 +- 0.6 min vs 9.2 +- 1.8 min; p = 0.001 - Healthy: 4.7 +- 1.3 min vs 9.7 +- 1.6 min; p = 0.03). The constant of elimination was similar between the two modalities in MONDO:0009061 subjects (0.153 (0.071-0.205) vs 0.149 (0.041-0.182); p = 0.26) and in healthy subjects (0.166 (0.130-0.218) vs 0.167 (0.119-0.210), p = 0.25). CONCLUSION: the Favorite inhalation is better to deliver a specific amount of drug than a mesh nebulizer (eFlow rapid ) in PwCF but not in healthy subjects.
7532167		Structurally variant classes of pilus appendage fibers coexpressed from Burkholderia (Pseudomonas) cepacia.One or more of five morphologically distinct classes of appendage pili were determined to be peritrichously expressed by 292formerly 292 isolated from disparate sources. 292-encoded cblA pilin gene hybridization-based analysis revealed that one associated class, cable (Cbl) adhesin type IIB. cepacia pili, correlates with epidemically transmitted strains from a single MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061) center. When only phenotypic assays were available, correlations between the source and the pilus type were nonetheless observed: filamentous (Fil) type IIIB. cepacia pili correlated with MONDO:0009061-associated nonepidemic isolates, diseaseD009085. cepacia pili correlated with clinical (non-MONDO:0009061) isolates, and spike (Spk) type VB. cepacia pili correlated with environmental isolates. Further, Cbl, Fil, or Spk pili typically appear as an internal framework for constitutively coexpressed, peritrichously arranged dense mats of fine, curly mesh (Msh) type IB. cepacia pili. Constitutive coexpression of dense mats of Msh type IB. cepacia pili in association with a labyrinth of either Cbl, Fil, or Spk pili suggests possible cooperative pilus interactions mediating adhesion-based colonization in the differing environments from which the strains were isolated. Despite such correlations, phylogenetic analyses indicate that with the exception of the epidemically transmitted clusters of isolates, the remaining 292 strains from the other three sources exhibited an equal degree of genetic relatedness independent of origin. As previously found for 562, this discrepancy could be accounted for by selection-driven, in vivo horizontal transfer events between distantly related members of the species 292, leading to the genetic acquisition of environmentally appropriate adhesion-based colonization pilus operons.
31108949	Negative_Correlation|chemicalD000089882|MONDO:0009061; Negative_Correlation|chemicalD010455|MONDO:0009061	Vibrating Mesh Nebulisation of Pro-Antimicrobial chemicalD010455 for Use in MONDO:0009061.BACKGROUND: There has been considerable interest in the use of antimicrobial chemicalD010455 (chemicalD000089882) as antimicrobial therapeutics in many conditions including MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061). The aim of this study is to determine if the prodrugs of chemicalD000089882 (pro-chemicalD000089882) can be delivered to the lung by a vibrating mesh nebuliser (VMN) and whether the pro-chemicalD000089882 modification has any effect on delivery. METHODS: Physical characteristics of the chemicalD010455 (chemicalD000089882 and prochemicalD000089882) and antimicrobial activity were compared before and after nebulisation. Droplet size distribution was determined by laser diffraction and cascade impaction. Delivery to a model lung was determined in models of spontaneously-breathing and mechanically-ventilated 9606. RESULTS: The physical characteristics and antimicrobial activities were unchanged after nebulisation. Mean droplet size diameters were below 5 mum in both determinations, with the fine particle fraction approximately 67% for both chemicalD010455. Approximately 25% of the nominal dose was delivered in the spontaneously-breathing model for both chemicalD010455, with higher deliveries observed in the mechanically-ventilated model. Delivery times were approximately 170 s per mL for both chemicalD010455 and the residual volume in the nebuliser was below 10% in nearly all cases. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that the delivery of (pro-)chemicalD000089882 to the lung using a VMN is feasible and that the prodrug modification is not detrimental. They support the further development of pro-chemicalD000089882 as therapeutics in MONDO:0009061.
18634743		Bilateral retrovascular HP:0100541.A 34-year-old 9606 with MONDO:0009061 presented with bilateral HP:0100541, which were found to be retrovascular at operation. The HP:0100790 were not amenable to conventional open or laparoscopic repair, and were repaired using pre-peritoneal mesh inserted deep to transversalis fascia. The anatomical basis and management of uncommon variants of HP:0100541 are discussed.
30223075	Negative_Correlation|chemicalD002939|MONDO:0009061; Negative_Correlation|chemicalD002939|MONDO:0024355	Synergy of nebulized phage PEV20 and chemicalD002939 combination against 287.Nebulization is currently used for delivery of antibiotics for MONDO:0024355. Bacteriophages (or phages) are effective predators of pathogens including 287 commonly found in the lungs of 9606 with MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061). It is known that phages and antibiotics can potentially show synergistic antimicrobial effect on bacterial killing. In the present study, we investigated synergistic antimicrobial effect of phage PEV20 with five different antibiotics against three 287 strains isolated from sputum of MONDO:0009061 9606. The antibiotics included chemicalD002939, chemicalD014031, colistin, chemicalD001398 and chemicalD000583, which are approved by U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for inhaled administration. Phage and antibiotic synergy was determined by assessing bacterial killing performing time-kill studies. Among the different phage-antibiotic combinations, PEV20 and chemicalD002939 exhibited the most synergistic effect. Two phage-chemicalD002939 combinations, containing 1/4 and 1/2 of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of chemicalD002939 against 287 strains FADD1-PA001 (A) and JIP865, respectively were aerosolized using both air-jet and vibrating mesh nebulizers and the synergistic antibacterial activity was maintained after nebulization. Air-jet nebulizer generated droplets with smaller volume median diameters (3.6-3.7 microm) and slightly larger span (2.3-2.4) than vibrating mesh nebulizers (5.1-5.3 microm; 2.1-2.2), achieving a higher fine particle fraction (FPF) of 70%. In conclusion, nebulized phage PEV20 and chemicalD002939 combination shows promising antimicrobial and aerosol characteristics for potential treatment of MONDO:0024355 caused by drug-resistant 287.

The treatment strategy in both MONDO:0020683 (MONDO:0020683) and diseaseD000092562 (diseaseD000092562) is to reduce the severity of the symptoms, minimize the duration of the disease and prevent complications. Topical therapy has become an important tool in otolaryngologists armamentarium for diseaseD000092562 treatment. Recently, topical chemicalD006820 (chemicalD006820), the major component of many extracellular matrices that promotes tissue healing, including activation and moderation of the diseaseD007249 responses, cell proliferation, migration and angiogenesis, has been proposed for MONDO:0020683 and diseaseD000092562 adjuvant tool. The aim of the study is to systematically review the published literature regarding all the therapeutic effects of chemicalD006820 on the MONDO:0020683 and diseaseD000092562. Relevant published studies were found in PubMed, Google Scholar and Ovid, using a combined keyword search or medical subject headings. At the end of our study selection process, 5 relevant publications were included: 2 of them investigated the potential role of chemicalD006820 in reducing symptoms and preventing exacerbations of diseaseD000092562 in adult population, two of them in paediatric 9606 affected by upper MONDO:0024355 and one of them in MONDO:0009061 9606 with bacterial rhinopharyngitis. Data deriving from the present review of 5 clinical studies showed that the use of topical chemicalD006820 represents a relevant therapeutic advance in diseaseD000092562 to minimize symptoms and prevent reacutization with a significant improvement of their quality of life, as it avoids systemic side effects and increases local drug activity. Further studies on larger populations and with new specific nebulization devices for upper airway are needed to confirm these encouraging results.
33919035		Evaluation of Aerosol Therapy during the Escalation of Care in a Model of Adult MONDO:0009061.MONDO:0005275 is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061). MONDO:0009061 9606 inhale antibiotics regularly as treatment against persistent MONDO:0005113. The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of clinical intervention on aerosol therapy during the escalation of care using a bench model of adult MONDO:0009061. Droplet size analysis of selected antibiotics was completed in tandem with the delivered aerosol dose (% of total dose) assessments in simulations of various interventions providing chemicalD010100 supplementation or ventilatory support. Results highlight the variability of aerosolised dose delivery. In the homecare setting, the vibrating mesh nebuliser (VMN) delivered significantly more than the jet nebuliser (JN) (16.15 +- 0.86% versus 6.51 +- 2.15%). In the hospital setting, using VMN only, significant variability was seen across clinical interventions. In the emergency department, VMN plus mouthpiece (no supplemental chemicalD010100) was seen to deliver (29.02 +- 1.41%) versus low flow nasal therapy (10 L per minute (LPM) chemicalD010100) (1.81 +- 0.47%) and high flow nasal therapy (50 LPM chemicalD010100) (3.36 +- 0.34%). In the ward/intensive care unit, non-invasive ventilation recorded 19.02 +- 0.28%, versus 22.64 +- 1.88% of the dose delivered during invasive mechanical ventilation. These results will have application in the design of intervention-appropriate aerosol therapy strategies and will be of use to researchers developing new therapeutics for application in MONDO:0009061 and beyond.
20625676		Cell profile of BAL fluid in children and adolescents with and without MONDO:0005275.The objective of this study was to review the literature on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cell profiles in healthy children and adolescents, as well as on the use of BAL as a diagnostic and follow-up tool for MONDO:0005275 9606 in this age bracket. To that end, we used the Medline database, compiling studies published between 1989 and 2009 employing the following MeSH descriptors (with Boolean operators) as search terms: bronchoalveolar lavage AND cytology OR cell AND child. In healthy children, the cell profile includes alveolar macrophages (> 80%), lymphocytes (approximately 10%), neutrophils (approximately 2%) and eosinophils (< 1%). The profile varies depending on the disease under study. The number of neutrophils is greater in HP:0030831 children, especially in non-atopic children, as well as in those with pulmonary MONDO:0005550 and diseaseD007249 profiles, including MONDO:0009061 and MONDO:0015925. Eosinophil counts are elevated in children/adolescents with MONDO:0004979 and can reach high levels in those with MONDO:0015243 or MONDO:0015691. In a heterogeneous group of diseases, the number of lymphocytes can increase. Evaluation of the BAL fluid cell profile, when used in conjunction with clinical and imaging findings, has proven to be an essential tool in the investigation of various MONDO:0005275. Less invasive than transbronchial and open lung biopsies, BAL has great clinical value. Further studies adopting standard international protocols should be carried out. Such studies should involve various age groups and settings in order to obtain reference values for BAL fluid cell profiles, which are necessary for a more accurate interpretation of findings in children and adolescents with MONDO:0005275.
31047122		Activity monitors in MONDO:0005275.Physical activity is reduced in 9606 with diseaseD002908. Activity monitors can measure physical activity objectively and accurately over prolonged periods of time. Research grade and commercially available devices, using accelerometer technology, are being increasingly used in clinical studies. Physical activity levels have been found to have a moderate to strong correlation with important measures such as pulmonary function, exercise capacity, quality of life, and mortality and hospitalizations in 9606 with MONDO:0005002, MONDO:0015925, diseaseD000081029 and MONDO:0009061. Their use as a clinical trial end-point and as a tool to augment rehabilitation efforts has also been explored in 9606 with MONDO:0005002 with variable results. Due to the ease of use, economic viability, widespread availability and good 9606 compliance, their use in adult and pediatric medicine is expanding. This narrative review summarizes the current evidence of use of activity monitors in MONDO:0005002, MONDO:0015925, MONDO:0004979, diseaseD000081029, MONDO:0009061 and lung transplant 9606 for the purposes of prognostication, monitoring, outcome measures and intervention.
36439573		Inhaled Antibiotics in MONDO:0004822 (MONDO:0004822): A Systematic Review of Efficacy and Limitations in Adult 9606.MONDO:0004822 has recently been under the spotlight due to a better detection rate with advanced imaging techniques. Recurrent diseaseD007239 in such 9606 are the main cause of their deterioration. This invariably leads to a catastrophic wheel of decline diseaseD055370, reinfection, and repeated hospital consultations. The main goal of their management is based on the principles of prevention and vigorous treatment of recurrent diseaseD007239. This review aimed to gather recent therapeutic options for inhaled antibacterial use in such 9606 and compare them for their properties of safety and efficacy. Studies done in the last 10 years on adult 9606 were gathered using the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) strategy and later sorted using the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Research engines used include Google Scholar, PubMed, and the Saudi Digital Library. Out of the 31,739 articles identified initially, 1362 were screened. The final eight selected papers were assessed for quality by using the quality assessment checklist, the Cochrane bias assessment tool, the Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles (SANRA) tools and cross-examined by co-authors. We concluded that the use of inhaled antibiotics as an adjuvant and follow-up treatment option is associated with better short and long-term prognoses in 9606. They lead to lesser systemic side effects than the oral and intravenous varieties available on the market. However, the establishment of a hierarchy among the subgroups remains a grey area that needs further research.
30904464		MONDO:0009061 in the modern therapeutic era: Give the shower a thought!Fifty-two meshes of e-flow rapid  were characterized for chemicalD014031 delivery with a laser diffractometer after 6 months of home use by MONDO:0009061 9606 treated with various nebulized drugs. Three meshes were out of order and 30 considered to be defective for chemicalD014031 delivery. The use of the specific mesh cleaning shower system permitted 14 defective meshes to be in the expected range of nebulized volume.
26106207		Radioaerosol Pulmonary Deposition Using Mesh and Jet Nebulizers During Noninvasive Ventilation in Healthy Subjects.BACKGROUND: In vivo deposition studies of aerosol administration during noninvasive ventilation (NIV) are scarce in the literature. The aim of this study was to compare radioaerosol pulmonary index and radioaerosol mass balance in the different compartments (pulmonary and extrapulmonary) of radio-tagged aerosol administered using vibrating mesh nebulizers and conventional jet nebulizers during NIV. METHODS: This was a crossover clinical trial involving 10 healthy subjects (mean age of 33.7 +- 10.0 y) randomly assigned to both treatment arms of this study: group 1 (NIV + vibrating mesh nebulizer, n = 10) and group 2 (NIV + jet nebulizer, n = 10). All subjects inhaled 3 mL of technetium-99m diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (25 mCi) and 0.9% saline solution via vibrating mesh and jet nebulizers during NIV through a face mask secured with straps while receiving positive inspiratory and expiratory pressures of 12 and 5 cm chemicalD014867, respectively. Scintigraphy was performed to count radioaerosol particles deposited in the regions of interest to determine radioaerosol mass balance from the lungs, upper airways, stomach, nebulizer, ventilator circuit, inspiratory and expiratory filters, and mask as a percentage. RESULTS: Vibrating mesh nebulizers deposited 972,013 +- 214,459 counts versus jet nebulizer with 386,025 +- 130,363 counts (P = .005). In a determination of mass balance, vibrating mesh nebulizers showed a higher deposition of inhaled radioaerosol compared with jet nebulizers (23.1 +- 5.8% vs 6.1 +- 2.5%, P = .005) and a higher proportion of radioaerosol deposited into the lungs (5.5 +- 0.9% versus 1.5 +- 0.6%, respectively, P = .005). The residual drug volume was lower with vibrating mesh nebulizers (5.1 +- 1.5%) compared with jet nebulizers (41.3 +- 4.2%, P = .005). CONCLUSIONS: During NIV in healthy subjects, vibrating mesh nebulizers delivered > 2-fold more radiolabeled drug into the respiratory tract compared with conventional jet nebulizers. Additional studies are recommended in subjects with MONDO:0004979, MONDO:0005002, MONDO:0004822, and MONDO:0009061 to better understand differences in both aerosol delivery and response.

21385138	Association|chemicalD011092|MONDO:0009061; Negative_Correlation|chemicalD000111|MONDO:0009061	Rapid transport of muco-inert nanoparticles in MONDO:0009061 sputum treated with chemicalD000111.AIMS: Sputum poses a critical diffusional barrier that strongly limits the efficacy of drug and gene carriers in the airways of individuals with MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061). Previous attempts to enhance particle penetration of MONDO:0009061 sputum have focused on either reducing its barrier properties via mucolytics, or decreasing particle adhesion to sputum constituents by coating the particle surface with non-mucoadhesive polymers, including chemicalD011092 (chemicalD011092). Neither approach has enabled particles to penetrate expectorated sputum at rates previously observed for non-mucoadhesive nanoparticles in 9606 cervicovaginal mucus. Here, we sought to investigate whether a common mucolytic, chemicalD000111 (chemicalD000111), in combination with dense chemicalD011092 coatings on particles, can synergistically enhance particle penetration across fresh undiluted MONDO:0009061 sputum. MATERIALS & METHODS: We used high-resolution multiple particle tracking to measure the diffusion of uncoated and chemicalD011092-coated nanoparticles in native and chemicalD000111-treated MONDO:0009061 sputum. RESULTS: We discovered that 200 nm particles, if densely coated with chemicalD011092, were able to penetrate MONDO:0009061 sputum pretreated with chemicalD000111 with average speeds approaching their theoretical speeds in chemicalD014867. Based on the rapid penetration of chemicalD011092-coated particles in chemicalD000111-treated sputum, we determined that the average spacing between sputum mesh elements was increased from 145 +- 50 nm to 230 +- 50 nm upon chemicalD000111 treatment. Mathematical models based on particle transport rates suggest as much as 75 and 30% of 200 and 500 nm chemicalD011092-coated particles, respectively, may penetrate a physiologically thick chemicalD000111-treated MONDO:0009061 sputum layer within 20 min. Uncoated particles were trapped in MONDO:0009061 sputum pretreated with chemicalD000111 nearly to the same extent as in native sputum, suggesting that chemicalD000111 treatment alone offered little improvement to particle penetration. CONCLUSION: chemicalD000111 facilitated rapid diffusion of chemicalD011092-coated, muco-inert nanoparticles in MONDO:0009061 sputum. Our results provide a promising strategy to improve drug and gene carrier penetration in MONDO:0009061 sputum, offering hope for improved therapies for MONDO:0009061.
24865497		Aerosol delivery of DNA/liposomes to the lung for MONDO:0009061 gene therapy.Abstract Lung gene therapy is being evaluated for a range of acute and chronic diseases, including MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061). As these therapies approach clinical realization, it is becoming increasingly clear that the ability to efficiently deliver gene transfer agents (GTAs) to target cell populations within the lung may prove just as critical as the gene therapy formulation itself in terms of generating positive clinical outcomes. Key to the success of any aerosol gene therapy is the interaction between the GTA and nebulization device. We evaluated the effects of aerosolization on our preferred formulation, plasmid DNA (pDNA) complexed with the cationic liposome GL67A (pDNA/GL67A) using commercially available nebulizer devices. The relatively high viscosity (6.3+-0.1 cP) and particulate nature of pDNA/GL67A formulations hindered stable aerosol generation in ultrasonic and vibrating mesh nebulizers but was not problematic in the jet nebulizers tested. Aerosol size characteristics varied significantly between devices, but the AeroEclipse II nebulizer operating at 50 psi generated stable pDNA/GL67A aerosols suitable for delivery to the MONDO:0009061 lung (mass median aerodynamic diameter 3.4+-0.1 mum). Importantly, biological function of pDNA/GL67A formulations was retained after nebulization, and although aerosol delivery rate was lower than that of other devices (0.17+-0.01 ml/min), the breath-actuated AeroEclipse II nebulizer generated aerosol only during the inspiratory phase and as such was more efficient than other devices with 83+-3% of generated aerosol available for 9606 inhalation. On the basis of these results, we have selected the AeroEclipse II nebulizer for the delivery of pDNA/GL67A formulations to the lungs of MONDO:0009061 9606 as part of phase IIa/b clinical studies. 
28358158		Direct monitoring of MONDO:0005275 treatment biomarkers using plasmonic gold nanorods with diffusion-sensitive OCT.The solid concentration of pulmonary mucus (wt%) is critical to respiratory health. In 9606 with MONDO:0005087, such as MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061) and MONDO:0005002 (MONDO:0005002), mucus hydration is impaired, resulting in high wt%. Mucus with high wt% is a hallmark of MONDO:0005275 that leads to obstructed airways, diseaseD007249, and diseaseD007239. Methods to measure mucus hydration in situ and in real-time are needed for drug development and personalized therapy. We employed plasmonic gold nanorod (GNR) biosensors that intermittently collide with macromolecules comprising the mucus mesh as they self-diffuse, such that GNR translational diffusion (DT) is sensitive to wt%. GNRs are attractive candidates for bioprobes due to their anisotropic optical scattering that makes them easily distinguishable from native tissue using polarization-sensitive OCT. Using principles of heterodyne dynamic light scattering, we developed diffusion-sensitive optical coherence tomography (DS-OCT) to spatially-resolve changing DT in real-time. DS-OCT enables, for the first time, direct monitoring of changes in nanoparticle diffusion rates that are sensitive to nanoporosity with spatial and temporal resolutions of 4.7 mum and 0.2 s. DS-OCT therefore enables us to measure spatially-resolved changes in mucus wt% over time. In this study, we demonstrate the applicability of DS-OCT on well-differentiated primary 9606 bronchial epithelial cells during a clinical mucus-hydrating therapy, hypertonic chemicalD012965 treatment (HST), to reveal, for the first time, mucus mixing, cellular secretions, and mucus hydration on the micrometer scale that translate to long-term therapeutic effects.

Administration of nanoparticles (NPs) with high antibiotic load capable of penetrating the tight mesh of biofilm/mucus can be an advent to overcome the treatment bottlenecks. Biodegradable and biocompatible chemicalD011108 nanoparticles efficiently loaded with ciprofloxacin complex offer a solution for emerging treatment strategies. NPs were prepared under controlled conditions by utilizing MicroJet Reactor (MJR) to yield a particle size of 190.4+-28.6nm with 0.089 PDI. Encapsulation efficiency of the drug was 79% resulting in a loading of 14%. Release was determined to be controlled and medium-independent in chemicalD007854, chemicalD007854+0.2% chemicalD011136 and simulated lung fluid. diseaseD064420 assays with 0609 cells and MONDO:0009061 bronchial epithelial cells (HL93-) indicated that complex-loaded chemicalD000077182 NPs were non-toxic at concentrations >> MICcipro against lab strains of the bacteria. Antibacterial activity tests revealed enhanced activity when applied as nanoparticles. NPs' colloidal stability in mucus was proven. Notably, a decrease in mucus turbidity was observed upon incubation with NPs. Herewith, ciprofloxacin complex-loaded chemicalD000077182 NPs are introduced as promising pulmonary nano drug delivery systems against MONDO:0005141 in MONDO:0009061 lung.
37422433		Nonsense mutations accelerate lung disease and decrease survival of cystic fibrosis children.RATIONALE: Limited information is available on the clinical status of people with Cystic Fibrosis (pwCF) carrying 2 nonsense mutations (PTC/PTC). The main objective of this study was to compare disease severity between pwCF PTC/PTC, compound heterozygous for variantrs113993960## and PTC (variantrs113993960##/PTC) and homozygous for variantrs113993960## (variantrs113993960##+/+). METHODS: Based on the European CF Society Patient Registry clinical data of pwCF living in high and middle income European and neighboring countries, PTC/PTC (n = 657) were compared with variantrs113993960##+/+ (n = 21,317) and variantrs113993960##/PTC(n = 4254).ncbi1080 mRNA and protein activity levels were assessed in primary human nasal epithelial (HNE) cells sampled from 22 PTC/PTC pwCF. MAIN RESULTS: As compared to variantrs113993960##+/+ pwCF; both PTC/PTC and variantrs113993960##/PTC pwCF exhibited a significantly faster rate of decline in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 s (FEV1) from 7 years (-1.33 for variantrs113993960## +/+, -1.59 for variantrs113993960##/PTC; -1.65 for PTC/PTC, p < 0.001) until respectively 30 years (-1.05 for variantrs113993960## +/+, -1.23 for PTC/PTC, p = 0.048) and 27 years (-1.12 for variantrs113993960## +/+, -1.26 for variantrs113993960##/PTC, p = 0.034). This resulted in lower FEV1 values in adulthood. Mortality of pediatric pwCF with one or two PTC alleles was significantly higher than their variantrs113993960## homozygous pairs. Infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa was more frequent in PTC/PTC versus variantrs113993960##+/+ and variantrs113993960##/PTC pwCF. ncbi1080 activity in PTC/PTC pwCF's HNE cells ranged between 0% to 3% of the wild-type level. CONCLUSIONS: Nonsense mutations decrease the survival and accelerate the course of respiratory disease in children and adolescents with Cystic Fibrosis.
30038933		An Adeno-Associated Viral Vector Capable of Penetrating the Mucus Barrier to Inhaled Gene Therapy.Diffusion of the viral vectors evaluated in inhaled gene therapy clinical trials to date are largely hindered within airway mucus, which limits their access to, and transduction of, the underlying airway epithelium prior to clearance from the lung. Here, we discovered that 272636AAV) serotype 6 was able to rapidly diffuse through mucus collected from MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061) 9606, unlike previously tested AAV serotypes. A point mutation of the 471 capsid suggests a potential mechanism by which 471 avoids adhesion to the mucus mesh. Significantly greater transgene expression was achieved with 471 compared to a mucoadhesive serotype, AAV1, in air-liquid interface cultures of 9606 MONDO:0009061 bronchial epithelium with naturally secreted mucus or induced mucus hypersecretion. In addition, 471 achieved superior distribution and overall level of transgene expression compared to AAV1 in the airways and whole lungs, respectively, of transgenic 10090 with diseaseD000402. Our findings motivate further evaluation and clinical development of AAV6 for inhaled gene therapy.
32655858	Association|chemicalD003505|chemicalD011437; Association|chemicalD009569|MONDO:0009061	chemicalD009569 diffusion through MONDO:0009061-relevant media and lung tissue.A simplified diffusion cell methodology was employed to measure the diffusion coefficient of chemicalD009569 (NO) through phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and artificial sputum medium (ASM)-an in vitro analog for airway mucus. Diffusion through the proteinaceous ASM yielded a significantly lower diffusion coefficient compared to PBS, which is attributed to both the physical obstruction by the ncbi100508689 mesh and reactive nature of NO radicals towards the biological compounds in ASM. To further confirm that ASM was restricting NO from diffusing freely, a macromolecular chemicalD011437-modified chemicalD003505 donor (CD-PA) was employed to release the NO more slowly. The NO diffusion characteristics in ASM via the NO donor were also slower relative to PBS. As NO is likely to interact with lung cells after passing through the mucus barrier, the diffusion of both NO and the CD-PA macromolecular NO donor through differentiated lung tissue was investigated with and without an ASM layer. Comparison of NO diffusion through the three diffusion barriers indicated that the lung tissue significantly impeded NO penetration over the course of the experiment compared to PBS and ASM. In fact, the diffusion of CD-PA through the lung tissue was hindered until after the release of its NO payload, potentially due to the increased net charge of the NO donor structure. Of importance, the viability of the tissue was not influenced by the NO-releasing CD-PA at bactericidal concentrations.
36309203		Quantifying the effectiveness of ultraviolet-C light at inactivating airborne 36809.BACKGROUND: 36809 (36809) group are environmental organisms that can cause diseaseD007239 in people with MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061) and other suppurative MONDO:0005275. There is potential for person-to-person airborne transmission of 36809 among people with MONDO:0009061 attending the same care centre. Ultraviolet light (band C, UV-C) is used for 1773 control indoors; however, no studies have assessed UV-C for airborne 36809. AIM: To determine whether a range of UV-C doses increased the inactivation of airborne 36809, compared with no-UVC conditions. METHODS: 36809 was generated by a vibrating mesh nebulizer located within a 400 L rotating drum sampler, and then exposed to an array of 265 nm UV-C light-emitting diodes (LED). A six-stage Andersen Cascade Impactor was used to collect aerosols. Standard microbiological protocols were used for enumerating 36809, and these quantified the effectiveness of UV-C doses (in triplicate). UV-C effectiveness was estimated using the difference between inactivation with and without UV-C. FINDINGS: Sixteen tests were performed, with UV-C doses ranging from 276 to 1104 muW s/cm2. Mean (+-SD) UV-C effectiveness ranged from 47.1% (+-13.4) to 83.6% (+-3.3). UV-C led to significantly greater inactivation of 36809 (all P-values <=0.045) than natural decay at all doses assessed. Using an indoor model of the hospital environment, it was estimated that UV-C doses in the range studied here could be safely delivered in clinical settings where 9606 and staff are present. CONCLUSION: This study provides empirical in-vitro evidence that nebulized 36809 are susceptible to UV-C inactivation.
30004000	Association|chemicalD006025|chemicalD010455; Association|chemicalD006025|chemicalD057846	PEGylated enhanced cell penetrating chemicalD010455 nanoparticles for lung gene therapy.The lung remains an attractive target for the gene therapy of MONDO:0000001 such as MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061). Despite over 27 clinical trials, there are still very few gene therapy vectors that have shown any improvement in lung function; highlighting the need to develop formulations with improved gene transfer potency and the desirable physiochemical characteristics for efficacious therapy. Herein, we introduce a novel cell penetrating chemicalD010455 (chemicalD057846)-based non-viral vector that utilises chemicalD006025 (chemicalD006025)-binding enhanced transduction (GET) for highly efficient gene transfer. GET peptides couple directly with DNA through electrostatic interactions to form nanoparticles (NPs). In order to adapt the GET chemicalD010455 for efficient in vivo delivery, we engineered PEGylated versions of the chemicalD010455 and employed a strategy to form DNA NPs with different densities of PEG coatings. We were able to identify candidate formulations (PEGylation rates >=40%) that shielded the positively charged surface of particles, maintained colloidal stability in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and retained gene transfer activity in 9606 bronchial epithelial cell lines and precision cut lung slices (PCLS) in vitro. Using multiple particle tracking (MPT) technology, we demonstrated that PEG-GET complexes were able to navigate the mucus mesh and diffuse rapidly through 9606 MONDO:0009061 sputum samples ex vivo. When tested in 10090 lung models in vivo, PEGylated particles demonstrated superior biodistribution, improved safety profiles and efficient gene transfer of a reporter luciferase plasmid compared to non-PEGylated complexes. Furthermore, gene expression was significantly enhanced in comparison to chemicalD011094 (chemicalD011094), a non-viral gene carrier that has been widely tested in pre-clinical settings. This work describes an innovative approach that combines novel GET peptides for enhanced transfection with a tuneable PEG coating for efficacious lung gene therapy.
21283985	Comparison|chemicalD008353|chemicalD012965	chemicalD008353 delivery by vibrating mesh nebulisation for enhancing mucociliary clearance.Mucociliary clearance is compromised by airway surface liquid HP:0001944 in MONDO:0005087 states such as MONDO:0009061. Rehydration by hyperosmolar agents such as nebulised chemicalD012965 and dry powder chemicalD008353 has demonstrated in vivo safety and efficacy for restoring mucociliary function. chemicalD008353, delivered as a nebulised formulation for this purpose, has not been investigated as yet. The current study examines the feasibility of delivering such a formulation using recent vibrating mesh technology. Nebulisation was conducted using an Aeroneb Go(TM) vibrating mesh nebuliser, and aerosol size was assessed by laser diffraction. Cascade impaction coupled with mass assay by high-performance liquid chromatography was used to confirm fluid uniformity and correlation with laser diffraction sizing. The following nebuliser formulations were prepared and aerosolised: deionised chemicalD014867, chemicalD008353 (150 mg/mL) aqueous solution, chemicalD012965 aqueous solution [0.2%, 1%, 3%, 5%, 7% (w/v)] and chemicalD008353 (150 mg/mL) in chemicalD012965 solution [0.2%, 1%, 3%, 7% (w/v)]. chemicalD008353 aqueous solution was poorly nebulised, resulting in lengthy treatment times and large median droplet size. Addition of chemicalD012965 drastically improved nebuliser performance and aerosol characteristics. In vivo studies are necessary to confirm efficacy of nebulised chemicalD008353. If substantiated, it could provide a pleasant-tasting alternative mucoactive agent with prolonged therapeutic action.
23234801		"Psychological impact of working with 9606 with MONDO:0009061 at end-of-life, pre-transplant stage.OBJECTIVE: Multidisciplinary staff who work with end-of-life, pre-transplant 9606 with MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061) have to juggle two seemingly opposing care approaches; active care to maintain their 9606' health and condition in anticipation of a transplant, and sensitive palliative care that takes their end-of-life wishes into consideration should they not receive a transplant. Little is known about the psychological impact on staff working within this care dichotomy. The aim of this study is to explore staff's experiences and understand more about the psychological impact of this work on them professionally and personally, and how this affects their ability to provide appropriate care for their 9606. METHOD: A qualitative explorative research design was used. Ten semistructured interviews with multidisciplinary staff working in MONDO:0009061 centers and units across the United Kingdom were analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). RESULTS: Two superordinate themes emerged from the analysis: factors contributing to the ""juggle"" of active and palliative care, and extent of emotional impact on staff. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: The study indicates that there is an emotional impact on staff working with 9606 with MONDO:0009061 at end-of-life, pre-transplant stages. Specifically, it reveals the extent of the unpredictability that staff work with, and the range of emotions that staff experience, including uncertainty about professional identity and MONDO:0011918 about working practices. The depth and intimacy of professional-9606 relationships is highlighted, particularly for staff in close contact with and similar in age to their 9606. Additionally, the strength of staff's commitment and desire to care for 9606 within broader humanistic terms that mesh with their own personal values is brought to light. Despite the difficulties with their work, the majority of staff adopted numerous coping strategies to manage their emotions, many of which emphasized the link between their professional and personal values in undertaking their roles."
37159780		A Systematic Review of MONDO:0009061 in Children: Can Non-Medical Therapy Options Lead to a Better Mental Health Outcome?MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061) is a chronic disorder that begins at an early age, so it is crucial to be aware of the physical and emotional burden placed on individuals suffering from it and their families. It significantly impacts an individual's life; therefore, it is essential to acknowledge the effects of the disease on physical and mental health. Our systematic review aims to highlight the areas of life affected by MONDO:0009061 and evaluate various non-medical treatment options that may support the mental health of MONDO:0009061 9606. We selected PubMed, Google Scholar, and MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online) as our databases. We initially found 146,095 articles and narrowed the number of articles down using filters, exclusion and inclusion criteria, and various combinations of Medical Subheadings (MeSH) and key terms. We decided to use a final count of nine articles for our systematic review. The studies we included highlighted the negative impact of MONDO:0009061 on mental health, like MONDO:0005379 and MONDO:0011918, as well as on sleep, physical health, and overall quality of life. Several non-medical interventions, such as logotherapy, psychological interventions, complementary and alternative medicine, and many more, have been shown to enhance the mental health of many participants. Studies suggested that such therapy options may greatly benefit individuals with MONDO:0009061 and their current treatment plan. This review indicates that non-medical therapy options can enhance the mental health of individuals suffering from MONDO:0009061 and that it is crucial to bring more attention to preventing and treating mental health issues in MONDO:0009061 9606. However, as current data is limited, more research with a larger number of participants over an extended period of time is necessary to better evaluate the efficacy of non-medical interventions on mental health.

METHODS: A randomized, open-label, crossover study was performed. In 2 separate study visits, blood samples from 22 children were collected following TIS nebulization with I-neb (75 mg) and PARI-LC Plus (300 mg). Study visits were separated by 1 month, in which 1 of the study nebulizers was used twice daily. chemicalD014031 PK for both nebulizers was established using measured chemicalD014031 concentrations and Bayesian PK modelling software. Hearing and renal function tests were performed to test for chemicalD000617 associated diseaseD064420. In addition to standard estimated glomerular filtration rate values, biomarkers for MONDO:0004970 (ncbi26762 and ncbi51594) were measured. 9606 and nebulizer satisfaction were assessed. RESULTS: Inhalations were well tolerated and serum trough concentrations below the predefined toxic limit were reached with no significant differences in PK parameters between nebulizers. Results of audiometry and estimated glomerular filtration rate revealed no abnormalities. However, increased urinary ncbi51594/chemicalD003404 ratios at visit 2 for both nebulizers suggest TIS-induced subclinical MONDO:0002492. Nebulization time was 50% shorter and 9606 satisfaction was significantly higher with the diseaseD006969. CONCLUSIONS: Nebulization of 75 mg TIS with the I-neb in children with MONDO:0009061 resulted in comparable systemic exposure to 300 mg TIS with the PARI-LC Plus and was well tolerated and preferred over the PARI-LC Plus. Long-term safety of TIS nebulization should be monitored clinically, especially regarding the effects on MONDO:0002492.

The aim of chemicalD014031 inhalation therapy in MONDO:0009061 9606 with diseaseD000088562 is to deliver high amounts of drug directly to the site of diseaseD007239. chemicalD014031( ) is a chemicalD014031 nebulizer solution (300 mg/5 ml) approved by FDA for maintenance therapy for 9606 with MONDO:0009061. The 20% chemicalD014031 solution was reported as the optimal and maximal concentration. METHODS: Nebulization of high strength chemicalD014031 solution (20% chemicalD014031) (HSTS) has been assessed in this study by using different selected high performance nebulizer delivery systems: two different designs of jet nebulizers, and three new nebulizers based on vibrating mesh technology. The aerosol particle size distribution and output characteristics were measured for in vitro performance assessment of the nebulizer systems. The methodology was adapted from the current European standard, EN 13544-1:2001E. RESULTS: The particle size distribution characteristic measurements showed that all tested nebulizers may be suitable for inhalation of HSTS. The mean (SD) of highest percentage of fine particles (<5 mum) was 77.64 (2.3) % for Sidestream( ), at flow rate 16 L/min. The highest respirable inhaled mass was for Pari LC Plus( ) combined with PariBoyN( ) compressor, with mean (SD) 90.85 (8.6) mg. The mean (SD) of highest drug wastage percentage was 63.9 (3.9) % for Sidestream( ) jet nebulizer combined with compressed air cylinder at flow rate 16 L/min, while the lowest was 2.3 (0.26) % for NE-U22 Omron( ) (high frequency). CONCLUSIONS: The HSTS can be nebulized by all tested nebulisers but the high frequency NE-U22 Omron( ) and Aeroneb Go( ) are more efficient. When the HSTS compared to chemicalD014031( ), the respirable inhaled dose was increased to more than 73%.
21438171	Association|chemicalD014031|chemicalD016284; Negative_Correlation|chemicalD014031|MONDO:0009061	Higher chemicalD014031 concentration and vibrating mesh technology can shorten antibiotic treatment time in MONDO:0009061.Poor adherence to recommended therapy in MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061) is often because of the time demands of therapy. chemicalD014031 (chemicalD014031 , 300 mg at 60 mg/ml) inhaled from the PARI LC PLUS  nebulizer requires about 20 min. This study determined if equivalent levels of pulmonary deposition could be achieved in shorter time using 1.5 ml of 100 mg/ml chemicalD014031 solution delivered by an investigational eFlow  nebulizer. Sixteen males with stable MONDO:0009061, 8 children and 8 adults, and an FEV(1)  > 45% predicted inhaled both preparations on two occasions with (99m) chemicalD016284 added to the chemicalD014031. Blood samples were taken for quantification of chemicalD014031 in the serum. The PARI LC PLUS  delivered 45.4 (39.3-51.6), mean and 95% CI, mg to the lungs in 17.0 +- 2.5 min (mean +- SD) with serum levels of 1,089 +- 388 microg/L. The investigational eFlow  delivered 46.3(40.3-51.7) mg in 4.0 +- 1.0 min with blood levels of 909 +- 458 microg/L. Only the time of delivery was significantly different with P < 0.0001 (paired t-test). Tolerability of the treatment was comparable for both inhalation regimes, but the shorter treatment was preferred by all 9606. These results demonstrate the possibility of delivering equivalent levels of chemicalD014031 much faster into the lungs of MONDO:0009061 9606 when using eFlow , a very efficient electronic nebulizer.
35002357		"diseaseD009165 in Infants: A Systematic Review.Limited information and literature exist examining MONDO:0024355 caused by nontuberculous mycobacterial specifically in an infant population. The objective of our study was to summarize clinical characteristics and outcomes of infant 9606 with diseaseD009165 via systematic literature review to identify common diagnostic and treatment regimens for this diseaseD007239 in infants. A search of MEDLINE and PubMed databases in October 2019 using MeSH search terms ""infant,"" ""NTM,"" ""pulmonary,"" and ""36809"" yielded 139 articles. Inclusion criteria were i) English-language studies including cases and case series with ii) established diseaseD009165 in iii) a 9606 population of infants no older than 24 months. 9606 with MONDO:0009061 and any study which did not contain relevant information such as diseaseD007239 and age were excluded. This yielded data on 37 9606 extracted from 28 studies analyzed. The most common strain was 37162, isolated in 56.8% of 9606 diagnoses. Bronchoscopy/thoracoscopy with a subsequent culture were the most common diagnostic techniques, utilized in 64.9% of cases. Drug therapeutic treatment was utilized in 86% of cases, with a median of three drugs administered. Notable limitations of this study are the small sample size and its retrospective nature, which relies on information reported in previous case studies. Although there is limited formal clinician consensus on the treatment of MONDO:0024355 and how it may differ in an infant population, our findings indicate an informal consensus typically involving diagnostic lung specimen culture and antibiotic therapy."
37909943		[Pediatric pulmonary rehabilitation in the light of qualitative research: What statistic cannot show].Several studies have supported the positive effect of MONDO:0021113 rehabilitation (RR) in children and adolescents (CRA) with chronic MONDO:0005087 (MONDO:0005087); however, qualitative aspects related to the experiences and perceptions about RR have been scarcely studied. OBJECTIVE: to analyze the qualitative evidence regarding the perceptions and experiences of patients, families and professionals related to the RR of children and adolescents with MONDO:0006946. METHODS: Review of qualitative studies in 5 databases. We used MeSH terms and free English-language terms grouped into three dimensions: patients, intervention, and research design. The study subjects had to be patients, their families, teachers or treating health teams. No restrictions were placed on language or year of publication. The search strategy was configured as follows: ((MONDO:0009061) OR (MONDO:0004979) OR (MONDO:0019056)) AND ((MONDO:0021113 rehabilitation) OR (Exercise)) AND ((Qualitative research) OR (Phenomenology) OR (Grounded theory) OR (Ethnography)). Two independent authors analyzed atingent titles, abstracts and long texts. Finally, a qualitative description of the results was made. RESULTS: Twenty-one qualitative studies were selected, all on patients, family members, teachers or professionals treating patients with MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061), MONDO:0004979 or MONDO:0019056 (MONDO:0019056). Perception of benefits, parental influence, enjoyment of the protocols, and time required to engage in physical activity were categories identified in all three groups. Aspects such as perceived safety on school grounds and parental stress were specific categories, highlighted in the context of MONDO:0004979 and MONDO:0009061 respectively. CONCLUSION: Several general and specific factors of a qualitative nature influence the experience of children with MONDO:0005087 during RR. Future studies conducted in our cultural context should be conducted to confirm these results.

In 9606 with MONDO:0005087, such as MONDO:0005002 (MONDO:0005002), MONDO:0009061 (MONDO:0009061), non-MONDO:0009061 MONDO:0004822, and MONDO:0004979, an increase in crosslinking and physical entanglement of ncbi100508689 polymers as well as mucus dehydration often alters and typically reduces mucus mesh network pore size, which reduces neutrophil migration, decreases pathogen capture, sustains MONDO:0005113, and accelerates lung function decline. Conventional aerosol particles containing hydrophobic drugs are rapidly captured and removed by MCC. Therefore, it is critical to design aerosol delivery systems with the appropriate size and surface chemistry that can improve drug retention and absorption with the goal of increased efficacy. Biodegradable muco-adhesive particles (MAPs) and muco-penetrating particles (MPPs) have been engineered to achieve effective pulmonary delivery and extend drug residence time in the lungs. MAPs can be used to target mucus as they get trapped in airway mucus by steric obstruction and/or adhesion. MPPs avoid muco-adhesion and are designed to have a particle size smaller than the mucus network, enhancing lung retention of particles as well as transport to the respiratory epithelial layer and drug absorption. In this review, we aim to provide insight into the composition of airway mucus, rheological characteristics of airway mucus in healthy and diseased subjects, the most recent techniques to study the flow dynamics and particle diffusion in airway mucus (in particular, multiple particle tracking, MPT), and the advancements in engineering MPPs that have contributed to improved airway mucus penetration, lung distribution, and retention.
20373910	Positive_Correlation|MONDO:0003147|ncbi5265; Negative_Correlation|MONDO:0009061|ncbi5265	The I-neb Adaptive Aerosol Delivery System enhances delivery of ncbi5265 with controlled inhalation.BACKGROUND: Inhaled ncbi5265 (ncbi5265) is being developed for treatment of MONDO:0009061 to protect the lungs from excessive free elastase. High drug costs mandate a very efficient aerosol system to deliver a high payload to the airways. The I-neb Adaptive Aerosol Delivery (AAD) System is a portable, electronic, vibrating mesh nebulizer that delivers aerosol only during inhalation. It can be operated in conventional tidal breathing mode (TBM) or in target inhalation mode (TIM) that guides the 9606 to inhale deeply and slowly. The purposes of this in vitro study were to determine aerosol characteristics, device efficiency, and delivery time of ncbi5265 using the MONDO:0003147 System with TBM and TIM. METHODS: We studied the MONDO:0003147 System in TBM and TIM (inspiratory time 6 or 9 sec) using a breath simulator. The loaded dose was 0.5 mL ncbi5265 (50 mg/mL). Nebulized drug captured on an inspiratory filter was reported as emitted dose. Particle size was measured by laser diffraction. Predicted lung doses were calculated based on the results of a prior scintigraphy study of the MONDO:0003147 System. RESULTS: Particle size (VMD) for TBM and TIM was similar (4.4-4.8 microm). The emitted doses were very high and similar between modes (82-90% of loaded dose). Predicted lung dose of ncbi5265 (percent of loaded dose) and delivery times were: TBM 56.6% in 7.5 min; TIM-6 59.9% in 4.4 min; and TIM-9 64.5% in 2.5 min. CONCLUSIONS: The MONDO:0003147 System enhanced ncbi5265 delivery by inhalation-only aerosol generation and a low-residual dose. Predicted lung dose was high for both TBM and TIM, but longer inspiratory times with TIM reduced the administration time to one-third that of tidal breathing. We conclude that slow, deep, controlled inspirations using the MONDO:0003147 System is an efficient method to deliver ncbi5265.

Without properly functioning ncbi1080 channels, chemicalD002712 does not exit respiratory epithelial cells, and consequently the mucus lining the surface of the cells becomes thick. This viscous mucus accumulates and causes abnormal function of the mucociliary apparatus, which can lead to MONDO:0005113 colonization, diseaseD007239 with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), and eventually MONDO:0005275. Recent studies have shown that the increased susceptibility to MONDO:0024355 in MONDO:0009061 patients may also be due to defects in neutrophil function, but the exact mechanism is uncertain. Methods: The PubMed database was searched on February 10, 2023 and again on July 23, 2023 to compile a comprehensive list of clinical and experimental studies to evaluate neutrophil function in MONDO:0009061. The first search included a combination of MeSH terms: ""MONDO:0009061"" and ""neutrophils/physiology"". A separate second search included a combination of the MeSH terms: ""neutrophils"" and ""ncbi1080"". Key Content and Findings: Neutrophils from patients with MONDO:0009061 have decreased transfer of chemicalD002712 into phagolysosomes after MONDO:0005113 ingestion and have dysregulated degranulation. This reduces the production of toxic oxidative radicals, especially chemicalD006997 (chemicalD006997), and reduces bactericidal activity. ncbi1080 potentiators correct the dysregulated degranulation in patients with MONDO:0009061 and increased neutrophil killing activity. A reduced concentration of chemicalD002712 in in vitro assays also reduces neutrophil killing activity; these observations are relevant to the reduced chemicalD002712 concentrations in respiratory secretions in patients with MONDO:0009061. Conclusions: This literature review summarizes studies that demonstrate that an important defect in MONDO:0009061 neutrophils lies in the chemicalD010100-dependent pathway in phagolysosomes and studies with chemicalC545203 demonstrate that this drug corrects MONDO:0009061 neutrophil function. These studies demonstrate the potential utility of using easily available neutrophils to study drug effects in MONDO:0009061 patients."
23617606		Ex vivo characterization of particle transport in mucus secretions coating freshly excised mucosal tissues.Sustained drug delivery to mucosal surfaces has the potential to improve the effectiveness of prophylactic and therapeutic treatments for numerous diseases and conditions, including MONDO:0005265, MONDO:0021681, MONDO:0009061, MONDO:0005041, MONDO:0006733, and various MONDO:0005070. Sustained delivery systems such as nanoparticles can be useful for mucosal delivery, but recent work suggests they must penetrate the rapidly cleared mucus barrier that overlies all mucosal epithelia to achieve uniform distribution on epithelial surfaces and enhanced residence time. Thus, it is important to evaluate the mucus-penetrating ability of nanosized delivery systems in preclinical animal studies, and for administration to 9606. We describe a simple ex vivo method to visualize and quantify nanoparticle transport in mucus on fresh mucosal tissues. Using this method in 10090 models, we observed variations in the mucus mesh at different anatomical locations, as well as cyclical variations that may have implications for mucosal delivery.
22988559		"Mucus penetrating nanoparticles: biophysical tool and method of drug and gene delivery.A method that could provide more uniform and longer-lasting drug and gene delivery to mucosal surfaces holds the potential to greatly improve the effectiveness of prophylactic and therapeutic approaches for numerous diseases and conditions, including MONDO:0021681, MONDO:0009061, chronic diseaseD000092562, MONDO:0005265, and MONDO:0005041 to name a few. However, the body's natural defenses, including adhesive, rapidly cleared mucus linings coating nearly all entry points to the body not covered by skin, has limited the effectiveness of drug and gene delivery by nanoscale delivery systems. This article discusses the recent development of the ""mucuspenetrating particle"" or ""MPP"" nanotechnology, and how it has been used to both enhance understanding of the nanoscale barrier properties of 9606 mucus secretions, and to achieve more uniform and longer-lasting drug delivery to mucosal tissues following topical administration. Drug loaded MPPs possess non-adhesive coatings that allow them to rapidly penetrate mucus layers through openings in the mucus mesh at rates nearly as fast as they would penetrate pure chemicalD014867. Critically, MPPs allow enhanced drug and gene delivery to mucosal tissues without diminishing the protective function of mucus. Recent progress in the development of MPPs as a biophysical tool to probe the length-scale dependent rheological properties of mucosal secretions and as a method for drug and gene delivery is highlighted."
32992472		Nebulizer Care and Inhalation Technique in Children with MONDO:0009061.Nebulizers are used by the great majority of MONDO:0009061 9606 for delivery of cornerstone treatments. Inhalation technique and adequate disinfection and maintenance are important for optimizing medication delivery. In this study, inhalation technique and nebulizer disinfection/maintenance were assessed in MONDO:0009061 9606 by direct observation in clinic and completion of a scoring sheet. A total of 108 9606 were recruited. The maximum inhalation technique score was attained by 30.5% and adequate inhalation technique score by 74.08% of 9606. The inhalation technique score was best with the vibrating mesh nebulizer (p = 0.038), while 9606 age and number of nebulized medications did not affect ITS significantly (p > 0.05). Nebulizer disinfection/maintenance score was excellent in only 31.48%. Most families kept the nebulizer clean and used appropriate disinfection method, but only half of them replaced the nebulizer and nebulizer cup at the recommended time intervals. Nebulizer disinfection/maintenance score was positively affected by a number of nebulized medications and negatively by years of equipment use (p = 0.009 and p = 0.001, respectively). Even though inhalation technique and disinfection/maintenance practices were found to be adequate in a large proportion of cases, there is still a need for regular review and education. The type of nebulizer was associated with improved inhalation technique, but more data are required before making specific recommendations.

METHODS: A systematic review of 1,435 studies was performed in adults receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. Two different administration strategies (adjunctive and substitute) were considered clinically relevant. Inclusion was restricted to studies using jet, ultrasonic, and vibrating-mesh nebulizers. Studies involving children, colonized-but-not-diseaseD007239 adults, and MONDO:0009061 9606 were excluded. RESULTS: Five of the 11 studies included had a small sample size (fewer than 50 9606), and only 6 were randomized. Diversity of case-mix, dosage, and devices are sources of bias. Only a few 9606 had severe HP:0012418. chemicalD000617 and colistin were the most common antibiotics, being safe regarding nephrotoxicity and MONDO:0005527, but increased MONDO:0005087 in 9% (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.18; I = 52%), particularly when administered to MONDO:0021113 9606. For tracheobronchitis, a significant decrease in emergence of resistance was evidenced (risk ratio, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.64; I = 0%). Similar findings were observed in MONDO:0005249 by susceptible pathogens, without improvement in mortality or ventilation duration. In MONDO:0005249 caused by resistant pathogens, higher clinical resolution (odds ratio, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.30 to 2.96; I = 0%) was evidenced. These findings were not consistently evidenced in the assessment of efficacy against MONDO:0005249 caused by susceptible pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Performance of randomized trials evaluating the impact of nebulized antibiotics with more homogeneous populations, standardized drug delivery, predetermined clinical efficacy, and safety outcomes is urgently required. diseaseD007239 by resistant pathogens might potentially have higher benefit from nebulized antiinfective agents. Nebulization, without concomitant systemic administration of the drug, may reduce nephrotoxicity but may also be associated with higher risk of MONDO:0005087.

Textbooks and reviews only marginally address the homeostasis of chemicalD008274 in MONDO:0009061. METHODS: We performed a search of the Medical Subject Headings terms (MONDO:0009061 OR MONDO:0009061) AND (MONDO:0006844 OR hypomagnes[a]emia) in the US National Library of Medicine and Excerpta Medica databases. RESULTS: We identified 25 reports dealing with chemicalD008274 and MONDO:0009061. The results of the review may be summarized as follows. First, disease613882 affects more than half of the MONDO:0009061 9606 with advanced disease; second, magnesemia, which is normally age-independent, relevantly decreases with age in MONDO:0009061; third, chemicalD000617 antimicrobials frequently induce both acute and chronic diseaseC537152; fourth, sweat chemicalD008274 concentration was normal in MONDO:0009061 9606; fifth, limited data suggest the existence of an impaired intestinal chemicalD008274 balance. Finally, stimulating observations suggest that chemicalD008274 supplements might achieve an improvement in respiratory muscle strength and mucolytic activity of both recombinant and endogenous deoxyribonuclease. CONCLUSIONS: The first comprehensive review of the literature confirms that, despite being one of the most prevalent minerals in the body, the importance of chemicalD008274 in MONDO:0009061 is largely overlooked. In these 9606, disease613882 should be sought once a year. Furthermore, the potential of supplementation with this cation deserves more attention.

The stiff mucus in these 9606 represents a compartment, which cannot easily be reached by systemic treatment. While MONDO:0005113 are now successfully treated with repeated inhalation of antibiotics such as chemicalD014031, 57% of MONDO:0009061 9606 are colonized by Aspergillus species. About 10-20% of colonized 9606 develop symptoms of MONDO:0015243 (MONDO:0015243). While current standard of treatment of MONDO:0015243 in MONDO:0009061 9606 is to suppress the MONDO:0000775 related symptoms by administration of glucocorticoids, chemicalD017964 (chemicalD017964), administered orally at high doses, can alleviate the symptoms of MONDO:0015243. However, no inhalable formulation of chemicalD017964 is available to enable local treatment of MONDO:0005657. The aim of this study was to describe an aqueous nanosuspension of chemicalD017964 and to characterize the pharmacokinetics after single dose inhalation. Using wet-milling with organic milling beads, a stable nanosuspension with particle size in the range of 200nm and an chemicalD017964 concentration of 20% (v/w) could be obtained, using chemicalD011136 at a concentration of 14% relative to chemicalD017964. The suspension was stable if stored at 8 C for 3 months without particle growth and could be nebulized using standard nebulizer technologies including mesh technology and pressured air nebulizers. A 10% suspension was well tolerated upon repeated dose inhalation once daily for 7 days at a predicted dose of 45mg/kg in 10116. A single dose inhalation at a predicted dose of 22.5mg/kg resulted in maximum lung tissue concentration of 21.4mug/g tissue with a terminal half-life of 25.4h. Serum concentrations were lower, with a maximum concentration of 104ng/ml at 4h after dosing and a terminal half-life of 10.5h. The data indicate that chemicalD017964 nanosuspension represents an interesting formulation for inhaled administration in MONDO:0009061 9606 suffering from MONDO:0015243. High and long lasting lung tissue concentrations well above the minimal inhibitory concentration of Aspergillus species enable once daily administration with minimal systemic exposure.
