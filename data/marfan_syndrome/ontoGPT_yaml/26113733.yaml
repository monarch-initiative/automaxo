input_text: 'Non-aneurysmal abdominal aortic rupture in a patient with Marfan syndrome.
  Aortic rupture in the presence of aneurysmal disease is well understood and extensively
  described in the literature. However, aortic rupture in a non-aneurysmal aorta is
  far less common. In the few reported cases, perforations are believed to result
  from a penetrating atheromatous ulcer of the aorta. We describe a rare case of non-aneurysmal
  aortic rupture in a 68-year-old man with Marfan syndrome and a history of proximal
  aortic surgery. The urgent need for hemorrhage control precluded any consideration
  of an endovascular repair. '
