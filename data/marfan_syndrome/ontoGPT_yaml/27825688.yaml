input_text: 'Aortic Dissection in Pregnancy: Management Strategy and Outcomes. BACKGROUND:
  Aortic dissection in pregnancy is a rare but lethal catastrophe. Clinical experiences
  are limited. We report our experience in 25 patients focusing on etiology, management
  strategies, and outcomes. METHODS: Between June 1998 and February 2015, we treated
  25 pregnant women (mean age, 31.6 +- 4.7 years) in whom aortic dissection developed
  at a mean of 28 +- 10 gestational weeks (GWs). Type A aortic dissection (TAAD) was
  present in 20 (80%) and type B (TBAD) in 5 (20%). Marfan syndrome was seen in 17
  (68%). Management strategy was based on dissection type and GWs. RESULTS: TAADs
  were managed surgically in 19 (95.0%) and medically in 1 (5.0%). Maternal and fetal
  mortalities were, respectively, 14.3% (1 of 7) and 0 (0 of 7) in the "delivery first"
  group (7 of 20), 16.7% (1 of 6) and 33.3% (2 of 6) in "single-stage delivery and
  aortic repair" group (6 of 20), 16.7% (1 of 6) and 66.7% (4 of 6) in "aortic repair
  first" group (6 of 20), and 100% (1 of 1) and 100% (1 of 1) in the "medical management"
  group (1 of 20). TBADs were managed surgically in 60% (3 of 5) and endovascularly
  and medically in 20% each (1 of 5). No maternal deaths occurred. Fetal mortality
  was 100% in the surgical group and 0% in the other groups. During late follow-up,
  which was complete in 95.2% (20 of 21), 3 maternal and 2 fetal deaths occurred in
  the TAAD group. Overall maternal survival was 68.6% at 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Marfan
  syndrome predominates among women with aortic dissection in pregnancy. For TAADs,
  after 28 GWs, delivery followed by surgical repair can achieve maternal and fetal
  survival adequately; before 28 GWs, maternal survival should be prioritized given
  the high risk of fetal death. For TBADs in pregnancy, nonsurgical management is
  preferred.'
