input_text: Meta-analysis Examining the Usefulness of Angiotensin Receptor blockers
  for the Prevention of Aortic Root Dilation in Patients With the Marfan Syndrome.
  The Marfan syndrome (MFS) patients are highly predisposed to thoracic aortic aneurysm
  and/or dissection, with virtually every patient having evidence of aortic disease
  at some point during their lifetime. We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate
  the efficacy of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in slowing down the progression
  of aortic dilatation in MFS patients. PUBMED, EMBASE, and COCHRANE databases were
  searched for relevant articles published from inception to February 1, 2020. We
  included randomized clinical trials evaluating the effect of ARBs on aortic root
  size in patients with MFS with a follow-up period of at least 2.5 years. Seven studies
  were included with a total of 1,510 patients. Our analysis demonstrated a significantly
  smaller change in aortic root and ascending aorta dilation in the ARBs treated group
  when compared with placebo (mean difference 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.31
  to -0.04; p = 0.04, I2 = 94%, and mean difference -0.13, 95% CI -0.17 to -0.09;
  p < 0.00001, I2 = 0%, respectively). ARBs as an add-on therapy to beta-blockers
  resulted in a significantly smaller change in aortic root dilation when compared
  with the arm without ARBs (mean difference -2.06, 95% CI -2.54 to -1.58; p < 0.00001,
  I2 = 91%). However, there was no statistically significant difference in the number
  of clinical events (aortic complications/surgery) observed in the ARBs arm when
  compared with placebo (Risk ratio of 1.01, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.38; p = 0.94, I2 = 0%).
  In conclusion, ARBs therapy is associated with a slower progression of aortic root
  dilation when compared with placebo and as an addition to beta-blocker therapy.
