input_text: 'AAV-mediated AP-1 decoy oligonucleotide expression inhibits aortic elastolysis
  in a mouse model of Marfan syndrome. AIMS: Marfan syndrome is one of the most common
  inherited disorders of connective tissue caused by fibrillin-1 mutations, characterized
  by enhanced transcription factor AP-1 DNA binding activity and subsequently abnormally
  increased expression and activity of matrix-metalloproteinases (MMPs). We aimed
  to establish a novel adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based strategy for long-term expression
  of an AP-1 neutralizing RNA hairpin (hp) decoy oligonucleotide (dON) in the aorta
  to prevent aortic elastolysis in a murine model of Marfan syndrome. METHODS AND
  RESULTS: Using fibrillin-1 hypomorphic mice (mgR/mgR), aortic grafts from young
  (9 weeks old) donor mgR/mgR mice were transduced ex vivo with AAV vectors and implanted
  as infrarenal aortic interposition grafts in mgR/mgR mice. Grafts were explanted
  after 30 days. For in vitro studies, isolated primary aortic smooth muscle cells
  (SMCs) from mgR/mgR mice were used. Elastica-van-Giesson staining visualized elastolysis,
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was assessed using dihydroethidine staining.
  RNA F.I.S.H. verified AP-1 hp dON generation in the ex vivo transduced aortic tissue.
  MMP expression and activity were assessed by western blotting and immunoprecipitation
  combined with zymography.Transduction resulted in stable therapeutic dON expression
  in endothelial and SMCs. MMP expression and activity, ROS formation as well as expression
  of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 were significantly reduced. Monocyte graft
  infiltration declined and the integrity of the elastin architecture was maintained.
  RNAseq analysis confirmed the beneficial effect of AP-1 neutralization on the pro-inflammatory
  environment in SMCs. CONCLUSION: This novel approach protects from deterioration
  of aortic stability by sustained delivery of nucleic acids-based therapeutics and
  further elucidated how to interfere with the mechanism of elastolysis.'
