input_text: '[Safe and Effective Analgesia with Bilateral Continuous TAP Block for
  a Patient with Marfan Syndrome after Open Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair]. A patient
  with Marfan syndrome underwent emergency open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.
  She was referred to our department for postoperative analgesia. Taking the risk
  of possible dural ectasia into consideration, we avoided epidural block. Alternatively,
  we performed bilateral continuous transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block with sufficient
  analgesia. Lumbosacral dural ectasia is frequently observed in patients with Marfan
  syndrome. A few reports described that their fragile dura may contribute to an increased
  risk of dural puncture and postdural puncture headache (PDPH). Thus, in planning
  neuraxial block for a patient with Marfan syndrome, the possible consequences of
  lumbosacral dural ectasia should be considered. A case we herein present shows bilateral
  continuous TAP block could be a safe and effective alternative to epidural block.'
