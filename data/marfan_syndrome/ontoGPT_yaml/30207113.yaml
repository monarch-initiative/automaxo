input_text: "Long-Term Results after Modified Bentall Operation in 200 Patients. BACKGROUND:
  Composite graft replacement of the aortic root is the treatment of choice for an
  array of aortic root pathologies, such as annuloaortic ectasia, Marfan syndrome
  and acute or chronic aortic dissection type A. In this retrospective study of the
  authors' aortic surgery database, an exploration was made of factors related to
  early and long-term morbidity and mortality of patients who underwent this procedure.
  METHODS: Between 2000 and 2009, a total of 200 consecutive patients (male:female
  ratio 4:1; mean age 56.2 +- 11.66 years) underwent the modified Bentall operation
  at the authors' institution, with a composite graft (mechanical valve) being used
  to correct aortic root pathology. All preoperative, perioperative and postoperative
  data, as well as long-term follow up data, were retrieved from the authors' aortic
  surgery database. RESULTS: Preoperative characteristics of the patients included
  elective and emergency operations (83.1% and 15.9%, respectively). Intraoperative
  and 30-day mortalities were 2% and 3.5%, respectively, while the rate of postoperative
  cerebrovascular events was 1.5%. Long-term survival at a mean follow up of 110 months
  for the elective and emergency groups was 88.6% and 71.9%, respectively (p = 0.007).
  Moreover, during the same period new cerebrovascular events were observed in 5.8%
  of cases. Predictive factors for late survival were type of surgery (elective versus
  emergency; p = 0.023), conduit size (<=23 mm versus >23 mm; p = 0.053) , age >65
  years (p = 0.001), intensive care unit stay (days; p <0.001) and postoperative creatinine
  level (p = 0.002). Survival rates at one, three, five and 10 years postoperatively
  were 93.5%, 92.5%, 91.5% and 85.9%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who underwent
  the modified Bentall operation presented with minimal major adverse effects and
  demonstrated a good long-term survival."
