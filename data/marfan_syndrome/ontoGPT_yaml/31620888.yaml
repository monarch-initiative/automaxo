input_text: "Marfan syndrome in adolescence: adolescents' perspectives on (physical)
  functioning, disability, contextual factors and support needs. Although essential
  for providing optimal adolescent patient support, knowledge of the impact of Marfan
  syndrome in adolescence is limited. To explore adolescents' perceived impact of
  Marfan syndrome on (physical) functioning (activities, participation), disability
  (limitations, restrictions), contextual factors and support needs, we interviewed
  19 adolescents with Marfan syndrome. Audio-recordings were transcribed, coded and
  analysed using thematic analysis. Identified themes were \"difficulties in keeping
  up with peers\" and \"being and feeling different from peers\". Furthermore, an
  adolescent Marfan syndrome-specific International Classification of Functioning,
  Disability and Health for Children and Youth (ICF-CY) model derived from the data
  describing the adolescent perceived impact of Marfan syndrome on functioning, disability
  and its contextual factors. Adolescents perceived problems in keeping up with peers
  in school, sports, leisure and friendships/relationships, and they could not meet
  work requirements. Moreover, participants perceived to differ from peers due to
  their appearance and disability. Contextual factors: coping with Marfan syndrome,
  self-esteem/image, knowledge about Marfan syndrome, support from family/friends/teachers,
  ability to express needs and peer-group acceptation acted individually as barrier
  or facilitator for identified themes.Conclusion: Adolescents with Marfan syndrome
  perceived limitations and restrictions in (physical) functioning. They perceived
  problems in keeping up with peers and perceived to differ from peers due to their
  appearance and disability. This warrants awareness and tailored physical, psychosocial,
  educational and environmental support programmes to improve (physical) functioning
  and empowerment of adolescents with Marfan syndrome.What is known:  Marfan syndrome
  is a hereditary connective tissue disorder.  Marfan syndrome affects multiple systems.What
  is new:  Adolescents with Marfan syndrome perceive (1) problems in keeping up with
  peers in school, sports, leisure, friendships/relationships and work (2) to differ
  from peers due to their appearance and disability.  An adolescent Marfan syndrome-specific
  International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health for Children
  and Youth model derived from the data describing the adolescent perceived impact
  of Marfan syndrome on functioning, disability and contextual factors."
