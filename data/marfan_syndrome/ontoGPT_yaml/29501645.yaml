input_text: 'Predictors for Late Reoperation After Surgical Repair of Acute Type A
  Aortic Dissection. BACKGROUND: It is impossible to resolve all the problems of the
  entire diseased aorta with just one operation for acute type A aortic dissection,
  which requires additional surgical treatment in the long-term. METHODS: From April
  2004 to March 2017, 310 patients underwent surgical repair for acute type A aortic
  dissection at our institution. Of these, 32 (10.3%) died in the hospital. Of the
  278 hospital survivors, 38 underwent late reoperation associated with aortic dissection
  during the follow-up period. We compared the 240 nonreoperation patients and the
  38 reoperation patients to analyze risk factors for late reoperation after operations
  for acute type A dissection. RESULTS: The mean duration from the initial operation
  to reoperation was 3.54 +- 3.0 years. The rates of actuarial freedom from reoperation
  were 96.9%, 83.2%, and 64.2% at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively. The multivariate
  Cox proportional hazard regression analysis revealed the following as independent
  predictors of late reoperation: younger age, Marfan syndrome, nonprescription of
  beta-blockers, greater diameter of the descending aorta, ratio of false lumen to
  true lumen of more than 1, limb malperfusion, and primary entry in the ascending
  aorta. Log-rank analysis revealed no difference in long-term survival between the
  two groups. CONCLUSIONS: We found several risk factors for both late reoperation
  and death. Specifically, aortic diameter in the early phase after the initial operation
  and nonuse of beta-blockers were strong predictors. The ratio of the false lumen
  to the true lumen may also be a new and useful indicator for late reoperation.'
