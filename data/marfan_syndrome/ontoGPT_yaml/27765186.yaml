input_text: 'Valve-Sparing Root Replacement Compared With Composite Valve Graft Procedures
  in Patients With Aortic Root Dilation. BACKGROUND: Although aortic valve-sparing
  (AVS) operations are established alternatives to composite valve graft (CVG) procedures
  for patients with aortic root aneurysms, comparative long-term outcomes are lacking.
  OBJECTIVES: This study sought to compare the results of patients undergoing AVS
  procedures with those undergoing CVG operations. METHODS: From 1990 to 2010, a total
  of 616 patients age <70 years and without aortic stenosis underwent elective aortic
  root surgery (AVS, n = 253; CVG with a bioprosthesis [bio-CVG], n = 180; CVG with
  a mechanical prosthesis [m-CVG], n = 183). A propensity score was used as a covariate
  to adjust for unbalanced variables in group comparisons. Mean age was 46 +- 14 years,
  83.3% were male, and mean follow-up was 9.8 +- 5.3 years. RESULTS: Patients undergoing
  AVS had higher rates of Marfan syndrome and lower rates of bicuspid aortic valve
  than those undergoing bio-CVG or m-CVG procedures. In-hospital mortality (0.3%)
  and stroke rate (1.3%) were similar among groups. After adjusting for clinical covariates,
  both bio-CVG and m-CVG procedures were associated with increased long-term major
  adverse valve-related events compared with patients undergoing AVS (hazard ratio
  [HR]: 3.4, p = 0.005; and HR: 5.2, p < 0.001, respectively). They were also associated
  with increased cardiac mortality (HR: 7.0, p = 0.001; and HR: 6.4, p = 0.003). Furthermore,
  bio-CVG procedures were associated with increased risk of reoperations (HR: 6.9;
  p = 0.003), and m-CVG procedures were associated with increased risk of anticoagulant-related
  hemorrhage (HR: 5.6; p = 0.008) compared with AVS procedures. CONCLUSIONS: This
  comparative study showed that AVS procedures were associated with reduced cardiac
  mortality and valve-related complications when compared with bio-CVG and m-CVG.
  AVS is the treatment of choice for young patients with aortic root aneurysm and
  normal or near-normal aortic cusps.'
