input_text: Acute complicated type B aortic dissection during the New York City COVID-19
  surge. The impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in New York
  City (NYC) is dramatic. COVID-19 cases surged, hospitals expanded to meet capacity,
  and NYC remains the global epicenter of this pandemic. During this unprecedented
  time, a young woman with known Marfan syndrome presented with an acute complicated
  type B aortic dissection to our Aortic Center. Using the provisional extension to
  induce a complete attachment technique, we treated this patient and quickly discharged
  her the next day to decrease the risk of COVID-19 infection. Her progress was monitored
  using frequent phone calls and one office visit at two weeks.
