input_text: "Emergency vascular surgical care in populations with unique physiologic
  characteristics: Pediatric, pregnant, and frail populations. Vascular surgical emergencies
  are common in vascular surgical care and require complex decision making and multidisciplinary
  care. They are especially challenging when they occur in patients with unique physiological
  characteristics, such as pediatric, pregnant, and frail patients. Among the pediatric
  and pregnant population, vascular emergencies are rare. This rarity challenges accurate
  and timely diagnosis of the vascular emergency. This landscape review summarizes
  these three unique populations' epidemiology and emergency vascular considerations.
  Understanding the epidemiology is the foundation for accurate diagnosis and subsequent
  management. Considering each population's unique characteristics is crucial to the
  emergent vascular surgical interventions decision making. Collaborative and multidisciplinary
  care is vital in gaining expertise in managing these special populations and achieving
  optimal patient outcomes."
