input_text: 'Aortopathy in pregnancy. Up to half of all aortic dissections and ruptures
  in women younger than 40 years are associated with pregnancy. In pregnancy, women
  with aortic disease such as arteritis and aortitis are at significant risk of aneurysmal
  formation and dissection with potential for catastrophic outcomes. Pregnancy places
  predisposed women at an increased risk of dissection due to physiological and hormonal
  changes that occur, particularly those with connective tissue disorders, genetic
  syndromes, congenital heart disease, and other heritable and acquired conditions
  involving the aorta. Thus, preconception counseling and preparation are advised
  to determine which patients may cautiously pursue pregnancy, to optimize medical
  management prior to conception (antihypertensive medications and anticoagulants
  in the setting of mechanical valves), to identify women in whom aortic root repair
  should occur prior to pregnancy, and lastly, those in whom pregnancy is contraindicated.
  Additionally, discussion of the heritable nature of many aortic conditions and associated
  syndromes is indicated. Preconception and genetic counseling, management by a multidisciplinary
  team, along with close echocardiographic surveillance and medical management, are
  recommended if precursors of dissection are identified. '
