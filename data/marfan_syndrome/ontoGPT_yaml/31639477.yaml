input_text: 'Endovascular Repair of Bilateral Internal Mammary Artery Aneurysms in
  a Patient with Marfan Syndrome. BACKGROUND: True internal mammary artery aneurysms
  are rare but rupture has been described. CASE REPORT: A 39-year-old male patient
  with Marfan syndrome was diagnosed with large asymptomatic bilateral internal mammary
  artery aneurysms (IMAAs) on contrast-enhanced CT scan, without other arterial lesions.
  Both aneurysms were coil embolized, a stent graft was deployed in the left subclavian
  artery to cover a wide neck that precluded complete and safe embolization of the
  left IMAA. Reintervention on the right side was performed 5 years later due to recanalization.
  Eight years after the initial procedure, the patient presented with a type A aortic
  dissection that was successfully repaired. CONCLUSIONS: Although extremely rare,
  endovascular treatment should be considered to prevent rupture of internal mammary
  artery aneurysms.'
