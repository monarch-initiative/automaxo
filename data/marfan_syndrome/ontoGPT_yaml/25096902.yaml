input_text: 'Impact of aortic aneurysm on hospitalizations in patients with marfan
  syndrome: a multi-institutional study. Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant
  connective tissue disorder affecting 1 in 3,000 people. Cardiovascular involvement
  is a prominent feature of MFS, with aortic dissection and/or rupture being the leading
  cause of death. Advances in the medical and surgical care of patients with MFS have
  improved survival. Hospital resource utilization and outcomes have not been evaluated
  in a large population of patients with MFS. We sought to analyze pediatric hospital
  resource utilization and outcomes in patients with MFS. Nationally distributed data
  from 43 pediatric hospitals in the 2004-2011 Pediatric Health Information System
  database were used to identify patients admitted to the hospital with International
  Classification of Diseases-9th Revision codes for a diagnosis of MFS. Aortic aneurysm
  (AA) with or without dissection, length of stay (LOS), and hospital charges were
  determined. During the study period, there were 1,978 admissions in 1,228 patients
  with MFS. AA was present in 217 (11%) admissions in 188 (15%) patients (63% male).
  Mean age of patients with AA was 13.8 +- 5.9 years. Aortic dissection or rupture
  was present in 15 (7% with AA) admissions in 15 (8% with AA) patients (mean age
  15.7 +- 5.2 years). Other cardiac diagnoses occurred more commonly in the AA cohort
  (p < 0.0001), regardless of the reason for admission. Cardiothoracic surgical procedures
  were performed in 116 AA admissions (53%). Mean LOS, hospital charges per admission,
  and charges per day were significantly higher in AA cohort compared to those without
  AA. In-hospital mortality for AA was 2%. The presence of AA in patients with MFS
  increases hospital resource utilization. Cardiothoracic surgeries are commonly performed
  in this cohort. Other cardiovascular diagnoses are more prevalent in patients with
  AA suggesting a more severe phenotype.'
