input_text: 'Cardiovascular Benefits of Moderate Exercise Training in Marfan Syndrome:
  Insights From an Animal Model. BACKGROUND: Marfan syndrome (MF) leads to aortic
  root dilatation and a predisposition to aortic dissection, mitral valve prolapse,
  and primary and secondary cardiomyopathy. Overall, regular physical exercise is
  recommended for a healthy lifestyle, but dynamic sports are strongly discouraged
  in MF patients. Nonetheless, evidence supporting this recommendation is lacking.
  Therefore, we studied the role of long-term dynamic exercise of moderate intensity
  on the MF cardiovascular phenotype. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a transgenic mouse model
  of MF (Fbn1C1039G/+), 4-month-old wild-type and MF mice were subjected to training
  on a treadmill for 5 months; sedentary littermates served as controls for each group.
  Aortic and cardiac remodeling was assessed by echocardiography and histology. The
  4-month-old MF mice showed aortic root dilatation, elastic lamina rupture, and tunica
  media fibrosis, as well as cardiac hypertrophy, left ventricular fibrosis, and intramyocardial
  vessel remodeling. Over the 5-month experimental period, aortic root dilation rate
  was significantly greater in the sedentary MF group, compared with the wild-type
  group ( mm, 0.27+-0.07 versus 0.13+-0.02, respectively). Exercise significantly
  blunted the aortic root dilation rate in MF mice compared with sedentary MF littermates
  ( mm, 0.10+-0.04 versus 0.27+-0.07, respectively). However, these 2 groups were
  indistinguishable by aortic root stiffness, tunica media fibrosis, and elastic lamina
  ruptures. In MF mice, exercise also produced cardiac hypertrophy regression without
  changes in left ventricular fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results in a transgenic mouse
  model of MF indicate that moderate dynamic exercise mitigates the progression of
  the MF cardiovascular phenotype.'
