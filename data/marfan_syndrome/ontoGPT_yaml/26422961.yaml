input_text: '[Anesthetic Management of Right Lower Lobectomy in a Patient with Marfan
  Syndrome]. We report a case of partial lobectomy in a patient with Marfan syndrome.
  A 56-year-old woman with Marfan syndrome was scheduled for partial lobectomy for
  suspected lung cancer under general anesthesia. She underwent a Bentall operation
  and mitral valve replacement 10 months before and strict blood pressure management
  was required. After induction of general anesthesia with propofol and fentanyl,
  topical intratracheal lidocaine anesthesia was performed using the Pentax-AWS Airwayscope
  (AWS) for visualization, allowing for the Soft-tipped Tube Exchanger (TE-Soft) to
  be inserted into the trachea. Next, a double-lumen tracheal tube was uneventfully
  intubated via the TE-Soft with minimal change in vital signs. During the operation,
  pressure-controlled ventilation was performed to minimize the risk of pneumothorax.
  After the operation, under continuous administration of landiorol and dexmedetomidine,
  the double-lumen tracheal tube was extubated uneventfully. Strict airway and circulation
  management is needed for lung or vessel preservation in patients whose conditions
  are complicated by Marfan syndrome.'
