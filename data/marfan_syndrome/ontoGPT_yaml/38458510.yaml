input_text: 'Axillary vs Femoral Arterial Cannulation in Acute Type A Dissection:
  International Multicenter Data. BACKGROUND: Cannulation strategy in acute Type A
  dissection (ATAD) varies widely without known gold standards. We compared ATAD outcomes
  of Axillary versus Femoral cannulation in a large cohort from the International
  Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection (IRAD). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed
  2145 IRAD Interventional Cohort patients (1996-2021) undergoing ATAD repair with
  axillary or femoral cannulation (Axillary: N=1106, 52%; Femoral: N=1039, 48%). Endpoints
  included: early mortality; neurologic, respiratory and renal complications; malperfusion;
  and tamponade. All outcomes are presented as axillary with respect to femoral. RESULTS:
  The proportion of patients under age 70 in both groups was similar (N=1577, 74%)
  as were: bicuspid aortic valve, Marfan syndrome, and previous dissection. Femoral
  patients had slightly more aortic insufficiency [408 (55%) vs 429 (60%) p=0.058]
  and coronary involvement [48 (8%) vs 70 (13%) p=0.022]. Axillary patients underwent
  more total arch [156 (15%) vs 106 (11%) p=0.02] and valve-sparing root replacements
  [220 (22%) vs 112 (12%) p<0.001]. More Femoral patients underwent commissural resuspension
  [269 (30.9%) vs 324 (35.3%) p=0.05]. Valve replacement rates were not different.
  Mean duration of cardiopulmonary bypass was longer among Femoral patients [190 (150-237)
  vs 200 (160-249) mins p=0.002]. In-hospital mortality was similar between Axillary
  (N=165, 15%) and Femoral (N=149, 14%) patients (p=0.7). Furthermore, there were
  no differences in stroke, visceral ischemia, tamponade, respiratory insufficiency,
  coma, or spinal cord ischemia. CONCLUSIONS: Axillary cannulation is associated with
  more stable ATAD presentation, but more extensive intervention compared to Femoral.
  Both have equivalent early mortality, stroke, tamponade, and malperfusion outcomes
  after statistical adjustment.'
