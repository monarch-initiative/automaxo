input_text: 'A marked decrease in heart rate variability in Marfan syndrome patients
  with confirmed FBN1 mutations. BACKGROUND: The studies on heart rate variability
  (HRV), a key predictor of all-cause mortality, in Marfan syndrome (MS), up to now
  have not been reported, especially in patients with FBN1 mutations. METHODS: Among
  18 MS patients with the phenotype of MS meeting inclusion criteria 15 have had a
  FBN1 gene mutation. Short electrocardiography records were taken in the supine position
  and during orthostatic tests. The control group consisted of 30 apparently healthy
  nonathletes matched by age and gender. RESULTS: Heart rates in MS patients with
  the FBN1 mutation were increased in both the supine position and orthostatic test
  (p < 0.001). Most of the time-domain (standard deviation, pNN50) and frequency-domain
  (total power, very low, low, and high frequency) parameters of HRV were significantly
  reduced in the MS patients (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A marked decrease in HRV, documented
  in the study, may be an important clinical feature in MS patients with confirmed
  FBN1 gene mutations.'
