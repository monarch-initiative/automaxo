input_text: "Marfan Syndrome: new diagnostic criteria, same anesthesia care? Case
  report and review. BACKGROUND: Marfan's Syndrome (MFS) is a disorder of connective
  tissue, mainly involving the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and ocular systems.
  The most severe problems include aortic root dilatation and dissection. Anesthetic
  management is vital for the improvement on perioperative morbidity. CASE REPORT:
  61-year-old male with MFS, presenting mainly with pectus carinatum, scoliosis, ectopia
  lens, previous spontaneous pneumothorax and aortal aneurysm and dissection submitted
  to thoracoabdominal aortic prosthesis placement. Underwent routine laparoscopic
  cholecystectomy due to lithiasis. Important findings on preoperative examination
  were thoracolumbar kyphoscoliosis, metallic murmur on cardiac exam. Chest radiograph
  revealed Cobb angle of 70 . Echocardiogram showed evidence of aortic mechanical
  prosthesis with no deficits. DISCUSSION: Preoperative evaluation should focus on
  cardiopulmonary abnormalities. The anesthesiologist should be prepared for a potentially
  difficult intubation. Proper positioning and limb support prior to induction is
  crucial in order to avoid joint injuries. Consider antibiotic prophylaxis for subacute
  bacterial endocarditis. The patient should be carefully positioned to avoid joint
  injuries. Intraoperatively cardiovascular monitoring is mandatory: avoid maneuvers
  that can lead to tachycardia or hypertension, control airway pressure to prevent
  pneumothorax and maintain an adequate volemia to decrease chances of prolapse, especially
  if considering laparoscopic surgery. No single intraoperative anesthetic agent or
  technique has demonstrated superiority. Adequate postoperative pain management is
  vitally important to avoid the detrimental effects of hypertension and tachycardia."
