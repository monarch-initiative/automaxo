input_text: 'Marfan syndrome: A therapeutic challenge for long-term care. Marfan syndrome
  (MFS) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by mutations in the fibrillin-1
  gene. Acute aortic dissection is the leading cause of death in patients suffering
  from MFS and consequence of medial degeneration and aneurysm formation. In addition
  to its structural function in the formation of elastic fibers, fibrillin has a major
  role in keeping maintaining transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) in an inactive
  form. Dysfunctional fibrillin increases TGF-beta bioavailability and concentration
  in the extracellular matrix, leading to activation of proinflammatory transcription
  factors. In turn, these events cause increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases
  and cytokines that control the migration and infiltration of inflammatory cells
  into the aorta. Moreover, TGF-beta causes accumulation of reactive oxygen species
  leading to further degradation of elastin fibers. All these processes result in
  medial elastolysis, which increases the risk of vascular complications. Although
  MFS is a hereditary disease, symptoms and traits are usually not noticeable at birth.
  During childhood or adolescence affected individuals present with severe tissue
  weaknesses, especially in the aorta, heart, eyes, and skeleton. Considering this,
  even young patients should avoid activities that exert additional stress and pressure
  on the aorta and the cardiovascular system. Thus, if the diagnosis is made and prophylactic
  treatment is initiated in a timely fashion, MFS and its preliminary pathophysiologic
  vascular remodeling can be successfully ameliorated reducing the risk of life-threatening
  complications. This commentary focuses on new research opportunities and molecular
  findings on MFS, discusses future challenges and possible long-term therapies.'
