  Perloff and lessons learned from him: aortopathy in adults with CHD. Marfan syndrome,
  bicuspid aortic valve, and/or coarctation of the aorta are associated with medial
  abnormalities of the ascending aortic or para-coarctation aorta. Medial abnormalities
  in the ascending aorta are prevalent in other type of patients with a variety of
  CHDs such as single ventricle, persistent truncus arteriosus, transposition of the
  great arteries, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, and tetralogy of Fallot, encompassing
  a wide age range and may predispose to dilatation, aneurysm, and rapture necessitating
  aortic valve and root surgery. These CHDs exhibit ongoing dilatation of the aortic
  root and reduced aortic elasticity and increased aortic stiffness that may relate
  to intrinsic properties of the aortic root. These aortic dilatation and increased
  stiffness can induce aortic aneurysm, rapture of the aorta, and aortic regurgitation,
  but also provoke left ventricular hypertrophy, reduced coronary artery flow, and
  left ventricular failure. Therefore, a new clinical entity can be used to call this
  association of aortic pathophysiological abnormality, aortic dilation, and aorto-left
  ventricular interaction - "aortopathy".'
