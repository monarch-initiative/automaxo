input_text: 'Aortic root valve-sparing repair and dissections in Marfans syndrome
  during pregnancy: A case series. INTRODUCTION: Marfan syndrome is a connective tissue
  disorder caused by mutations in the fibrillar FBN-1 gene. Aortic dissection and
  rupture are major causes of morbidity and mortality and are of special concern during
  pregnancy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors report four cases of aortic root repair
  with preservation of the native aortic valve that have has created a discussion
  between cardiothoracic surgeons, obstetricians, and gynecologists regarding the
  best care for Marfan syndrome patients. We present these cases here with a review
  of the literature. RESULTS: Surgery of the aorta and valves in Marfan syndrome is
  less risky than in previous eras and surgical management guidelines are generally
  accepted. Yet, we may be unnecessarily referring women to terminate pregnancies
  or to avoid pregnancy. We believe there may be alternative options for these patients.
  CONCLUSIONS: Marfan syndrome during pregnancy can be navigated with preconception
  counseling, antepartum care, and close postpartum follow-up involving an appropriate
  multidisciplinary team.'
