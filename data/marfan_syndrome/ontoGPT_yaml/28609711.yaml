input_text: 'Birth characteristics of women with Marfan syndrome, obstetric and neonatal
  outcomes of their pregnancies-A nationwide cohort and case-control study. OBJECTIVE:
  The aim was to investigate birth characteristics, obstetric and neonatal outcomes
  of the first childbirth in women with Marfan syndrome by use of Swedish national
  registers since pregnancy-related outcomes in women with Marfan syndrome have only
  been sparsely investigated. STUDY DESIGN: In this national population-based cohort
  study and matched case-control study of Swedish women born 1973-1993, women with
  Marfan syndrome (n=273) were compared to women without the condition (n=1 017 265).
  The study population was followed until 2013. A total of 364 553 mother-firstborn-offspring
  pairs were analyzed. Sixty-one women with Marfan syndrome became mothers. Women
  with Marfan syndrome were also compared to 543 healthy controls. RESULTS: Women
  with Marfan syndrome were more often born preterm (p<0.001), small-for-gestational
  age (p<0.001), and delivered by cesarean section (p=0.001). Women with Marfan syndrome
  had no increased risk of giving birth by cesarean section (p=0.079). No increased
  neonatal risks in their children were found. Women with Marfan syndrome were less
  likely to give birth than those without (p<0.001). There were no maternal deaths.
  CONCLUSIONS: Women with Marfan syndrome were more likely to be born preterm, SGA
  and by cesarean section. These increased risks of preterm birth and SGA babies were
  not found in connection with their own first childbirth. Pregnancies with known
  fetal Marfan syndrome have to be carefully monitored. The results are important
  for obstetricians giving preconception counseling and treating women with Marfan
  syndrome. Further studies are needed to evaluate risks during pregnancy and long-term
  effects of pregnancy on the cardiovascular status of women with Marfan syndrome.'
