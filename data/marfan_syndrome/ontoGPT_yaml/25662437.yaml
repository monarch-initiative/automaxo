input_text: 'Early and medium term results of the sleeve valve-sparing procedure for
  aortic root ectasia. BACKGROUND: The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate
  our experience of using a simplified aortic valve sleeve procedure to treat aortic
  root ectasia and aneurysms with or without aortic regurgitation. In experienced
  hands, 2 aortic valve-sparing procedures, ie, Yacoub and David, have yielded excellent
  long-term results in the treatment of aortic root aneurysms, with or without aortic
  regurgitation. However, these techniques are demanding and not widely used. Recently,
  a new and simplified valve-sparing technique, named "sleeve procedure," has been
  proposed, and has yielded encouraging early results. METHODS: Ninety consecutive
  patients with aortic root aneurysms underwent sleeve procedures from October 2006
  to October 2012. Follow-up data (clinical 100% complete and echocardiographic 93%
  complete) were acquired from our outpatient clinic or from the referring cardiologist.
  RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 61.5 +- 12.5 years, 79% were male, 16
  (18%) had a bicuspid valve, 3 had Marfan syndrome, and 2 had aortic dissection.
  Over a mean clinical follow-up of 34 +- 19 months, 2 patients died from noncardiac
  causes and 1 was reoperated on for the recurrence of aortic regurgitation. On follow-up
  echocardiography after a mean of 18 +- 9 months, aortic regurgitation was absent/negligible,
  mild or moderate in 62%, 37%, and 1% of patients, respectively, and the diameters
  of the annulus, Valsalva sinuses, and sinotubular junction were 27.3 + 2.2, 37.0
  + 3.4, and 30.6 + 3.1 mm, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our encouraging early and medium
  term results suggest that the sleeve procedure is a safe and effective aortic valve-sparing
  technique for the treatment of aortic root ectasia and aneurysm. However, longer
  follow-up is needed in order to draw definitive conclusions.'
