input_text: 'Management of Marfan Syndrome during pregnancy: A real world experience
  from a Joint Cardiac Obstetric Service. BACKGROUND: Pregnancy in Marfan Syndrome
  (MFS) is associated with increased maternal risk of cardiovascular events. Given
  the maternal and genetic risks, pre-conception counselling is essential to facilitate
  informed choices. Multidisciplinary antenatal care with regular imaging is mandatory
  and best delivered through a Joint Cardiac Obstetric Service (JCOS). The aim of
  this study was to compare the care delivered in a JCOS against recognised international
  standards (European Society of Cardiology (ESC)). METHODS: Pregnancies in women
  with MFS from 2005 to 2015 were identified from our institutional database. Patient
  records were reviewed and practice assessed against pre-determined standards based
  on ESC guidelines. RESULTS: There were 23 pregnancies in 15 women with MFS. 13/23
  (57%) occurred in women with aortic dilatation at baseline. There were 3 important
  maternal cardiac events (type A dissection; deterioration in left ventricular function;
  significant left ventricular and progressive aortic dilatation). Four women did
  not have access to expert pre-conception counselling. These women were all referred
  to the JCOS late in established pregnancy. Imaging was often delayed and only 7/23
  cases (30%) met the standard for minimum frequency of echocardiographic surveillance.
  Only 12/23 (52%) had pre-conception imaging of the whole aorta with CT/MRI. Distal
  aortic dilatation was identified in 7/23 cases but none of these underwent further
  MRI evaluation during pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Despite having a dedicated JCOS, our
  data show that facilitating complete obstetric and cardiac care for this group remains
  challenging. Education of local care providers and timely referral for expert pre-conception
  counselling in a JCOS are key.'
