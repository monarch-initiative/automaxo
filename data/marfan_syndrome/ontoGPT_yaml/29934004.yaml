input_text: 'Stent-assisted, balloon-induced intimal disruption and relamination of
  aortic dissection in patients with Marfan syndrome: Midterm outcomes and aortic
  remodeling. OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to assess the midterm outcomes and
  aortic remodeling in patients with Marfan syndrome with complicated acute type B
  aortic dissection treated with stent-assisted, balloon-induced intimal disruption
  and relamination. METHODS: We reviewed all patients treated with stent-assisted,
  balloon-induced intimal disruption and relamination for a complicated acute type
  B aortic dissection associated with Marfan syndrome according to the revised Ghent
  criteria. RESULTS: Between 2015 and November 2017, 7 patients with Marfan syndrome
  underwent stent-assisted, balloon-induced intimal disruption and relamination for
  a complicated acute type B aortic dissection. The median age of patients was 47
  years (range, 23-70). Four patients had a history of aortic root replacement. Technical
  success was achieved in 100%. Three patients required an adjunctive procedure for
  renal artery stenting (n = 2) and iliac artery stenting (n = 1). There was no in-hospital
  death, 30-day postoperative stroke, spinal cord ischemia, ischemic colitis, or renal
  failure requiring dialysis. At a median follow-up of 15 months (range, 7-28), 1
  patient required aortic arch replacement for aneurysmal degeneration associated
  with a type Ia endoleak at 2 years, giving a late reintervention rate of 14%. There
  was no other secondary endoleak. The primary visceral patency rate was 100%. There
  were no all-cause deaths reported. At last computed tomography scan, all patients
  had complete aortic remodeling of the treated thoracoabdominal aorta. Distally,
  at the nonstented infrarenal aortoiliac level, 6 patients had persistent false lumen
  flow with stable aorto-iliac diameter in 5. One patient had iliac diameter growth
  (27 mm diameter at last computed tomography scan). CONCLUSIONS: Stent-assisted,
  balloon-induced intimal disruption and relamination of aortic dissection in patients
  with Marfan syndrome is feasible, safe, and associated with an immediate and midterm
  persisting thoracoabdominal aortic remodeling.'
