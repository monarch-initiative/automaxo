input_text: Interventional Spine Considerations for Dural Ectasia in a Patient With
  Marfan Syndrome. For patients with Marfan syndrome who present with radicular low
  back pain, interventional spine providers should be familiar with dural ectasia
  with variable diffuse thinning of the posterior wall of the lumbar spine and sacrum.
  Providers should carefully weigh the risks and benefits of offering elective procedures
  because altered anatomy may put these patients at higher risk of dural puncture.
  Patient selection is essential because hydrostatic pressures and/or neural tension
  should also be considered as potential pain generators that may not be relieved
  by steroid injections. Careful evaluation of recent magnetic resonance images and
  vigilant procedural technique is highly recommended.
