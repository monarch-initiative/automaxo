input_text: 'Maternal and fetal outcomes in pregnancies complicated by Marfan syndrome.
  OBJECTIVES: Information to guide counselling and management for pregnancy in women
  with Marfan syndrome (MFS) is limited. We therefore conducted a UK multicentre study.
  METHODS: Retrospective observational study of women with MFS delivering between
  January 1998 and March 2018 in 12 UK centres reporting data on maternal and neonatal
  outcomes. RESULTS: In total, there were 258 pregnancies in 151 women with MFS (19
  women had prior aortic root replacements), including 226 pregnancies >=24 weeks
  (two sets of twins), 20 miscarriages and 12 pregnancy terminations. Excluding miscarriages
  and terminations, there were 221 live births in 139 women. Only 50% of women received
  preconception counselling. There were no deaths, but five women experienced aortic
  dissection (1.9%; one type A and four type B-one had a type B dissection at 12 weeks
  and subsequent termination of pregnancy). Five women required cardiac surgery postpartum.
  No predictors for aortic dissection could be identified. The babies of the 131 (65.8%)
  women taking beta-blockers were on average 316 g lighter (p<0.001). Caesarean section
  rates were high (50%), particularly in women with dilated aortic roots. In 55 women,
  echocardiographic aortic imaging was available prepregnancy and postpregnancy; there
  was a small but significant average increase in AoR size of 0.84 mm (Median follow-up
  2.3 months) CONCLUSION: There were no maternal deaths, and the aortic dissection
  rate was 1.9% (mainly type B). There with no identifiable factors associated with
  aortic dissection in our cohort. Preconception counselling rates were low and need
  improvement. Aortic size measurements increased marginally following pregnancy.'
