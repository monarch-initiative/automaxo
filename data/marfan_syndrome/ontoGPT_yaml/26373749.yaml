input_text: Aortic issues in scoliosis and scoliotic operations. The spatial relations
  between the aorta and vertebrae are changing with posture, surgical techniques,
  and operative maneuvers. "Risky screws" (within 1-3 mm proximity to the aorta or
  other adjacent tissues) were found in 5.8-15.2% screws. In order to avoid early
  and later aortic complications secondary to scoliotic operations, careful preoperative
  metrology of aorto-vertebrae relations is of crucial importance. Compared with patients
  with idiopathic scoliosis, Marfan-related scoliosis is characterized by faster progression
  and it is more bracing-resistant due to the particular developmental anomalies in
  Marfan syndrome, implying the refractory nature of the latter. The present study
  aims to highlight the clinical impact of preoperative aorto-vertebra metrology in
  the scoliotic operations.
