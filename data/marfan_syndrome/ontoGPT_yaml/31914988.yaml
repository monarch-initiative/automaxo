input_text: 'A case of Marfan syndrome with massive haemoptysis from collaterals of
  the lateral thoracic artery. BACKGROUND: Marfan Syndrome (MFS) is a heritable connective
  tissue disorder with a high degree of clinical variability including respiratory
  diseases; a rare case of MFS with massive intrathoracic bleeding has been reported
  recently. CASE PRESENTATION: A 32-year-old man who had been diagnosed with MFS underwent
  a Bentall operation with artificial valve replacement for aortic dissection and
  regurgitation of an aortic valve in 2012. Warfarin was started postoperatively,
  and the dosage was gradually increased until 2017, when the patient was transported
  to our hospital due to sudden massive haemoptysis. Computed tomography (CT) with
  a maximum intensity projection (MIP) revealed several giant pulmonary cysts with
  fluid levels in the apex of the right lung with an abnormal vessel from the right
  subclavian artery. Transcatheter arterial embolization was performed with angiography
  and haemostasis was achieved, which suggested that the bleeding vessel was the lateral
  thoracic artery (LTA) branch. CT taken before the incident indicated thickening
  of the cystic wall adjacent to the thorax; therefore, it was postulated that the
  bleeding originated from fragile anastomoses between the LTA and pulmonary or bronchial
  arteries. It appears that the vessels exhibited inflammation that began postoperatively,
  which extended to the cysts. CONCLUSION: We experienced a case of MFS with massive
  haemoptysis from the right LTA. We have to be aware of the possibility that massive
  haemoptysis could be induced in MFS with inflamed pulmonary cysts.'
