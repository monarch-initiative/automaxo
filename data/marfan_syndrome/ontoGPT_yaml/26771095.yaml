input_text: "[Efficacy of Stent-Assisted Coil Embolization for a Dissecting Aneurysm
  of the Cervical Internal Carotid Artery Caused by a Systemic Vascular Disease: A
  Case Report]. Systemic vascular diseases such as fibromuscular dysplasia, Ehlers-Danlos
  syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and Behcet's disease are known to cause spontaneous dissecting
  aneurysms of the cervical internal carotid artery. These diseases are generally
  associated with vascular fragility; therefore, invasive treatments are avoided in
  many cases of dissecting aneurysms, and a conservative approach is used for the
  primary disease. Surgical or intravascular treatment may be chosen when aneurysms
  are progressive or are associated with a high risk of hemorrhage; however, there
  is no consensus on which treatment is better. We report a case of a dissecting aneurysm
  of the cervical internal carotid artery in a patient with suspected Behcet's disease,
  which was treated using stent-assisted coil embolization. A man in his 40's, with
  suspected Behcet's disease, presented with an enlarged dissecting aneurysm of the
  right cervical internal carotid artery. The lesion was present for approximately
  10 years. We performed stent-assisted coil embolization for the lesion. Post-surgery,
  no aneurysms were detected with carotid artery echography. Our case report suggests
  that stent-assisted coil embolization is a promising treatment for dissecting aneurysms
  of the cervical internal carotid artery. In addition, the procedure demonstrates
  the utility of carotid artery echograms for examining recanalization after stent-assisted
  coil embolization. "
