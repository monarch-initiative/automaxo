input_text: 'Valve-sparing David I procedure in acute aortic type A dissection: a
  20-year experience with more than 100 patients. OBJECTIVES: The aortic valve-sparing
  David procedure has been applied to the elective treatment of patients with aortic
  aneurysms with excellent results. The use of this technique in patients with acute
  aortic dissection type A (AADA) is still a matter of debate. We present our long-term
  experience with 109 patients with AADA who had the valve-sparing David I procedure.
  METHODS: Between July 1993 and October 2015, 109 patients with AADA had the valve-sparing
  David I procedure at our centre. We conducted a retrospective review with follow-up.
  RESULTS: The mean age was 54 +- 12 years; 78 (72%) patients were men. Marfan syndrome
  was present in 6 (5%) patients and bicuspid aortic valve in 3 (3%). Only 4 (4%)
  patients received the isolated David procedure; 50 (46%) underwent additional proximal,
  13 (12%) subtotal and 42 (39%) total aortic arch replacement. The in-hospital mortality
  rate was 11% ( n  = 12). Intraoperative/discharge echocardiography showed aortic
  insufficiency <= I  in 93 of 97 patients (96%). Mean follow-up time was 8.3 +- 5.7
  years. The survival rate after discharge at 1, 5 and 10 years was 94%, 90% and 78%,
  respectively. Thirteen percent ( n  = 13) of patients underwent valve-related reoperation.
  Freedom from valve-related reoperation at 1, 5 and 10 years was 96%, 88% and 85%,
  respectively. Compared to patients who underwent the David I procedure for any reason
  other than AADA, there were no significant differences in long-term survival rates
  ( P  = 0.29) and freedom from a valve-related reoperation ( P  = 0.39). CONCLUSIONS:
  The valve-sparing David I procedure has acceptable long-term results even in emergent
  operations for AADA and is not inferior when performed in elective settings.'
