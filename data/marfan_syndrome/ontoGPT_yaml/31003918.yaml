input_text: 'The effects of losartan versus beta-blockers on cardiovascular protection
  in marfan syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:
  Variable effects of beta-blockers (BB) and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB)
  were reported to retard aortic root growth in Marfan syndrome (MFS). This study
  aimed to compare the effects of BB therapy and ARB-related therapies on cardiovascular
  protection in MFS. METHODS: Studies of randomized control trials comparing the efficacy
  of only-BB and ARB-related (only-ARB or ARB-plus-BB) therapies for MFS published
  before July 31, 2018 in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were selected.
  The outcomes included changes in aortic growth and cardiovascular events. RESULTS:
  Eight trials involving 1381 patients were included. Patients received only-BB and
  ARB-related therapies did not differ significantly in changes in aortic growth (aortic
  root diameter: standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.04, 95% confidence interval
  [CI]: -0.11-0.19, p = 0.63) or cardiovascular events (aortic dissection: Peto odds
  ratio [OR] = 1.67, 95% CI: 0.42-6.72, p = 0.47; aortic surgery: risk ratio = 0.97,
  95% CI: 0.66-1.41, p = 0.86; death: Peto OR = 2.78, 95% CI: 0.39-19.82, p = 0.31).
  Subgroup analysis revealed that ARB-plus-BB therapy exhibited nonsignificantly better
  outcomes than only-BB therapy (aortic root diameter: SMD = 0.11, 95% CI: -0.22-0.45,
  p = 0.52; ascending aorta diameter: SMD = 0.10, 95% CI: -0.07-0.27, p = 0.26; aortic
  surgery: Peto OR = 1.10, 95% CI: 0.75-1.61, p = 0.62). CONCLUSION: For cardiovascular
  protection in MFS, only-ARB therapy is not inferior to only-BB therapy. Moreover,
  the outcomes of ARB-plus-BB therapy seemed to be favourable to those of only-BB
  therapy.'
