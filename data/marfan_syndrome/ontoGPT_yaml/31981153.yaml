input_text: 'Preoperative halo-gravity traction for treatment of severe adult kyphosis
  and scoliosis. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. OBJECTIVE: To assess the
  efficacy of preoperative halo-gravity traction (HGT) in the treatment for severe
  adult kyphosis and scoliosis. Preoperative HGT improves severe curve magnitude and
  clinical condition in pediatric spinal deformity. However, the efficacy of HGT on
  severe adult spinal deformity has rarely been studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This
  study included 18 patients with severe adult kyphosis and scoliosis (age >= 18)
  who underwent a preoperative HGT (mean 4 weeks), and subsequent definitive posterior-alone
  corrective fusion. Etiologies were neurofibromatosis (n = 5), adult idiopathic (n
  = 3), multiple vertebral fractures due to osteoporosis (n = 1) and multiple myeloma
  (n = 1), degenerative failed back syndrome (n = 1), Scheuermann kyphosis (n = 1),
  Marfan syndrome (n = 1), and other genetic and connective tissue disorders (n =
  5). We reviewed baseline demographics, including coronal and sagittal radiographic
  profiles. The changes in major curve magnitude, pulmonary function tests (PFTs),
  and nutritional status were assessed between pre- and post-traction and immediate
  post-definitive corrective surgery. RESULTS: There were 11 male and 7 female patients,
  aged 18-69 years with their major coronal and sagittal curves being 92.0  +- 25.2  and
  111.6  +- 40.1 , respectively. The major coronal and sagittal curves were reduced
  by 18.4% and 16.8% after halo-traction, and 54.7% and 44.2% after definitive fusion,
  respectively. PFTs showed significant increase in %FEV1 and %FVC when comparing
  pre- and post-traction [43.0% +- 17.4% vs. 49.6% +- 18.7%, and 44.8%. +- 16.7% vs.
  54.3% +- 20.7%, respectively, p < 0.01 (n = 11)]. Effective weight gain was observed
  after traction (46.8 +- 14.5 vs. 49.3 +- 13.5 kg, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Halo-gravity
  traction (HGT) for severe coronal and sagittal plane spinal deformity in adult patients
  significantly reduced Cobb angles, improved PFTs, and allowed for effective weight
  gain in the preoperative period. The use of preoperative HGT is extremely beneficial
  to optimize the alignment and overall health of severe adult spinal deformity patients
  before their spinal reconstruction. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV.'
