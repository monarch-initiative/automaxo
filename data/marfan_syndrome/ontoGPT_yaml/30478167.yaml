input_text: Patients at Risk for Aortic Rupture Often Exposed to Fluoroquinolones
  during Hospitalization. Several studies have indicated that fluoroquinolone use
  may be associated with an increased risk of aortic aneurysm or dissection (AAD).
  Because patients with AAD or Marfan syndrome are at increased risk for aortic rupture,
  we performed a retrospective cohort study to determine the prevalence of systemic
  fluoroquinolone exposure and predictors of fluoroquinolone use in these patients.
  Data were obtained from the advisory board billing and administrative database,
  which contained information on 22 million adult hospitalizations in the United States
  for the study period (2009 to 2015). International Classification of Diseases (9/10)
  and Current Procedural Terminology codes were used to identify patients who had
  AAD or Marfan syndrome or underwent aortic repair. We identified 136,789 admissions
  for AAD, which involved 99,818 unique patients, 20% of whom received fluoroquinolone
  during a hospital admission. Of the 7,045 patients with dissection, 18% were exposed
  to fluoroquinolone. Of the 27,876 AAD patients who underwent aortic repair, 19%
  received fluoroquinolone during a hospitalization before the repair. In the AAD
  patients, having a diagnosis of pneumonia or urinary tract infection increased the
  likelihood of receiving fluoroquinolone during admission by 46% and 40%, respectively
  (P < 0.001). Additionally, we identified 2,871 admissions for Marfan syndrome, which
  involved 1,872 patients, 14% of whom received fluoroquinolone during an admission.
  In these patients, pneumonia and urinary tract infections also increased the risk
  of fluoroquinolone exposure. If the deleterious effects of fluoroquinolone on aortic
  integrity are substantiated, reducing fluoroquinolone use in hospitalized patients
  with aortic disorders will become an urgent safety issue for antibiotic stewardship
  programs.
