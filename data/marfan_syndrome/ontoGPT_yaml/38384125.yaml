input_text: 'Neurotrophic Keratopathy in Marfan Syndrome Patient After Micropulse
  Transscleral Cyclophotocoagulation: A Call for Risk Stratification. BACKGROUND Micropulse
  transscleral cyclophotocoagulation is a non-invasive, widely employed procedure
  that uses diode laser to target the ciliary body to lower the intraocular pressure.
  Despite its acknowledged efficacy, certain complications are recognized, with neurotrophic
  keratopathy being a rare yet serious consequence. This report seeks to shed light
  on a potential high-risk subgroup susceptible to neurotrophic keratopathy, exemplified
  by our patient with Marfan syndrome, a condition characterized by thin sclera. CASE
  REPORT Our patient, who was confirmed to have Marfan syndrome with pseudophakic
  glaucoma, underwent micropulse transscleral cyclophotocoagulation due to high intraocular
  pressure bilaterally and subsequently quickly manifested neurotrophic keratopathy
  in both eyes postoperatively. Swift initiation of management involved a comprehensive
  approach, including topical antibiotics, preservative-free lubrication, medroxyprogesterone
  acetate 1%, serum balanced salt solution (BSS) 50%, and the application of bandage
  contact lenses to expedite healing. Fortunately, the left eye demonstrated resolution
  within 10 days, while the right eye exhibited delayed healing, leading to subsequent
  scarring. CONCLUSIONS This report highlights the critical importance of recognizing
  populations predisposed to neurotrophic keratopathy before subjecting them to micropulse
  transscleral cyclophotocoagulation. Such awareness allows for the fine-tuning of
  procedural parameters, offering a strategic approach to mitigate the risk of neurotrophic
  keratopathy development. By further exploring and recognizing potential risk factors,
  clinicians can enhance patient outcomes and refine the safety profile of micropulse
  transscleral cyclophotocoagulation.'
