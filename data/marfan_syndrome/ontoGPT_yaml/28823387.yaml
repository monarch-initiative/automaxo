input_text: Losartan in combination with propranolol slows the aortic root dilatation
  in neonatal Marfan syndrome. Neonatal Marfan syndrome, in contrast to classical
  Marfan syndrome, is characterized by rapidly progressive multi-valvular cardiac
  disease and death from congestive heart failure, typically within the first year
  of life. Due to the rarity of this condition, treatment for neonatal Marfan syndrome
  has not been well studied. In this report, a combination of losartan and propranolol
  reduced the aortic root dilatation rate after three months of losartan therapy.
  Genetic analysis in this patient revealed a mutation in exon 25 of the FBN1 gene,
  which typically results in a shorter life expectancy. However, the patient's heart
  failure was controlled by losartan, propranolol and other anti-congestive medications,
  which may have prolonged his survival.
