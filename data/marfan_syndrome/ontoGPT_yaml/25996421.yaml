input_text: 'Intraoperative Suprachoroidal Hemorrhage After Penetrating Keratoplasty:
  Case Series and Review of Literature. OBJECTIVE: To describe four cases of intraoperative
  suprachoroidal hemorrhage (SCH) during penetrating keratoplasty and to review the
  literature. METHODS: Cases with intraoperative SCH during penetrating keratoplasty
  over 3-year period were reviewed. The parameters evaluated were ocular and systemic
  risk factors, intraoperative details, and postoperative outcomes. A review of literature
  of intraoperative SCH during penetrating keratoplasty was also conducted. RESULTS:
  Of the 543 cases that underwent penetrating keratoplasty for optical indications
  during the study period, four cases developed intraoperative SCH, which is an incidence
  of 0.73%. Suprachoroidal hemorrhage occurred in the following cases: failed pediatric
  graft, donor eye in a case of contralateral autokeratoplasty, Marfan syndrome with
  aphakic bullous keratopathy who had undergone multiple ocular surgeries, and a case
  of healed keratitis with corneoiridic scar. The mean age, axial length, and intraocular
  pressure were 32.75+-22.17 years (range, 4-57 years), 23.29+-2.12 mm (range, 20.38-25.2
  mm), and 16.25+-3.86 mm Hg (range, 16-20 mm Hg), respectively. Postoperatively,
  two eyes had a best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of counting fingers. The third
  case had BCVA of light perception (LP), and fourth eye had no LP. CONCLUSION: The
  visual outcomes in cases of open-sky penetrating keratoplasty with SCH continue
  to be abysmally poor. The importance of thoroughly informing the patient about this
  complication cannot be underrated.'
