input_text: "Palliative Mitral Valve Repair During Infancy for Neonatal Marfan Syndrome.
  An infant with neonatal Marfan syndrome (nMFS), a condition that is nearly always
  lethal during infancy, was referred to our hospital with symptoms of congestive
  heart failure resulting from severe mitral valve insufficiency. During mitral valve
  repair, the use of an annuloplasty ring was waived until annular dilatation was
  achieved after 2 palliative mitral valvuloplasty procedures. After the definitive
  operation, the patient's mitral valve function remained within normal limits until
  the last follow-up when the patient was 11 years old. To the best of our knowledge,
  this patient has the longest recorded survival after mitral valve repair. "
