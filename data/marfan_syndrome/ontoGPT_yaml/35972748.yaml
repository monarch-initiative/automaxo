input_text: Pre-implantation genetic testing for Marfan syndrome using mini-sequencing.
  Marfan syndrome (MFS1) is an autosomal dominant condition causing aortopathy including
  fatal aortic dissection. This study aimed to perform clinical PGT-M in a family
  with a history of MFS1 for two generations. A family with two members affected by
  MFS1 approached the hospital for PGT-M. The couple decided to join the project following
  extensive counselling and informed consent was obtained. The mutation contributory
  to MFS1 was identified using whole-exome sequencing (WES). A novel PGT-M protocol
  using multiplex fluorescent PCR and mini-sequencing was developed and tested. Ten
  blastocysts were subjected to PGT-M in two clinical PGT cycles. Mini-sequencing
  revealed four normal and six affected embryos. Microsatellite-based linkage analysis
  confirmed mutation analysis results in all samples. The embryos diagnosed as normal
  (non-MFS1) were chosen for transfer. A pregnancy was obtained in the third embryo
  transfer. Invasive prenatal diagnosis confirmed the normal genotype of the baby.
  This study demonstrated comprehensive management using the application of clinical-based
  diagnosis, WES for mutation identification within the MFS1 gene, mini-sequencing
  for embryo selection and microsatellite-based linkage analysis for backup of PGT-M
  results and contamination detection to assist couples in having a healthy child
  when there was a family history of Marfan syndrome.Impact StatementWhat is already
  known on this subject? Marfan syndrome (MFS1, OMIM#154700) is an autosomal dominant
  condition causing aortopathy including fatal aortic dissection. Pre-implantation
  genetic testing (PGT) is an alternative to traditional invasive prenatal diagnosis
  (PND) giving the couples the chance of starting pregnancy with the confidence that
  the baby will be unaffected. Most of the previous PGT reports employed microsatellite-based
  linkage analysis. A few PGT studies used sequencing, mini-sequencing and mutation
  analysis; however, the details of the techniques were not described.What do the
  results of this study add? Single-cell PCR protocol using multiplex fluorescent
  PCR and mini-sequencing was developed and validated. Two clinical PGTs cycles for
  Marfan syndrome were performed. A healthy baby was resulted. The details of multiplex
  fluorescent PCR and mini-sequencing protocols are described in this study so that
  the procedures can be reproduced.What are the implications of these findings for
  clinical practice and/or further research? Embryo selection can help the family
  suffering from Marfan syndrome for two generations to start a pregnancy with confidence
  that their child will be unaffected. This study also shows the use of a mini-sequencing
  protocol for PGT, which can be a universal protocol for other mutations by changing
  the PCR primers and mini-sequencing primers.
