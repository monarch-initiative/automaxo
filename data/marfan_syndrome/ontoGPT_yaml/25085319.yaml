input_text: "Acute aortic dissection in pregnant women. Acute aortic dissection occurring
  during pregnancy represents a lethal risk to both the mother and fetus. Management
  of parturient with acute aortic dissection is complex. We report our experience
  of two pregnancies with type A acute aortic dissection. One patient is a 31-year-old
  pregnant woman (33rd gestational week) with a bicuspid aortic valve and the other
  is a 32-year-old pregnant woman (30th gestational week) with the Marfan syndrome.
  In both cases, a combined emergency operation consisting of Cesarean section, total
  hysterectomy prior to corrective surgery for aortic dissection was successfully
  performed within a relatively short period of time after the onset. Both patients'
  postoperative recovery was uneventful, and we achieved a favorable maternal and
  fetal outcome. "
