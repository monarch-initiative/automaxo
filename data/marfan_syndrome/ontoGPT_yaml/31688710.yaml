input_text: 'Successful Thrombolysis in the Setting of Marfan Syndrome and Chronic
  Aortic Dissection. INTRODUCTION: Thrombolysis is the standard of care in acute ischemic
  stroke. It is usually contraindicated in patients with aortic dissection. CASE REPORT:
  We report a case of Marfan syndrome and chronic aortic dissection presenting with
  acute ischemic stroke treated with thrombolysis. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this
  is the first case of Marfan syndrome with chronic aortic dissection undergoing thrombolysis
  for acute ischemic stroke with a near-complete recovery of neurological deficit
  and favorable long-term outcome.'
