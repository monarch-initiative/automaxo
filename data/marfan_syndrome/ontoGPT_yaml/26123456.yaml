input_text: 'Left gastric artery aneurysm in Marfan syndrome: a unique case. A 78-year-old
  man presented with abdominal pain, high International Normalised Ratio and rapidly
  falling haemoglobin. He had a background of Marfan syndrome and was on warfarin
  following mechanical aortic valve replacement. Abdominal CT imaging showed haemoperitoneum
  with a leaking aneurysm of the left gastric artery measuring 10 mm in diameter.
  The decision whether to reverse his anticoagulation provided a difficult clinical
  scenario given the risk of thrombosis associated with the mechanical aortic valve.
  The patient went on to have a successful percutaneous embolisation of the aneurysm
  using a metallic coil and Onyx. Left gastric artery aneurysms are rare and have
  a reported mortality of up to 70%. This is the first case of gastric artery aneurysm
  described in a patient with Marfan syndrome.'
