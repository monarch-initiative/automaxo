input_text: Chylous Ascites Developing after Open Thoracoabdominal Aortic Aneurysm
  Repair in a Patient with Marfan Syndrome. Chylous ascites is the pathologic accumulation
  of chylous fluid in the peritoneal cavity, caused by lymphomas, metastatic malignancies,
  and abdominal surgeries, rarely due to surgical trauma of the cisterna chyli or
  its major branches. A 24-year-old man with history of Marfan syndrome presented
  to our hospital with abdominal distention, abdominal pain, fluid in the incision
  region, and weakness. He had underwent an elective open aneurysm repair surgery
  nine days before for thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm. Computed tomography revealed
  massive fluid collection in the abdominal cavity, which was drained surgically.
  He was diagnosed with chylous ascites and was discharged after conservative treatment.
