input_text: 'In-hospital outcomes and long-term survival of women of childbearing
  age with aortic dissection. OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we defined the outcomes
  and effects of pregnancy in a cohort of women of childbearing age with acute aortic
  dissection (AAD). METHODS: We reviewed our database of AAD to identify all eligible
  female patients. Women aged <45 years were included. Data on pregnancy timing with
  respect to the occurrence of dissection, the demographic data, dissection extent,
  dissection treatment, dissection-related outcomes, overall maternal and fetal mortality,
  and genetic testing results were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 62 women aged <45
  years had presented to us with AAD from 1999 to 2017. Of the 62 women, 37 (60%)
  had had a history of pregnancy at AAD. Of these 37 patients, 10 (27%) had had a
  peripartum aortic dissection, defined as dissection during pregnancy or within 12
  months postpartum. Of the 10 AADs, 5 were type A and 5 were type B. Three patients
  had presented with AAD during pregnancy (one in the second and two in the third
  trimester). Five patients (50%) had developed AAD in the immediate postpartum period
  (within 3 months) and two (20%) in the late postpartum period. For the immediate
  postpartum AADs (<3 months), four of the five patients delivered via cesarean section.
  Of these 10 peripartum AADs, 3 (30%) had occurred in patients with known Marfan
  syndrome. In-hospital mortality for those with peripartum AAD was 10% (1 of 10).
  Fetal mortality was 20% (2 of 10). CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of aortic dissection
  in women of childbearing age at our institution was low. However, pregnancy might
  increase the risk of those young women genetically predisposed to dissection events.
  From these data, this risk appears to be greatest in the immediate postpartum period,
  even for those who undergo cesarean section. Close clinical and radiographic surveillance
  is required for all women with suspected aortopathy, especially in the third trimester
  and early postpartum period.'
