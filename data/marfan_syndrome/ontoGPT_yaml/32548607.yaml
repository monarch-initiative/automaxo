input_text: Internal thoracic artery pseudoaneurysm after redo aortic root replacement.
  Pseudoaneurysm of the internal thoracic artery (ITA) or bleeding from the ITA is
  an extremely rare complication after cardiovascular surgery via a median sternotomy.
  Early treatment is needed in the case of massive haemorrhage or a rapidly enlarging
  pseudoaneurysm. Herein, we present a rare case of a delayed large pseudoaneurysm
  of the right ITA in a 49-year-old woman with Marfan syndrome who underwent redo
  aortic root replacement via re-median sternotomy and pacemaker implantation. Diagnostic
  selective angiography revealed the origin of the pseudoaneurysm, and simultaneous
  transcatheter embolisation of the ITA was successfully performed. Follow-up computed
  tomography imaging showed no evidence of contrast media extravasation from the ITA
  and recurrent extra-pleural haemorrhage. Our findings suggest that postoperative
  management of patients who have undergone median sternotomy, including cardiovascular
  surgeries, should also focus on the prevention or early detection of pseudoaneurysm
  of the ITA to avoid life-threatening conditions.
