input_text: 'Pharmacological resources, diagnostic approach and coordination of care
  in joint hypermobility-related disorders. INTRODUCTION: Joint hypermobility (JH)
  is the hallmark of many hereditary soft connective tissue disorders, including Ehlers-Danlos
  syndromes and related disorders, disorders of the TGFbeta-pathway, lateral meningocele
  syndrome, arterial tortuosity syndrome, and cutis laxa syndromes. Contemporary practice
  separates individuals with isolated, non-syndromic JH from patients with Mendelian
  syndromes and those with hypermobility spectrum disorders. The latter is a new nosologic
  entity grouping together individuals with JH and related musculoskeletal manifestations,
  but lacking inclusion criteria for well-defined and/or single-gene disorders. Area
  covered: Nomenclature of JH and JH-related disorders are summarized on a practically
  oriented perspective. Critical areas of clinical management comprise pain; cardiovascular
  and respiratory issues; fatigue and dysautonomia; bone fragility; and capillary,
  skin and soft tissue fragility. Medical management stands on low-evidence data.
  Ongoing preclinical and clinical studies are aimed to reach a more personalized
  pharmacological approach to the management of the cardiovascular risk, musculoskeletal
  pain, and reduced bone mass. Expert commentary: Correct classification of patients
  with JH-related disorders needs a systematic approach, in which a wide array of
  molecular tests should be intermingled with strong clinical competences in highly
  specialized settings. A multispecialty, hierarchical approach should be encouraged
  for optimal coordination of care in systemic phenotypes.'
