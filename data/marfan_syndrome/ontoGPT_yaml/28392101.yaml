input_text: 'Surgical and Endovascular Treatments of Extracranial Carotid Artery Aneurysms-Report
  of Six Cases. BACKGROUND: Although the natural course of extracranial carotid artery
  aneurysms (ECAAs) is still unknown, they may cause stroke or cranial nerve dysfunction
  unless they are treated. In this report, we reviewed the clinical results of 6 patients
  who underwent endovascular and surgical treatments for ECAAs. METHODS: A total of
  6 patients underwent endovascular and surgical treatments for ECAAs for 9 years.
  The primary causes of ECAAs included Marfan syndrome (1 patient), infection (1 patient),
  trauma (2 patients), and unknown (2 patients). All 6 ECAAs were symptomatic. RESULTS:
  One patient underwent surgical resection of the ECAA followed by end-to-end anastomosis
  of the internal carotid artery (ICA). Another patient underwent proximal ICA ligation
  combined with high-flow external carotid artery-to-middle cerebral artery bypass
  using a radial artery graft, because the patient also had a giant thrombosed aneurysm
  in the cavernous portion of the ipsilateral ICA. Endovascular treatment was selected
  in the other 4 patients using a covered stent or a bare metal stent combined with
  coil embolization. Of these patients, one required proximal ICA ligation followed
  by superficial temporal artery-to-middle cerebral artery anastomosis due to an anatomical
  problem for stent placement. There was no neurological deterioration at the discharge
  in all but 1 patient who suffered ischemic stroke during surgery. CONCLUSION: Surgical
  or endovascular treatment yielded a relatively satisfactory outcome in patients
  with ECAAs.'
