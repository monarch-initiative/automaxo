input_text: Recent progress in understanding the natural and clinical histories of
  the Marfan syndrome. Over the past 4 decades, remarkable progress in understanding
  the cause, pathogenesis, and management of the MFS has led to an increase in life
  expectancy to near normal for most patients. Accompanying this increased life span
  has been the emergence of previously rare or unanticipated clinical problems. Despite
  much more detailed knowledge of the molecular, cellular, and tissue effects of a
  mutation in FBN1, targeted, effective therapy remains elusive. Until such precision
  medicine takes hold, management will depend on early diagnosis, regular scrutiny
  by imaging, chronic beta-blockade, and perhaps ARBs, and prophylactic cardiothoracic
  surgery. Without question, MFS will remain a fertile subject for basic, translational,
  and clinical research for the foreseeable future.
