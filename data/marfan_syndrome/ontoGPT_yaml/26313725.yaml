input_text: 'Surgery of the aortic root: should we go for the valve-sparing root reconstruction
  or the composite graft-valve replacement is still the first choice of treatment
  for these patients? OBJECTIVE: To compare the results of the root reconstruction
  with the aortic valve-sparing operation versus composite graft-valve replacement.
  METHODS: From January 2002 to October 2013, 324 patients underwent aortic root reconstruction.
  They were 263 composite graft-valve replacement and 61 aortic valve-sparing operation
  (43 reimplantation and 18 remodeling). Twenty-six percent of the patients were NYHA
  functional class III and IV; 9.6% had Marfan syndrome, and 12% had bicuspid aortic
  valve. There was a predominance of aneurysms over dissections (81% vs. 19%), with
  7% being acute dissections. The complete follow-up of 100% of the patients was performed
  with median follow-up time of 902 days for patients undergoing composite graft-valve
  replacement and 1492 for those undergoing aortic valve-sparing operation. RESULTS:
  In-hospital mortality was 6.7% and 4.9%, respectively for composite graft-valve
  replacement and aortic valve-sparing operation (ns). During the late follow-up period,
  there was 0% moderate and 15.4% severe aortic regurgitation, and NYHA functional
  class I and II were 89.4% and 94%, respectively for composite graft-valve replacement
  and aortic valve-sparing operation (ns). Root reconstruction with aortic valve-sparing
  operation showed lower late mortality (P=0.001) and lower bleeding complications
  (P=0.006). There was no difference for thromboembolism, endocarditis, and need of
  reoperation. CONCLUSION: The aortic root reconstruction with preservation of the
  valve should be the operation being performed for presenting lower late mortality
  and survival free of bleeding events.'
