input_text: Aortic Graft Dehiscence After Valve-Sparing Root Replacement. Postoperative
  pseudoaneurysm of the left ventricular outflow tract is a rare but potentially lethal
  complication in patients after valve-sparing root replacement. This report describes
  a case of postoperative left ventricular outflow tract pseudoaneurysm in a 49-year-old
  woman with Marfan syndrome after valve-sparing aortic root replacement. Four months
  postoperatively, severe dehiscence of the aortic root graft resulted in a retrosternal
  giant pseudoaneurysm. She underwent emergency redo aortic root replacement, and
  the postoperative course was uneventful. Although valve-sparing aortic root replacement
  for aortic root dilatation is widely accepted, we must consider the possibility
  of postoperative pseudoaneurysms in patients with Marfan syndrome.
