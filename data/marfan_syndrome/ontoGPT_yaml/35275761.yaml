input_text: 'D-dimer in Marfan syndrome: effect of obstructive sleep apnea induced
  blood pressure surges. Aortic dissection and rupture are the major causes of premature
  death in persons with Marfan syndrome (MFS), a rare genetic disorder featuring cardiovascular,
  skeletal, and ocular impairments. We and others have found that obstructive sleep
  apnea (OSA) confers significant vascular stress in this population and may accelerate
  aortic disease progression. We hypothesized that D-dimer, a diagnostic biomarker
  for several types of vascular injury that is also elevated in persons with MFS with
  aortic enlargement, may be sensitive to cardiovascular stresses caused by OSA. To
  test this concept, we recruited 16 persons with MFS without aortic dissection and
  randomized them to two nights of polysomnography, without (baseline) and with OSA
  treatment: continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). In addition to scoring OSA
  by the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), beat-by-beat systolic BP (SBP) and pulse-pressure
  (PP) fluctuations were quantified. Morning blood samples were also assayed for D-dimer
  levels. In this cohort (male:female, 10:6; age, 36 +- 13 yr; aortic diameter, 4
  +- 1 cm), CPAP eliminated OSA (AHI: 20 +- 17 vs. 3 +- 2 events/h, P = 0.001) and
  decreased fluctuations in SBP (13 +- 4 vs. 9 +- 3 mmHg, P = 0.011) and PP (7 +-
  2 vs. 5 +- 2 mmHg, P = 0.013). CPAP also reduced D-dimer levels from 1,108 +- 656
  to 882 +- 532 ng/mL (P = 0.023). Linear regression revealed a positive association
  between the maximum PP during OSA and D-dimer in both the unadjusted (r = 0.523,
  P = 0.038) and a model adjusted for contemporaneous aortic root diameter (r = 0.733,
  P = 0.028). Our study revealed that overnight CPAP reduces D-dimer levels commensurate
  with the elimination of OSA and concomitant hemodynamic fluctuations. Morning D-dimer
  measurements together with OSA screening might serve as predictors of vascular injury
  in MFS.NEW & NOTEWORTHY What is New? Surges in blood pressure caused by obstructive
  sleep apnea during sleep increase vascular stress and D-dimer levels in Marfan syndrome.
  Elevations in D-dimer can be lowered with CPAP. What is Noteworthy? D-dimer levels
  might serve as a marker for determining the significance of obstructive sleep apnea
  in persons with Marfan syndrome. D-dimer or obstructive sleep apnea screening is
  a potential method to identify persons with Marfan syndrome at risk for adverse
  cardiovascular events.'
