input_text: 'Pelvic pain from a giant presacral Tarlov cyst successfully obliterated
  using aneurysm clips in a patient with Marfan syndrome. Patients with Marfan syndrome
  used to succumb early in life from cardiovascular complications. With the current
  rapid advance in medical and surgical care, such patients may now have near-normal
  longevities. Consequently, rare late-life complications are emerging in these patients
  and represent challenges to clinicians for their diagnoses and treatments. The authors
  report a rare case of pelvic pain and genital prolapse from a giant presacral Tarlov
  cyst in a 67-year-old patient with Marfan syndrome. This 67-year-old Caucasian female
  presented with progressively severe pelvic pain, intermittent explosive diarrhea,
  and dysuria. Physical and bimanual examination demonstrated genital prolapse and
  a nontender, cyst-like mass fixed in the midline. She underwent ultrasound, CT,
  and eventually MRI evaluations that led to the diagnosis of a giant (6.7 x 6.4 x
  6.6 cm) Tarlov cyst originating from the right S-2 nerve root sleeve/sacral foramen
  with intrapelvic extension. She underwent S1-S2 and S2-S3 laminectomy with obliteration
  of the Tarlov cyst using aneurysm clips. Postoperatively, her pelvic pain and bowel
  symptoms resolved and the bladder symptoms improved. The 3-month follow-up CT of
  abdomen/pelvis demonstrated resolution of the cyst. The present case illustrates
  that clinicians caring for elderly patients with Marfan syndrome need to increasingly
  recognize such unusual late-life complications. Also, these large Tarlov cysts can
  be simply and effectively obliterated with aneurysm clips. '
