input_text: 'Anti-TGFbeta (Transforming Growth Factor beta) Therapy With Betaglycan-Derived
  P144 Peptide Gene Delivery Prevents the Formation of Aortic Aneurysm in a Mouse
  Model of Marfan Syndrome. Objective: We investigated the effect of a potent TGFbeta
  (transforming growth factor beta) inhibitor peptide (P144) from the betaglycan/TGFbeta
  receptor III on aortic aneurysm development in a Marfan syndrome mouse model. Approach
  and Results: We used a chimeric gene encoding the P144 peptide linked to apolipoprotein
  A-I via a flexible linker expressed by a hepatotropic adeno-associated vector. Two
  experimental approaches were performed: (1) a preventive treatment where the vector
  was injected before the onset of the aortic aneurysm (aged 4 weeks) and followed-up
  for 4 and 20 weeks and (2) a palliative treatment where the vector was injected
  once the aneurysm was formed (8 weeks old) and followed-up for 16 weeks. We evaluated
  the aortic root diameter by echocardiography, the aortic wall architecture and TGFbeta
  signaling downstream effector expression of pSMAD2 and pERK1/2 by immunohistomorphometry,
  and Tgfbeta1 and Tgfbeta2 mRNA expression levels by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
  Marfan syndrome mice subjected to the preventive approach showed no aortic dilation
  in contrast to untreated Marfan syndrome mice, which at the same end point age already
  presented the aneurysm. In contrast, the palliative treatment with P144 did not
  halt aneurysm progression. In all cases, P144 improved elastic fiber morphology
  and normalized pERK1/2-mediated TGFbeta signaling. Unlike the palliative treatment,
  the preventive treatment reduced Tgfbeta1 and Tgfbeta2 mRNA levels. Conclusions:
  P144 prevents the onset of aortic aneurysm but not its progression. Results indicate
  the importance of reducing the excess of active TGFbeta signaling during the early
  stages of aortic disease progression.'
