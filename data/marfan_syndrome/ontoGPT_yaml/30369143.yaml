input_text: '[Surgical correction of contractural arachnodactyly deformity of a child
  with Marfan syndrome]. A Marfan syndrome child with contractural arachnodactyly
  deformity of both hands was admitted to our unit in June 2015. The left and right
  middle fingers and ring fingers of the child received the continuous " Z" skin flap
  and " V-Y" plasty to reduce the palmar tension on the skin and release the contracture.
  Due to the improper therapeutic strategy and the underestimation of effect of underlying
  lesions of Marfan syndrome on the therapeutic strategy, the right middle finger
  of child was with ischemic necrosis and amputated, and the finger tip was accompanied
  with distension and paroxysmal neuropathic pain at a specified future date. The
  skin flaps of the other three surgical fingers were with local necrosis and scar
  healing. The child was complicated by distal interphalangeal joints stiffness and
  some serious complications post-discharge. Combined with this case, the similar
  disorders are not recommended to carry out one-stage operation.'
