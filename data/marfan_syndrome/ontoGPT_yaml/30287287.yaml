input_text: 'Aortic Surgery Outcomes of Marfan Syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome
  Patients at Teaching and Nonteaching Hospitals. BACKGROUND: Despite improvements
  in prevention and management, aortic aneurysm repair remains a high-risk operation
  for patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). The goal
  of this study was to examine differences in characteristics and outcomes of patients
  with MFS or EDS undergoing aortic aneurysm repair at teaching versus nonteaching
  hospitals. METHODS: We used the National Inpatient Sample to study patients with
  MFS or EDS undergoing open or endovascular aortic aneurysm repair from 2000 to 2014.
  RESULTS: Of 3487 patients (MFS = 3375, EDS = 112), 2974 (85%) had repair at a teaching
  hospital. Patients who underwent repair at a teaching hospital were slightly younger
  than those who underwent repair at a nonteaching hospital (38 vs. 43 years, P <
  0.01) but otherwise were similar in gender (29% vs. 28% female), race (70% vs. 78%
  white), and connective tissue disorder diagnosis (97% vs. 97% MFS, all P >= 0.1).
  There were no differences in anatomy (17% vs. 19% abdominal, 67% vs. 66% thoracic,
  and 15% vs. 15% thoracoabdominal, all P >= 0.1) or type of repair (5% vs. 5% endovascular),
  but patients at nonteaching hospitals were more likely to have a dissection (49%
  vs. 38%, P = 0.02). There was no difference in perioperative mortality (4% vs. 6%,
  P = 0.5) or length of stay (median 8 days vs. 7 days, P = 0.3) between teaching
  and nonteaching hospitals. There was also no difference in hemorrhagic (47% vs.
  43%), pulmonary (9% vs. 16%), renal (12% vs. 14%), or neurologic (5% vs. 6%) complications
  between teaching and nonteaching hospitals, respectively (all P >= 0.05). In analysis
  stratified by anatomic extent of repair, there was a lower prevalence of pulmonary
  complications in thoracic aorta repairs at teaching hospitals (8.1% vs. 18.4%, P
  = 0.01) but a higher prevalence of hemorrhage in abdominal aortic repairs at teaching
  hospitals (45.6% vs. 20.6%, P = 0.04) as compared with nonteaching hospitals. CONCLUSIONS:
  Patients with MFS and EDS who undergo aortic aneurysm repair have their operations
  predominantly at teaching hospitals, but those patients who undergo repair at nonteaching
  hospitals do not have worse mortality or morbidity despite a higher incidence of
  dissection.'
