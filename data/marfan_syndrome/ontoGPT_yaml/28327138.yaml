input_text: 'Accuracy of pedicle screw placement in patients with Marfan syndrome.
  BACKGROUND: There is no study concerning safety and accuracy of pedicle screw placement
  in Marfan syndrome. The objective of this study is to investigate accuracy and safety
  of pedicle screw placement in scoliosis associated with Marfan syndrome. METHODS:
  CT scanning was performed to analyze accuracy of pedicle screw placement. Pedicle
  perforations were classified as medial, lateral or anterior and categorized to four
  grades: <= 2 mm as Grade 1, 2.1-4.0 mm as Grade 2, 4.1-6.0 mm as Grade 3, >=6.1
  mm as Grade 4. Fully contained screws or with medial wall perforation <= 2 mm or
  with lateral wall perforation <= 6 mm and without injury of visceral organs were
  considered acceptable, otherwise were unacceptable. RESULTS: 976 pedicle screws
  were placed, 713 screws (73.1%) were fully contained within the cortical boundaries
  of the pedicle. 924 (94.7%) screws were considered as acceptable, and 52 (5.3%)
  as unacceptable. The perforation rate was higher using free-hand technique than
  O-arm navigation technique (30.8% VS. 11.4%, P < 0.05), higher in lumbar region
  than in thoracic region (34.1% VS. 22.3%, P < 0.05) and higher in concave side than
  in convex side (33.5% VS. 21.9%, P < 0.05). No injury of visceral organs especially
  aorta erosion was noted in the series. 7 cases of dural tear caused by misplaced
  screws occurred, and 4 cases developed cerebro-spinal fluid leak. Drainage and pressure
  dressings were applied for these patients, and no infection was observed. Leg pain
  was observed in 7 cases, and 2 cases simultaneously complained of leg weakness.
  Revision surgery was conducted to remove the misplaced screws for these 2 patients.
  Conservative treatment was applied for the 5 patients without leg weakness. Symptoms
  of leg weakness and pain resolved in all patients. CONCLUSION: Placement of pedicle
  screw in Marfan syndrome is accuracy and safe. O-arm navigation was an effective
  modality to ensure the safety and accuracy of screw placement. Special attention
  should be paid when screws were placed at the lumber spine and the concave side
  of spine deformity to avoid the higher rate of complications.'
