input_text: 'Lateral Position for Cesarean Delivery Because of Severe Aortocaval Compression
  in a Patient With Marfan Syndrome: A Case Report. Prompt recognition and management
  of hypotension resulting from aortocaval compression syndrome are essential to optimize
  the maternal and fetal outcomes. Management involves increasing leftward uterine
  displacement and sometimes full lateral positioning, although lateral position during
  cesarean delivery is typically considered to be impractical. We report an obstetric
  patient case of severe aortocaval compression syndrome resulting in hypotension
  and loss of consciousness that ultimately underwent cesarean delivery under general
  anesthesia in the lateral position. Performing cesarean delivery in the lateral
  position is virtually unreported, and this unique strategy prevented further symptoms
  of aortocaval compression and enabled safe delivery.'
