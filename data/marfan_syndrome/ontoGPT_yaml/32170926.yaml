input_text: Macrophage lineages in heart valve development and disease. Heterogeneous
  macrophage lineages are present in the aortic and mitral valves of the heart during
  development and disease. These populations include resident macrophages of embryonic
  origins and recruited monocyte-derived macrophages prevalent in disease. Soon after
  birth, macrophages from haematopoietic lineages are recruited to the heart valves,
  and bone marrow transplantation studies in mice demonstrate that haematopoietic-derived
  macrophages continue to invest adult valves. During myxomatous heart valve disease,
  monocyte-derived macrophages are recruited to the heart valves and they contribute
  to valve degeneration in a mouse model of Marfan syndrome. Here, we review recent
  studies of macrophage lineages in heart valve development and disease with discussion
  of clinical significance and therapeutic applications.
