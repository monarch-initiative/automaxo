input_text: 'Bimanual irrigation-aspiration for ectopia lentis and use of a small
  incision for 4-point scleral-sutured foldable intraocular lens and anterior vitrectomy
  in patients with Marfan syndrome. Purpose: This study evaluated bimanual intracapsular
  irrigation-aspiration for ectopia lentis with use of a small incision for 4-point
  scleral fixation of a foldable posterior-chamber intraocular lens (IOL) and anterior
  vitrectomy in patients with Marfan syndrome. Methods: We performed a retrospective
  study of 18 eyes from 10 patients with Marfan syndrome who underwent surgical intervention
  for ectopia lentis at our clinic between July 2012 and September 2018. In this study,
  intraoperative and postoperative complications, uncorrected visual acuity, best-corrected
  visual acuity, spherical equivalent, intraocular pressure, and endothelial cell
  density were evaluated. Results: No intraoperative complications were reported.
  In all cases, early postoperative evaluation revealed a clear cornea, round pupil,
  and well-centered IOL. Mean logMAR uncorrected visual acuity improved from 1.09
  preoperatively to 0.56 postoperatively (P < 0.05). Mean logMAR best-corrected visual
  acuity improved from 0.45 preoperatively to 0.17 postoperatively (P < 0.05). Aside
  from transient ocular hypertension, no postoperative complications were reported.
  Conclusion: The combined surgical technique presented above yields excellent visual
  outcomes with an extremely low incidence of complications. This approach is simple,
  safe, and effective in the treatment of ectopia lentis in patients with Marfan syndrome.'
