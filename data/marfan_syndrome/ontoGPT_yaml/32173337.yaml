input_text: Emergency Ravitch Procedure for Inferior Vena Cava Compression After Surgical
  Scoliosis Correction. Pectus excavatum is a common chest malformation, classically
  asymptomatic. The pectus excavatum surgical procedure allows aesthetic correction.
  Funnel chest is a malformation frequently associated with thoracic scoliosis, especially
  in Marfan syndrome. Scoliosis is treated with first-line nonsurgical treatment.
  Second-line treatment consists of a scoliosis operation. In this case report, we
  present an exceptional emergency indication of funnel chest correction with the
  Ravitch procedure for a 14-year-old girl who presented with postoperative acute
  compression of the inferior vena cava due to a surgical scoliosis correction.
