input_text: 'Cardiac resynchronization therapy in adults with congenital heart disease.
  Aims: In adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) heart failure is one of the
  leading causes of morbidity and mortality but experience with and reported outcome
  of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is limited. We investigated the efficacy
  of CRT in adults with CHD. Methods and results: This was a retrospective study including
  48 adults with CHD who received CRT since 2003 in four tertiary referral centres.
  Responders were defined as patients who showed improvement in NYHA functional class
  and/or systemic ventricular ejection fraction by at least one category. Ventricular
  function was assessed by echocardiography and graded on a four point ordinal scale.
  Median age at CRT was 47 years (range 18-74 years) and 77% was male. Cardiac diagnosis
  included tetralogy of Fallot in 29%, (congenitally corrected) transposition of great
  arteries in 23%, septal defects in 25%, left sided lesions in 21%, and Marfan syndrome
  in 2% of the patients. The median follow-up duration after CRT was 2.6 years (range
  0.1-8.8). Overall, 37 out of 48 patients (77%) responded to CRT either by improvement
  of NYHA functional class and/or systemic ventricular function. There were 11 non-responders
  to CRT. Of these, three patients died and four underwent heart transplantation.
  Conclusion: In this cohort of older CHD patients, CRT was accomplished with a success
  rate comparable to those with acquired heart disease despite the complex anatomy
  and technical challenges frequently encountered in this population. Further studies
  are needed to establish appropriate guidelines for patient selection and long term
  outcome.'
