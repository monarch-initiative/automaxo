input_text: '[S2-Guideline: Pediatric Flat Foot]. In pediatric flat foot a differentiation
  has to be made between the flexible and the rigid form. The diagnosis is based on
  the history, clinical examination as well as pedobarography, gait analysis and imaging
  techniques. It is important to rule out neuropediatric conditions such as muscular
  dystrophies, Ehlers-Danlos- or Marfan syndrome. In children six years of age and
  younger a flexible flat foot is nearly always physiological (97% of all 19 months
  old children). Up to the age of ten years the medial column of the foot is developing.
  Only a minority of children (4% in ten year olds) has a persistent or progressive
  deformity. Beyond to age of ten there is a danger of deformity decompensation as
  well as an increased rigidity. Only a minority of children develops some pain (<
  2%). A clear risk factor for persistent pediatric flat foot is obesity (62% of six
  year old children with flat foot are obese). Pathogenetic factors include muscular,
  bony or soft tissue conditions. However, there specific rule is still unclear. Prevention
  consists in a thorough parent information about the normal development as well as
  encouragement of regular sportive activities. Soft and large enough shoes should
  be carried as a protection. Barfoot walking has to be encouraged on uneven grounds.
  If physiotherapy is needed different methods can be applied. Orthosis treatment
  should include a proprioceptive approach. Surgical interventions in children are
  rare. If surgical treatment is planned a detailed algorhythm should be used before
  utilizing one of the many different surgical methods.'
