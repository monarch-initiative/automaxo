input_text: 'Outcomes for Treatment of Capsulolabral Adhesions With a Capsular Spacer
  During Revision Hip Arthroscopy. BACKGROUND: The presence of adhesions is a common
  source of pain and dysfunction after hip arthroscopic surgery and an indication
  for revision surgery. The placement of a capsular spacer in the capsulolabral recess
  after lysis of adhesions has been developed to treat and prevent the recurrence
  of adhesions. PURPOSE: To evaluate patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and survivorship
  at a minimum of 2 years after revision hip arthroscopic surgery with capsular spacer
  placement for capsular adhesions. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence,
  4. METHODS: Between January 2013 and June 2018, a total of 95 patients (99 hips)
  aged >=18 years underwent revision hip arthroscopic surgery for the treatment of
  capsular adhesions with the placement of a capsular spacer. Overall, 53 patients
  (56 hips) met the inclusion criteria and had a minimum 2-year follow-up, forming
  the cohort of this study. Exclusion criteria included confounding metabolic bone
  diseases (eg, Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, Marfan syndrome), labral deficiency, or
  advanced osteoarthritis (Tonnis grade 2 or 3). Preoperative and postoperative outcome
  scores (modified Harris Hip Score [mHHS], Hip Outcome Score-Activities of Daily
  Living [HOS-ADL], Hip Outcome Score-Sport-Specific Subscale [HOS-SSS], 12-Item Short
  Form Health Survey [SF-12], and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis
  Index [WOMAC]) were collected and compared in addition to the revision rate, conversion
  to total hip arthroplasty, and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: The mean age of the
  cohort was 32 +- 11 years, with 32 female hips (57%) and a median number of previous
  hip arthroscopic procedures of 1 (range, 1-5). The arthroplasty- and revision-free
  survivorship rate at 2 years was 91%. Overall, 5 patients (6 hips; 11%) underwent
  revision surgery at a mean of 2.4 +- 1.4 years after capsular spacer placement,
  with symptomatic capsular defects being the most common finding. There were 4 patients
  (7%) who converted to total hip arthroplasty. For hips not requiring subsequent
  surgery (n = 46), there was a significant improvement in outcome scores except for
  the SF-12 Mental Component Summary, with rates of achieving the minimal clinically
  important difference of 70%, 70%, and 65% for the mHHS, HOS-ADL, and HOS-SSS, respectively.
  CONCLUSION: Capsular spacers, as part of a systematic approach including lysis of
  adhesions with early and consistent postoperative physical therapy including circumduction
  exercises, resulted in improved PROs as well as high arthroplasty- and revision-free
  survivorship (91%) at a minimum 2-year follow-up. Capsular spacers should be considered
  in revision hip arthroscopic procedures when an adequate labral volume remains but
  adhesions continue to be a concern.'
