input_text: 'Growth-friendly Spinal Instrumentation in Marfan Syndrome Achieves Sustained
  Gains in Thoracic Height Amidst High Rates of Implant Failure. BACKGROUND: There
  are few reports on the surgical management of early-onset scoliosis (EOS) associated
  with Marfan syndrome (MFS). Affected patients tend to have more rapid curve progression
  than those with idiopathic EOS, and their course is further complicated by medical
  comorbidities. As surgical techniques and implants for growing spines become more
  widely applied, this study seeks to better delineate the safety and efficacy of
  growth-friendly spinal instrumentation in treating this population. METHODS: A prospective
  registry of children treated for EOS was queried for MFS patients treated between
  1996 and 2016. Forty-two patients underwent rib-based or spine-based growing instrumentation
  and were assessed on preoperative, surgical, and postoperative clinical and radiographic
  parameters including complications and reoperations. Subgroup analysis was performed
  based on spine-based versus rib-based fixation. RESULTS: Patients underwent their
  index surgery at a mean age of 5.5 years, when the major coronal curve and kyphosis
  measured 77 and 50 degrees, respectively. Over half were treated with traditional
  growing rods. Patients underwent 7.2 total surgical procedures-4.7 lengthening and
  1.9 revision surgeries not including conversion to fusion-over a follow-up of 6.5
  (+-4.1) years. Radiographic correction was greatest at index surgery but maintained
  over time, with a final thoracic height measuring 23.8 cm. Patients experienced
  a mean of 2.6 complications over the course of the study period; however, a small
  group of 6 patients experienced >=6 complications while over half of patients experienced
  0 or 1. Implant failures represented 42% of all complications with infection and
  pulmonary complications following. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest report on patients
  with EOS and MFS. All subtypes of growth-friendly constructs reduced curve progression
  in this cohort, but complications and reoperations were nearly universal; patients
  were particularly plagued by implant failure and migration. Further collaborations
  are needed to enhance understanding of optimal timing and fixation constructs for
  those with MFS and other connective tissue diseases.'
