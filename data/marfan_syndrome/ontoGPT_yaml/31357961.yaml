input_text: "Marfan syndrome in childhood: parents' perspectives of the impact on
  daily functioning of children, parents and family; a qualitative study. BACKGROUND:
  Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a heritable connective tissue disease caused by a defect
  in FBN1. The diagnosis is based on the revised Ghent criteria. The main features
  involve the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, ophthalmic, pulmonary systems and facial
  features. Although the clinical manifestations of MFS in children are thoroughly
  addressed in several studies, literature on the impact of MFS on daily functioning
  is restricted to pediatric advice on sports and leisure participation. Therefore,
  the full impact of MFS on daily functioning remains unclear. The aim of this qualitative
  study was to explore parents' perspectives on the impact of MFS on daily functioning
  of children with MFS aged 4-12 years, themselves and family regarding functional
  performance, activities, participation, personal and environmental factors, and
  disease burden. METHODS: In this qualitative study parents participated in individual
  semi-structured interviews (n = 10) and 3 focus groups (n = 5, n = 5 and n = 6).
  Meetings were transcribed, and data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Meaningful
  concepts were coded, and concepts concerning children with MFS were linked to the
  International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health for Children
  and Youth. Thereafter themes were identified and interpreted. RESULTS: Parents reported
  their children could not keep up with peers because of fatigue, pain and physical
  impairments. Children experienced participation restrictions in school, sports,
  play and other leisure activities. Parents reported their child as being different
  due to physical appearance, which provoked unsupportive attitudes. Parental burden
  was caused by high care needs, lack of support, a limited social life, and concerns
  about the child's development. Family burden was caused by adjusted and complex
  family schedules, other family members with MFS, and reproductive planning decision-making,
  whereas family cohesiveness and caring were positively perceived factors. CONCLUSIONS:
  Parents perceived a large impact of MFS on daily functioning of their children with
  MFS, themselves and their family. More awareness among all professionals involved
  in the care of children with MFS and their families is needed so that professionals
  can address their support needs and provide tailored interventions, rehabilitation
  and/or educational programs to empower and improve daily functioning of the children,
  parents and family."
