input_text: '[Spontaneous intracranial hypotension and Marfan syndrome]. Spontaneous
  intracranial hypotension is the most common complication in patients undergoing
  a lumbar puncture. A much rarer entity is headaches attributed to spontaneous (or
  idiopathic) low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure but the combination with a connective
  tissue disorder is even rarer. The first case of a patient with spontaneous intracranial
  hypotension and genetically established Marfan syndrome was published in 1995. This
  article describes the cases of two female patients who presented with postural headache.
  Magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple leakages of CSF and both patients had
  a genetically confirmed diagnosis of Marfan syndrome. The initial symptomatic treatment
  did not result in a significant relief of the headaches. Epidural blood patching
  was performed and the intervention was successful in both patients. Finally, the
  most important epidemiological, diagnostic and pathophysiological aspects are demonstrated
  and the therapeutic procedures are presented. '
