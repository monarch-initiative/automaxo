input_text: Aortic dissection during pregnancy - obstetric perspective. The risk of
  vascular events during pregnancy is substantially increased. Beyond comparatively
  frequent vascular diseases, pregnancy may lead also to the development of exceptionally
  rare vascular events such as the aortic dissection and aortic rupture which are
  conceivably endangering life conditions. Women with the connective tissue disorders
  and with a family history of the aorta diseases are especially prone to the aortic
  complications which may also develop in the absence of these risk factors due to
  the pregnancy-induced structural changes of the aortic wall. The preconception counselling
  is vital for patients with aortopathies to assess the risk of the aortic dissection
  and to establish the most appropriate care plan including the surgical intervention.
  This review presents the management guidelines in patients with the aortic dissection
  risk during pregnancy.
