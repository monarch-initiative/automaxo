input_text: 'Genotype-Phenotype Correlation in Children: The Impact of FBN1 Variants
  on Pediatric Marfan Care. Currently, no reliable genotype-phenotype correlation
  is available for pediatric Marfan patients in everyday clinical practice. We investigated
  correlations of FBN1 variants with the prevalence and age of onset of Marfan manifestations
  in childhood and differentiated three groups: missense/in-frame, splice, and nonsense/frameshift
  variants. In addition, we differentiated missense variants destroying or generating
  a cysteine (cys-missense) and alterations not affecting cysteine. We categorized
  105 FBN1-positive pediatric patients. Patients with cys-missense more frequently
  developed aortic dilatation (p = 0.03) requiring medication (p = 0.003), tricuspid
  valve prolapse (p = 0.03), and earlier onset of myopia (p = 0.02) than those with
  other missense variants. Missense variants correlated with a higher prevalence of
  ectopia lentis (p = 0.002) and earlier onset of pulmonary artery dilatation (p =
  0.03) than nonsense/frameshift, and dural ectasia was more common in the latter
  (p = 0.005). Pectus excavatum (p = 0.007) appeared more often in patients with splice
  compared with missense/in-frame variants, while hernia (p = 0.04) appeared earlier
  in the latter. Findings on genotype-phenotype correlations in Marfan-affected children
  can improve interdisciplinary therapy. In patients with cys-missense variants, early
  medical treatment of aortic dilatation seems reasonable and early regular ophthalmologic
  follow-up essential. Patients with nonsense/frameshift and splice variants require
  early involvement of orthopedic specialists to support the growing child.'
