input_text: 'Risk Factors for Late Aortic Valve Dysfunction After the David V Valve-Sparing
  Root Replacement. BACKGROUND: Valve-sparing root replacement (VSRR) is an established
  therapy for aortic root pathology. However, late aortic valve dysfunction requiring
  reoperation remains a primary concern of this procedure. This study examines risk
  factors for late aortic insufficiency (AI) and aortic stenosis (AS) after David
  V VSRR. METHODS: A retrospective review from 2005 to 2015 at a US academic center
  identified 282 patients who underwent VSRR. Cox proportional hazards regression
  analysis was used to identify risk factors for late AI and AS after VSRR. RESULTS:
  The mean age was 46.4 years. Sixty-four patients (22.7%) had bicuspid valves, and
  41 patients (14.5%) had Marfan syndrome. The incidence of reoperations was 27 (9.6%),
  and 42 cases (14.9%) presented with acute type A dissection. Operative mortality
  was 8 (2.8%). Seven-year survival was 90.9%. Seven-year cumulative incidence of
  reoperation, greater than 2+ AI and greater than moderate AS were 3.1%, 2.2%, and
  0.8%, respectively. Multivariable analysis showed aortic root size 55 mm or larger
  (hazard ratio 3.44, 95% confidence interval: 1.27 to 9.29, p = 0.01) to be a risk
  factor for late AI whereas bicuspid valve (hazard ratio 16.07, 95% confidence interval:
  3.12 to 82.68, p = 0.001) and cusp repair were found to be risk factors (hazard
  ratio 5.91, 95% confidence interval: 1.17 to 29.86, p = 0.03) for late AS. CONCLUSIONS:
  Valve-sparing root replacement can be performed with low operative risk and good
  overall long-term survival even in complex clinical settings. Durable valve function
  can be expected; however, aortic root size 55 cm or more, bicuspid valve anatomy,
  and cusp repair represent independent risk factors for late aortic valve dysfunction
  after these procedures.'
