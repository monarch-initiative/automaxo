input_text: 'Precise Therapy for Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm in Marfan Syndrome: A Puzzle
  Nearing Its Solution. Marfan Syndrome (MFS) is a rare connective tissue disorder,
  resulting from mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene, characterized by pathologic phenotypes
  in multiple organs, the most detrimental of which affects the thoracic aorta. Indeed,
  thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA), leading to acute dissection and rupture, are today
  the major cause of morbidity and mortality in adult MFS patients. Therefore, there
  is a compelling need for novel therapeutic strategies to delay TAA progression and
  counteract aortic dissection occurrence. Unfortunately, the wide phenotypic variability
  of MFS patients, together with the lack of a complete genotype-phenotype correlation,
  have represented until now a barrier hampering the conduction of translational studies
  aimed to predict disease prognosis and drug discovery. In this review, we will illustrate
  available therapeutic strategies to improve the health of MFS patients. Starting
  from gold standard surgical overtures and the description of the main pharmacological
  approaches, we will comprehensively review the state-of-the-art of in vivo MFS models
  and discuss recent clinical pharmacogenetic results. Finally, we will focus on induced
  pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) as a technology that, if integrated with preclinical
  research and pharmacogenetics, could contribute in determining the best therapeutic
  approach for each MFS patient on the base of individual differences. Finally, we
  will suggest the integration of preclinical studies, pharmacogenetics and iPSC technology
  as the most likely strategy to help solve the composite puzzle of precise medicine
  in this condition.'
