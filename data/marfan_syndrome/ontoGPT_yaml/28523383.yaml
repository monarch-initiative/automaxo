input_text: 'Anterior sacral meningocele presenting as intracystic bleeding. PURPOSE:
  To report a case of anterior sacral meningocele with intralesional bleeding secondary
  to sacrococcygeal trauma. Likewise, there is a discussion about the physiopathology
  and the surgical approach to these types of lesions. METHODS: A 43-year-old man
  diagnosed with Marfan syndrome suffered sacrococcygeal trauma. He was admitted to
  the emergency room due to symptoms of headache, nausea, and lower limb subjective
  weakness. CT and MRI showed a large retroperitoneal mass with hemorrhagic content
  close to the sacrum. Likewise, the MRI showed an image compatible with subarachnoid
  hemorrhage in the thoracic spinal area, cerebral convexity, and the basal cisterns.
  The patient went into surgery for an anterior abdominal approach in the midline
  to reduce the content of the lesion, and subsequently, in the same act, a posterior
  approach was done with an S1-S2 laminectomy and obliteration of the pedicle. Postoperative
  MRI 5 months later showed resolution of the ASM. RESULTS: Anterior sacral meningocele
  is characterized by herniation of the dura mater and the arachnoid mater outside
  the spinal canal through a defect of the sacrum. We add the risk of bleeding after
  trauma-never seen in the literature-as one of the possible inherent complications
  of this lesion. CONCLUSIONS: This report highlights a complication never seen in
  the literature of a relatively rare condition. In our case, the combined approach
  was effective for both clinical control and lesion regression.'
