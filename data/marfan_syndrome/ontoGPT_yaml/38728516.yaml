input_text: 'Acute ischemic stroke with a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome: A report of
  3 cases in multifaceted settings. RATIONALE: Marfan syndrome (MFS), which is a dominantly
  inherited connective tissue disease resulting from a mutation in the FBN1 gene,
  exhibits variable manifestations affecting the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal,
  ophthalmologic, and pulmonary systems. Notably, neurologic deficiency, which involves
  ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, is a rare but severe manifestation. The safety of
  rt-PA treatment for ischemic stroke caused by MFS is still under discussion. PATIENT
  CONCERNS: In the current report, we discuss 3 atypical MFS cases presented as acute
  ischemic stroke, compared to those exhibiting cardiovascular and musculoskeletal
  abnormalities. DIAGNOSES: Three patients were diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke
  accompanied by MFS based on clinical manifestations, imaging examinations, and genetic
  testings. INTERVENTIONS: The first case underwent intravenous thrombolytic therapy
  with rt-PA, the second case received antiplatelet therapy, and the third case received
  anticoagulant therapy and perfusion therapy. OUTCOMES: The neurologic deficiency
  of all three patients showed improvement upon discharge, and there were no symptoms
  of recurrence observed during the follow-up period. LESSONS SUBSECTIONS: MFS is
  a rare etiology in young people with embolic stroke of undetermined source. Physicians
  should take MFS into consideration when they observe the characteristic symptoms
  during a consultation. The potential pathogenesis of ischemic stroke secondary to
  MFS may include cardio-embolism, arterial dissection, and hypoperfusion. Although
  intravenous thrombolysis is a promising therapy to treat acute ischemic stroke,
  further examinations should be conducted to rule out contraindications in patients
  with a suspicion of MFS.'
