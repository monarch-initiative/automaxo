input_text: Correction of the Marfan Syndrome Pathogenic FBN1 Mutation by Base Editing
  in Human Cells and Heterozygous Embryos. There are urgent demands for efficient
  treatment of heritable genetic diseases. The base editing technology has displayed
  its efficiency and precision in base substitution in human embryos, providing a
  potential early-stage treatment for genetic diseases. Taking advantage of this technology,
  we corrected a Marfan syndrome pathogenic mutation, FBN1T7498C. We first tested
  the feasibility in mutant cells, then successfully achieved genetic correction in
  heterozygous human embryos. The results showed that the BE3 mediated perfect correction
  at the efficiency of about 89%. Importantly, no off-target and indels were detected
  in any tested sites in samples by high-throughput deep sequencing combined with
  whole-genome sequencing analysis. Our study therefore suggests the efficiency and
  genetic safety of correcting a Marfan syndrome (MFS) pathogenic mutation in embryos
  by base editing.
