input_text: 'Progressive double major scoliotic curve with concurrent lumbosacral
  spondylolisthesis in a skeletally immature patient with Marfan syndrome treated
  with anterior scoliosis correction. STUDY DESIGN: Case report (review of patient
  records, imaging, and pulmonary function tests) and literature review. OBJECTIVES:
  To describe the case of a skeletally immature patient with Marfan syndrome who underwent
  anterior scoliosis correction (ASC) and muscle-sparing posterior far lateral interbody
  fusion (FLIF) in a two-stage procedure to correct progressive severe double major
  scoliosis and spondylolisthesis. Patients with Marfan syndrome suffer from rapidly
  progressive scoliosis and spondylolisthesis. Operative treatment has typically been
  limited to PSF, but newer techniques may be less invasive and provide more spine
  motion. METHODS: A 12-year-old girl with Marfan syndrome, spondylolisthesis, and
  severe progressive scoliosis underwent a two-stage procedure to achieve correction.
  Muscle-sparing posterior FLIF of the spondylolisthesis from L4-S1 was initially
  performed, followed 1 week later by ASC from right T4-T11 and left T11-L3 using
  an anterior screw/cord construct. RESULTS: Follow-up from the index procedures for
  the spondylolisthesis and scoliosis is 35 months. No significant complications occurred
  in perioperative and postoperative follow-up periods. At the 13-month follow-up,
  the double major scoliosis showed continued curve correction via growth modulation
  and overcorrection of the lumbar to - 13 . A revision lengthening procedure of the
  anterior cord from T11-L3 was performed. An asymptomatic elevated hemidiaphragm
  was discovered at 6 weeks postoperation, which was believed to be secondary to retraction
  neuropraxia and subsequently improved. At 21 months postlengthening and 35 months
  postindex procedure, she is skeletally mature and the curves have maintained correction
  in both the coronal and sagittal planes without any further complications. CONCLUSIONS:
  Anterior scoliosis correction of both a thoracic and lumbar curve combined with
  an L4-S1 PSF was effective for this patient and may be promising for patients with
  Marfan syndrome, progressive scoliosis, and spondylolisthesis. Overcorrection can
  be planned for and easily corrected by inserting a new cord of a different length.'
