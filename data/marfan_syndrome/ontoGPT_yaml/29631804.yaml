input_text: Influence of Aortic Stiffness on Aortic-Root Growth Rate and Outcome in
  Patients With the Marfan Syndrome. The Pediatric Heart Network randomized trial
  of atenolol versus losartan in the Marfan syndrome showed no treatment differences
  in the rates of aortic-root growth or clinical outcomes. In this report we present
  treatment effects on aortic stiffness and determine whether baseline aortic stiffness
  predicts aortic-root growth and clinical outcomes. Echocardiograms at 0, 6, 12,
  24, and 36 months from 608 subjects (6 months to 25 years) who met original Ghent
  criteria and had a maximum aortic-root z-score (ARz) >3 were centrally reviewed.
  Stiffness index (SI) and elastic modulus (EM) were calculated for aortic root and
  ascending aorta. Data were analyzed using multivariable mixed effects modeling and
  Cox regression. Heart rate-corrected aortic-root SI over 3 years decreased with
  atenolol but did not change with losartan (-0.298 +- 0.139 vs 0.141 +- 0.139/year,
  p = 0.01). In the entire cohort, above-median aortic-root SI (>9.1) and EM (>618
  mm Hg) predicted a smaller annual decrease in ARz (p <=0.001). Upper-quartile aortic-root
  EM (>914 mm Hg) predicted the composite outcome of aortic-root surgery, dissection,
  or death (hazard ratio 2.17, 95% confidence interval 1.02 to 4.63, p = 0.04). Crude
  3-year event rates were 10.4% versus 3.2% for higher versus lower EM groups. In
  conclusion, atenolol was associated with a decrease in aortic-root SI, whereas losartan
  was not. Higher baseline aortic-root SI and EM were associated with a smaller decrease
  in ARz and increased risk for clinical outcomes. These data suggest that noninvasive
  aortic stiffness measures may identify patients at higher risk of progressive aortic
  enlargement and adverse clinical outcomes, potentially allowing for closer monitoring
  and more aggressive therapy.
