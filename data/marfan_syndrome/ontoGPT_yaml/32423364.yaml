input_text: 'Trends of vascular surgery procedures in Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos
  syndrome. OBJECTIVES: Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome represent two connective
  tissue vascular diseases requiring unique consideration in their vascular surgical
  care. A comprehensive national review encompassing all hospitalizations for the
  Marfan Syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome patient population is lacking. METHODS:
  The National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample from 2010 to 2014 was reviewed for all
  inpatient vascular surgery procedures including those with a diagnosis of Marfan
  syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. National estimates of vascular surgery rates
  were generated from provided weights. Patient demographics, procedure type, and
  outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: There were 3103 Marfan syndrome and 476 Ehlers-Danlos
  syndrome vascular procedures identified as well as 3,895,381 vascular procedures
  in the remainder of population (control group). The percent of aortic procedures
  from all vascular procedures in Marfan syndrome (23.5%) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
  (23.5%) were 2.5-fold higher than controls (9.1%), p < 0.0001. Open aortic aneurysm
  repair was also significantly greater in both Marfan syndrome (16.8%) and Ehlers-Danlos
  syndrome (11.2%) compared to controls (4.4%), p < 0.0001. Endovascular aortic repair
  (p < 0.2302) was similar among the groups. Marfan syndrome (7.7%) and Ehlers-Danlos
  syndrome (5.1%) had more thoracic endovascular aortic repair performed than controls
  (0.7%), p < 0.0001. Percutaneous procedures were fewer in Marfan syndrome (6.3%)
  than controls (31.3%) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (26.3%), p < 0.0001, while repair
  of peripheral arteries was greater in Marfan syndrome (5.9%) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
  (4.1%) than controls (1.5%), p < 0.0001. For total aortic procedures, the mean age
  of aortic procedures was 68.2 years in controls vs 45.8 years in Marfan syndrome
  and 55.3 years in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, p < 0.0001. Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos
  syndrome had fewer comorbidities overall, while controls had significantly higher
  rates of coronary artery disease (controls 39.9% vs Marfan syndrome 8.3% and Ehlers-Danlos
  syndrome 13.0%, p < 0.0001), peripheral vascular disease (controls 34.5% vs Marfan
  syndrome 4.2% and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 8.7%, p < 0.0001), and diabetes (controls
  20.6% vs Marfan syndrome 6.6 and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 4.4%, p < 0.0001). Marfan
  syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome had higher overall complication rate (65.5%
  and 52.2%) compared to controls (44.6%), p < 0.0001. Postoperative hemorrhage was
  more likely in Marfan syndrome (42.9%) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (39.1%) than controls
  (22.2%), p < 0.0001. Increased respiratory failure was noted in Marfan syndrome
  (20.2%) vs controls (10.7%) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (8.7%), p = .0003. Finally,
  length of stay was increased in Marfan syndrome 12.5 days vs Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
  7.4 days and controls 7.2 days (p < 0.0001) as well as a higher median costs of
  index hospitalization in Marfan syndrome ($57,084 vs Ehlers-Danlos syndrome $22,032
  and controls $26,520, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Marfan syndrome and
  Ehlers-Danlos syndrome differ from other patients undergoing vascular surgical procedures,
  with a significantly higher proportion of aortic procedures including open aneurysm
  repair and thoracic endovascular aortic repair. While they are younger with fewer
  comorbidities, due to the unique pathogenesis of their underlying connective tissue
  disorder, there is an overall higher rate of procedural complications and increased
  length of stay and cost for Marfan syndrome patients undergoing aortic surgery.'
