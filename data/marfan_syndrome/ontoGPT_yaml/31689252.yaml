  Hospital Outcomes: A 12-Year Analysis. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
  OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the trends in management and inpatient outcomes in patients
  with syndromic scoliosis undergoing spinal deformity correction. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND
  DATA: Syndromic scoliosis (SS) refers to scoliosis that is most commonly associated
  with systemic disease including Ehler Danhlos syndrome (EDS), Marfan syndrome (MF),
  Down syndrome (DS), Achondroplasia (AP), and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Limited
  data exist evaluating hospital outcomes in patients with SS undergoing spinal deformity
  correction. METHODS: The Kids' Inpatient Database (KIDS) was queried from 2001 to
  2012 to identify all pediatric patients with scoliosis undergoing spinal fusion.
  These patients were then sub-divided into two cohorts: (1) patients with idiopathic
  scoliosis (IS) and (2) patients with syndromic scoliosis. Trends in surgical management,
  and postoperative morbidity and mortality were assessed. Length of stay and total
  hospital charges were additionally analyzed. A sub-analysis to characterize outcomes
  in each syndrome was also performed. RESULTS: An estimated 1071 patients with SS
  were identified and compared with 24,989 pediatric patients with IS. MF (36.8%),
  Down syndrome (16.0%), and PWS (14.9%) were the most common diagnoses among patients
  with SS. Between 2001 and 2012, there was a significant decline in the number of
  anterior procedures performed in both cohorts. Conversely, the number of posterior
  based procedures increased. SS was associated with increased major complications
  (2.7% compared with 1.0% in IS; P < 0.001) and minor complication rates (41.0% compared
  with 28.5% in IS; P < 0.001). Patients with AP incurred the highest rate of major
  complications (10.7%), minor complications (60.8%), and intraoperative durotomies
  (6.1%). Total hospital charges increased significantly over the 12-year span. CONCLUSION:
  Trends in management of syndromic scoliosis have paralleled that of idiopathic scoliosis.
  Syndromic scoliosis is associated with increased risks with surgical deformity correction.
  Further prospective studies are warranted to evaluate the reasons for these differences.
