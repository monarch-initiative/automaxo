input_text: 'Successive MRI Findings of Reversible Cerebral White Matter Lesions in
  a Patient with Cystathionine beta-Synthase Deficiency. Cystathionine beta-synthase
  (CBS) deficiency, well known as classical homocystinuria, is a rare autosomal recessive
  inborn error of homocysteine and sulfur metabolism. CBS converts homocysteine to
  cystathionine. The clinical features of untreated CBS deficiency include myopia,
  ectopia lentis, mental retardation, skeletal anomalies resembling Marfan syndrome,
  and thromboembolic events. Cerebral white matter lesions (CWMLs), identified in
  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are related to various clinical conditions including
  ischemia, inflammation, demyelination, infection, a tumor, and metabolic disorders
  such as phenylketonuria. The presence of CWMLs is, however, believed to be a very
  rare condition in CBS-deficient patients. Herein, we report reversible CWMLs associated
  with hypermethioninemia caused by poor protein restriction and betaine therapy in
  a 21-year-old male with pyridoxine-nonresponsive CBS deficiency. T2-weighted images
  (T2WI) and fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) images showed diffuse high
  signal intensity in subcortical areas extending to the deep white matter. Diffusion-weighted
  images (DWI) showed high signal intensity, while apparent diffusion coefficient
  (ADC) map demonstrated decreased ADC value in the lesions. The course of improvement
  after correct methionine restriction was successively followed by brain MRI. The
  CWMLs had regressed at 1 month after restriction, and disappeared after 5 months.
  ADC values were very low before proper methionine restriction, but normalized after
  2 months. Use of betaine in the presence of elevated plasma methionine may increase
  the risk of reversible CWMLs in some CBS-deficient patients. '
