input_text: Pre- and Postoperative Imaging of the Aortic Root. Three-dimensional datasets
  acquired using computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are ideally suited
  for characterization of the aortic root. These modalities offer different advantages
  and limitations, which must be weighed according to the clinical context. This article
  provides an overview of current aortic root imaging, highlighting normal anatomy,
  pathologic conditions, imaging techniques, measurement thresholds, relevant surgical
  procedures, postoperative complications and potential imaging pitfalls. Patients
  with a range of clinical conditions are predisposed to aortic root disease, including
  Marfan syndrome, bicuspid aortic valve, vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and Loeys-Dietz
  syndrome. Various surgical techniques may be used to repair the aortic root, including
  placement of a composite valve graft, such as the Bentall and Cabrol procedures;
  placement of an aortic root graft with preservation of the native valve, such as
  the Yacoub and David techniques; and implantation of a biologic graft, such as a
  homograft, autograft, or xenograft. Potential imaging pitfalls in the postoperative
  period include mimickers of pathologic processes such as felt pledgets, graft folds,
  and nonabsorbable hemostatic agents. Postoperative complications that may be encountered
  include pseudoaneurysms, infection, and dehiscence. Radiologists should be familiar
  with normal aortic root anatomy, surgical procedures, and postoperative complications,
  to accurately interpret pre- and postoperative imaging performed for evaluation
  of the aortic root. Online supplemental material is available for this article.
