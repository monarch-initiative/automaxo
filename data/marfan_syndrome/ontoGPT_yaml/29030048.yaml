input_text: 'Increased Prevalence of Cerebrovascular Disease in Hospitalized Patients
  with Marfan Syndrome. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Small studies have suggested that
  Marfan syndrome is associated with a number of cerebrovascular complications. We
  sought to determine whether a clinical diagnosis of Marfan syndrome is associated
  with a higher prevalence of cerebrovascular diseases than the general population
  by performing a case-control study of hospitalized patients in the Nationwide Inpatient
  Sample (NIS). METHODS: Using the 2000-2012 NIS, we performed a case-control study
  matching cases of Marfan syndrome to controls without such a diagnosis. The prevalence
  of various cerebrovascular diseases between the 2 groups were compared, and multivariate
  logistic regression was used to adjust for suspected comorbidities. RESULTS: Between
  2000 and 2012, there were a total of 13,883 discharges carrying a diagnosis of Marfan
  syndrome. On univariate analysis, patients with Marfan syndrome were more likely
  to have a primary or secondary diagnosis of hemorrhagic stroke (0.5% versus 0.3%,
  odds ratio [OR] = 1.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06-2.29, P = 0.02) as well
  as intracranial hemorrhage (subarachnoid hemorrhage [SAH] and hemorrhagic stroke)
  (0.3% versus 0.2%, OR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.05-2.82, P = 0.03). Patients hospitalized
  with Marfan syndrome were significantly more likely to have carotid dissection (0.3%
  versus 0.0%, OR = 11.69, 95% CI = 3.60-38.08, P <. 0001) and cerebral aneurysms
  (0.2% versus 0.1%, OR = 3.67, 95% CI = 1.76-7.68, P = 0.0002). On multivariate analysis
  adjusted for age, race, and comorbidities, patients with Marfan syndrome had significantly
  higher odds of ischemic stroke (OR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.02-1.43, P = 0.03), hemorrhagic
  stroke (OR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.18-2.63, P = 0.005), carotid artery dissection (OR
  = 11.94, 95% CI = 4.23-50.03, P < 0.0001), and cerebral aneurysm (OR = 3.95, 95%
  CI = 1.95-8.90, P <0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: There is a modestly increased prevalence
  of ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and cerebral aneurysms in hospitalized patients
  with Marfan syndrome when compared with controls.'
