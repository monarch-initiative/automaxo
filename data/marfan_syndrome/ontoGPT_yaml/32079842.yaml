input_text: Novel double-flanged technique for managing Marfan syndrome and microspherophakia.
  A new technique for fixating the capsular bag in patients with ectopia lentis is
  presented. In this technique, the capsulorhexis is performed using a femtosecond
  laser, followed by the insertion of a standard capsular tension ring to redistribute
  capsular forces. The nucleus is hydroprolapsed into the anterior chamber and nuclear
  disassembly is performed above the iris plane to reduce zonular stress. Finally,
  a 5-0 polypropylene monofilament is used to fixate a capsular tension segment and
  subluxated capsular bag. This novel double-flanged method, achieved with cautery,
  does not require direct suturing of the monofilament on the sclera. This article
  describes the use of this new technique in 3 eyes, 2 in patients with Marfan syndrome
  and 1 in a patient with microspherophakia.
