input_text: '[Effect of native aortic valve sparing aortic root reconstruction surgery
  on short- and long-term prognosis in Marfan syndrome patients:a meta-analysis].
  OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis was performed to analyze the effect of preserving
  the native aortic valve on short- and long-term prognosis post aortic root reconstruction
  surgery for patients with Marfan syndrome. METHODS: Database including Pubmed,Embase,
  Cochrane library, CNKI, Wanfang,VIP and CBM were searched to collect studies comparing
  clinical results of valve sparing surgery with composite valve graft surgery for
  patients with Marfan syndrome. Study quality was assessed by Newcastle-Ottawa Scale
  and publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of the funnel plot together
  with Egger test. Clinical outcomes data was extracted from the manuscripts and analyzed
  with Revman 5.0 supplied by Cochrane collaboration. RESULTS: Seven clinical trials
  with 690 patients were included. Meta- analysis demonstrated that valve sparing
  surgery was associated with a lower incidence of re-exploration (RR = 0.51, 95%CI:0.29-
  0.90, P < 0.05), thromboembolism (RR = 0.17, 95%CI:0.05-0.57, P < 0.01), endocarditis
  (RR = 0.31, 95%CI:0.11-0.94, P < 0.05) and significantly lower long-term death rate
  (RR = 0.37, 95%CI:0.18-0.74, P < 0.01). Reoperation rate was similar between the
  two groups (RR = 1.07, 95%CI:0.35-3.27, P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Valve sparing aortic
  root reconstruction surgery is a superior procedure to composite valve graft surgery
  in term of improving the short- and long-term prognosis for patients with Marfan
  syndrome.'
