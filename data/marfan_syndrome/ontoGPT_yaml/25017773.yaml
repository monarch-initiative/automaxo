input_text: Hemobilia associated with a giant thrombosed aneurysm of the hepatic artery
  requiring hepatectomy. Hemobilia is an unusual and potentially catastrophic cause
  of gastrointestinal bleeding. Although hepatic artery aneurysm is a cause of hemobilia,
  nontraumatic cases are infrequently reported. Herein, we describe the case of a
  giant hepatic artery aneurysm requiring hepatectomy because of repeated hemobilia
  in a patient with Marfan syndrome. A 53-year-old man presented to our hospital with
  sudden epigastric pain and jaundice. Abdominal computed tomography showed a giant
  hepatic arterial aneurysm in the porta hepatis, and emergency endoscopic retrograde
  cholangiography revealed hemobilia. Assuming that the aneurysm caused the hemobilia,
  we performed an abdominal angiogram for treatment. The study revealed a thrombosed
  aneurysm along with tortuous abnormal vessels in the periphery of the left hepatic
  artery, which appeared to surround the aneurysm. Therefore, we embolized the left
  hepatic artery, and immediate hemostasis was achieved. Rebleeding occurred 3 times
  thereafter, and each time, transarterial embolization was performed, resulting in
  prompt but only temporary hemostasis. Then, emergency left hemihepatectomy and resection
  of the aneurysm were performed. Pathologic examination of the resected specimen
  revealed that the aneurysm was completely thrombosed and organized; however, abnormal
  arterioles proliferated between the aneurysmal wall and the bile duct. The unique
  feature of this case was that the abnormal arterioles induced by the organized hepatic
  artery aneurysm, not the aneurysm itself, caused the hemobilia.
