input_text: 'Heart disease in pregnancy. Cardiac disease is the leading cause of maternal
  mortality in the developed world. The majority of women with heart disease are able
  to successfully undergo pregnancy. However, in women with severely impaired ventricular
  function, severe left heart obstruction, pulmonary hypertension and aortopathy,
  such as Marfan syndrome, with significant aortic dilatation, pregnancy is associated
  with a significant risk, and these women should be counselled against pregnancy
  if there is no option for treatment that reduces risk. Although there are increasing
  numbers of women with congenital heart disease who are considering pregnancy, as
  a result of joint expert specialist cardiac and obstetric care, maternal mortality
  is low. Most of the observed mortality occurs in women with structurally normal
  hearts who were not known to have heart disease before their pregnancy. It is therefore
  important that those caring for pregnant women are aware of the risk factors for
  and presentation of cardiac conditions in pregnancy. We review the presentation
  and management of both congenital and acquired heart diseases in pregnancy. '
