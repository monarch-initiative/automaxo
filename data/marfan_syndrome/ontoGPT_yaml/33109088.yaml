input_text: "Myocardial ischemia 10 years after a modified Cabrol procedure in a 42-year-old
  patient with Marfan syndrome. BACKGROUND: Marfan syndrome, a genetic disorder of
  the connective tissue, may cause aortic root dilation with aortic insufficiency,
  aortic dissection and mitral prolapse with mitral insufficiency. We present a case
  of a late complication of the modified Cabrol procedure that included replacing
  the ascending aorta with a composite graft. CASE PRESENTATION: In February 2019,
  a 42-year-old female patient with Marfan syndrome who presented with chest pain
  was sent to the Emergency Department. She had undergone the modified Cabrol procedure
  10 years prior. Upon presenting, laboratory analysis revealed elevated troponin-I
  levels. Electrocardiogram showed new inverted T waves over lead I, aVL and V4 to
  V6. Contrast computed tomography (CT) revealed thrombosis in the Dacron graft. Percutaneous
  coronary angiography was conducted, and a large thrombus in the graft was noted.
  Thrombolytic therapy and percutaneous coronary intervention were performed, after
  which the patient had no more symptoms and was discharged without complications.
  CONCLUSIONS: Aortic root surgery, including the Cabrol or modified Cabrol procedure,
  is necessary for complicated cases of aortic dilations, such as in patients with
  Marfan syndrome, even though the Cabrol or modified Cabrol procedure has a high
  complication rate. Regarding this case, we were surprised by the timing of the myocardial
  ischemia and the position of the thrombus, which differed from other cases. To better
  manage such a patient's condition and to detect the formation of thrombus early,
  completeness of the graft and possible stenosis of the anastomosis site to avoid
  preventable myocardial ischemia, we suggest that patients should have regular image
  follow-up, even years after the Cabrol or modified Cabrol procedure."
