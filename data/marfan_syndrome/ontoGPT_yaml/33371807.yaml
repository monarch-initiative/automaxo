input_text: 'Ten-Year Clinical Characteristics and Early Outcomes of Type B Aortic
  Dissection Patients With Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair. OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND:
  This study examined the 10-year hospitalization characteristics, economic patterns
  and early clinical outcomes of type B aortic dissection (TBAD) patients that underwent
  thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) in one high-volume hospital in China.
  METHODS: We performed a population-based retrospective analysis based on electronic
  medical record system data provided by Zhongshan Hospital Fudan University from
  2009 to 2018. RESULTS: We identified 1,367 cases of TBAD patients with TEVAR over
  the past decade. The total incidence of in-hospital complications was 7.6% (104
  of 1,367), among which acute kidney injury (AKI) had the highest incidence (3.1%,
  42 of 1,367). Aortic-related reintervention was performed in 7 patients (0.5%).
  The overall aortic-related in-hospital mortality rate was 2.7% (37 of 1,367) and
  had no significant time-varying trend (P = 0.2). Among these, 27% of in-hospital
  deaths were caused by retrograde type A dissection (RTAD). Chronic TBAD had a higher
  risk of in-hospital death versus acute TBAD, with a risk ratio of 2.69 (95% confidence
  interval [CI]: 1.19-6.09). Patients with hypertension (risk ratio 4.63, 95% CI:
  1.38, 15.54) also had a higher in-hospital death risk. These 2 factors were also
  the predictive factors for the composite endpoint of in-hospital adverse events
  (risk ratio 2.17, 95% CI: 1.43, 3.29 and risk ratio 4.83, 95% CI: 1.90, 12.28, respectively),
  in addition to Marfan syndrome (risk ratio 4.05, 95% CI: 1.61, 10.19). The average
  length of hospitalization significantly declined during the past decade (annual
  percentage change -6.3%, 95% CI -8.2 to -4.3), and the stent-grafts (SGs) cost was
  the main expenditure of the total hospitalization costs. CONCLUSION: Our study showed
  a favorable early outcome of TEVAR over the past decade. Greater attention should
  be paid to certain risk factors in order to reduce the in-hospital adverse events.
  SG expenditure is still the primary economic burden on Chinese TBAD patients.'
