input_text: 'A whole-genome sequencing-based novel preimplantation genetic testing
  method for de novo mutations combined with chromosomal balanced translocations.
  PURPOSE: To explore a new preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) method for de novo
  mutations (DNMs) combined with chromosomal balanced translocations by whole-genome
  sequencing (WGS) using the MGISEQ-2000 sequencer. METHODS: Two families, one with
  maternal Olmsted syndrome caused by DNM (c.1246C>T) in TRPV3 and a paternal Robertsonian
  translocation and one with paternal Marfan syndrome caused by DNM (c.4952_4955delAATG)
  in FBN1 and a maternal reciprocal translocation, underwent PGT for monogenetic disease
  (PGT-M), chromosomal aneuploidy, and structural rearrangement. WGS of embryos and
  family members were performed. Bioinformatics analysis based on gradient sequencing
  depth was performed, and parent-embryo haplotyping was conducted for DNM diagnosis.
  Sanger sequencing, karyotyping, and chromosomal microarray analysis were performed
  using an amniotic fluid sample to confirm the PGT results. RESULTS: After 1 PGT
  cycle, WGS of 2 embryos from the Olmsted syndrome family revealed euploid embryos
  without DNMs; after 2 cycles, the 11 embryos from the Marfan syndrome family showed
  only 1 normal embryo without DNM, copy number variations (CNVs), or aneuploidy.
  Moreover, 1 blastocyst from the Marfan syndrome family was transferred back to the
  uterus; the amniocentesis test results were confirmed by PGT and a healthy infant
  was born. CONCLUSIONS: WGS based on parent-embryo haplotypes was an effective strategy
  for PGT of DNMs combined with a chromosomal balanced translocation. Our results
  indicate this is a reliable and effective diagnostic method that is useful for clinical
  application in PGT of patients with DNMs.'
