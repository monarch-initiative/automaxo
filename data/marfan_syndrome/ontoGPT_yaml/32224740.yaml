input_text: "Recent Modifications of the Nuss Procedure: The Pursuit of Safety During
  the Minimally Invasive Repair of Pectus Excavatum. OBJECTIVE: To review standardized
  Nuss correction of pectus excavatum and vacuum bell treatment over the last 10 years.
  SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: In 2010, we reported 21 years of the Nuss procedure
  in 1215 patients. METHODS: Over the last 10 years, 2008-2018, we evaluated 1885
  pectus excavatum patients. Surgery was indicated for well-defined objective criteria.
  A consistent operation was performed by 8 surgeons in 1034 patients, median 15 years,
  (range 6-46); 996 were primary, and 38 redo operations. Surgical patients' mean
  computed tomography index was 5.46. Mitral valve prolapse was present in 5.4%, Marfan
  syndrome in 1.1% and scoliosis in 29%. Vacuum bell treatment was introduced for
  218 patients who did not meet surgical criteria or were averse to surgery. RESULTS:
  At primary operation, 1 bar was placed in 49.8%; 2 bars, 49.4%; and 3 bars, 0.7%.
  There were no deaths. Cardiac perforation occurred in 1 patient who had undergone
  previous cardiac surgery. Paraplegia after epidural catheter occurred once. Reoperation
  for bar displacement occurred in 1.8%, hemothorax in 0.3%, and wound infection in
  2.9%; 1.4% required surgical drainage. Allergy to stainless steel was identified
  in 13.7%. A good anatomic outcome was always achieved at bar removal. Recurrence
  requiring reoperation occurred in 3 primary surgical patients. Two patients developed
  carinate overcorrection requiring reoperation. Vacuum bell treatment produced better
  results in younger and less severe cases. CONCLUSIONS: A standardized Nuss procedure
  was performed by multiple surgeons in 1034 patients with good overall safety and
  results in primary repairs. Vacuum bell treatment is useful."
