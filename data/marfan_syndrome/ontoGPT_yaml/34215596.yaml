input_text: "Acceptance and commitment therapy meets peer-support. Development of
  a supportive self-care intervention for patients with rare diseases: a multistage
  development process. OBJECTIVE: We aimed at developing a patient-centred self-help
  programme, tailored to the needs of patients with rare chronic diseases. DESIGN:
  Multistage, multimethod development process including a survey with validated self-report
  scales and open-ended questions (phase 1) and focus groups (phase 2) for needs assessment
  and, consolidating the first phases and the literature, the intervention development
  (phase 3). SETTING: Phase 1: nationwide online survey in Germany, phase 2: four
  separate and diagnostically homogeneous focus groups. The focus groups took place
  at a university medical centre in Germany. PARTICIPANTS: Target group were patients
  with rare diseases that occur at a prevalence <1:2000. Phase 1: n=300 participants
  with different rare diseases. Phase 2: Individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1
  (n=4), primary sclerosing cholangitis (n=5), pulmonary arterial hypertension (n=4)
  and Marfan syndrome (n=5). RESULTS: The central results of phases 1 and 2 were requests
  for more information about the disease and contact with other affected persons.
  Patients also expressed support needs in dealing with difficult emotions and identified
  acceptance of the disease as a turning point for quality of life. In phase 3, we
  identified acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) as a suitable therapeutic approach
  and determined details about implementation and execution of self-management programmes.
  A 6-week self-help concept led by peer counsellors was developed, which includes
  disease-specific information and ACT-based exercises. CONCLUSION: Based on a multistage
  needs assessment, we developed a peer-guided self-help intervention for patients
  with rare chronic diseases. Combining self-management, peer-counselling and ACT
  may help living with a rare condition. Further research needs to test the programme's
  efficacy. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN13738704."
