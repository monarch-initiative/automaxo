input_text: 'Gene transfer to the vascular system: Novel translational perspectives
  for vascular diseases. Although vessels are directly exposed to the bloodstream,
  vascular gene transfer is rarely used as a tool for preclinical studies for several
  reasons: (i) viral and non-viral vectors show a low transduction efficiency in the
  vascular system; (ii) classical vascular gene therapy approaches such as treatment
  of peripheral or cardiac ischemia are focusing on non-vascular target cells; and
  (iii) vascular diseases are rarely monogenetic, thus gene replacement approaches
  are uncommon. Here, we provide an overview of recent approaches in developing novel
  vectors and modes of application for improved transduction efficiency of large and
  small vessels. Increased availability of such tools for vascular gene transfer has
  already facilitated preclinical studies addressing a broad variety of vascular diseases
  like transplant vasculopathy, atherosclerosis, and hereditary aortic diseases such
  as Marfan syndrome.'
