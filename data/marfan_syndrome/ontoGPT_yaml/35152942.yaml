input_text: 'Assessment of pleural pressure during sleep in Marfan syndrome. STUDY
  OBJECTIVES: Patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) have a high risk for aortic aneurysms.
  They are also susceptible to sleep-disordered breathing that may expose them to
  highly negative intrathoracic pressures known to increase aortic transmural pressure,
  which may accelerate aortic dilatation. Our objective was to quantify overnight
  intrathoracic pressure changes during sleep in snoring patients with MFS and the
  therapeutic effect of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). METHODS: We used
  a questionnaire to identify self-reported snoring patients with MFS. In these patients,
  we monitored intrathoracic pressure using esophageal pressure (Pes) during overnight
  baseline and CPAP sleep studies. We defined a peak-inspiratory Pes (Pespeak-insp)
  < - 5 cm H2O as greater than normal and examined the distribution of Pespeak-insp
  during baseline and CPAP studies. RESULTS: In our sample of 23 snorers with MFS,
  we found that 70% of sleep breaths exhibited Pespeak-insp < -5 cm H2O, with apnea/hypopneass
  accounting for only 12%, suggesting prevalent stable flow-limited breathing and
  snoring. In a subset (n = 12) with Pes monitoring during a CPAP night, CPAP lowered
  the mean proportion of breaths with Pespeak-insp < -5 cm H2O from 83.7% +- 14.9%
  to 3.6% +- 3.0% (P < .001). In addition, contemporaneous aortic root diameter was
  associated with the mean Pespeak-insp during inspiratory flow-limited breathing
  and apneas/hypopneas (beta = -0.05, r = .675, P = .033). CONCLUSIONS: The sleep
  state in MFS revealed prolonged exposure to exaggerated negative inspiratory Pes,
  which was reversible with CPAP. Since negative intrathoracic pressure can contribute
  to thoracic aortic stress and aortic dilatation, snoring may be a reversible risk
  factor for progression of aortic pathology in MFS. CITATION: Sowho M, Jun J, Sgambati
