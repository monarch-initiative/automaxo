input_text: '[Marfan syndrome: clinical and pathomorphological restructurings after
  surgical treatment of aortic aneurysm]. The authors examined the state of patients
  suffering from Marfan syndrome (MS) who endured operation for ascending aorta aneurysm
  with replacement of the ascending aorta and aortic valve (Bentall operation), studying
  alterations of the skeleton, face, heart and eyes, as well as pathomorphological
  restructurings in the aortic wall. The study was carried out 7.0 +- 4.2 years after
  the operation. We examined a total of 39 patients with MS - 27 (69.2%) men and 12
  (30.8%) women aged from 22 to 70 years old (average age - 42.1 +- 13.4 years). All
  patients were operated on for dissecting aneurysm of the ascending aorta accompanied
  by a considerable degree of aortic valve insufficiency or aortic ostium stenosis.
  The mean diameter of the aorta at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva amounted
  to 7.0 +- 1.3 cm (minimal - 5.0 cm, maximal - 12.0 cm), the Z-score prior to operation
  was 12.7 +- 6.5. The time form making the diagnosis of MS to surgical intervention
  for aortic aneurysm amounted to 9.6 +- 5.9 years. The condition after operative
  treatment in all patients was satisfactory, with the haemodynamic indices stable:
  systolic AP - 133.5 +- 19.1 mm Hg, diastolic AP 85.1 +- 12.9 mm Hg, heart rate 74.8
  +- 7.2 bpm. The average systemic score for the symptoms and tests of MS patients
  amounted to 8.2 +- 3.3 points. Pathohistological alterations of the aorta in patients
  with Marfan syndrome consisted in pronounced restructuring of the wall with deep
  irreversible alternative changes. The pathological process extended in the middle
  aortic layer all alone the length, but not only in the portions of rupture and dissection.
  The main pathomorphological signs in MS were as follows: focal accumulations of
  mucoid substances, dystrophic alterations of smooth-muscle cells, ribbon-like anuclear
  zones, formation of cystlike cavities, alterations of elastic fibres - fragmentation,
  hyperelastosis, multiplication, thinning and straightening, zones of elastolysis.'
