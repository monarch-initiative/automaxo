input_text: 'The influence of Marfans and bicuspid valves on outcomes following aortic
  valve reimplantation. BACKGROUND: We analyzed our early and midterm results with
  aortic valve reimplantation surgery to determine the influence of Marfan syndrome
  and bicuspid valves on outcomes with this technique. METHODS: Between March 2004
  and December 2015, 267 patients underwent aortic valve reimplantation operations.
  The mean diameter of the sinuses of Valsalva was 50 +- 3 mm and moderate/severe
  aortic regurgitation was present in 34.4% of these patients. A bicuspid aortic valve
  was present in 21% and 40% had Marfan syndrome. RESULTS: Overall 30-day mortality
  was 0.37% (1/267). Mean follow-up was 59.7 +- 38.7 months. Overall survival at 1,
  3, and 5 years was 98 +- 8%, 98 +- 1%, and 94 +- 2%, respectively. Freedom from
  reoperation and aortic regurgitation >II was 99 +- 5%, 98 +- 8%, 96.7 +- 8%, and
  99 +- 6%, 98 +- 1%, 98 +- 1%, respectively at 1, 3, and 5 years follow-up, with
  no differences between Marfan and bicuspid aortic valve groups. (p = 0.94 and p
  = 0.96, respectively). No endocarditis or thromboembolic complications were documented,
  and 93.6% of the patients did not receive any anticoagulation therapy. CONCLUSIONS:
  The reimplantation technique for aortic root aneurysms is associated with excellent
  clinical and functional outcomes at short and mid-term follow-up.'
