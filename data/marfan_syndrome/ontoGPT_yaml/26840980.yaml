input_text: 'Loss of Endothelial Barrier in Marfan Mice (mgR/mgR) Results in Severe
  Inflammation after Adenoviral Gene Therapy. OBJECTIVES: Marfan syndrome is an autosomal
  dominant inherited disorder of connective tissue. The vascular complications of
  Marfan syndrome have the biggest impact on life expectancy. The aorta of Marfan
  patients reveals degradation of elastin layers caused by increased proteolytic activity
  of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). In this study we performed adenoviral gene
  transfer of human tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases-1 (hTIMP-1) in aortic
  grafts of fibrillin-1 deficient Marfan mice (mgR/mgR) in order to reduce elastolysis.
  METHODS: We performed heterotopic infrarenal transplantation of the thoracic aorta
  in female mice (n = 7 per group). Before implantation, mgR/mgR and wild-type aortas
  (WT, C57BL/6) were transduced ex vivo with an adenoviral vector coding for human
  TIMP-1 (Ad.hTIMP-1) or beta-galactosidase (Ad.beta-Gal). As control mgR/mgR and
  wild-type aortas received no gene therapy. Thirty days after surgery, overexpression
  of the transgene was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and collagen in situ
  zymography. Histologic staining was performed to investigate inflammation, the neointimal
  index (NI), and elastin breaks. Endothelial barrier function of native not virus-exposed
  aortas was evaluated by perfusion of fluorescent albumin and examinations of virus-exposed
  tissue were performed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). RESULTS: IHC and
  ISZ revealed sufficient expression of the transgene. Severe cellular inflammation
  and intima hyperplasia were seen only in adenovirus treated mgR/mgR aortas (Ad.beta-Gal,
  Ad.hTIMP-1 NI: 0.23; 0.43), but not in native and Ad.hTIMP-1 treated WT (NI: 0.01;
  0.00). Compared to native mgR/mgR and Ad.hTIMP-1 treated WT aorta, the NI is highly
  significant greater in Ad.hTIMP-1 transduced mgR/mgR aorta (p = 0.001; p = 0.001).
  As expected, untreated Marfan grafts showed significant more elastolysis compared
  to WT (p = 0.001). However, elastolysis in Marfan aortas was not reduced by adenoviral
  overexpression of hTIMP-1 (compared to untreated Marfan aorta: Ad.hTIMP-1 p = 0.902;
  control Ad.beta-Gal. p = 0.165). The virus-untreated and not transplanted mgR/mgR
  aorta revealed a significant increase of albumin diffusion through the endothelial
  barrier (p = 0.037). TEM analysis of adenovirus-exposed mgR/mgR aortas displayed
  disruption of the basement membrane and basolateral space. CONCLUSIONS: Murine Marfan
  aortic grafts developed severe inflammation after adenoviral contact. We demonstrated
  that fibrillin-1 deficiency is associated with relevant dysfunction of the endothelial
  barrier that enables adenovirus to induce vessel-harming inflammation. Endothelial
  dysfunction may play a pivotal role in the development of the vascular phenotype
  of Marfan syndrome.'
