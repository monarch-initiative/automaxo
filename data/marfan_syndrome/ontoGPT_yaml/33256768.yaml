  in the treatment of severe rigid nonidiopathic scoliosis. INTRODUCTION: Strong halo-femoral
  traction has been widely used in the field of severe rigid scoliosis correction.
  The objective of this study was to analyze the corrective contribution of strong
  halo-femoral traction in the treatment of severe rigid nonidiopathic scoliosis and
  discuss its meaning. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective review was performed
  for patients with severe rigid nonidiopathic scoliosis who were treated with halo-femoral
  traction in our center from December 2008 to December 2015. All cases underwent
  halo-femoral traction for 2 to 4 weeks before a one-stage posterior operation, and
  the absolute and relative contribution rates of each orthopedic factor (bending,
  fulcrum, traction, surgery) were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 38 patients were
  included (15 males and 23 females), with a mean age of 16.4 +- 3.73 years (10-22
  years) and follow-up of 55.05 +- 6.63 months (range 40-68 months). The etiology
  was congenital in 17 patients, neuromuscular in 14 patients, neurofibromatosis-1
  in 3 patients, and Marfan syndrome in 2 patients. Congenital high scapular disease
  with scoliosis was found in 2 patients. The mean coronal Cobb angle of the major
  curve was 97.99  +- 11.47  (range 78 -124 ), with a mean flexibility of 15.68% +-
  6.65%. The absolute contribution rate (ACR) of bending was 27.26% +- 10.16%, the
  ACR of the fulcrum was 10.91% +- 2.50%, the ACR of traction was 32.32% +- 11.41%,
  and the ACR of surgery was 29.50% +- 9.70%. A significant difference in correction
  was noted between the ACRs of traction and the fulcrum (P < 0.05). DISCUSSION: Strong
  halo-femoral traction plays a relatively significant role in the treatment of severe
  rigid nonidiopathic scoliosis while decreasing the risk of operation, and it is
  a safe and effective method for the treatment of severe rigid nonidiopathic scoliosis.'
