input_text: 'Spinal fusion in pediatric patients with marfan syndrome: a nationwide
  assessment on short-term outcomes and readmission risk. PURPOSE: The purpose of
  this study was to utilize the National Readmission Database (NRD) to determine estimates
  for complication rates, 90-day readmission rates, and hospital costs associated
  with spinal fusion in pediatric patients with Marfan syndrome. METHODS: The 2012-2015
  NRD databases were queried for all pediatric (< 19 years old) patients diagnosed
  with Marfan syndrome undergoing spinal fusion surgery. The primary outcome variables
  in this study were index admission complications and 90-day readmissions. RESULTS:
  A total of 249 patients with Marfan syndrome underwent spinal fusion surgery between
  2012 and 2015 (mean age +- standard deviation at the time of surgery: 14 +- 2.0,
  132 (53%) female). 25 (10.1%) were readmitted within 90 days of the index hospital
  discharge date. Overall, 59.7% of patients experienced at least one complication
  during the index admission. Unplanned 90-day readmission could be predicted by older
  age (odds ratio 2.3, 95% confidence interval 1.3-4.2, p = 0.006), Medicaid insurance
  status (56.0, 3.8-820.0, p = 0.003), and experiencing an inpatient medical complication
  (42.9, 4.6-398.7, p = 0.001). Patients were readmitted for wound dehiscence (8 patients,
  3.2%), nervous system related complications (3 patients, 1.2%), and postoperative
  infectious related complications (4 patients, 1.6%). CONCLUSION: This study is the
  first to demonstrate on a national level the complications and potential risk factors
  for 90-day hospital readmission for patients with Marfan syndrome undergoing spinal
  fusion. Patients with Marfan syndrome undergoing spinal fusion often present with
  multiple medical comorbidities that must be managed carefully perioperatively to
  reduce inpatient complications and early hospital readmissions.'
