input_text: 'The "Destino-guided BEVAR" to Catheterize Downward Branches from a Femoral
  Access: Technical Note and Case Report. BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to
  report the Destino-guided branched endovascular aortic repair approach as a valid
  alternative to catheterization downward branches in complex aortic arch/descending
  thoracic anatomies. METHODS & RESULTS: A 53-year-old woman with Marfan syndrome
  underwent a thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair for a type III dissecting
  aneurysm. A custom repair with an endograft having 3 fenestrations (for renal arteries
  and superior mesenteric artery) and 1 branch for the celiac trunk was planned. The
  right axillary artery was chronically occluded; the left subclavian artery (LSA)
  was aneurysmatic. The catheterization of the celiac trunk branch was demanding but
  ultimately a bare stent was used as a bridging component between the graft and the
  target vessel, for spinal cord preconditioning. At the 2-month computed tomography
  angiography, when planning the relining of the bare metal stent, a 1 cm increase
  in diameter of the LSA aneurysm was documented and therefore a Destino-guided branched
  endovascular aortic repair was planned. This approach consists of branch catheterization
  via femoral access using the Destino steerable guiding sheath inside which, after
  bending, a smaller Cook Flexor is placed to easily deliver the stent, while maintaining
  stability. CONCLUSIONS: The Destino-guided branched endovascular aortic repair is
  a reproducible and effective alternative to the classic catheterization of side
  branches via brachial/axillary access allowing their completion from a femoral access.'
