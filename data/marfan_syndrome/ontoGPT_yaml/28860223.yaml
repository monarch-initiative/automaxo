input_text: Differentiation and Application of Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived
  Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) play a role in
  the development of vascular disease, for example, neointimal formation, arterial
  aneurysm, and Marfan syndrome caused by genetic mutations in VSMCs, but little is
  known about the mechanisms of the disease process. Advances in induced pluripotent
  stem cell technology have now made it possible to derive VSMCs from several different
  somatic cells using a selection of protocols. As such, researchers have set out
  to delineate key signaling processes involved in triggering VSMC gene expression
  to grasp the extent of gene regulatory networks involved in phenotype commitment.
  This technology has also paved the way for investigations into diseases affecting
  VSMC behavior and function, which may be treatable once an identifiable culprit
  molecule or gene has been repaired. Moreover, induced pluripotent stem cell-derived
  VSMCs are also being considered for their use in tissue-engineered blood vessels
  as they may prove more beneficial than using autologous vessels. Finally, while
  several issues remains to be clarified before induced pluripotent stem cell-derived
  VSMCs can become used in regenerative medicine, they do offer both clinicians and
  researchers hope for both treating and understanding vascular disease. In this review,
  we aim to update the recent progress on VSMC generation from stem cells and the
  underlying molecular mechanisms of VSMC differentiation. We will also explore how
  the use of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived VSMCs has changed the game for
  regenerative medicine by offering new therapeutic avenues to clinicians, as well
  as providing researchers with a new platform for modeling of vascular disease.
