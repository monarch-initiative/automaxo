                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In Mali, malaria remains the major endemic and leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the most vulnerable groups, notably children under five years of age and pregnant women. Achieving the goal of eliminating malaria by 2030 would be difficult, if not impossible, if we do not identify all the dimensions that influence the persistence of the disease within communities. This is why this study was conducted to assess the perceptions, attitudes and beliefs of parents regarding seasonal malaria chemoprevention in children under 5 years of age. METHODS: This study focused on 10 villages in the M'pessoba health area. Community consent was obtained in each village before starting the survey. Moreover, free and informed individual consent was obtained before starting to administer the questions. A questionnaire on parents' knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about SMC was administered randomly to at least 25 parents per village. RESULTS: Of the 333 parents interviewed, nearly 97.9% (n = 333) thought that SMC should be taken by children aged 3-59 months. According to the majority of the participants, SMC protects against malaria (75.7%). The majority of parents interviewed (79.3%) were aware that SMC was administered over 3 days. Most of the participants (97.3%) thought that even under SMC, children must continue to sleep under mosquito nets. A total of 61.9% of parents experienced side effects following the administration SMC medications. During our survey, 90.7% of parents confirmed that the children had taken the second dose, compared with 85.3% for the third dose. A minority of participants (33.6%) thought that taking SMC only once had a protective effect for 3 months. A total of 93.4% of the 333 parents interviewed were in favor of administering SMC to their children the following year. CONCLUSION: The study showed limited community perception regarding the protection period of SMC after taking a full dose.",

The emerging uses of CQ and HCQ in cancer therapy, metabolic syndrome and bone disorders highlight their broad clinical potential. Patients with autoimmune and inflammatory conditions have a higher risk of suboptimal bone health because of chronic inflammation, immune dysregulation and medication use. In the present review, the use of CQ and HCQ in bone research was explored, particularly in terms of their effectiveness and mechanism in modulating bone homeostasis. CQ and HCQ inhibit osteoblastic activity by suppressing autophagy, inducing oxidative stress and promoting osteoblast apoptosis. CQ suppresses osteoclastic activity by blocking the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-beta/receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-beta ligand interaction, autophagy and inflammation. HCQ inhibits osteoclastogenesis by increasing the expression levels of osteoprotegerin, inducing osteoclast apoptosis and reducing cytokines without affecting autophagy. With regard to the molecular machineries, CQ and HCQ inhibit bone formation and bone resorption. Variations in dose, frequency and duration of CQ and HCQ treatment result in heterogenous outcomes. Further research is necessary to clarify the net effects of CQ and HCQ on bone through studies specifically designed to explore their direct impact as the primary objective. The use of these medications is broadening particularly in patients with autoimmune diseases who are at risk of skeletal disorders. However, their safety profiles, adverse effects and contraindications must be carefully monitored when administered for long-term use and in combination.",

Initially delivered through the Expanded Programme of Immunization (EPI), recent pilot studies explored PMC delivery via the vitamin A supplementation programme or community health workers (CHWs). Understanding SP demand across the various delivery channels is key to implementing PMC. METHODS: A 5-year epidemiologically-based forecasting model was developed to estimate SP volumes required for nine sub-Saharan countries based on seven different scenarios considering the EPI, vitamin A or CHWs delivery channels, alone or in combination. Model inputs were secondary data sources, enhanced with information from a field survey conducted among 40 national decision-makers and 176 healthcare providers. Projected SP volumes were estimated based on expected coverage and uptake within the eligible population. The efficiency of meeting the need versus demand was calculated for each scenario. A sensitivity analysis was performed for base, low and high estimates of the coverage and uptake rates. The forecasting period was 2023 to 2027. RESULTS: The eligible population in the study countries was estimated at 21 million children in 2023. Estimated demand in 2027 ranged from 17.8 million SP doses for EPI to 49.6 million when combining all delivery channels. These results were highly dependent on the coverage and uptake rate of each delivery channel. The sensitivity analysis showed that uncertainty around the estimates ranged from twofold (Vitamin A), to 3.4-fold (CHWs). EPI was the most efficient channel overall (53%), but the efficiency of each scenario varied by country depending on local contexts.

                    "abstract": "Progress in malaria control will rely on deployment and effective targeting of combinations of interventions, including malaria vaccines and perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC). Several countries with PMC programmes have introduced malaria vaccination into their essential programmes on immunizations, but empirical evidence on the impact of combining these two interventions and how best to co-implement them are lacking. At the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene 2023 annual meeting, a stakeholder meeting was convened to identify key policy, operational and research gaps for co-implementation of malaria vaccines and PMC. Participants from 11 endemic countries, including representatives from national malaria and immunization programmes, the World Health Organization, researchers, implementing organizations and funders attended. Identified evidence gaps were prioritized to select urgent issues to inform co-implementation. The output of these activities is a strategic roadmap of priority malaria vaccine and PMC co-implementation evidence gaps, and solutions to address them. The roadmap was presented to stakeholders for feedback at the 2024 Multilateral Initiative on Malaria meeting and revised accordingly. The roadmap outlines four key areas of work to address urgent evidence gaps for co-implementation: (1) support to the global and national policy process, (2) implementation support and research, (3) clinical studies, and (4) modelling. Together, these areas will provide practical guidance on the co-implementation of the interventions, and robust evidence to inform decision-making on how best to design, optimize and scale-up co-implementation in different contexts, including if and in what contexts the co-implementation is cost-effective, and the optimal schedule for co-implementation. This will work towards supporting the policy process on co-implementation of malaria vaccines and PMC, and achieving the most impactful use of available resources for the prevention of malaria in children.",

                    "abstract": "In response to vaccination and/or infectious agents, the liver produces acute-phase proteins (APPs) driven by IL-6, which circulate in blood plasma as components of the humoral innate defense. This study investigates the liver of mice for possible effects of protective vaccination against primary blood-stage infections of Plasmodium chabaudi malaria on the expression of genes encoding APPs and IL-6 family members. Female Balb/c mice were vaccinated with a non-infectious vaccine prior to challenge with 106P. chabaudi-infected erythrocytes, resulting in about 80% survival of otherwise lethal infections. Gene expression microarrays were used to determine the relative transcript levels of genes in the livers of vaccinated and unvaccinated mice on days 0, 1, 4, 8, and 11 p.i. (post infectionem). Vaccination induced significant (p-value < 0.05) differences in the expression of malaria-responsive genes toward the end of crisis on day 11 p.i., when mice recovered from infections. These genes include Saa4, Apcs, Cp, and Crp, encoding APPs described to inhibitorily interact with parasitic blood stages; the genes F2, F7, F8, F9, F10, and F13b, and Plg, Plat, and Serpina5, encoding proteins balancing coagulation vs. fibrinolysis dysregulated by malaria, respectively; the genes Hc, C8a, C8b, C8g, and C9, encoding components of lytic complement membrane attack complex (MAC); and Cfh, Cfi, and C4bp, encoding complement-regulatory proteins. Vaccination accelerated, albeit differently, the malaria-induced activation of all three complement pathways, evidenced as higher transcript levels of C1qa, C1qb, C1qc, Fcna, Cfp, C3, Cfh, C8a, and C9 on day 4 p.i., C1ra, C1s, and C2 on day 1 p.i., and Serping1, encoding the multifunctional protease inhibitor C1INH, on day 0 p.i. Protective vaccination may also accelerate downregulation of the malaria-promoting lethality of IL-6 trans-signaling, which may contribute to an overall accelerated recovery of mice from otherwise lethal blood-stage malaria.",

The emerging uses of CQ and HCQ in cancer therapy, metabolic syndrome and bone disorders highlight their broad clinical potential. Patients with autoimmune and inflammatory conditions have a higher risk of suboptimal bone health because of chronic inflammation, immune dysregulation and medication use. In the present review, the use of CQ and HCQ in bone research was explored, particularly in terms of their effectiveness and mechanism in modulating bone homeostasis. CQ and HCQ inhibit osteoblastic activity by suppressing autophagy, inducing oxidative stress and promoting osteoblast apoptosis. CQ suppresses osteoclastic activity by blocking the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-beta/receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-beta ligand interaction, autophagy and inflammation. HCQ inhibits osteoclastogenesis by increasing the expression levels of osteoprotegerin, inducing osteoclast apoptosis and reducing cytokines without affecting autophagy. With regard to the molecular machineries, CQ and HCQ inhibit bone formation and bone resorption. Variations in dose, frequency and duration of CQ and HCQ treatment result in heterogenous outcomes. Further research is necessary to clarify the net effects of CQ and HCQ on bone through studies specifically designed to explore their direct impact as the primary objective. The use of these medications is broadening particularly in patients with autoimmune diseases who are at risk of skeletal disorders. However, their safety profiles, adverse effects and contraindications must be carefully monitored when administered for long-term use and in combination.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ghana adopted the WHO-recommended Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention (SMC) in 2016 following a pilot study as a vital strategy for malaria control. SMC is the intermittent administration of a preventive and curative dose of anti-malarial medicine (Sulfadoxine-Pyrimetamine + Amodiaquine) during four months of the malaria season. This study monitored the implementation of SMC to ensure the intervention is achieving its target. METHODS: This was a longitudinal study in four administrative districts of the Upper East Region of Ghana. Children aged between 3 and 59 months were sampled and followed up one week after each cycle of SMC dosing to complete a questionnaire. SMC status was determined through the caregiver's report and child welfare cards, if available. Caregivers were asked if the participant had been treated for malaria since the last cycle. Simple and multiple logistic regressions were employed to determine associations between SMC adherence and the independent variables, with all results interpreted at a 95% confidence level (CI). RESULTS: This study reported an average SMC coverage of 87% (CI: 86.7-89.5) per cycle with a 2% dropout after the first cycle. SMC adherence rate remained above 82% (CI: 1.4-2.5), with malaria incidence decreasing in those who received all four doses of SMC compared to partial recipients. Health system/programme (49%) and patient related factors (33%) were the main reasons reported for non-adherence. Significant predictors of adherence were household size (aOR = 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.08), sleeping under bed nets (aOR = 1.88, 95% CI 1.44-2.48), and indoor residual spraying (IRS) presence (aOR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.69-1.99). CONCLUSION: Despite achieving an average coverage of 87% per cycle, it falls short of the national target of 90%. Notable reasons for drop-outs and non-adherence were, the caregiver being unavailable during the distribution, highlighting the need for diversified approaches in SMC campaigns to enhance coverage, and adherence, and maximize intervention benefits.",

The emerging uses of CQ and HCQ in cancer therapy, metabolic syndrome and bone disorders highlight their broad clinical potential. Patients with autoimmune and inflammatory conditions have a higher risk of suboptimal bone health because of chronic inflammation, immune dysregulation and medication use. In the present review, the use of CQ and HCQ in bone research was explored, particularly in terms of their effectiveness and mechanism in modulating bone homeostasis. CQ and HCQ inhibit osteoblastic activity by suppressing autophagy, inducing oxidative stress and promoting osteoblast apoptosis. CQ suppresses osteoclastic activity by blocking the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-beta/receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-beta ligand interaction, autophagy and inflammation. HCQ inhibits osteoclastogenesis by increasing the expression levels of osteoprotegerin, inducing osteoclast apoptosis and reducing cytokines without affecting autophagy. With regard to the molecular machineries, CQ and HCQ inhibit bone formation and bone resorption. Variations in dose, frequency and duration of CQ and HCQ treatment result in heterogenous outcomes. Further research is necessary to clarify the net effects of CQ and HCQ on bone through studies specifically designed to explore their direct impact as the primary objective. The use of these medications is broadening particularly in patients with autoimmune diseases who are at risk of skeletal disorders.

At the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene 2023 annual meeting, a stakeholder meeting was convened to identify key policy, operational and research gaps for co-implementation of malaria vaccines and PMC.

This study aimed to encapsulate larvicide-producing bacteria in nanofibers designed to shield bacterial cells from environmental stress-mimicking natural biofilms-thereby enhancing their survival in aquatic habitats and prolonging larvicide production. During the initial screening, Pseudomonas aeruginosa proved to be more effective than the other two tested species, P. fluorescens and P. putida, in producing potent larvicides and was therefore selected for nanofiber encapsulation studies. Our findings demonstrate that nanofiber encapsulation can be a viable strategy for controlling mosquito larvae in breeding habitats over an extended period without harming non-target organisms.",

Initially delivered through the Expanded Programme of Immunization (EPI), recent pilot studies explored PMC delivery via the vitamin A supplementation programme or community health workers (CHWs). Understanding SP demand across the various delivery channels is key to implementing PMC. METHODS: A 5-year epidemiologically-based forecasting model was developed to estimate SP volumes required for nine sub-Saharan countries based on seven different scenarios considering the EPI, vitamin A or CHWs delivery channels, alone or in combination. Model inputs were secondary data sources, enhanced with information from a field survey conducted among 40 national decision-makers and 176 healthcare providers. Projected SP volumes were estimated based on expected coverage and uptake within the eligible population. The efficiency of meeting the need versus demand was calculated for each scenario. A sensitivity analysis was performed for base, low and high estimates of the coverage and uptake rates. The forecasting period was 2023 to 2027. RESULTS: The eligible population in the study countries was estimated at 21 million children in 2023. Estimated demand in 2027 ranged from 17.8 million SP doses for EPI to 49.6 million when combining all delivery channels. These results were highly dependent on the coverage and uptake rate of each delivery channel. The sensitivity analysis showed that uncertainty around the estimates ranged from twofold (Vitamin A), to 3.4-fold (CHWs). EPI was the most efficient channel overall (53%), but the efficiency of each scenario varied by country depending on local contexts.

                    "abstract": "Nanoemulsions are tiny mixtures of water and oil stabilized by surfactants, and they have become increasingly popular across various industries, including medicine. With droplet sizes in the nanometer scale, these mixtures are both compact and effective. This discussion explores the potential of polysaccharide-based nanotechnology as an innovative approach to drug delivery. Nanoemulsions offer several benefits, such as enhanced drug solubility and bioavailability, which are crucial for drugs that poorly dissolve in water. The incorporation of natural polysaccharides as emulsifiers in these nanoemulsions ensures their biocompatibility and safety within the body. Additionally, nanoemulsions can facilitate a sustained release of medications, allowing for gradual drug release over an extended period. This controlled release can be achieved through the careful selection and formulation of polysaccharides. This review addresses the methods for producing polysaccharide-based nanoemulsions and examines their physical and chemical properties. It highlights the influence of polysaccharide molecular weight and structure on the stability of nanoemulsions and the effectiveness of drug encapsulation. By understanding these factors, researchers can develop more efficient and safe drug delivery systems utilizing nanoemulsions. Additionally, the present article provides explicit and thorough information about the use of NPLS-based nano-carriers encapsulating a number of drugs designed to treat a variety of conditions, such as diabetes, cancer, HIV, malaria, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and skin diseases. For this reason, it is very important to review the most recent developments in polysaccharide-based nano-biocarriers in drug delivery and their application in the treatment of diseases. In this work, we concentrated on the preparation of polysaccharide-based nano-biocarriers, commonly used polysaccharides for the preparation of nano-biocarriers, and drugs loaded on polysaccharide-based nano-biocarriers to treat diseases. In the near future, polysaccharide-based nano-biocarriers will be used more and more frequently in drug delivery and disease treatment.",

The emerging uses of CQ and HCQ in cancer therapy, metabolic syndrome and bone disorders highlight their broad clinical potential. Patients with autoimmune and inflammatory conditions have a higher risk of suboptimal bone health because of chronic inflammation, immune dysregulation and medication use. In the present review, the use of CQ and HCQ in bone research was explored, particularly in terms of their effectiveness and mechanism in modulating bone homeostasis. CQ and HCQ inhibit osteoblastic activity by suppressing autophagy, inducing oxidative stress and promoting osteoblast apoptosis. CQ suppresses osteoclastic activity by blocking the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-beta/receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-beta ligand interaction, autophagy and inflammation. HCQ inhibits osteoclastogenesis by increasing the expression levels of osteoprotegerin, inducing osteoclast apoptosis and reducing cytokines without affecting autophagy. With regard to the molecular machineries, CQ and HCQ inhibit bone formation and bone resorption. Variations in dose, frequency and duration of CQ and HCQ treatment result in heterogenous outcomes. Further research is necessary to clarify the net effects of CQ and HCQ on bone through studies specifically designed to explore their direct impact as the primary objective. The use of these medications is broadening particularly in patients with autoimmune diseases who are at risk of skeletal disorders. However, their safety profiles, adverse effects and contraindications must be carefully monitored when administered for long-term use and in combination.",

This study investigates the liver of mice for possible effects of protective vaccination against primary blood-stage infections of Plasmodium chabaudi malaria on the expression of genes encoding APPs and IL-6 family members. Female Balb/c mice were vaccinated with a non-infectious vaccine prior to challenge with 106P. chabaudi-infected erythrocytes, resulting in about 80% survival of otherwise lethal infections. Gene expression microarrays were used to determine the relative transcript levels of genes in the livers of vaccinated and unvaccinated mice on days 0, 1, 4, 8, and 11 p.i. (post infectionem). Vaccination induced significant (p-value < 0.05) differences in the expression of malaria-responsive genes toward the end of crisis on day 11 p.i., when mice recovered from infections. These genes include Saa4, Apcs, Cp, and Crp, encoding APPs described to inhibitorily interact with parasitic blood stages; the genes F2, F7, F8, F9, F10, and F13b, and Plg, Plat, and Serpina5, encoding proteins balancing coagulation vs. fibrinolysis dysregulated by malaria, respectively; the genes Hc, C8a, C8b, C8g, and C9, encoding components of lytic complement membrane attack complex (MAC); and Cfh, Cfi, and C4bp, encoding complement-regulatory proteins. Vaccination accelerated, albeit differently, the malaria-induced activation of all three complement pathways, evidenced as higher transcript levels of C1qa, C1qb, C1qc, Fcna, Cfp, C3, Cfh, C8a, and C9 on day 4 p.i., C1ra, C1s, and C2 on day 1 p.i., and Serping1, encoding the multifunctional protease inhibitor C1INH, on day 0 p.i. Protective vaccination may also accelerate downregulation of the malaria-promoting lethality of IL-6 trans-signaling, which may contribute to an overall accelerated recovery of mice from otherwise lethal blood-stage malaria.",

The emerging uses of CQ and HCQ in cancer therapy, metabolic syndrome and bone disorders highlight their broad clinical potential. Patients with autoimmune and inflammatory conditions have a higher risk of suboptimal bone health because of chronic inflammation, immune dysregulation and medication use. In the present review, the use of CQ and HCQ in bone research was explored, particularly in terms of their effectiveness and mechanism in modulating bone homeostasis. CQ and HCQ inhibit osteoblastic activity by suppressing autophagy, inducing oxidative stress and promoting osteoblast apoptosis. CQ suppresses osteoclastic activity by blocking the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-beta/receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-beta ligand interaction, autophagy and inflammation. HCQ inhibits osteoclastogenesis by increasing the expression levels of osteoprotegerin, inducing osteoclast apoptosis and reducing cytokines without affecting autophagy. With regard to the molecular machineries, CQ and HCQ inhibit bone formation and bone resorption. Variations in dose, frequency and duration of CQ and HCQ treatment result in heterogenous outcomes. Further research is necessary to clarify the net effects of CQ and HCQ on bone through studies specifically designed to explore their direct impact as the primary objective. The use of these medications is broadening particularly in patients with autoimmune diseases who are at risk of skeletal disorders. However, their safety profiles, adverse effects and contraindications must be carefully monitored when administered for long-term use and in combination.",

SMC is the intermittent administration of a preventive and curative dose of anti-malarial medicine (Sulfadoxine-Pyrimetamine + Amodiaquine) during four months of the malaria season. This study monitored the implementation of SMC to ensure the intervention is achieving its target. METHODS: This was a longitudinal study in four administrative districts of the Upper East Region of Ghana. Children aged between 3 and 59 months were sampled and followed up one week after each cycle of SMC dosing to complete a questionnaire. SMC status was determined through the caregiver's report and child welfare cards, if available. Caregivers were asked if the participant had been treated for malaria since the last cycle. Simple and multiple logistic regressions were employed to determine associations between SMC adherence and the independent variables, with all results interpreted at a 95% confidence level (CI). RESULTS: This study reported an average SMC coverage of 87% (CI: 86.7-89.5) per cycle with a 2% dropout after the first cycle. SMC adherence rate remained above 82% (CI: 1.4-2.5), with malaria incidence decreasing in those who received all four doses of SMC compared to partial recipients. Health system/programme (49%) and patient related factors (33%) were the main reasons reported for non-adherence. Significant predictors of adherence were household size (aOR = 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.08), sleeping under bed nets (aOR = 1.88, 95% CI 1.44-2.48), and indoor residual spraying (IRS) presence (aOR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.69-1.99). CONCLUSION: Despite achieving an average coverage of 87% per cycle, it falls short of the national target of 90%. Notable reasons for drop-outs and non-adherence were, the caregiver being unavailable during the distribution, highlighting the need for diversified approaches in SMC campaigns to enhance coverage, and adherence, and maximize intervention benefits.",

Several countries with PMC programmes have introduced malaria vaccination into their essential programmes on immunizations, but empirical evidence on the impact of combining these two interventions and how best to co-implement them are lacking. At the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene 2023 annual meeting, a stakeholder meeting was convened to identify key policy, operational and research gaps for co-implementation of malaria vaccines and PMC. Participants from 11 endemic countries, including representatives from national malaria and immunization programmes, the World Health Organization, researchers, implementing organizations and funders attended. Identified evidence gaps were prioritized to select urgent issues to inform co-implementation. The output of these activities is a strategic roadmap of priority malaria vaccine and PMC co-implementation evidence gaps, and solutions to address them. The roadmap was presented to stakeholders for feedback at the 2024 Multilateral Initiative on Malaria meeting and revised accordingly. The roadmap outlines four key areas of work to address urgent evidence gaps for co-implementation: (1) support to the global and national policy process, (2) implementation support and research, (3) clinical studies, and (4) modelling. Together, these areas will provide practical guidance on the co-implementation of the interventions, and robust evidence to inform decision-making on how best to design, optimize and scale-up co-implementation in different contexts, including if and in what contexts the co-implementation is cost-effective, and the optimal schedule for co-implementation.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In Mali, malaria remains the major endemic and leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the most vulnerable groups, notably children under five years of age and pregnant women. Achieving the goal of eliminating malaria by 2030 would be difficult, if not impossible, if we do not identify all the dimensions that influence the persistence of the disease within communities. This is why this study was conducted to assess the perceptions, attitudes and beliefs of parents regarding seasonal malaria chemoprevention in children under 5 years of age. METHODS: This study focused on 10 villages in the M'pessoba health area. Community consent was obtained in each village before starting the survey. Moreover, free and informed individual consent was obtained before starting to administer the questions. A questionnaire on parents' knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about SMC was administered randomly to at least 25 parents per village. RESULTS: Of the 333 parents interviewed, nearly 97.9% (n = 333) thought that SMC should be taken by children aged 3-59 months. According to the majority of the participants, SMC protects against malaria (75.7%). The majority of parents interviewed (79.3%) were aware that SMC was administered over 3 days. Most of the participants (97.3%) thought that even under SMC, children must continue to sleep under mosquito nets. A total of 61.9% of parents experienced side effects following the administration SMC medications. During our survey, 90.7% of parents confirmed that the children had taken the second dose, compared with 85.3% for the third dose. A minority of participants (33.6%) thought that taking SMC only once had a protective effect for 3 months. A total of 93.4% of the 333 parents interviewed were in favor of administering SMC to their children the following year. CONCLUSION: The study showed limited community perception regarding the protection period of SMC after taking a full dose.",
