input_text: Protective Vaccination of Mice Against Blood-Stage Malaria Impacts Hepatic
  Expression of Genes Encoding Acute-Phase Proteins and IL-6 Family Members. In response
  to vaccination and/or infectious agents, the liver produces acute-phase proteins
  (APPs) driven by IL-6, which circulate in blood plasma as components of the humoral
  innate defense. This study investigates the liver of mice for possible effects of
  protective vaccination against primary blood-stage infections of Plasmodium chabaudi
  malaria on the expression of genes encoding APPs and IL-6 family members. Female
  Balb/c mice were vaccinated with a non-infectious vaccine prior to challenge with
  106P. chabaudi-infected erythrocytes, resulting in about 80% survival of otherwise
  lethal infections. Gene expression microarrays were used to determine the relative
  transcript levels of genes in the livers of vaccinated and unvaccinated mice on
  days 0, 1, 4, 8, and 11 p.i. (post infectionem). Vaccination induced significant
  (p-value < 0.05) differences in the expression of malaria-responsive genes toward
  the end of crisis on day 11 p.i., when mice recovered from infections. These genes
  include Saa4, Apcs, Cp, and Crp, encoding APPs described to inhibitorily interact
  with parasitic blood stages; the genes F2, F7, F8, F9, F10, and F13b, and Plg, Plat,
  and Serpina5, encoding proteins balancing coagulation vs. fibrinolysis dysregulated
  by malaria, respectively; the genes Hc, C8a, C8b, C8g, and C9, encoding components
  of lytic complement membrane attack complex (MAC); and Cfh, Cfi, and C4bp, encoding
  complement-regulatory proteins. Vaccination accelerated, albeit differently, the
  malaria-induced activation of all three complement pathways, evidenced as higher
  transcript levels of C1qa, C1qb, C1qc, Fcna, Cfp, C3, Cfh, C8a, and C9 on day 4
  p.i., C1ra, C1s, and C2 on day 1 p.i., and Serping1, encoding the multifunctional
  protease inhibitor C1INH, on day 0 p.i. Protective vaccination may also accelerate
  downregulation of the malaria-promoting lethality of IL-6 trans-signaling, which
  may contribute to an overall accelerated recovery of mice from otherwise lethal
  blood-stage malaria.
