input_text: Nanofiber encapsulation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa for the sustained release
  of mosquito larvicides. Despite the rising global incidence of vector-borne diseases
  such as malaria, dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, existing vector control strategies
  remain inadequate for completely eliminating vectors from their breeding sites.
  This study aimed to encapsulate larvicide-producing bacteria in nanofibers designed
  to shield bacterial cells from environmental stress-mimicking natural biofilms-thereby
  enhancing their survival in aquatic habitats and prolonging larvicide production.
  During the initial screening, Pseudomonas aeruginosa proved to be more effective
  than the other two tested species, P. fluorescens and P. putida, in producing potent
  larvicides and was therefore selected for nanofiber encapsulation studies. Our findings
  demonstrate that nanofiber encapsulation can be a viable strategy for controlling
  mosquito larvae in breeding habitats over an extended period without harming non-target
  organisms.
