input_text: 'A roadmap of priority evidence gaps for the co-implementation of malaria
  vaccines and perennial malaria chemoprevention. Progress in malaria control will
  rely on deployment and effective targeting of combinations of interventions, including
  malaria vaccines and perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC). Several countries
  with PMC programmes have introduced malaria vaccination into their essential programmes
  on immunizations, but empirical evidence on the impact of combining these two interventions
  and how best to co-implement them are lacking. At the American Society of Tropical
  Medicine and Hygiene 2023 annual meeting, a stakeholder meeting was convened to
  identify key policy, operational and research gaps for co-implementation of malaria
  vaccines and PMC. Participants from 11 endemic countries, including representatives
  from national malaria and immunization programmes, the World Health Organization,
  researchers, implementing organizations and funders attended. Identified evidence
  gaps were prioritized to select urgent issues to inform co-implementation. The output
  of these activities is a strategic roadmap of priority malaria vaccine and PMC co-implementation
  evidence gaps, and solutions to address them. The roadmap was presented to stakeholders
  for feedback at the 2024 Multilateral Initiative on Malaria meeting and revised
  accordingly. The roadmap outlines four key areas of work to address urgent evidence
  gaps for co-implementation: (1) support to the global and national policy process,
  (2) implementation support and research, (3) clinical studies, and (4) modelling.
  Together, these areas will provide practical guidance on the co-implementation of
  the interventions, and robust evidence to inform decision-making on how best to
  design, optimize and scale-up co-implementation in different contexts, including
  if and in what contexts the co-implementation is cost-effective, and the optimal
  schedule for co-implementation. This will work towards supporting the policy process
  on co-implementation of malaria vaccines and PMC, and achieving the most impactful
  use of available resources for the prevention of malaria in children.'
