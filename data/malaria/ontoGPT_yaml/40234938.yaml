input_text: 'Projected uptake of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine for perennial malaria chemoprevention
  in children under 2 years of age in nine sub-Saharan African countries: an epidemiologically-based
  5-year forecast analysis. BACKGROUND: Perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC) with
  sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is recommended for children under 2 years of age
  living in areas of perennial malaria transmission. Initially delivered through the
  Expanded Programme of Immunization (EPI), recent pilot studies explored PMC delivery
  via the vitamin A supplementation programme or community health workers (CHWs).
  Understanding SP demand across the various delivery channels is key to implementing
  PMC. METHODS: A 5-year epidemiologically-based forecasting model was developed to
  estimate SP volumes required for nine sub-Saharan countries based on seven different
  scenarios considering the EPI, vitamin A or CHWs delivery channels, alone or in
  combination. Model inputs were secondary data sources, enhanced with information
  from a field survey conducted among 40 national decision-makers and 176 healthcare
  providers. Projected SP volumes were estimated based on expected coverage and uptake
  within the eligible population. The efficiency of meeting the need versus demand
  was calculated for each scenario. A sensitivity analysis was performed for base,
  low and high estimates of the coverage and uptake rates. The forecasting period
  was 2023 to 2027. RESULTS: The eligible population in the study countries was estimated
  at 21 million children in 2023. Estimated demand in 2027 ranged from 17.8 million
  SP doses for EPI to 49.6 million when combining all delivery channels. These results
  were highly dependent on the coverage and uptake rate of each delivery channel.
  The sensitivity analysis showed that uncertainty around the estimates ranged from
  twofold (Vitamin A), to 3.4-fold (CHWs). EPI was the most efficient channel overall
  (53%), but the efficiency of each scenario varied by country depending on local
  contexts. CONCLUSIONS: The model provides a tool to anticipate SP needs and demand
  for PMC under various scenarios, aiding manufacturers, donors, partners, governments,
  and procurement organizations in effective planning for PMC implementation.'
