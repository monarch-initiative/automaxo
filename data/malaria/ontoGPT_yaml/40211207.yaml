input_text: "Seasonal malaria chemoprevention in children aged 3-59 months in Mali:
  parents' perceptions, attitudes and beliefs regarding drug administration. BACKGROUND:
  In Mali, malaria remains the major endemic and leading cause of morbidity and mortality
  in the most vulnerable groups, notably children under five years of age and pregnant
  women. Achieving the goal of eliminating malaria by 2030 would be difficult, if
  not impossible, if we do not identify all the dimensions that influence the persistence
  of the disease within communities. This is why this study was conducted to assess
  the perceptions, attitudes and beliefs of parents regarding seasonal malaria chemoprevention
  in children under 5 years of age. METHODS: This study focused on 10 villages in
  the M'pessoba health area. Community consent was obtained in each village before
  starting the survey. Moreover, free and informed individual consent was obtained
  before starting to administer the questions. A questionnaire on parents' knowledge,
  attitudes and beliefs about SMC was administered randomly to at least 25 parents
  per village. RESULTS: Of the 333 parents interviewed, nearly 97.9% (n = 333) thought
  that SMC should be taken by children aged 3-59 months. According to the majority
  of the participants, SMC protects against malaria (75.7%). The majority of parents
  interviewed (79.3%) were aware that SMC was administered over 3 days. Most of the
  participants (97.3%) thought that even under SMC, children must continue to sleep
  under mosquito nets. A total of 61.9% of parents experienced side effects following
  the administration SMC medications. During our survey, 90.7% of parents confirmed
  that the children had taken the second dose, compared with 85.3% for the third dose.
  A minority of participants (33.6%) thought that taking SMC only once had a protective
  effect for 3 months. A total of 93.4% of the 333 parents interviewed were in favor
  of administering SMC to their children the following year. CONCLUSION: The study
  showed limited community perception regarding the protection period of SMC after
  taking a full dose."
