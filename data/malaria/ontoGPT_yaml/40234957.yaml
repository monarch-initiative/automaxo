input_text: "Evaluation of seasonal malaria chemoprevention implementation in the
  Upper East region of Northern Ghana. BACKGROUND: Ghana adopted the WHO-recommended
  Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention (SMC) in 2016 following a pilot study as a vital
  strategy for malaria control. SMC is the intermittent administration of a preventive
  and curative dose of anti-malarial medicine (Sulfadoxine-Pyrimetamine + Amodiaquine)
  during four months of the malaria season. This study monitored the implementation
  of SMC to ensure the intervention is achieving its target. METHODS: This was a longitudinal
  study in four administrative districts of the Upper East Region of Ghana. Children
  aged between 3 and 59 months were sampled and followed up one week after each cycle
  of SMC dosing to complete a questionnaire. SMC status was determined through the
  caregiver's report and child welfare cards, if available. Caregivers were asked
  if the participant had been treated for malaria since the last cycle. Simple and
  multiple logistic regressions were employed to determine associations between SMC
  adherence and the independent variables, with all results interpreted at a 95% confidence
  level (CI). RESULTS: This study reported an average SMC coverage of 87% (CI: 86.7-89.5)
  per cycle with a 2% dropout after the first cycle. SMC adherence rate remained above
  82% (CI: 1.4-2.5), with malaria incidence decreasing in those who received all four
  doses of SMC compared to partial recipients. Health system/programme (49%) and patient
  related factors (33%) were the main reasons reported for non-adherence. Significant
  predictors of adherence were household size (aOR = 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.08), sleeping
  under bed nets (aOR = 1.88, 95% CI 1.44-2.48), and indoor residual spraying (IRS)
  presence (aOR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.69-1.99). CONCLUSION: Despite achieving an average
  coverage of 87% per cycle, it falls short of the national target of 90%. Notable
  reasons for drop-outs and non-adherence were, the caregiver being unavailable during
  the distribution, highlighting the need for diversified approaches in SMC campaigns
  to enhance coverage, and adherence, and maximize intervention benefits."
