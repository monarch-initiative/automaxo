32459778	Simultaneous Midface Advancement and Orthognathic Surgery: A Powerful Technique for Managing Midface Hypoplasia and Malocclusion.	BACKGROUND: Midface hypoplasia dramatically affects the normative facial cascade. Simultaneous Le Fort III and Le Fort I procedures (Le Fort III/I) provide a powerful tool for achieving significant midface advancement. This study presents the authors' approach for addressing midface hypoplasia in the setting of class III malocclusion using Le Fort III/I advancement. METHODS: This was an institutional review board-approved retrospective review of patients who underwent Le Fort III/I advancement at the authors' institution from 2009 to 2019. Demographic, surgical, and postoperative data were recorded. The authors' operative technique and surgical pearls are described. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients met inclusion criteria, 15 male patients (60 percent) and 10 female patients (40 percent). Patient age ranged from 14.9 to 21.6 years. Diagnoses included Crouzon syndrome, nonsyndromic developmental skeletal dysplasia, cleft lip/palate, Klippel-Feil syndrome, Apert syndrome, Van den Ende-Gupta syndrome, and Pfeiffer syndrome. Le Fort III advancements averaged 6.18 +- 1.38 mm and Le Fort I advancements averaged 6.70 +- 2.48 mm. Thirteen patients underwent simultaneous bilateral sagittal split osteotomy with average movement of 5.85 +- 1.21 mm. Average follow-up was 1.3 +- 1.0 years. One patient experienced intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid leak that resolved with expectant management. Three patients experienced major complications (12 percent) postoperatively necessitating repeated orthognathic operations. Ten patients experienced minor complications (40 percent). Average length of stay was 10 days, with all patients achieving improvement of their facial profile. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' experience reaffirms the relative safety of simultaneous Le Fort III/I advancement. This technique should be considered in select patients with global midface retrusion and class III malocclusion. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, IV.
25929771	Correction of Brachymetatarsia and Medial Angulation of the Great Toe of Apert Foot By Distraction Osteogenesis: A Review of 7 Years of Experience.	BACKGROUND: Apert foot anomalies may cause severe problems such as pain and development of callus formation related to weight redistribution, problems with footwear, and gait disturbances that may limit their daily activities. The main purpose of this study was to review our experience with distraction osteogenesis for the correction of brachymetatarsia and the great toe angulation of the patients with Apert syndrome. METHODS: This study retrospectively reviewed 7 patients (14 extremities) followed up for Apert syndrome who underwent distraction for the correction of bilateral congenital brachymetatarsia and angulation of the great toe between 2004 and 2008. Correction of the metatarsal inclination angle, the medial angulation of the great toe, the percentage of lengthening, and lengthening rates of distracted bones were evaluated. RESULTS: Patients ranged in age from 4 to 8 years at the distraction operation, with a mean age of 5.4+-1.3 years, and the average length of follow-up was 86.6+-21.0 months. The length of the first metatarsal bone increased significantly from the average length of 32.6+-5.7 mm to an average of 46.7+-6.5 mm (P<0.001). The mean lengthening rate and lengthening percentages of distracted bones were 0.4%+-0.1%/month and 30.2%+-6.4%/month, respectively. Preoperative and postoperative metatarsal inclination angles were at a mean of 43.8+-5.12 and 32.6+-3.8, respectively, and the correction of metatarsal inclination was considered as statistically significant (P<0.001). The mean angulation of the great toe reduced significantly from 49.8+-11.76 to 13.2+-8.5 degrees after distraction (P<0.001). Minor complications such as pin loosening, pin-tract infection, and early union that required reoperation were observed in 5 extremities (35.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Anatomic features of Apert foot may lead to complaints that may limit patients' daily activities and require as much attention as associated hand and craniofacial anomalies. Distraction appears to be an effective and safe approach for the simultaneous correction of the shortness of the first ray and medial angulation of the great toe. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV.
29891270	Central Coalition Osteotomy of Phalangeal Synostoses in the Management of the Type III Apert Hand.	PURPOSE: We report a technique in the management of the type III Apert hand. The proposed approach facilitates the creation of a 5-fingered hand in 3 stages. METHODS: We reviewed records of patients with Apert syndrome and type III hands surgically treated at our institution from 1995 through 2014. In all cases, syndactyly release was performed in 3 stages with prioritization of the border digits. In addition, limited retrograde, axial osteotomies between the phalangeal segments of the conjoined index, middle, and ring fingers were performed during the first stage. Medical records were reviewed for demographics, clinical presentation, operative findings, and postoperative outcomes. RESULTS: Twelve pediatric patients with type III hands underwent syndactyly release. Median patient age was 10.0, 15.8, and 29.6 months at operative stages 1, 2, and 3, respectively. A thumb and 4 fingers were achieved for all but 1 hand. The median duration of hospital stay was 2 days for each stage. No infections or major complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate this method as a safe and effective means of creating 5 digits in the Apert patient with type III hands. Our opinion is that the additional aesthetic and functional gains offset the requirement of a 3-stage approach. TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic IV.
24709088	Assessing the corrective effects of facial bipartition distraction in Apert syndrome using geometric morphometrics.	UNLABELLED: Apert syndrome is a congenital disorder characterized by craniosynostosis and midface hypoplasia. This study looks to identify to what extent bipartition distraction corrects the morphological abnormalities of this condition. Preoperative and postoperative three-dimensional computed tomography (3DCT) scans of 10 patients with Apert syndrome (12-21 years) were identified from the Great Ormond Street Hospital database. To analyse preoperative and postoperative scans, 98 landmarks and 13 normal skulls were used. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to analyse patterns in the datasets. Within each group, eigenvectors were identified that demonstrated the aspects of the skull where most variations were found. The analysis allowed both global shape measurement and local proportions. Postoperative and normal scans both showed the same first three principal components. Warping from preoperative to postoperative illustrates midface advancement and inward rotation of the orbits. Postoperative to normal warps demonstrate some remaining differences. The reliability of the used land marks varied between 77% and 95% for the highly reproducible landmarks between the two observers. 95% versus 100% were at least acceptable reproducible landmarks. This study allows us to understand the way bipartition distraction corrects the abnormalities of the Apert skull. Analysing the surgical outcome of facial bipartition with geometric morphometrics shows that some major Apert characteristics are corrected. Using the data and the output of further studies, surgical procedures can be adapted in order to achieve a postoperative result closer to the normal population. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic clinical question Level IV.
25569391	Complications in 54 frontofacial distraction procedures in patients with syndromic craniosynostosis.	Patients with syndromic craniosynostosis manifest midfacial hypoplasia often treated by midfacial advancement. Benefits of midfacial advancement by distraction osteogenesis have been well studied; little is known about the perioperative morbidity of these procedures, specifically relating to device selection. This study compares the perioperative complications between semiburied- and halo-type distraction osteogenesis of the midface. A retrospective review was performed on all patients with syndromic craniosynostosis who underwent midface distraction with semiburied- or halo-type external distractors. Demographic information and operative/postoperative course were reviewed. Complications were categorized as hardware-related, infectious, and either as major (requiring additional intervention) or minor (requiring medication only). Chi-squared and Fisher exact test were used to compare variables.From 1999 to 2012, a total of 54 patients underwent midface distraction osteogenesis, including 23 patients with Apert syndrome, 19 patients with Crouzon syndrome, 10 patients with Pfeiffer syndrome, and 2 patients with other craniofacial syndromes. Thirty-three patients underwent a total of 34 subcranial Le Fort III distraction procedures and 21 underwent 21 monobloc distraction procedures. The mean age during surgery was 8.0 (range, 4.0-17.7) years, whereas the mean time between distractor placement and removal was 102.9 days. Thirty procedures were performed with external halo-type distractors (18 Le Fort III and 12 monobloc distractions), whereas 25 were performed with buried midface distractors (16 Le Fort III and 9 monobloc distractions). There were no significant differences in diagnoses or interventions between the distraction devices. Of the 19 distractor-related complications, there were a total of 10 (18.2%) in the halo group including 5 (9.1%) requiring separate operative intervention as well as 9 (16.4%) in the buried distractor group including 6 (10.1%) requiring separate operative intervention. Major infections were more common in the buried distractor group (n = 8) compared with the halo distractor group (n = 3) (P = 0.048). There were 4 (7.3%) patients in the halo group who had malposition or transcranial pin migration related to postoperative positioning or falls and required operative repositioning. Frontofacial distraction is an important technique in patients with syndromic craniosynostosis. Higher rates of halo displacement requiring surgery are offset with lower rates of infections compared with buried distractors.

25313108	Visual surveillance in craniosynostoses.	Craniosynostosis is the premature fusion of one or more cranial sutures that may be isolated or syndromic. These children can have multiple developmental issues including speech, hearing, and vision, in addition to the aesthetic issue of an abnormally shaped skull and midfacial hypoplasia. As the aesthetic outcomes of craniofacial surgery have improved, attention has turned on the functional outcomes and visual loss is a well-known problem with these patients. In the past 15 years, a greater understanding of the causes of visual loss has developed. Factors such as amblyopia, corneal exposure, and optic neuropathy are all now looked for to prevent or reduce visual loss. Optic neuropathy is caused by craniocerebral disproportion (though to a lesser extent than originally thought), cerebral hypo perfusion, hydrocephalus, and obstructive sleep apnea. Amblyopia is due to increased incidence of strabismus, anisometropia, astigmatism, and ametropia in these cases. A comprehensive approach to managing these children's visual function allows the clinician to reduce potential visual loss in children with craniosynostoses especially the syndromic variety. 
33136789	Apert Hand Reconstruction: Do Partial-Thickness Skin Grafts Result in Flexion Scar Contracture?	BACKGROUND: Hand reconstruction for patients with Apert syndrome is a critical step in comprehensive care and enables this population to gain significant hand function. Digit separation for Apert syndrome, as described in most algorithms, is finalized using local flaps and full-thickness skin grafts. The objective of this study is to report our experience using local flaps and partial-thickness skin grafts after digit separation for Apert hand reconstruction. METHODS: An observational retrospective study was performed with Apert patients whose hands were reconstructed between January 2007 and July 2019 using local flaps and partial-thickness skin grafts after digit separation. Demographic data and outcome data were verified and recorded. RESULTS: Out of a total of 75 Apert patients who underwent hand reconstruction, 12 underwent hand reconstruction utilizing local flaps and partial-thickness skin grafts. The average patient age at the time of the first procedure was 1.9 years. These 12 patients were stratified according to Upton hand severity, 3 being type I (25%), 3 being type II (25%) and 6 being type III (50%). Mean follow up provided to all patients in this study was 1.8 years and donor site-related complications were seen in 2 patients (16.6%). No flexion scar contracture was observed in any of the patients who received partial-thickness skin grafts. CONCLUSIONS: The use of local flaps along with partial-thickness skin grafts to finalize digit separation for patients with Apert syndrome is an effective technique that reduces donor site morbidity and does not result in flexion scar contracture.
23508053	Normalizing facial ratios in apert syndrome patients with Le Fort II midface distraction and simultaneous zygomatic repositioning.	BACKGROUND: Le Fort III distraction advances the Apert midface but leaves the central concavity and vertical compression untreated. The authors propose that Le Fort II distraction and simultaneous zygomatic repositioning as a combined procedure can move the central midface and lateral orbits in independent vectors in order to improve the facial deformity. The purpose of this study was to determine whether this segmental movement results in more normal facial proportions than Le Fort III distraction. METHODS: Computed tomographic scan analyses were performed before and after distraction in patients undergoing Le Fort III distraction (n = 5) and Le Fort II distraction with simultaneous zygomatic repositioning (n = 4). The calculated axial facial ratios and vertical facial ratios relative to the skull base were compared to those of unoperated Crouzon (n = 5) and normal (n = 6) controls. RESULTS: With Le Fort III distraction, facial ratios did not change with surgery and remained lower (p < 0.01; paired t test comparison) than normal and Crouzon controls. Although the face was advanced, its shape remained abnormal. With the Le Fort II segmental movement procedure, the central face advanced and lengthened more than the lateral orbit. This differential movement changed the abnormal facial ratios that were present before surgery into ratios that were not significantly different from normal controls (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Compared with Le Fort III distraction, Le Fort II distraction with simultaneous zygomatic repositioning normalizes the position and the shape of the Apert face.

25693342	[Air-Q  intubating laryngeal airway as a conduit for tracheal intubation in a patient with Apert syndrome: a case report].	We present a case of an 18-year-old male who underwent strabismus operation under general anesthesia. In his childhood, tracheostomy had been performed for the repair of cleft lip and palate. His Mallampati classification was IV and preoperative endoscopic examination revealed megaloglossia and severe airway narrowing. For possible difficult airway, intubating laryngeal airway (air-Q , size 2.5) was used for tracheal intubation. Following insertion of air-Q , trachea was intubated via air-Q  guided with fiberscope. The patient was ventilated via tracheal tube with the air-Q  remaining in place during the operation. air-Q  can be effectively utilized for airway management for an adult Apert syndrome patient
28906337	A Three-Dimensional Study of Midfacial Changes Following Le Fort II Distraction With Zygomatic Repositioning in Syndromic Patients.	Le Fort II distraction with zygomatic repositioning introduced the ability to restore central midfacial height and convexity independent of changes in orbital morphology. This study analyzes midfacial and orbital morphology before and after Le Fort II distraction with zygomatic repositioning.All patients who underwent Le Fort II Distraction with zygomatic repositioning between 2013 and 2015 were included. Two- and 3-dimensional measurements were made using 3dMD Vultus software to assess canthal tilt, nasolabial angle, ratio of midfacial to lower facial height, and absolute change in nasal length. Presence of an open bite and Angle classification were assessed before and after surgery.Four patients underwent segmental midface advancement using Le Fort II distraction with zygomatic repositioning. Associated diagnoses included Apert syndrome, Goldenhar syndrome, and achondroplasia. Changes in facial dimensions included: 3.19  improvement in canthal tilt (range -4.7  to 8.4 ), 9  change in nasolabial angle (range -1.0  to 19 ), and 0.69 cm increase in absolute nasal length (range 0.2-0.94 cm). Mean ratio of midfacial to lower facial height was 0.79 preoperatively and 0.89 postoperatively. Preoperatively, all patients demonstrated Angle class III with 3 of 4 patients demonstrating anterior open bite. All achieved closure of open bite and demonstrated class I or II occlusion. No complications were observed.Le Fort II distraction with zygomatic repositioning resulted in normalization of midfacial soft tissue landmarks. This form of advancement demonstrates the ability to selectively improve midfacial height and canthal tilt while restoring normal occlusion.
31895846	Apert Syndrome Management: Changing Treatment Algorithm.	BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to review 10 years of surgical experience in the management of Apert syndrome, focusing on an updated algorithm which includes hand reconstruction and posterior vault distraction osteogenesis (PVDO). Additionally, the authors compare PVDO, which is currently used, with fronto-orbital advancement (FOA), which was utilized in a previous algorithm. METHODS: An observational retrospective study was performed on consecutive patients with Apert syndrome who underwent upper and lower limb reconstruction and craniofacial surgery between 2007 and 2017. A modified Clavien-Dindo surgical complication scale was used to stratify complications between PVDO and FOA. Demographic, surgical, and outcome data was also recorded. The blood transfusion rate between PVDO and FOA was also assessed and compared utilizing the Student t test. RESULTS: The present study included 69 patients with Apert syndrome (34 males and 35 females). Craniofacial surgeries were performed on a total of 38 patients. A total of 210 operations were performed on the respective upper and lower limbs of patients included in this study. A total of 18 patients underwent PVDO (n = 9) and FOA (n = 9). Posterior vault distraction osteogenesis required significantly less transfused blood volume than FOA (P < 0.05). Complication rate and length of hospital stay were similar for each procedure. CONCLUSION: An updated algorithm to treat Apert patients was implemented. Posterior vault distraction osteogenesis incorporated into an updated algorithm results in a lower blood transfusion rate.
22901909	The role of bronchoscopy in the management of patients with severe craniofacial syndromes.	PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to assess the incidence of airway anomalies in children with severe craniofacial syndromes and to establish the role of bronchoscopy in the care of these patients. METHODS: Consecutive children with craniofacial syndromes, including both bony deformities of the skull and face, in which a bronchoscopy was performed between 1995 and 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients (22 boys, 14 girls; mean age, 39 months) were studied. Craniofacial synostosis was present in 21 patients (Crouzen syndrome, 11; Apert syndrome, 7, Pfeiffer syndrome, 3) and craniofacial dysostosis in 15 (Goldenhart syndrome, 8; Treacher Collins syndrome, 7). In 30 patients (83.3%), bronchoscopy was performed because of respiratory symptoms (apneic episodes, 22; respiratory distress, 13; stridor, 6; cyanosis, 1) and, in the remaining 6 (asymptomatic children), during guided tracheal intubation before a surgical procedure. Airway anomalies were found in 69.4% of patients (70% in symptomatic patients). Management consisted of tracheotomy in 13 patients, adenoidectomy/tonsillectomy in 13, glossopexy in 5, antireflux surgery in 3, and supraglottoplasty in 2. CONCLUSIONS: Airway anomalies occurred in 70% of children with severe craniofacial syndromes and respiratory symptoms. Bronchoscopy should be performed routinely in this selected group of patients, and the entire airway must be examined. Treatment should be tailored to each individual patient.
22449603	Craniofacial team management in Apert syndrome.	INTRODUCTION: Apert syndrome is one of the rarest of the craniosynostosis syndromes. Affected persons have extensive structural and functional impairments, some of which can be life threatening. Management requires team care from infancy to adulthood. The purposes of this article are to assess the outcomes in individuals with Apert syndrome after completion of treatment and to review current protocols for craniofacial team care and dental, orthodontic, and orthognathic surgical management. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of 8 subjects with Apert syndrome. Cephalograms at 2 time points were compared: adolescence (before midface advancement) and at least 1 year after advancement. The cephalometric values were compared with paired t tests. Team protocols are delineated. RESULTS: Measurements indicating forward positioning of the maxilla increased significantly: SNA by 10.7  (P = 0.002) and midface length by 9.6 mm (P = 0.002). Sagittal jaw relationship improved significantly as well: ANB by 14  (P = 0.004) and the Wits appraisal by 8 mm (P = 0.003). Vertical dimensions also increased. CONCLUSIONS: All individuals had significantly improved and stable positions of the midface and normalized facial profiles after treatment.
31137453	Apert Syndrome: Intraoperative and Postoperative Hyponatremia.	Apert syndrome is one of the acrocephalosyndactilia syndromes that is characterized with calvarial an extremity deformities. Anesthesia management of this syndrome is commonly related with difficult airway. However, hyponatremia is another insistent complication that can occur during craniosynostosis surgeries. Hyponatremia is a common complication during calvarial remodeling surgeries and it can result in serious neurologic damage. Development of mild hyponatremia in a patient with Apert syndrome that went under craniosynostosis surgery was presented in this study.
23157089	[Use of the air-Q intubating laryngeal airway for tracheal intubation in predicted difficult airway management in a pediatric patient].	The intubating laryngeal airway, air-Q ILA, was recently introduced in Japan. It has been used in adult patients for difficult airway management; however, there are few reports available on its use in pediatric patients. We report the use of the air-Q ILA in predicted difficult airway management in a 16-month-old patient with Apert syndrome characterized by acrocephalosyndactyly undergoing a syndactyly operation. It was somewhat difficult to keep his airway with a facemask, and an air-Q ILA was inserted. Following the ventilation via air-Q ILA, tracheal intubation guided by a tracheal fiberscope was attempted through the air-Q ILA. Five months after this operation, the patient again underwent the same operation. We managed his airway in the same way as previously, and the tracheal was intubated. This case shows that the air-Q ILA can be an alternative device in pediatric difficult airway management.
28338248	Surgical strategy for Apert syndrome: Retrospective study of developmental quotient and three-dimensional computerized tomography.	There are many surgical techniques for craniosynostosis. However, the indications for and timing of surgery still remain unclarified. Most of the skull growth in craniosynostosis is completed in the first year, and the bone is strong enough to undergo distraction osteogenesis. However, previous reports showed that patients operated on before 1 year of age had better IQ than those operated later in life. This report aims to consider the best timing for cranial expansion and surgical strategy for Apert syndrome. From January 2002 to December 2011, 13 patients with Apert syndrome were operated on and were followed up for more than 5 years. Nine patients underwent operations before 1 year of age (early surgery group) and three patients underwent operations later in life (late surgery group). They underwent fronto-orbital advancement for primary surgery. We evaluated postoperative developmental quotient every year and cephalic index (CI) measured by three-dimensional computerized tomography (3D-CT) at the age over 5 years retrospectively. Eleven of 13 patients improved their developmental quotient scores, with no significant intergroup differences. The CI evaluation showed cases with remnant brachycephalic deformity in both groups. Two patients with remnant plagiocephalic deformities tend to have primary surgery early in life compared to the others. Thus the delay in primary surgery had little influence on psychological development. We conclude that the primary surgery can be delayed unless the intracranial pressure needs to be controlled. In addition, fronto-orbital advancement could not sufficiently improve the brachycephalic appearance, other procedures like posterior vault distraction might be better alternatives.
28820838	Five-Year Follow-Up of Midface Distraction in Growing Children with Syndromic Craniosynostosis.	BACKGROUND: Maxillary position in patients with syndromic craniosynostosis after midface distraction has been shown to be stable 1 year postoperatively. The purpose of this study is to assess midfacial position in the growing child with craniosynostosis 5 years after Le Fort III advancement with a rigid external device. METHODS: Seventeen consecutive patients were identified to have the diagnosis of syndromic craniosynostosis and had undergone midface advancement [corrected]. There were 10 boys and seven girls, seven patients had Crouzon syndrome, five had Apert syndrome, and five had Pfeiffer syndrome. A standard subcranial Le Fort III osteotomy was performed. Cephalometric analysis was performed to assess the position of the maxilla. RESULTS: After device removal, orbitale advanced 13.67 mm along the x axis and downward 1.70 mm along the y axis. The A point advanced 15.97 mm along the x axis and downward 1.14 mm along the y axis. At 1 year after distraction, both orbitale and A point had advanced an additional 0.47 mm and 0.24 mm along the x axis and downward 0.58 mm and 1.78 mm along the y axis, respectively. At 5 years after distraction, the orbitale moved posterior 0.58 mm and the A point advanced an additional 2.08 mm along the x axis. Orbitale and A point descended 3.23 mm and 5.2 mm along the y axis, respectively. CONCLUSION: After Le Fort III advancement with distraction, the maxillary position remains stable and continues to advance minimally along the x axis and demonstrates more growth along the y axis over the long term. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, IV.
23170942	Reconstruction of the hand in Apert syndrome: two case reports and a literature review of updated strategies for diagnosis and management.	BACKGROUND: Apert syndrome is a set of complex malformations of the first brachial arch, with manifestations on the skull, face, hands and feet. At the level of the hand, the following signs are always present: complex syndactyly of the second, third and fourth digits with distal bone fusion; simple syndactyly of the fifth digit; foreshortened thumb with radial clinodactily; and symphalangism excluding the fifth digit. METHODS: The digital separation of an Apert hand should begin at 9 months of age and should be completed by 2 to 4 years of age. Our simplified approach consists of early bilateral surgery on border digits followed by unilateral separation of middle syndactily combined with thumb and digit osteotomies and bone grafting as required. RESULTS: Between 1995 and 2010 seven patients with Apert syndrome underwent reconstructive surgery of the complex hand syndactyly. The main target in our surgical strategy involved early bilateral separation of border digits, which started between 1 and 2 years of age. The unilateral middle syndactyly mass division with osteotomy of the thumb and other digits and bone grafting (as required) was carried out in later surgeries, which are usually completed by 4 years of age. The evaluation of the results was performed based on the functional results of the hand, morbidity, flap necrosis, skin graft lysis, postoperative range of motion in the small joints, gross grasp, pincer grasp, scar appearance, contractures of digits, and aesthetic outcome. CONCLUSION: As intended, this study proves the need for a complex surgical approach as early as possible with low revision rate, and acceptable functional and aesthetic outcome.

33039308	Assessment of long-term quality of life in patients with syndromic craniosynostosis.	Several studies have analyzed the long-term stability of cranioplasty and midface distraction in patients with craniosynostosis; however, few studies have investigated long-term quality of life (QOL) and complications in adults with syndromic craniosynostosis. This study aimed to investigate the QOL (social, physical, and psychosocial) of patients with adult syndromic craniosynostosis. Patients aged >=20 years with syndromic craniosynostosis, who were surgically treated at a single craniofacial institution, were included in this study. We investigated everyday inconvenience (using the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule questionnaire), any ongoing treatment, marital status, and number of children. Totally, 18 patients aged 22-48 years (mean: 31.4 +- 9.2 years) answered the questionnaire (Crouzon syndrome, 9; Apert syndrome, 5; Pfeiffer syndrome, 4). Of these, only one Crouzon syndrome patient was married; she was also the only one with a child. Apert syndrome patients were found to have difficulty in understanding, communication, and self-care because of their mental retardation and hand and foot handicaps; however, their participation in society was the most aggressive. In contrast, Crouzon syndrome patients had especially poor participation in society. In all patients, any ongoing hospital treatment was due to ophthalmological conditions. Crouzon syndrome patients have extremely poor QOL; the absence of mental retardation and hand and foot handicaps forces them to live in mainstream society, for which they are emotionally ill-equipped. It is necessary to treat these patients without any residual deformity to provide psychological support and to create an accepting society.

23271523	Apert syndrome:  evaluation of a treatment algorithm.	BACKGROUND: The authors catalogued phenotypic variability among children with Apert syndrome, reviewed surgical outcomes (particularly with respect to their treatment goals of avoiding preventable developmental delays and reducing operative interventions), and examined correlations that might stimulate improved treatment paradigms. METHODS: A case series review of all Apert syndrome patients, treated by a single surgeon, including phenotypic variations, mutational analyses, developmental assessments, and surgical treatments, was performed. RESULTS: Over a 20-year period, 135 Apert syndrome patients were treated (32 percent from birth). A fairly even distribution of mutations was noted (S252W, n = 20; P253R, n = 18). Of 268 hands, 60 percent were type I, 21 percent were type II, and 19 percent were type III. Fifty percent had palatal anomalies. Three separate skull configuration types were identified, and 29 percent had acquired Chiari malformations, 24 percent had anomalies of the septum pellucidum, and 12 percent had anomalies of the corpus callosum. Cranial and midfacial procedures were performed significantly earlier at outside centers (6.2 months versus 12.6 months, and 5.3 years versus 7.5 years). No significant correlations were noted between development and gene mutation, hand or skull phenotypes, intracranial anomalies, and timing of initial skull surgery. A significant correlation was noted between adverse development and ventriculoperitoneal shunts, tracheostomies, and more operative interventions. Higher development strongly correlated with treatment at our center from birth. CONCLUSION: Treatment goals focused on the prevention of avoidable developmental delays (from raised intracranial pressure and sleep apnea) and reducing operative interventions may potentially improve developmental outcomes. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, III.

26365357	Perifascial areolar tissue grafting for treating syndactyly with bone fusion in patients with Apert syndrome.	Complete syndactyly with bone fusion in patients with Apert syndrome was treated using perifascial areolar tissue (PAT) grafts via a two-stage surgery (i.e. bone separation using inter-bone PAT graft insertion followed by web separation and reconstruction with full-thickness skin grafts). This technique is easy and created nail folds for fingertips.
32398550	Management of Paronychia in Patients With Apert Syndrome.	Apert syndrome is a complex congenital syndrome that includes bicoronal craniosynostosis, craniofacial dysmorphologies, cleft palate, hearing loss, spina bifida occulta, cardiac anomalies, and affects the upper and lower extremities-producing complex syndactyly in these patients. Management of the hands yields several challenges and mandates close follow-up to balance repair of complex polysyndactyly with other pressing interventions, such as posterior cranial vault distraction and surgical management of the airway. Our goals of therapy for the hands are to preserve 10 digits, provide sufficient soft tissue coverage, optimize hand function, and minimize the number of surgical interventions. Ideally, surgical management of the hand differences occurs between the ages of 9 months and 2 years, to optimize neurocognitive development. In complex syndactyly observed in patients with Apert syndrome, there are broad, conjoined nail plates that overlie the fused digits, and paronychia occurs frequently. Suppurative infections can delay definitive surgical intervention for the patient's complex syndactyly, and resolution of paronychia is critical. This study aims to propose an effective and safe technique to manage paronychia when it occurs in patients with Apert complex syndactyly and to mitigate the length of delay to definitive polysyndactyly reconstruction. In the context of these patients' need for multiple surgical interventions within the first few years of life, this strategy for preventing or mitigating paronychia can play an important role in streamlining their complex surgical management while avoiding multiple cancellations.
26674912	Management of the Airway in Apert Syndrome.	The management of the airway in Apert syndrome is complex and multidisciplinary. This rare syndrome, occurring in up to approximately 1 in 65,000 live births, results in airway compromise at various anatomic levels, in addition to abnormal central respiratory drive. Obstructive apneas arise because of decreased airway caliber, which may occur in the form of congenital bony nasal stenosis, choanal atresia, a deviated nasal septum, a narrowed nasopharynx, a thick long soft palate, lateral palatal swellings, and a tracheal cartilage sleeve. Central apneas in Apert syndrome arise because of raised intracranial pressure and/or Chiari malformations. The purpose of this study was to investigate our treatment methods and outcomes in optimizing the airway in this complex, rare and interesting cohort of patients who present with airway compromise. Patients with Apert syndrome were retrospectively evaluated during a period from 1990 to 2013. Treatments for obstructive apnea were dilatation of nasal airways and choanal atresia repair, adenoidectomy, tonsillectomy, early midface advancement, and noninvasive ventilation. The insertion of ventriculoperitoneal shunts, fronto-orbital advancement, and Chiari decompression aid in managing central apneas. The authors present our experience at Alder Hey Children's Hospital, Liverpool, one of the 4 Supraregional Craniofacial Units in the United Kingdom. 
33710128	Satisfying Clinical and Functional Results in 12 Apert Children Treated With Soft Tissue Distractor.	BACKGROUND: The complex syndactyly in Apert syndrome hands is challenging to operate. The synostosis and tightness of skin between third and fourth digits lead to severe coverage problems during ray release. A soft tissue distractor can simplify the release with the aim to keep all 10 fingers. METHODS: A retrospective follow-up of 12 patients/24 hands, median age 8 years (6 to 17 y), 6 boys and 6 girls, operated between 2000 and 2013 was done from 2015 to 2016. The surgical management started with syndactyly release of the first and fourth web, and later of the second. The third stage was placing a soft tissue distractor on the third and fourth finger after osteotomy on the synostosis between them. Four weeks of distraction and 2 weeks of rest resulted in regenerated skin between the digits giving much better coverage of the released digits at time of separation 6 weeks later. Assessment of hand function, grip strength and completion of the Patient Reported Outcome Measure CHEQ was performed. RESULTS: Soft tissue coverage at the time of digit separation was considerably facilitated. We experienced 2 infections in 2 hands. In 18/24 hands median 2 (1 to 3) small full thickness skin grafts were needed, usually for coverage of the base of the digits. All wounds healed well. The children managed different practical tasks well, alternating between best functioning grip depending on the activity. According to CHEQ, the children did median 19 (13 to 27) activities independently and median 8 (2 to 15) nonindependently, of a total of 29. Peak strength values for 10/12 children were for the right hand median 17.8% (9.6% to 40.6%) of normative data and for left hand median 13.6% (2.4% to 20.5%) of normative data. CONCLUSION: Soft tissue distraction facilitates the treatment of acrocephalosyndactyly hands, giving 5-fingered hands. Apert children manage many activities independently but struggled with fine motor skills demanding strength. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV evidence.
28468151	Tracheal Cartilaginous Sleeve in Syndromic Craniosynostosis: An Underrecognized Source of Significant Morbidity and Mortality.	Tracheal cartilaginous sleeve (TCS) is a rare and previously unrecognized source of morbidity and mortality in patients with certain craniosynostosis syndromes. There is a paucity of reporting on this airway anomaly, and the true incidence of TCS is largely unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of TCS among patients with syndromic craniosynostosis at our institution. Patients with syndromic craniosynostosis who underwent direct bronchoscopy and laryngoscopy were evaluated retrospectively by pediatric otolaryngologists for the presence of TCS and associated anomalies. Among patients with a diagnosis of syndromic craniosynostosis in our craniofacial database, 10 (37%) were found to have previous direct bronchoscopy and laryngoscopy reports. Of these 10 patients, 2 had Crouzon syndrome, 3 had Pfeiffer syndrome, 3 had Apert syndrome, 1 had Muenke syndrome, and 1 had Antley-Bixler syndrome. Eighty percent (8/10) of these patients were found to have some evidence of TCS. The most commonly observed associated findings included the following: tracheostomy dependency (7/10; 70%), hearing loss (6/10; 60%), obstructive sleep apnea (5/10; 50%), cervical spine anomalies (5/10; 50%), developmental delay (5/10; 50%), and enlarged cerebral ventricles (4/10; 40%). Larger multicenter studies are required to further characterize this airway anomaly and its impact on this patient population. Our results confirm the importance of thorough airway evaluation at initial presentation and the need for validated screening protocols.
22196295	The Apert hand--angiographic planning of a single-stage, 5-digit release for all classes of deformity.	PURPOSE: To demonstrate the utility of computed tomography angiographic planning of a single-stage, complete release of syndactyly in Apert syndrome. METHODS: Computed tomography angiograms were performed as a preoperative planning tool in 6 patients. Five came to surgery. All had a single-stage operation for complete release of their syndactyly. RESULTS: Five patients, ranging from Upton type 1 to type 3 Apert hand deformities, have had preoperative computed tomography angiography that delineated the vascular anatomy. This allowed planning and execution of a single-stage syndactyly release in all patients. The preoperative imaging identified noteworthy abnormalities in vascular anatomy that were incorporated into surgical planning. CONCLUSIONS: The protocol presented allows preoperative planning and single-stage operation for complete release of syndactyly in patients with Apert syndrome.
31348830	The impact of chemo- and radiotherapy treatments on selfish de novo FGFR2 mutations in sperm of cancer survivors.	STUDY QUESTION: What effect does cancer treatment have on levels of spontaneous selfish fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) point mutations in human sperm? SUMMARY ANSWER: Chemotherapy and radiotherapy do not increase levels of spontaneous FGFR2 mutations in sperm but, unexpectedly, highly-sterilizing treatments dramatically reduce the levels of the disease-associated c.755C > G (Apert syndrome) mutation in sperm. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Cancer treatments lead to short-term increases in gross DNA damage (chromosomal abnormalities and DNA fragmentation) but the long-term effects, particularly at the single nucleotide resolution level, are poorly understood. We have exploited an ultra-sensitive assay to directly quantify point mutation levels at the FGFR2 locus. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: 'Selfish' mutations are disease-associated mutations that occur spontaneously in the sperm of most men and their levels typically increase with age. Levels of mutations at c.752-755 of FGFR2 (including c.755C > G and c.755C > T associated with Apert and Crouzon syndromes, respectively) in semen post-cancer treatment from 18 men were compared to levels in pre-treatment samples from the same individuals (n = 4) or levels in previously screened population controls (n = 99). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Cancer patients were stratified into four different groups based on the treatments they received and the length of time for spermatogenesis recovery. DNA extracted from semen samples was analysed using a previously established highly sensitive assay to identify mutations at positions c.752-755 of FGFR2. Five to ten micrograms of semen genomic DNA was spiked with internal controls for quantification purposes, digested with MboI restriction enzyme and gel extracted. Following PCR amplification, further MboI digestion and a nested PCR with barcoding primers, samples were sequenced on Illumina MiSeq. Mutation levels were determined relative to the spiked internal control; in individuals heterozygous for a nearby common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), mutations were phased to their respective alleles. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Patients treated with moderately-sterilizing alkylating regimens and who recovered spermatogenesis within <3 years after therapy (Group 3, n = 4) or non - alkylating chemotherapy and/or low gonadal radiation doses (Group 1, n = 4) had mutation levels similar to untreated controls. However, patients who had highly-sterilizing alkylating treatments (i.e. >5 years to spermatogenesis recovery) (Group 2, n = 7) or pelvic radiotherapy (Group 4, n = 3) exhibited c.755C > G mutation levels at or below background. Two patients (A and B) treated with highly-sterilizing alkylating agents demonstrated a clear reduction from pre-treatment levels; however pre-treatment samples were not available for the other patients with low mutation levels. Therefore, although based on their age we would expect detectable levels of mutations, we cannot exclude the possibility that these patients also had low mutation levels pre-treatment. In three patients with low c.755C > G levels at the first timepoint post-treatment, we observed increasing mutation levels over time. For two such patients we could phase the mutation to a nearby polymorphism (SNP) and determine that the mutation counts likely originated from a single or a small number of mutational events. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This study was limited to 18 patients with different treatment regimens; for nine of the 18 patients, samples from only one timepoint were available. Only 12 different de novo substitutions at the FGFR2 c.752-755 locus were assessed, two of which are known to be disease associated. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our data add to the body of evidence from epidemiological studies and experimental data in humans suggesting that male germline stem cells are resilient to the accumulation of spontaneous mutations. Collectively, these data should provide physicians and health-care professionals with reassuring experimental-based evidence for counselling of male cancer patients contemplating their reproductive options several years after treatment.

33619359	Insights and future directions of potential genetic therapy for Apert syndrome: A systematic review.	Apert syndrome is a genetic disorder characterised by craniosynostosis and structural discrepancy of the craniofacial region as well as the hands and feet. This condition is closely linked with fibroblast growth factor receptor-2 (FGFR2) gene mutations. Gene therapies are progressively being tested in advanced clinical trials, leading to a rise of its potential clinical indications. In recent years, research has made great progress in the gene therapy of craniosynostosis syndromes and several studies have investigated its influences in preventing/diminishing the complications of Apert syndrome. This article reviewed and exhibited different techniques of gene therapy and their influences in Apert syndrome progression. A systematic search was executed using electronic bibliographic databases including PubMed, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, SciFinder and Web of Science for all studies of gene therapy for Apert syndrome. The primary outcomes measurements vary from protein to gene expressions. According to the findings of included studies, we conclude that the gene therapy using FGF in Apert syndrome was critical in the regulation of suture fusion and patency, occurred via alterations in cellular proliferation. The superior outcome could be brought by biological therapies targeting the FGF/FGFR signalling. More studies in molecular genetics in Apert syndrome are recommended. This study reviews the current literature and provides insights to future possibilities of genetic therapy as intervention in Apert syndrome.
28570459	Alar Pinning in Rigid External Distraction for Midfacial Hypoplasia.	BACKGROUND: Distraction osteogenesis with a rigid external distractor is a widely accepted treatment for midfacial hypoplasia. In this study, the authors introduce the utilization of alar pinning with the external halo distractor for maxillary advancement, in place of an oral splint. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted of 7 patients who successfully underwent distraction osteogenesis using the alar pinning technique. Midfacial hypoplasia was secondary to Crouzon syndrome (n = 4), Apert syndrome (n = 1), Pfeiffer syndrome (n = 1), or bacterial meningitis (n = 1). Three patients were managed with monobloc osteotomies, 2 with Le Fort III osteotomies, 1 with Le Fort III osteotomy and frontoorbital advancement, and 1 with Le Fort I osteotomy alone. Patient charts were analyzed for postoperative course and complications relating to the alar pins. RESULTS: Two patients had minor complications specifically related to the alar pins. One patient had concern for a mild skin infection at a pin site that resolved with oral antibiotics. The other patient had loosening of an alar pin, which did not require operative management. Retrospective chart review indicated that all patients were pleased with their results from the distraction, and no patients opted for further advancement. DISCUSSION: Utilization of alar pin sites for external distraction is a feasible and reasonable option for treatment of midfacial hypoplasia involving a Le Fort osteotomy or monobloc procedure. Fixation sites within the alar crease minimize the visibility of pin site scars and eliminate the need for a custom-made oral splint, which prevents usage of the upper dentition and frequently requires consulting a dentist or orthodontist for fabrication. CONCLUSIONS: Alar pinning with an external halo distraction system for management of midfacial hypoplasia has minimal complications and is an alternative to using a custom-made oral splint.
29351022	A Survey of Orthodontic Treatment in Team Care for Patients With Syndromic Craniosynostosis in Japan.	"OBJECTIVE: To understand the actual condition of orthodontic treatment in team care for patients with syndromic craniosynostosis (SCS) in Japan. DESIGN: A nationwide collaborative survey. SETTING: Twenty-four orthodontic clinics in Japan. PATIENTS: A total of 246 patients with SCS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Treatment history was examined based on orthodontic records using common survey sheets. RESULTS: Most patients first visited the orthodontic clinic in the deciduous or mixed dentition phase. Midface advancement was performed without visiting the orthodontic clinic in about a quarter of the patients, and more than a half of the patients underwent ""surgery-first"" midface advancement. First-phase orthodontic treatment was carried out in about a half of the patients, and maxillary expansion and protraction were performed. Tooth extraction was required in about two-thirds of patients, and the extraction of maxillary teeth was required in most patients. Tooth abnormalities were found in 37.8% of patients, and abnormalities of maxillary molars were frequently (58.3%) found in patients who had undergone midface surgery below the age of 6 years. CONCLUSIONS: Many patients underwent ""surgery-first"" midface advancement, and visiting the orthodontic clinic at least before advancement was considered desirable. First-phase orthodontic treatment should be performed considering the burden of care. Midface advancement below the age of 6 years had a high risk of injury to the maxillary molars. This survey is considered useful for improving orthodontic treatment in team care of patients with SCS."
34133757	Complex Airway Management in Patients with Tracheal Cartilaginous Sleeves.	OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: A tracheal cartilaginous sleeve (TCS) is a rare anomaly characterized by anterior fusion of tracheal cartilages. TCS is associated with syndromic craniosynostoses including Apert, Crouzon and Pfeiffer syndromes and FGFR2, FGFR3, and TWIST1 variants. This study presents a 30-year review of patients with syndromic craniosynostosis and TCS and describes diagnostic methods, genetic variants, surgical interventions, and long-term outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective, single-institution review. METHODS: This review included patients with syndromic craniosynostosis and TCS treated at Seattle Children's Hospital from 1990 to 2020. Tracheostomy, genetic variants, and additional surgery were primary measures. Fisher's exact test compared need for tracheostomy in patients with proposed high-risk (FGFR2 p.W290 or FGFR2 p.C342) versus low-risk genetic variants. RESULTS: Thirty patients with TCS were identified. Average age at diagnosis was 12 months (range 2-weeks to 7.9-years; standard deviation 19.8 months). Syndromes included Pfeiffer (37%), Apert (37%), and Crouzon (26%). Severe obstructive sleep apnea was present in 76% of patients. Tracheostomy was performed in 17 patients (57%); five were successfully decannulated. Additional interventions included adenotonsillectomy (57%), nasal (20%), laryngeal (17%), and craniofacial skeletal surgery (87%). All patients with Pfeiffer syndrome and FGFR2 p.W290C variants and 83% of patients with FGFR2 p.C342 variants required tracheostomy, differing from other variants (P = .02, odds ratio 33, 95% confidence interval 1.56-697.96). One patient (3%) died. CONCLUSION: TCS contributes to multilevel airway obstruction in patients with syndromic craniosynostosis. Genetic testing in patients with FGFR2-related syndromic craniosynostoses may identify those at risk of TCS and facilitate early intervention. A better understanding of this patient population may foster individualized airway management strategies and improve outcomes. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4 Laryngoscope, 132:215-221, 2022.
27380568	Apert Syndrome: Outcomes From the Australian Craniofacial Unit's Birth to Maturity Management Protocol.	The complex, progressive, multisystem nature of Apert syndrome presents many challenges to managing surgeons. Based on the pioneering work of Paul Tessier, the senior author developed a multidisciplinary birth to maturity management protocol for Apert syndrome. Between 1975 and 2014 the Australian Craniofacial Unit has treated 174 Apert syndrome patients and 28 have completed full protocol management. This paper reviews the scientific contribution made to the management of Apert syndrome by the Australian Craniofacial Unit, the development and evolution of the protocol and presents comprehensive data on the surgical and nonsurgical craniofacial interventions, and outcomes for the 28 patients who have completed the programme; 26 had normal visual acuity, 22 had normal hearing, 20 achieved normal or nearly normal speech, 24 a functional class I occlusion, 18 completed mainstream schooling of whom at least 8 went on to tertiary education, at least 13 gained employment and 15 developed good social groups. These outcomes equal or exceed those presented by other authors and provide compelling evidence of the value of protocol management in clinical outcomes, in addition to their value in international collaboration, and scientific development of future therapeutic strategies for the management of Apert syndrome. 
23702195	Early midfacial distraction for syndromic craniosynostotic patients with obstructive sleep apnoea.	Syndromic craniosynostosis is known to be associated with various obstructive respiratory disorders, including sleep apnoea. We performed early midfacial distraction in 11 syndromic craniosynostotic patients with obstructive respiratory apnoea and obtained good results. There were four patients with Crouzon syndrome, three patients with Pfeiffer syndrome and four patients with Apert syndrome. Their ages ranged from 7 months to 3 years, 9 months (mean: 2 years, 5 months). Midfacial distraction was performed using an internal or external device to improve obstructive respiratory disorders, such as sleep apnoea, and to avoid tracheostomy. Evaluation was performed by comparison of the pre- and postoperative polysomnograms (PSGs) and cephalograms. All patients had markedly improved respiratory disorders during sleep and avoided tracheostomy. Preoperative PSGs and cephalograms were compared with those from 1 year to 1 year, 6 months postoperatively. The postoperative PSGs and cephalograms showed marked improvements compared with preoperative PSGs and cephalograms. Syndromic craniosynostotic patients have facial bone hypoplasia, particularly of the maxilla. The tongue and parapharyngeal soft tissue become enlarged, and the enlarged tissues can cause airway obstruction. In this study, marked improvements were observed in physical evaluation using PSGs and morphological evaluation using cephalograms. Early midfacial distraction is thought to be a very useful method to reconstruct a large pharyngeal cavity, enlarge the airway, improve obstructive respiratory disorders and to avoid tracheostomy. It is important to select a device suitable for each case when surgery and distraction are performed. 
24820706	Airway statuses and nasopharyngeal airway use for airway obstruction in syndromic craniosynostosis.	Syndromic craniosynostosis is associated with a high rate of respiratory difficulty, due mainly to midfacial hypoplasia. Nasopharyngeal airway establishment has been reported as the first-line approach to airway obstruction and may obviate the need for a highly invasive tracheotomy. No previous studies have compared airway obstruction status in syndromic craniosynostosis between cases requiring and not requiring airway managements. We focus on nasopharyngeal airway use and airway status outcomes to assess respiratory difficulty in patients with syndromic craniosynostosis. A retrospective data analysis of 51 cases with syndromic craniosynostosis was carried out. We divided 30 of the 51 cases with lateral pharyngeal x-rays taken before operations affecting airway diameters into 2 groups, one with neither nasopharyngeal airway insertion nor tracheotomy and the other with one or both of these interventions, and the mean diameters for 8 indices related to the pharyngeal space were compared. Cases with respiratory difficulty due to nasopharyngeal stenosis and requiring airway managements comprised a significantly higher proportion of those with Pfeiffer syndrome than patients with Crouzon or Apert syndrome. Comparative examination of lateral x-ray cephalometry between cases with neither nasopharyngeal airway insertion nor tracheotomy and cases with one or both revealed oropharyngeal diameters tended to be smaller in those with interventions. Cases requiring nasopharyngeal airway insertion were able to continue nasopharyngeal airway use for more than 1 year and a considerable number avoided tracheotomy. It may be worth considering an oropharyngeal-bypass nasopharyngeal airway before performing a tracheotomy. 
26398130	Alternative Methods for Nasotracheal Intubation and Extubation in a Patient With Apert Syndrome.	Apert syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by craniofacial abnormalities, craniosynostosis and syndactyly. Nasotracheal intubation for a patient with Apert syndrome can be a challenge because of abnormal facial anatomy. We experienced the anesthetic management of a patient with Apert syndrome who underwent partial resection of mandible and cleft palate repair with nasotracheal intubation. Nasotracheal intubation using a gastric tube and extubation using an airway exchange catheter proved useful in this case of airway compromise. 
30676503	Long-Term Functional Upper-Extremity Outcomes in Adults with Apert Syndrome.	BACKGROUND: The goal of this study was to determine upper-extremity function and health-related quality of life in a cohort of adults with Apert syndrome. METHODS: Twenty-two adults with Apert syndrome completed the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand survey; the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey; and a semistructured interview. One surgeon administered the Jebsen Hand Function Test and measured sensation, joint motion, and strength. RESULTS: Median Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score was 16.9, which indicated slightly greater disability than the population norm of 10.1. Median 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey scores were 54.5 for mental health and 57.0 for physical health-both more favorable than population norms. Total Jebsen Hand Function Test scores for dominant hand were 69.2 seconds for men and 64.7 seconds for women versus 37.8 seconds for population norms of both sexes. More complex syndactyly resulted in worse metacarpophalangeal joint motion but no significant difference in Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand; 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey; or other functional results. There was no difference in self-reported outcomes between patients with four (n = 8) versus five digits (n = 14) in each hand. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of adults with Apert syndrome, self-reported assessment of disability was more favorable than measured functional data would suggest. Despite significant functional deficits, the participants in this study had adapted remarkably well.
36310015	Left Ophthalmic Segment Internal Carotid Artery Aneurysm Treated with Flow Diversion in a Child with Apert Syndrome: Technical Note.	INTRODUCTION: Prevalence of intracranial aneurysms in children with Apert syndrome has not been described, and development of an aneurysm as a complication secondary to craniofacial surgery has never been reported. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the rare case of a 10-year-old boy with Apert syndrome who underwent craniofacial reconstruction surgery consisting of subcranial Le Fort III osteotomies, bilateral lateral canthopexies, and nasal nares dilations for midfacial hypoplasia and resultant obstructive sleep apnea, and on routine follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 1 year later, he was found to have a large left ophthalmic internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysm that was not seen on MRI obtained 2 years prior. Immediately after the craniofacial surgery, the patient experienced a severe headache behind his left eye and extraocular movement abnormalities that subsided over the next days to months. Given the new and rapid growth of the aneurysm on follow-up MRI, the patient underwent a diagnostic cerebral angiogram followed by successful flow diversion treatment of the aneurysm with the pipeline embolization device (Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland). CONCLUSION: Post-procedurally, over the next year, the patient developed word-finding difficulty and stuttering speech. He was found to have in-stent ICA stenosis and middle cerebral artery (MCA) stenosis at the first follow-up and underwent an initial angioplasty. After several weeks, ICA, MCA, and anterior cerebral artery stenoses were identified, and the patient underwent angioplasties for the ICA and MCA stenoses. On follow-up examination after the second procedure, the patient had tremendous improvement in his speech difficulties and was doing well clinically.
26046691	Progressive postnatal pansynostosis: an insidious and pernicious form of craniosynostosis.	OBJECT Progressive postnatal pansynostosis (PPP) is a rare form of craniosynostosis that is characterized by a normal head shape, insidious decrease in percentile head circumference, and high rates of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). This investigation describes the clinical, radiographic, and genetic features of this entity. METHODS The authors' craniofacial database for the period 1997-2013 was retrospectively culled to identify patients who had a normal or near-normal head shape and CT-confirmed multiple-suture synostosis. Patients with kleeblatt-schadel or previous craniofacial surgery were excluded. All demographic information was collected and analyzed. RESULTS Seventeen patients fit the inclusion criteria. Nine patients had a syndromic diagnosis: Crouzon syndrome (n = 4), Pfeiffer syndrome (n = 2), Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (n = 1), Apert syndrome (n = 1), and achondroplasia (n = 1). With the exception of 3 patients with mild turricephaly, all patients had a relatively normal head shape. Patients were diagnosed at an average age of 62.9 months. Nearly all patients had some combination of clinical, radiographic, or ophthalmological evidence of increased ICP. CONCLUSIONS PPP is insidious; diagnosis is typically delayed because the clinical signs are subtle and appear gradually. All normocephalic infants or children with a known or suspected craniosynostotic disorder should be carefully monitored; any decrease in percentile head circumference or signs/symptoms of increased ICP should prompt CT evaluation. 
30550448	Single Suture Synostosis and Isolated Cleft Palate in Non-Apert Syndrome Patients.	INTRODUCTION: Single suture craniosynostosis (SSC) and isolated cleft palate (ICP) in non-Apert syndrome patients rarely occur together. Management includes airway optimization, timing surgery appropriately, and assessing both cranial vault aesthetics and speech outcomes. The aim of this study was to compare treatment pathways and outcomes in patients with both conditions to standard treatment for these conditions in isolation. METHODS: Patient hospital medical records were retrospectively reviewed for demographic data, timing of surgery, aesthetic outcome (using the Whitaker grading system for head shape), and speech outcome (from speech therapy records of general development and speech assessment). RESULTS: Six patients with SSC and ICP were identified over an 18-year period. Cranial surgery was performed between 4 and 16 months and cleft surgery between 6 and 34 months of age in all cases. Documentation of cleft surgery and genetic testing was not available for 1 patient. One patient with hemi-palatal absence had an obturator inserted at 34 months. Two patients were found to have Fragile X and Emanuel syndrome, respectively.No increased perioperative airway risk was highlighted in any case. Four cases were designated Whitaker grade 1, 1 case was designated grade 2, and 1 case was not graded as no cranial surgery was performed. Half of the patients had general and speech developmental delay, while the other half demonstrated no signs of developmental delay. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Examination of 6 patients with SSC and ICP suggests the presence of both conditions does not adversely impact management or outcome for each condition, or increase perioperative risk.
