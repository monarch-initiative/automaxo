input_text: 'Assessment of long-term quality of life in patients with syndromic craniosynostosis.
  Several studies have analyzed the long-term stability of cranioplasty and midface
  distraction in patients with craniosynostosis; however, few studies have investigated
  long-term quality of life (QOL) and complications in adults with syndromic craniosynostosis.
  This study aimed to investigate the QOL (social, physical, and psychosocial) of
  patients with adult syndromic craniosynostosis. Patients aged >=20 years with syndromic
  craniosynostosis, who were surgically treated at a single craniofacial institution,
  were included in this study. We investigated everyday inconvenience (using the World
  Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule questionnaire), any ongoing treatment,
  marital status, and number of children. Totally, 18 patients aged 22-48 years (mean:
  31.4 +- 9.2 years) answered the questionnaire (Crouzon syndrome, 9; Apert syndrome,
  5; Pfeiffer syndrome, 4). Of these, only one Crouzon syndrome patient was married;
  she was also the only one with a child. Apert syndrome patients were found to have
  difficulty in understanding, communication, and self-care because of their mental
  retardation and hand and foot handicaps; however, their participation in society
  was the most aggressive. In contrast, Crouzon syndrome patients had especially poor
  participation in society. In all patients, any ongoing hospital treatment was due
  to ophthalmological conditions. Crouzon syndrome patients have extremely poor QOL;
  the absence of mental retardation and hand and foot handicaps forces them to live
  in mainstream society, for which they are emotionally ill-equipped. It is necessary
  to treat these patients without any residual deformity to provide psychological
  support and to create an accepting society.'
