input_text: 'Apert Hand Reconstruction: Do Partial-Thickness Skin Grafts Result in
  Flexion Scar Contracture? BACKGROUND: Hand reconstruction for patients with Apert
  syndrome is a critical step in comprehensive care and enables this population to
  gain significant hand function. Digit separation for Apert syndrome, as described
  in most algorithms, is finalized using local flaps and full-thickness skin grafts.
  The objective of this study is to report our experience using local flaps and partial-thickness
  skin grafts after digit separation for Apert hand reconstruction. METHODS: An observational
  retrospective study was performed with Apert patients whose hands were reconstructed
  between January 2007 and July 2019 using local flaps and partial-thickness skin
  grafts after digit separation. Demographic data and outcome data were verified and
  recorded. RESULTS: Out of a total of 75 Apert patients who underwent hand reconstruction,
  12 underwent hand reconstruction utilizing local flaps and partial-thickness skin
  grafts. The average patient age at the time of the first procedure was 1.9 years.
  These 12 patients were stratified according to Upton hand severity, 3 being type
  I (25%), 3 being type II (25%) and 6 being type III (50%). Mean follow up provided
  to all patients in this study was 1.8 years and donor site-related complications
  were seen in 2 patients (16.6%). No flexion scar contracture was observed in any
  of the patients who received partial-thickness skin grafts. CONCLUSIONS: The use
  of local flaps along with partial-thickness skin grafts to finalize digit separation
  for patients with Apert syndrome is an effective technique that reduces donor site
  morbidity and does not result in flexion scar contracture.'
