input_text: 'Apert Syndrome Management: Changing Treatment Algorithm. BACKGROUND:
  The purpose of this study is to review 10 years of surgical experience in the management
  of Apert syndrome, focusing on an updated algorithm which includes hand reconstruction
  and posterior vault distraction osteogenesis (PVDO). Additionally, the authors compare
  PVDO, which is currently used, with fronto-orbital advancement (FOA), which was
  utilized in a previous algorithm. METHODS: An observational retrospective study
  was performed on consecutive patients with Apert syndrome who underwent upper and
  lower limb reconstruction and craniofacial surgery between 2007 and 2017. A modified
  Clavien-Dindo surgical complication scale was used to stratify complications between
  PVDO and FOA. Demographic, surgical, and outcome data was also recorded. The blood
  transfusion rate between PVDO and FOA was also assessed and compared utilizing the
  Student t test. RESULTS: The present study included 69 patients with Apert syndrome
  (34 males and 35 females). Craniofacial surgeries were performed on a total of 38
  patients. A total of 210 operations were performed on the respective upper and lower
  limbs of patients included in this study. A total of 18 patients underwent PVDO
  (n = 9) and FOA (n = 9). Posterior vault distraction osteogenesis required significantly
  less transfused blood volume than FOA (P < 0.05). Complication rate and length of
  hospital stay were similar for each procedure. CONCLUSION: An updated algorithm
  to treat Apert patients was implemented. Posterior vault distraction osteogenesis
  incorporated into an updated algorithm results in a lower blood transfusion rate.'
