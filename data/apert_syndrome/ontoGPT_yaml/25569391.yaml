input_text: 'Complications in 54 frontofacial distraction procedures in patients with
  syndromic craniosynostosis. Patients with syndromic craniosynostosis manifest midfacial
  hypoplasia often treated by midfacial advancement. Benefits of midfacial advancement
  by distraction osteogenesis have been well studied; little is known about the perioperative
  morbidity of these procedures, specifically relating to device selection. This study
  compares the perioperative complications between semiburied- and halo-type distraction
  osteogenesis of the midface. A retrospective review was performed on all patients
  with syndromic craniosynostosis who underwent midface distraction with semiburied-
  or halo-type external distractors. Demographic information and operative/postoperative
  course were reviewed. Complications were categorized as hardware-related, infectious,
  and either as major (requiring additional intervention) or minor (requiring medication
  only). Chi-squared and Fisher exact test were used to compare variables.From 1999
  to 2012, a total of 54 patients underwent midface distraction osteogenesis, including
  23 patients with Apert syndrome, 19 patients with Crouzon syndrome, 10 patients
  with Pfeiffer syndrome, and 2 patients with other craniofacial syndromes. Thirty-three
  patients underwent a total of 34 subcranial Le Fort III distraction procedures and
  21 underwent 21 monobloc distraction procedures. The mean age during surgery was
  8.0 (range, 4.0-17.7) years, whereas the mean time between distractor placement
  and removal was 102.9 days. Thirty procedures were performed with external halo-type
  distractors (18 Le Fort III and 12 monobloc distractions), whereas 25 were performed
  with buried midface distractors (16 Le Fort III and 9 monobloc distractions). There
  were no significant differences in diagnoses or interventions between the distraction
  devices. Of the 19 distractor-related complications, there were a total of 10 (18.2%)
  in the halo group including 5 (9.1%) requiring separate operative intervention as
  well as 9 (16.4%) in the buried distractor group including 6 (10.1%) requiring separate
  operative intervention. Major infections were more common in the buried distractor
  group (n = 8) compared with the halo distractor group (n = 3) (P = 0.048). There
  were 4 (7.3%) patients in the halo group who had malposition or transcranial pin
  migration related to postoperative positioning or falls and required operative repositioning.
  Frontofacial distraction is an important technique in patients with syndromic craniosynostosis.
  Higher rates of halo displacement requiring surgery are offset with lower rates
  of infections compared with buried distractors. '
