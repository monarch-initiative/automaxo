input_text: 'A Survey of Orthodontic Treatment in Team Care for Patients With Syndromic
  Craniosynostosis in Japan. OBJECTIVE: To understand the actual condition of orthodontic
  treatment in team care for patients with syndromic craniosynostosis (SCS) in Japan.
  DESIGN: A nationwide collaborative survey. SETTING: Twenty-four orthodontic clinics
  in Japan. PATIENTS: A total of 246 patients with SCS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Treatment
  history was examined based on orthodontic records using common survey sheets. RESULTS:
  Most patients first visited the orthodontic clinic in the deciduous or mixed dentition
  phase. Midface advancement was performed without visiting the orthodontic clinic
  in about a quarter of the patients, and more than a half of the patients underwent
  "surgery-first" midface advancement. First-phase orthodontic treatment was carried
  out in about a half of the patients, and maxillary expansion and protraction were
  performed. Tooth extraction was required in about two-thirds of patients, and the
  extraction of maxillary teeth was required in most patients. Tooth abnormalities
  were found in 37.8% of patients, and abnormalities of maxillary molars were frequently
  (58.3%) found in patients who had undergone midface surgery below the age of 6 years.
  CONCLUSIONS: Many patients underwent "surgery-first" midface advancement, and visiting
  the orthodontic clinic at least before advancement was considered desirable. First-phase
  orthodontic treatment should be performed considering the burden of care. Midface
  advancement below the age of 6 years had a high risk of injury to the maxillary
  molars. This survey is considered useful for improving orthodontic treatment in
  team care of patients with SCS.'
