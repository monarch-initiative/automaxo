input_text: 'A Three-Dimensional Study of Midfacial Changes Following Le Fort II Distraction
  With Zygomatic Repositioning in Syndromic Patients. Le Fort II distraction with
  zygomatic repositioning introduced the ability to restore central midfacial height
  and convexity independent of changes in orbital morphology. This study analyzes
  midfacial and orbital morphology before and after Le Fort II distraction with zygomatic
  repositioning.All patients who underwent Le Fort II Distraction with zygomatic repositioning
  between 2013 and 2015 were included. Two- and 3-dimensional measurements were made
  using 3dMD Vultus software to assess canthal tilt, nasolabial angle, ratio of midfacial
  to lower facial height, and absolute change in nasal length. Presence of an open
  bite and Angle classification were assessed before and after surgery.Four patients
  underwent segmental midface advancement using Le Fort II distraction with zygomatic
  repositioning. Associated diagnoses included Apert syndrome, Goldenhar syndrome,
  and achondroplasia. Changes in facial dimensions included: 3.19  improvement in
  canthal tilt (range -4.7  to 8.4 ), 9  change in nasolabial angle (range -1.0  to
  19 ), and 0.69 cm increase in absolute nasal length (range 0.2-0.94 cm). Mean ratio
  of midfacial to lower facial height was 0.79 preoperatively and 0.89 postoperatively.
  Preoperatively, all patients demonstrated Angle class III with 3 of 4 patients demonstrating
  anterior open bite. All achieved closure of open bite and demonstrated class I or
  II occlusion. No complications were observed.Le Fort II distraction with zygomatic
  repositioning resulted in normalization of midfacial soft tissue landmarks. This
  form of advancement demonstrates the ability to selectively improve midfacial height
  and canthal tilt while restoring normal occlusion.'
