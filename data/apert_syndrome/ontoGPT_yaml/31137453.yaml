input_text: 'Apert Syndrome: Intraoperative and Postoperative Hyponatremia. Apert
  syndrome is one of the acrocephalosyndactilia syndromes that is characterized with
  calvarial an extremity deformities. Anesthesia management of this syndrome is commonly
  related with difficult airway. However, hyponatremia is another insistent complication
  that can occur during craniosynostosis surgeries. Hyponatremia is a common complication
  during calvarial remodeling surgeries and it can result in serious neurologic damage.
  Development of mild hyponatremia in a patient with Apert syndrome that went under
  craniosynostosis surgery was presented in this study.'
