input_text: 'Assessing the corrective effects of facial bipartition distraction in
  Apert syndrome using geometric morphometrics. UNLABELLED: Apert syndrome is a congenital
  disorder characterized by craniosynostosis and midface hypoplasia. This study looks
  to identify to what extent bipartition distraction corrects the morphological abnormalities
  of this condition. Preoperative and postoperative three-dimensional computed tomography
  (3DCT) scans of 10 patients with Apert syndrome (12-21 years) were identified from
  the Great Ormond Street Hospital database. To analyse preoperative and postoperative
  scans, 98 landmarks and 13 normal skulls were used. Principal component analysis
  (PCA) was used to analyse patterns in the datasets. Within each group, eigenvectors
  were identified that demonstrated the aspects of the skull where most variations
  were found. The analysis allowed both global shape measurement and local proportions.
  Postoperative and normal scans both showed the same first three principal components.
  Warping from preoperative to postoperative illustrates midface advancement and inward
  rotation of the orbits. Postoperative to normal warps demonstrate some remaining
  differences. The reliability of the used land marks varied between 77% and 95% for
  the highly reproducible landmarks between the two observers. 95% versus 100% were
  at least acceptable reproducible landmarks. This study allows us to understand the
  way bipartition distraction corrects the abnormalities of the Apert skull. Analysing
  the surgical outcome of facial bipartition with geometric morphometrics shows that
  some major Apert characteristics are corrected. Using the data and the output of
  further studies, surgical procedures can be adapted in order to achieve a postoperative
  result closer to the normal population. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic clinical
  question Level IV.'
