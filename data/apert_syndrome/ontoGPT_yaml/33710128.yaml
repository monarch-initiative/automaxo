input_text: 'Satisfying Clinical and Functional Results in 12 Apert Children Treated
  With Soft Tissue Distractor. BACKGROUND: The complex syndactyly in Apert syndrome
  hands is challenging to operate. The synostosis and tightness of skin between third
  and fourth digits lead to severe coverage problems during ray release. A soft tissue
  distractor can simplify the release with the aim to keep all 10 fingers. METHODS:
  A retrospective follow-up of 12 patients/24 hands, median age 8 years (6 to 17 y),
  6 boys and 6 girls, operated between 2000 and 2013 was done from 2015 to 2016. The
  surgical management started with syndactyly release of the first and fourth web,
  and later of the second. The third stage was placing a soft tissue distractor on
  the third and fourth finger after osteotomy on the synostosis between them. Four
  weeks of distraction and 2 weeks of rest resulted in regenerated skin between the
  digits giving much better coverage of the released digits at time of separation
  6 weeks later. Assessment of hand function, grip strength and completion of the
  Patient Reported Outcome Measure CHEQ was performed. RESULTS: Soft tissue coverage
  at the time of digit separation was considerably facilitated. We experienced 2 infections
  in 2 hands. In 18/24 hands median 2 (1 to 3) small full thickness skin grafts were
  needed, usually for coverage of the base of the digits. All wounds healed well.
  The children managed different practical tasks well, alternating between best functioning
  grip depending on the activity. According to CHEQ, the children did median 19 (13
  to 27) activities independently and median 8 (2 to 15) nonindependently, of a total
  of 29. Peak strength values for 10/12 children were for the right hand median 17.8%
  (9.6% to 40.6%) of normative data and for left hand median 13.6% (2.4% to 20.5%)
  of normative data. CONCLUSION: Soft tissue distraction facilitates the treatment
  of acrocephalosyndactyly hands, giving 5-fingered hands. Apert children manage many
  activities independently but struggled with fine motor skills demanding strength.
