input_text: 'Effect of Fibroblast Growth Factor 2 on Extraocular Muscle Structure
  and Function. Purpose: Mutations in the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor
  can result in strabismus, but little is known about how FGFs affect extraocular
  muscle structure and function. These were assessed after short-term and long-term
  exposure to exogenously applied FGF2 to determine the effect of enhanced signaling.
  Methods: One superior rectus muscle of adult rabbits received either a series of
  three injections of 500 ng, 1 microg, or 5 microg FGF2 and examined after 1 week,
  or received sustained treatment with FGF2 and examined after 1, 2, or 3 months.
  Muscles were assessed for alterations in force generation, myofiber size, and satellite
  cell number after each treatment. Results: One week after the 5 microg FGF2 injections,
  treated muscles showed significantly increased force generation compared with naive
  controls, which correlated with increased myofiber cross-sectional areas and Pax7-positive
  satellite cells. In contrast, 3 months of sustained FGF2 treatment resulted in decreased
  force generation, which correlated with decreased myofiber size and decreased satellite
  cells compared with naive control and the untreated contralateral side. Conclusions:
  FGF2 had distinctly different effects when short-term and long-term treatments were
  compared. The decreased size and ability to generate force correlated with decreased
  myofiber areas seen in individuals with Apert syndrome, where there is sustained
  activation of FGF signaling. Knowing more about signaling pathways critical for
  extraocular muscle function, development, and disease will pave the way for improved
  treatment options for strabismus patients with FGF abnormalities in craniofacial
  disease, which also may be applicable to other strabismus patients.'
