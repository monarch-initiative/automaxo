input_text: 'Alar Pinning in Rigid External Distraction for Midfacial Hypoplasia.
  BACKGROUND: Distraction osteogenesis with a rigid external distractor is a widely
  accepted treatment for midfacial hypoplasia. In this study, the authors introduce
  the utilization of alar pinning with the external halo distractor for maxillary
  advancement, in place of an oral splint. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was
  conducted of 7 patients who successfully underwent distraction osteogenesis using
  the alar pinning technique. Midfacial hypoplasia was secondary to Crouzon syndrome
  (n = 4), Apert syndrome (n = 1), Pfeiffer syndrome (n = 1), or bacterial meningitis
  (n = 1). Three patients were managed with monobloc osteotomies, 2 with Le Fort III
  osteotomies, 1 with Le Fort III osteotomy and frontoorbital advancement, and 1 with
  Le Fort I osteotomy alone. Patient charts were analyzed for postoperative course
  and complications relating to the alar pins. RESULTS: Two patients had minor complications
  specifically related to the alar pins. One patient had concern for a mild skin infection
  at a pin site that resolved with oral antibiotics. The other patient had loosening
  of an alar pin, which did not require operative management. Retrospective chart
  review indicated that all patients were pleased with their results from the distraction,
  and no patients opted for further advancement. DISCUSSION: Utilization of alar pin
  sites for external distraction is a feasible and reasonable option for treatment
  of midfacial hypoplasia involving a Le Fort osteotomy or monobloc procedure. Fixation
  sites within the alar crease minimize the visibility of pin site scars and eliminate
  the need for a custom-made oral splint, which prevents usage of the upper dentition
  and frequently requires consulting a dentist or orthodontist for fabrication. CONCLUSIONS:
  Alar pinning with an external halo distraction system for management of midfacial
  hypoplasia has minimal complications and is an alternative to using a custom-made
  oral splint.'
