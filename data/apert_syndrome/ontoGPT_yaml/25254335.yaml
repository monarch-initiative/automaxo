input_text: Enhanced fitness of adult spermatogonial stem cells bearing a paternal
  age-associated FGFR2 mutation. Pathogenic de novo mutations increase with fathers'
  age and could be amplified through competition between genetically distinct subpopulations
  of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). Here, we tested the fitness of SSCs bearing
  wild-type human FGFR2 or an Apert syndrome mutant, FGFR2 (S252W), to provide experimental
  evidence for SSC competition. The S252W allele conferred enhanced FGFR2-mediated
  signaling, particularly at very low concentrations of ligand, and also subtle changes
  in gene expression. Mutant SSCs exhibited improved competitiveness in vitro and
  increased stem cell activity in vivo upon transplantation. The fitness advantage
  in vitro only occurred in low concentrations of fibroblast growth factor (FGF),
  was independent of FGF-driven proliferation, and was accompanied by increased response
  to glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). Our studies provide experimental
  evidence of enhanced stem cell fitness in SSCs bearing a paternal age-associated
  mutation. Our model will be useful for interrogating other candidate mutations in
  the future to reveal mechanisms of disease risk.
