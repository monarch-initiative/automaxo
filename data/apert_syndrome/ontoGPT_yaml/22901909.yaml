input_text: 'The role of bronchoscopy in the management of patients with severe craniofacial
  syndromes. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to assess the incidence of airway
  anomalies in children with severe craniofacial syndromes and to establish the role
  of bronchoscopy in the care of these patients. METHODS: Consecutive children with
  craniofacial syndromes, including both bony deformities of the skull and face, in
  which a bronchoscopy was performed between 1995 and 2010 were retrospectively reviewed.
  RESULTS: Thirty-six patients (22 boys, 14 girls; mean age, 39 months) were studied.
  Craniofacial synostosis was present in 21 patients (Crouzen syndrome, 11; Apert
  syndrome, 7, Pfeiffer syndrome, 3) and craniofacial dysostosis in 15 (Goldenhart
  syndrome, 8; Treacher Collins syndrome, 7). In 30 patients (83.3%), bronchoscopy
  was performed because of respiratory symptoms (apneic episodes, 22; respiratory
  distress, 13; stridor, 6; cyanosis, 1) and, in the remaining 6 (asymptomatic children),
  during guided tracheal intubation before a surgical procedure. Airway anomalies
  were found in 69.4% of patients (70% in symptomatic patients). Management consisted
  of tracheotomy in 13 patients, adenoidectomy/tonsillectomy in 13, glossopexy in
  5, antireflux surgery in 3, and supraglottoplasty in 2. CONCLUSIONS: Airway anomalies
  occurred in 70% of children with severe craniofacial syndromes and respiratory symptoms.
  Bronchoscopy should be performed routinely in this selected group of patients, and
  the entire airway must be examined. Treatment should be tailored to each individual
  patient.'
