  mutations in sperm of cancer survivors. STUDY QUESTION: What effect does cancer
  treatment have on levels of spontaneous selfish fibroblast growth factor receptor
  2 (FGFR2) point mutations in human sperm? SUMMARY ANSWER: Chemotherapy and radiotherapy
  do not increase levels of spontaneous FGFR2 mutations in sperm but, unexpectedly,
  highly-sterilizing treatments dramatically reduce the levels of the disease-associated
  c.755C > G (Apert syndrome) mutation in sperm. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Cancer treatments
  lead to short-term increases in gross DNA damage (chromosomal abnormalities and
  DNA fragmentation) but the long-term effects, particularly at the single nucleotide
  resolution level, are poorly understood. We have exploited an ultra-sensitive assay
  to directly quantify point mutation levels at the FGFR2 locus. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE,
  DURATION: 'Selfish' mutations are disease-associated mutations that occur spontaneously
  in the sperm of most men and their levels typically increase with age. Levels of
  mutations at c.752-755 of FGFR2 (including c.755C > G and c.755C > T associated
  with Apert and Crouzon syndromes, respectively) in semen post-cancer treatment from
  18 men were compared to levels in pre-treatment samples from the same individuals
  (n = 4) or levels in previously screened population controls (n = 99). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS,
  SETTING, METHODS: Cancer patients were stratified into four different groups based
  on the treatments they received and the length of time for spermatogenesis recovery.
  DNA extracted from semen samples was analysed using a previously established highly
  sensitive assay to identify mutations at positions c.752-755 of FGFR2. Five to ten
  micrograms of semen genomic DNA was spiked with internal controls for quantification
  purposes, digested with MboI restriction enzyme and gel extracted. Following PCR
  amplification, further MboI digestion and a nested PCR with barcoding primers, samples
  were sequenced on Illumina MiSeq. Mutation levels were determined relative to the
  spiked internal control; in individuals heterozygous for a nearby common single
  nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), mutations were phased to their respective alleles.
  MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Patients treated with moderately-sterilizing
  alkylating regimens and who recovered spermatogenesis within <3 years after therapy
  (Group 3, n = 4) or non - alkylating chemotherapy and/or low gonadal radiation doses
  (Group 1, n = 4) had mutation levels similar to untreated controls. However, patients
  who had highly-sterilizing alkylating treatments (i.e. >5 years to spermatogenesis
  recovery) (Group 2, n = 7) or pelvic radiotherapy (Group 4, n = 3) exhibited c.755C
  > G mutation levels at or below background. Two patients (A and B) treated with
  highly-sterilizing alkylating agents demonstrated a clear reduction from pre-treatment
  levels; however pre-treatment samples were not available for the other patients
  with low mutation levels. Therefore, although based on their age we would expect
  detectable levels of mutations, we cannot exclude the possibility that these patients
  also had low mutation levels pre-treatment. In three patients with low c.755C >
  G levels at the first timepoint post-treatment, we observed increasing mutation
  levels over time. For two such patients we could phase the mutation to a nearby
  polymorphism (SNP) and determine that the mutation counts likely originated from
  a single or a small number of mutational events. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION:
  This study was limited to 18 patients with different treatment regimens; for nine
  of the 18 patients, samples from only one timepoint were available. Only 12 different
  de novo substitutions at the FGFR2 c.752-755 locus were assessed, two of which are
  known to be disease associated. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our data add
  to the body of evidence from epidemiological studies and experimental data in humans
  suggesting that male germline stem cells are resilient to the accumulation of spontaneous
  mutations. Collectively, these data should provide physicians and health-care professionals
  with reassuring experimental-based evidence for counselling of male cancer patients
  contemplating their reproductive options several years after treatment. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING
