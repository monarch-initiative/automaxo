input_text: 'Central Coalition Osteotomy of Phalangeal Synostoses in the Management
  of the Type III Apert Hand. PURPOSE: We report a technique in the management of
  the type III Apert hand. The proposed approach facilitates the creation of a 5-fingered
  hand in 3 stages. METHODS: We reviewed records of patients with Apert syndrome and
  type III hands surgically treated at our institution from 1995 through 2014. In
  all cases, syndactyly release was performed in 3 stages with prioritization of the
  border digits. In addition, limited retrograde, axial osteotomies between the phalangeal
  segments of the conjoined index, middle, and ring fingers were performed during
  the first stage. Medical records were reviewed for demographics, clinical presentation,
  operative findings, and postoperative outcomes. RESULTS: Twelve pediatric patients
  with type III hands underwent syndactyly release. Median patient age was 10.0, 15.8,
  and 29.6 months at operative stages 1, 2, and 3, respectively. A thumb and 4 fingers
  were achieved for all but 1 hand. The median duration of hospital stay was 2 days
  for each stage. No infections or major complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS:
  We demonstrate this method as a safe and effective means of creating 5 digits in
  the Apert patient with type III hands. Our opinion is that the additional aesthetic
  and functional gains offset the requirement of a 3-stage approach. TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL
  OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic IV.'
