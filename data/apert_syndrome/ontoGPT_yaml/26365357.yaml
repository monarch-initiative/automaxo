input_text: Perifascial areolar tissue grafting for treating syndactyly with bone
  fusion in patients with Apert syndrome. Complete syndactyly with bone fusion in
  patients with Apert syndrome was treated using perifascial areolar tissue (PAT)
  grafts via a two-stage surgery (i.e. bone separation using inter-bone PAT graft
  insertion followed by web separation and reconstruction with full-thickness skin
  grafts). This technique is easy and created nail folds for fingertips.
