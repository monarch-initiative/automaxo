input_text: 'Left Ophthalmic Segment Internal Carotid Artery Aneurysm Treated with
  Flow Diversion in a Child with Apert Syndrome: Technical Note. INTRODUCTION: Prevalence
  of intracranial aneurysms in children with Apert syndrome has not been described,
  and development of an aneurysm as a complication secondary to craniofacial surgery
  has never been reported. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the rare case of a 10-year-old
  boy with Apert syndrome who underwent craniofacial reconstruction surgery consisting
  of subcranial Le Fort III osteotomies, bilateral lateral canthopexies, and nasal
  nares dilations for midfacial hypoplasia and resultant obstructive sleep apnea,
  and on routine follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 1 year later, he was found
  to have a large left ophthalmic internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysm that was
  not seen on MRI obtained 2 years prior. Immediately after the craniofacial surgery,
  the patient experienced a severe headache behind his left eye and extraocular movement
  abnormalities that subsided over the next days to months. Given the new and rapid
  growth of the aneurysm on follow-up MRI, the patient underwent a diagnostic cerebral
  angiogram followed by successful flow diversion treatment of the aneurysm with the
  pipeline embolization device (Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland). CONCLUSION: Post-procedurally,
  over the next year, the patient developed word-finding difficulty and stuttering
  speech. He was found to have in-stent ICA stenosis and middle cerebral artery (MCA)
  stenosis at the first follow-up and underwent an initial angioplasty. After several
  weeks, ICA, MCA, and anterior cerebral artery stenoses were identified, and the
  patient underwent angioplasties for the ICA and MCA stenoses. On follow-up examination
  after the second procedure, the patient had tremendous improvement in his speech
  difficulties and was doing well clinically.'
