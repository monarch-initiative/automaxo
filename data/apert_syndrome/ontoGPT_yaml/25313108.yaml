input_text: "Visual surveillance in craniosynostoses. Craniosynostosis is the premature
  fusion of one or more cranial sutures that may be isolated or syndromic. These children
  can have multiple developmental issues including speech, hearing, and vision, in
  addition to the aesthetic issue of an abnormally shaped skull and midfacial hypoplasia.
  As the aesthetic outcomes of craniofacial surgery have improved, attention has turned
  on the functional outcomes and visual loss is a well-known problem with these patients.
  In the past 15 years, a greater understanding of the causes of visual loss has developed.
  Factors such as amblyopia, corneal exposure, and optic neuropathy are all now looked
  for to prevent or reduce visual loss. Optic neuropathy is caused by craniocerebral
  disproportion (though to a lesser extent than originally thought), cerebral hypo
  perfusion, hydrocephalus, and obstructive sleep apnea. Amblyopia is due to increased
  incidence of strabismus, anisometropia, astigmatism, and ametropia in these cases.
  A comprehensive approach to managing these children's visual function allows the
  clinician to reduce potential visual loss in children with craniosynostoses especially
  the syndromic variety. "
