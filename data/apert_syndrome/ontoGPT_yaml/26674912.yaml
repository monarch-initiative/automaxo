input_text: "Management of the Airway in Apert Syndrome. The management of the airway
  in Apert syndrome is complex and multidisciplinary. This rare syndrome, occurring
  in up to approximately 1 in 65,000 live births, results in airway compromise at
  various anatomic levels, in addition to abnormal central respiratory drive. Obstructive
  apneas arise because of decreased airway caliber, which may occur in the form of
  congenital bony nasal stenosis, choanal atresia, a deviated nasal septum, a narrowed
  nasopharynx, a thick long soft palate, lateral palatal swellings, and a tracheal
  cartilage sleeve. Central apneas in Apert syndrome arise because of raised intracranial
  pressure and/or Chiari malformations. The purpose of this study was to investigate
  our treatment methods and outcomes in optimizing the airway in this complex, rare
  and interesting cohort of patients who present with airway compromise. Patients
  with Apert syndrome were retrospectively evaluated during a period from 1990 to
  2013. Treatments for obstructive apnea were dilatation of nasal airways and choanal
  atresia repair, adenoidectomy, tonsillectomy, early midface advancement, and noninvasive
  ventilation. The insertion of ventriculoperitoneal shunts, fronto-orbital advancement,
  and Chiari decompression aid in managing central apneas. The authors present our
  experience at Alder Hey Children's Hospital, Liverpool, one of the 4 Supraregional
  Craniofacial Units in the United Kingdom. "
