input_text: 'Normalizing facial ratios in apert syndrome patients with Le Fort II
  midface distraction and simultaneous zygomatic repositioning. BACKGROUND: Le Fort
  III distraction advances the Apert midface but leaves the central concavity and
  vertical compression untreated. The authors propose that Le Fort II distraction
  and simultaneous zygomatic repositioning as a combined procedure can move the central
  midface and lateral orbits in independent vectors in order to improve the facial
  deformity. The purpose of this study was to determine whether this segmental movement
  results in more normal facial proportions than Le Fort III distraction. METHODS:
  Computed tomographic scan analyses were performed before and after distraction in
  patients undergoing Le Fort III distraction (n = 5) and Le Fort II distraction with
  simultaneous zygomatic repositioning (n = 4). The calculated axial facial ratios
  and vertical facial ratios relative to the skull base were compared to those of
  unoperated Crouzon (n = 5) and normal (n = 6) controls. RESULTS: With Le Fort III
  distraction, facial ratios did not change with surgery and remained lower (p < 0.01;
  paired t test comparison) than normal and Crouzon controls. Although the face was
  advanced, its shape remained abnormal. With the Le Fort II segmental movement procedure,
  the central face advanced and lengthened more than the lateral orbit. This differential
  movement changed the abnormal facial ratios that were present before surgery into
  ratios that were not significantly different from normal controls (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION:
  Compared with Le Fort III distraction, Le Fort II distraction with simultaneous
  zygomatic repositioning normalizes the position and the shape of the Apert face.
