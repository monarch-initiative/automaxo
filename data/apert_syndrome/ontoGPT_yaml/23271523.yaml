input_text: 'Apert syndrome:  evaluation of a treatment algorithm. BACKGROUND: The
  authors catalogued phenotypic variability among children with Apert syndrome, reviewed
  surgical outcomes (particularly with respect to their treatment goals of avoiding
  preventable developmental delays and reducing operative interventions), and examined
  correlations that might stimulate improved treatment paradigms. METHODS: A case
  series review of all Apert syndrome patients, treated by a single surgeon, including
  phenotypic variations, mutational analyses, developmental assessments, and surgical
  treatments, was performed. RESULTS: Over a 20-year period, 135 Apert syndrome patients
  were treated (32 percent from birth). A fairly even distribution of mutations was
  noted (S252W, n = 20; P253R, n = 18). Of 268 hands, 60 percent were type I, 21 percent
  were type II, and 19 percent were type III. Fifty percent had palatal anomalies.
  Three separate skull configuration types were identified, and 29 percent had acquired
  Chiari malformations, 24 percent had anomalies of the septum pellucidum, and 12
  percent had anomalies of the corpus callosum. Cranial and midfacial procedures were
  performed significantly earlier at outside centers (6.2 months versus 12.6 months,
  and 5.3 years versus 7.5 years). No significant correlations were noted between
  development and gene mutation, hand or skull phenotypes, intracranial anomalies,
  and timing of initial skull surgery. A significant correlation was noted between
  adverse development and ventriculoperitoneal shunts, tracheostomies, and more operative
  interventions. Higher development strongly correlated with treatment at our center
  from birth. CONCLUSION: Treatment goals focused on the prevention of avoidable developmental
  delays (from raised intracranial pressure and sleep apnea) and reducing operative
  interventions may potentially improve developmental outcomes. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL
  OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, III.'
