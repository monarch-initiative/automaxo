input_text: "Impact of paternal age on assisted reproductive technology outcomes and
  offspring health: a systematic review. BACKGROUND: The increase in paternal age
  and the percentage of births after assisted reproductive technologies (ART) may
  have consequences on offspring and society's position regarding access to ART must
  be questioned. Most countries recommend limiting ART to men under 60 years. What
  is the rationale for this threshold? OBJECTIVE: This systematic review assesses
  scientific arguments to establish links between paternal age, male fertility, and
  offspring health. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using the PRISMA guidelines, this systematic
  review of the literature analyzed 111 articles selected after screening PubMed,
  ScienceDirect, and Web of Science for articles published between January 1, 1995
  and December 31, 2021. RESULTS: A strong correlation was highlighted between advanced
  paternal age and a decrease of some sperm parameters (semen volume and sperm motility)
  and infant morbidity (exponentially increased incidence of achondroplasia and Apert
  syndrome, and more moderately increased incidence of autism and schizophrenia).
  The impact of paternal age on pregnancy and fetal aneuploidy rates is more controversial.
  No association was found with spontaneous abortion rates. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION:
  The scientific parameters should be explained to older parents undergoing ART. And
  for countries that discuss a limit on paternal age for access to ART, the debate
  requires consideration of social and ethical arguments."
