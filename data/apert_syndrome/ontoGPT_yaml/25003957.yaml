input_text: 'Therapeutic effect of nanogel-based delivery of soluble FGFR2 with S252W
  mutation on craniosynostosis. Apert syndrome is an autosomal dominantly inherited
  disorder caused by missense mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2).
  Surgical procedures are frequently required to reduce morphological and functional
  defects in patients with Apert syndrome; therefore, the development of noninvasive
  procedures to treat Apert syndrome is critical. Here we aimed to clarify the etiological
  mechanisms of craniosynostosis in mouse models of Apert syndrome and verify the
  effects of purified soluble FGFR2 harboring the S252W mutation (sFGFR2IIIcS252W)
  on calvarial sutures in Apert syndrome mice in vitro. We observed increased expression
  of Fgf10, Esrp1, and Fgfr2IIIb, which are indispensable for epidermal development,
  in coronal sutures in Apert syndrome mice. Purified sFGFR2IIIcS252W exhibited binding
  affinity for fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) 2 but also formed heterodimers with
  FGFR2IIIc, FGFR2IIIcS252W, and FGFR2IIIbS252W. Administration of sFGFR2IIIcS252W
  also inhibited Fgf2-dependent proliferation, phosphorylation of intracellular signaling
  molecules, and mineralization of FGFR2S252W-overexpressing MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts.
  sFGFR2IIIcS252W complexed with nanogels maintained the patency of coronal sutures,
  whereas synostosis was observed where the nanogel without sFGFR2S252W was applied.
  Thus, based on our current data, we suggest that increased Fgf10 and Fgfr2IIIb expression
  may induce the onset of craniosynostosis in patients with Apert syndrome and that
  the appropriate delivery of purified sFGFR2IIIcS252W could be effective for treating
  this disorder. '
