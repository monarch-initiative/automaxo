input_text: "Simultaneous Midface Advancement and Orthognathic Surgery: A Powerful
  Technique for Managing Midface Hypoplasia and Malocclusion. BACKGROUND: Midface
  hypoplasia dramatically affects the normative facial cascade. Simultaneous Le Fort
  III and Le Fort I procedures (Le Fort III/I) provide a powerful tool for achieving
  significant midface advancement. This study presents the authors' approach for addressing
  midface hypoplasia in the setting of class III malocclusion using Le Fort III/I
  advancement. METHODS: This was an institutional review board-approved retrospective
  review of patients who underwent Le Fort III/I advancement at the authors' institution
  from 2009 to 2019. Demographic, surgical, and postoperative data were recorded.
  The authors' operative technique and surgical pearls are described. RESULTS: Twenty-five
  patients met inclusion criteria, 15 male patients (60 percent) and 10 female patients
  (40 percent). Patient age ranged from 14.9 to 21.6 years. Diagnoses included Crouzon
  syndrome, nonsyndromic developmental skeletal dysplasia, cleft lip/palate, Klippel-Feil
  syndrome, Apert syndrome, Van den Ende-Gupta syndrome, and Pfeiffer syndrome. Le
  Fort III advancements averaged 6.18 +- 1.38 mm and Le Fort I advancements averaged
  6.70 +- 2.48 mm. Thirteen patients underwent simultaneous bilateral sagittal split
  osteotomy with average movement of 5.85 +- 1.21 mm. Average follow-up was 1.3 +-
  1.0 years. One patient experienced intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid leak that
  resolved with expectant management. Three patients experienced major complications
  (12 percent) postoperatively necessitating repeated orthognathic operations. Ten
  patients experienced minor complications (40 percent). Average length of stay was
  10 days, with all patients achieving improvement of their facial profile. CONCLUSIONS:
  The authors' experience reaffirms the relative safety of simultaneous Le Fort III/I
  advancement. This technique should be considered in select patients with global
  midface retrusion and class III malocclusion. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE:
  Therapeutic, IV."
