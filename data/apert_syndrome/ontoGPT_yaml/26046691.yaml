input_text: "Progressive postnatal pansynostosis: an insidious and pernicious form
  of craniosynostosis. OBJECT Progressive postnatal pansynostosis (PPP) is a rare
  form of craniosynostosis that is characterized by a normal head shape, insidious
  decrease in percentile head circumference, and high rates of elevated intracranial
  pressure (ICP). This investigation describes the clinical, radiographic, and genetic
  features of this entity. METHODS The authors' craniofacial database for the period
  1997-2013 was retrospectively culled to identify patients who had a normal or near-normal
  head shape and CT-confirmed multiple-suture synostosis. Patients with kleeblatt-schadel
  or previous craniofacial surgery were excluded. All demographic information was
  collected and analyzed. RESULTS Seventeen patients fit the inclusion criteria. Nine
  patients had a syndromic diagnosis: Crouzon syndrome (n = 4), Pfeiffer syndrome
  (n = 2), Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (n = 1), Apert syndrome (n = 1), and achondroplasia
  (n = 1). With the exception of 3 patients with mild turricephaly, all patients had
  a relatively normal head shape. Patients were diagnosed at an average age of 62.9
  months. Nearly all patients had some combination of clinical, radiographic, or ophthalmological
  evidence of increased ICP. CONCLUSIONS PPP is insidious; diagnosis is typically
  delayed because the clinical signs are subtle and appear gradually. All normocephalic
  infants or children with a known or suspected craniosynostotic disorder should be
  carefully monitored; any decrease in percentile head circumference or signs/symptoms
  of increased ICP should prompt CT evaluation. "
