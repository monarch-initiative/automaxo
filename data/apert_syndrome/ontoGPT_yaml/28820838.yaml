input_text: 'Five-Year Follow-Up of Midface Distraction in Growing Children with Syndromic
  Craniosynostosis. BACKGROUND: Maxillary position in patients with syndromic craniosynostosis
  after midface distraction has been shown to be stable 1 year postoperatively. The
  purpose of this study is to assess midfacial position in the growing child with
  craniosynostosis 5 years after Le Fort III advancement with a rigid external device.
  METHODS: Seventeen consecutive patients were identified to have the diagnosis of
  syndromic craniosynostosis and had undergone midface advancement [corrected]. There
  were 10 boys and seven girls, seven patients had Crouzon syndrome, five had Apert
  syndrome, and five had Pfeiffer syndrome. A standard subcranial Le Fort III osteotomy
  was performed. Cephalometric analysis was performed to assess the position of the
  maxilla. RESULTS: After device removal, orbitale advanced 13.67 mm along the x axis
  and downward 1.70 mm along the y axis. The A point advanced 15.97 mm along the x
  axis and downward 1.14 mm along the y axis. At 1 year after distraction, both orbitale
  and A point had advanced an additional 0.47 mm and 0.24 mm along the x axis and
  downward 0.58 mm and 1.78 mm along the y axis, respectively. At 5 years after distraction,
  the orbitale moved posterior 0.58 mm and the A point advanced an additional 2.08
  mm along the x axis. Orbitale and A point descended 3.23 mm and 5.2 mm along the
  y axis, respectively. CONCLUSION: After Le Fort III advancement with distraction,
  the maxillary position remains stable and continues to advance minimally along the
  x axis and demonstrates more growth along the y axis over the long term. CLINICAL
  QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, IV.'
