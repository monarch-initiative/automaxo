input_text: 'Early midfacial distraction for syndromic craniosynostotic patients with
  obstructive sleep apnoea. Syndromic craniosynostosis is known to be associated with
  various obstructive respiratory disorders, including sleep apnoea. We performed
  early midfacial distraction in 11 syndromic craniosynostotic patients with obstructive
  respiratory apnoea and obtained good results. There were four patients with Crouzon
  syndrome, three patients with Pfeiffer syndrome and four patients with Apert syndrome.
  Their ages ranged from 7 months to 3 years, 9 months (mean: 2 years, 5 months).
  Midfacial distraction was performed using an internal or external device to improve
  obstructive respiratory disorders, such as sleep apnoea, and to avoid tracheostomy.
  Evaluation was performed by comparison of the pre- and postoperative polysomnograms
  (PSGs) and cephalograms. All patients had markedly improved respiratory disorders
  during sleep and avoided tracheostomy. Preoperative PSGs and cephalograms were compared
  with those from 1 year to 1 year, 6 months postoperatively. The postoperative PSGs
  and cephalograms showed marked improvements compared with preoperative PSGs and
  cephalograms. Syndromic craniosynostotic patients have facial bone hypoplasia, particularly
  of the maxilla. The tongue and parapharyngeal soft tissue become enlarged, and the
  enlarged tissues can cause airway obstruction. In this study, marked improvements
  were observed in physical evaluation using PSGs and morphological evaluation using
  cephalograms. Early midfacial distraction is thought to be a very useful method
  to reconstruct a large pharyngeal cavity, enlarge the airway, improve obstructive
  respiratory disorders and to avoid tracheostomy. It is important to select a device
  suitable for each case when surgery and distraction are performed. '
