input_text: 'Surgical strategy for Apert syndrome: Retrospective study of developmental
  quotient and three-dimensional computerized tomography. There are many surgical
  techniques for craniosynostosis. However, the indications for and timing of surgery
  still remain unclarified. Most of the skull growth in craniosynostosis is completed
  in the first year, and the bone is strong enough to undergo distraction osteogenesis.
  However, previous reports showed that patients operated on before 1 year of age
  had better IQ than those operated later in life. This report aims to consider the
  best timing for cranial expansion and surgical strategy for Apert syndrome. From
  January 2002 to December 2011, 13 patients with Apert syndrome were operated on
  and were followed up for more than 5 years. Nine patients underwent operations before
  1 year of age (early surgery group) and three patients underwent operations later
  in life (late surgery group). They underwent fronto-orbital advancement for primary
  surgery. We evaluated postoperative developmental quotient every year and cephalic
  index (CI) measured by three-dimensional computerized tomography (3D-CT) at the
  age over 5 years retrospectively. Eleven of 13 patients improved their developmental
  quotient scores, with no significant intergroup differences. The CI evaluation showed
  cases with remnant brachycephalic deformity in both groups. Two patients with remnant
  plagiocephalic deformities tend to have primary surgery early in life compared to
  the others. Thus the delay in primary surgery had little influence on psychological
  development. We conclude that the primary surgery can be delayed unless the intracranial
  pressure needs to be controlled. In addition, fronto-orbital advancement could not
  sufficiently improve the brachycephalic appearance, other procedures like posterior
  vault distraction might be better alternatives.'
