input_text: 'Airway statuses and nasopharyngeal airway use for airway obstruction
  in syndromic craniosynostosis. Syndromic craniosynostosis is associated with a high
  rate of respiratory difficulty, due mainly to midfacial hypoplasia. Nasopharyngeal
  airway establishment has been reported as the first-line approach to airway obstruction
  and may obviate the need for a highly invasive tracheotomy. No previous studies
  have compared airway obstruction status in syndromic craniosynostosis between cases
  requiring and not requiring airway managements. We focus on nasopharyngeal airway
  use and airway status outcomes to assess respiratory difficulty in patients with
  syndromic craniosynostosis. A retrospective data analysis of 51 cases with syndromic
  craniosynostosis was carried out. We divided 30 of the 51 cases with lateral pharyngeal
  x-rays taken before operations affecting airway diameters into 2 groups, one with
  neither nasopharyngeal airway insertion nor tracheotomy and the other with one or
  both of these interventions, and the mean diameters for 8 indices related to the
  pharyngeal space were compared. Cases with respiratory difficulty due to nasopharyngeal
  stenosis and requiring airway managements comprised a significantly higher proportion
  of those with Pfeiffer syndrome than patients with Crouzon or Apert syndrome. Comparative
  examination of lateral x-ray cephalometry between cases with neither nasopharyngeal
  airway insertion nor tracheotomy and cases with one or both revealed oropharyngeal
  diameters tended to be smaller in those with interventions. Cases requiring nasopharyngeal
  airway insertion were able to continue nasopharyngeal airway use for more than 1
  year and a considerable number avoided tracheotomy. It may be worth considering
  an oropharyngeal-bypass nasopharyngeal airway before performing a tracheotomy. '
