input_text: "Correction of Brachymetatarsia and Medial Angulation of the Great Toe
  of Apert Foot By Distraction Osteogenesis: A Review of 7 Years of Experience. BACKGROUND:
  Apert foot anomalies may cause severe problems such as pain and development of callus
  formation related to weight redistribution, problems with footwear, and gait disturbances
  that may limit their daily activities. The main purpose of this study was to review
  our experience with distraction osteogenesis for the correction of brachymetatarsia
  and the great toe angulation of the patients with Apert syndrome. METHODS: This
  study retrospectively reviewed 7 patients (14 extremities) followed up for Apert
  syndrome who underwent distraction for the correction of bilateral congenital brachymetatarsia
  and angulation of the great toe between 2004 and 2008. Correction of the metatarsal
  inclination angle, the medial angulation of the great toe, the percentage of lengthening,
  and lengthening rates of distracted bones were evaluated. RESULTS: Patients ranged
  in age from 4 to 8 years at the distraction operation, with a mean age of 5.4+-1.3
  years, and the average length of follow-up was 86.6+-21.0 months. The length of
  the first metatarsal bone increased significantly from the average length of 32.6+-5.7
  mm to an average of 46.7+-6.5 mm (P<0.001). The mean lengthening rate and lengthening
  percentages of distracted bones were 0.4%+-0.1%/month and 30.2%+-6.4%/month, respectively.
  Preoperative and postoperative metatarsal inclination angles were at a mean of 43.8+-5.12
  and 32.6+-3.8, respectively, and the correction of metatarsal inclination was considered
  as statistically significant (P<0.001). The mean angulation of the great toe reduced
  significantly from 49.8+-11.76 to 13.2+-8.5 degrees after distraction (P<0.001).
  Minor complications such as pin loosening, pin-tract infection, and early union
  that required reoperation were observed in 5 extremities (35.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Anatomic
  features of Apert foot may lead to complaints that may limit patients' daily activities
  and require as much attention as associated hand and craniofacial anomalies. Distraction
  appears to be an effective and safe approach for the simultaneous correction of
  the shortness of the first ray and medial angulation of the great toe. LEVEL OF
  EVIDENCE: Level IV."
