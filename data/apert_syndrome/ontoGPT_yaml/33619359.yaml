input_text: 'Insights and future directions of potential genetic therapy for Apert
  syndrome: A systematic review. Apert syndrome is a genetic disorder characterised
  by craniosynostosis and structural discrepancy of the craniofacial region as well
  as the hands and feet. This condition is closely linked with fibroblast growth factor
  receptor-2 (FGFR2) gene mutations. Gene therapies are progressively being tested
  in advanced clinical trials, leading to a rise of its potential clinical indications.
  In recent years, research has made great progress in the gene therapy of craniosynostosis
  syndromes and several studies have investigated its influences in preventing/diminishing
  the complications of Apert syndrome. This article reviewed and exhibited different
  techniques of gene therapy and their influences in Apert syndrome progression. A
  systematic search was executed using electronic bibliographic databases including
  PubMed, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, SciFinder and Web of Science for all studies of gene
  therapy for Apert syndrome. The primary outcomes measurements vary from protein
  to gene expressions. According to the findings of included studies, we conclude
  that the gene therapy using FGF in Apert syndrome was critical in the regulation
  of suture fusion and patency, occurred via alterations in cellular proliferation.
  The superior outcome could be brought by biological therapies targeting the FGF/FGFR
  signalling. More studies in molecular genetics in Apert syndrome are recommended.
  This study reviews the current literature and provides insights to future possibilities
  of genetic therapy as intervention in Apert syndrome.'
