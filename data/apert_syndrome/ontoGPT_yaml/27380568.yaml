input_text: "Apert Syndrome: Outcomes From the Australian Craniofacial Unit's Birth
  to Maturity Management Protocol. The complex, progressive, multisystem nature of
  Apert syndrome presents many challenges to managing surgeons. Based on the pioneering
  work of Paul Tessier, the senior author developed a multidisciplinary birth to maturity
  management protocol for Apert syndrome. Between 1975 and 2014 the Australian Craniofacial
  Unit has treated 174 Apert syndrome patients and 28 have completed full protocol
  management. This paper reviews the scientific contribution made to the management
  of Apert syndrome by the Australian Craniofacial Unit, the development and evolution
  of the protocol and presents comprehensive data on the surgical and nonsurgical
  craniofacial interventions, and outcomes for the 28 patients who have completed
  the programme; 26 had normal visual acuity, 22 had normal hearing, 20 achieved normal
  or nearly normal speech, 24 a functional class I occlusion, 18 completed mainstream
  schooling of whom at least 8 went on to tertiary education, at least 13 gained employment
  and 15 developed good social groups. These outcomes equal or exceed those presented
  by other authors and provide compelling evidence of the value of protocol management
  in clinical outcomes, in addition to their value in international collaboration,
  and scientific development of future therapeutic strategies for the management of
  Apert syndrome. "
