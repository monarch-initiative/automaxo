input_text: 'The Apert hand--angiographic planning of a single-stage, 5-digit release
  for all classes of deformity. PURPOSE: To demonstrate the utility of computed tomography
  angiographic planning of a single-stage, complete release of syndactyly in Apert
  syndrome. METHODS: Computed tomography angiograms were performed as a preoperative
  planning tool in 6 patients. Five came to surgery. All had a single-stage operation
  for complete release of their syndactyly. RESULTS: Five patients, ranging from Upton
  type 1 to type 3 Apert hand deformities, have had preoperative computed tomography
  angiography that delineated the vascular anatomy. This allowed planning and execution
  of a single-stage syndactyly release in all patients. The preoperative imaging identified
  noteworthy abnormalities in vascular anatomy that were incorporated into surgical
  planning. CONCLUSIONS: The protocol presented allows preoperative planning and single-stage
  operation for complete release of syndactyly in patients with Apert syndrome.'
