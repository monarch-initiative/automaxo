input_text: '[Use of the air-Q intubating laryngeal airway for tracheal intubation
  in predicted difficult airway management in a pediatric patient]. The intubating
  laryngeal airway, air-Q ILA, was recently introduced in Japan. It has been used
  in adult patients for difficult airway management; however, there are few reports
  available on its use in pediatric patients. We report the use of the air-Q ILA in
  predicted difficult airway management in a 16-month-old patient with Apert syndrome
  characterized by acrocephalosyndactyly undergoing a syndactyly operation. It was
  somewhat difficult to keep his airway with a facemask, and an air-Q ILA was inserted.
  Following the ventilation via air-Q ILA, tracheal intubation guided by a tracheal
  fiberscope was attempted through the air-Q ILA. Five months after this operation,
  the patient again underwent the same operation. We managed his airway in the same
  way as previously, and the tracheal was intubated. This case shows that the air-Q
  ILA can be an alternative device in pediatric difficult airway management.'
