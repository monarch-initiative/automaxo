input_text: 'Single Suture Synostosis and Isolated Cleft Palate in Non-Apert Syndrome
  Patients. INTRODUCTION: Single suture craniosynostosis (SSC) and isolated cleft
  palate (ICP) in non-Apert syndrome patients rarely occur together. Management includes
  airway optimization, timing surgery appropriately, and assessing both cranial vault
  aesthetics and speech outcomes. The aim of this study was to compare treatment pathways
  and outcomes in patients with both conditions to standard treatment for these conditions
  in isolation. METHODS: Patient hospital medical records were retrospectively reviewed
  for demographic data, timing of surgery, aesthetic outcome (using the Whitaker grading
  system for head shape), and speech outcome (from speech therapy records of general
  development and speech assessment). RESULTS: Six patients with SSC and ICP were
  identified over an 18-year period. Cranial surgery was performed between 4 and 16
  months and cleft surgery between 6 and 34 months of age in all cases. Documentation
  of cleft surgery and genetic testing was not available for 1 patient. One patient
  with hemi-palatal absence had an obturator inserted at 34 months. Two patients were
  found to have Fragile X and Emanuel syndrome, respectively.No increased perioperative
  airway risk was highlighted in any case. Four cases were designated Whitaker grade
  1, 1 case was designated grade 2, and 1 case was not graded as no cranial surgery
  was performed. Half of the patients had general and speech developmental delay,
  while the other half demonstrated no signs of developmental delay. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION:
  Examination of 6 patients with SSC and ICP suggests the presence of both conditions
  does not adversely impact management or outcome for each condition, or increase
  perioperative risk.'
