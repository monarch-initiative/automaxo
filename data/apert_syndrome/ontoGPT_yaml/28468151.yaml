input_text: 'Tracheal Cartilaginous Sleeve in Syndromic Craniosynostosis: An Underrecognized
  Source of Significant Morbidity and Mortality. Tracheal cartilaginous sleeve (TCS)
  is a rare and previously unrecognized source of morbidity and mortality in patients
  with certain craniosynostosis syndromes. There is a paucity of reporting on this
  airway anomaly, and the true incidence of TCS is largely unknown. The purpose of
  this study was to investigate the incidence of TCS among patients with syndromic
  craniosynostosis at our institution. Patients with syndromic craniosynostosis who
  underwent direct bronchoscopy and laryngoscopy were evaluated retrospectively by
  pediatric otolaryngologists for the presence of TCS and associated anomalies. Among
  patients with a diagnosis of syndromic craniosynostosis in our craniofacial database,
  10 (37%) were found to have previous direct bronchoscopy and laryngoscopy reports.
  Of these 10 patients, 2 had Crouzon syndrome, 3 had Pfeiffer syndrome, 3 had Apert
  syndrome, 1 had Muenke syndrome, and 1 had Antley-Bixler syndrome. Eighty percent
  (8/10) of these patients were found to have some evidence of TCS. The most commonly
  observed associated findings included the following: tracheostomy dependency (7/10;
  70%), hearing loss (6/10; 60%), obstructive sleep apnea (5/10; 50%), cervical spine
  anomalies (5/10; 50%), developmental delay (5/10; 50%), and enlarged cerebral ventricles
  (4/10; 40%). Larger multicenter studies are required to further characterize this
  airway anomaly and its impact on this patient population. Our results confirm the
  importance of thorough airway evaluation at initial presentation and the need for
  validated screening protocols.'
