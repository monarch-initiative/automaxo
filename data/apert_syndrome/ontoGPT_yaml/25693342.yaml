input_text: '[Air-Q  intubating laryngeal airway as a conduit for tracheal intubation
  in a patient with Apert syndrome: a case report]. We present a case of an 18-year-old
  male who underwent strabismus operation under general anesthesia. In his childhood,
  tracheostomy had been performed for the repair of cleft lip and palate. His Mallampati
  classification was IV and preoperative endoscopic examination revealed megaloglossia
  and severe airway narrowing. For possible difficult airway, intubating laryngeal
  airway (air-Q , size 2.5) was used for tracheal intubation. Following insertion
  of air-Q , trachea was intubated via air-Q  guided with fiberscope. The patient
  was ventilated via tracheal tube with the air-Q  remaining in place during the operation.
  air-Q  can be effectively utilized for airway management for an adult Apert syndrome
  patient'
