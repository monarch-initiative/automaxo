input_text: Management of Paronychia in Patients With Apert Syndrome. Apert syndrome
  is a complex congenital syndrome that includes bicoronal craniosynostosis, craniofacial
  dysmorphologies, cleft palate, hearing loss, spina bifida occulta, cardiac anomalies,
  and affects the upper and lower extremities-producing complex syndactyly in these
  patients. Management of the hands yields several challenges and mandates close follow-up
  to balance repair of complex polysyndactyly with other pressing interventions, such
  as posterior cranial vault distraction and surgical management of the airway. Our
  goals of therapy for the hands are to preserve 10 digits, provide sufficient soft
  tissue coverage, optimize hand function, and minimize the number of surgical interventions.
  Ideally, surgical management of the hand differences occurs between the ages of
  9 months and 2 years, to optimize neurocognitive development. In complex syndactyly
  observed in patients with Apert syndrome, there are broad, conjoined nail plates
  that overlie the fused digits, and paronychia occurs frequently. Suppurative infections
  can delay definitive surgical intervention for the patient's complex syndactyly,
  and resolution of paronychia is critical. This study aims to propose an effective
  and safe technique to manage paronychia when it occurs in patients with Apert complex
  syndactyly and to mitigate the length of delay to definitive polysyndactyly reconstruction.
  In the context of these patients' need for multiple surgical interventions within
  the first few years of life, this strategy for preventing or mitigating paronychia
  can play an important role in streamlining their complex surgical management while
  avoiding multiple cancellations.
