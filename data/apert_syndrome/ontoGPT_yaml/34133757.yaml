input_text: "Complex Airway Management in Patients with Tracheal Cartilaginous Sleeves.
  OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: A tracheal cartilaginous sleeve (TCS) is a rare anomaly characterized
  by anterior fusion of tracheal cartilages. TCS is associated with syndromic craniosynostoses
  including Apert, Crouzon and Pfeiffer syndromes and FGFR2, FGFR3, and TWIST1 variants.
  This study presents a 30-year review of patients with syndromic craniosynostosis
  and TCS and describes diagnostic methods, genetic variants, surgical interventions,
  and long-term outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective, single-institution review.
  METHODS: This review included patients with syndromic craniosynostosis and TCS treated
  at Seattle Children's Hospital from 1990 to 2020. Tracheostomy, genetic variants,
  and additional surgery were primary measures. Fisher's exact test compared need
  for tracheostomy in patients with proposed high-risk (FGFR2 p.W290 or FGFR2 p.C342)
  versus low-risk genetic variants. RESULTS: Thirty patients with TCS were identified.
  Average age at diagnosis was 12 months (range 2-weeks to 7.9-years; standard deviation
  19.8 months). Syndromes included Pfeiffer (37%), Apert (37%), and Crouzon (26%).
  Severe obstructive sleep apnea was present in 76% of patients. Tracheostomy was
  performed in 17 patients (57%); five were successfully decannulated. Additional
  interventions included adenotonsillectomy (57%), nasal (20%), laryngeal (17%), and
  craniofacial skeletal surgery (87%). All patients with Pfeiffer syndrome and FGFR2
  p.W290C variants and 83% of patients with FGFR2 p.C342 variants required tracheostomy,
  differing from other variants (P = .02, odds ratio 33, 95% confidence interval 1.56-697.96).
  One patient (3%) died. CONCLUSION: TCS contributes to multilevel airway obstruction
  in patients with syndromic craniosynostosis. Genetic testing in patients with FGFR2-related
  syndromic craniosynostoses may identify those at risk of TCS and facilitate early
  intervention. A better understanding of this patient population may foster individualized
  airway management strategies and improve outcomes. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4 Laryngoscope,
