Clinical work-up proofed myocardial copper and iron accumulation using mass spectrometry, which led most likely to myocardial fibrosis as visualized by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (unprecedented delayed enhancement pattern) and endomyocardial biopsy. Consequently, cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation and subsequent episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia were considered as primary cardiac manifestation of Wilson's disease. This can, as illustrated by our case, occur even late after curative liver transplantation, which is an important fact that treating physicians should be aware of during clinical follow-up of these patients.

METHODS: A total of 32 untreated WD patients and 10 normal controls were enrolled in the study. The neurological symptoms were evaluated using the modified Young scale. Liver function, metal metabolism, susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) examination were done. The clinical disease stages were divided into metal deposition period, fiber damage period, and neuronal necrosis period according to the imaging results. The content of 24-h urine copper, serum copper, and serum iron; and the levels of catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), nitric oxide synthase (NOS), superoxide dismutase (SOD), interleukin (IL-1), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) were detected. RESULTS: The contents of urinary copper in WD patients at neuronal necrosis stage were lower than those in patients at the metal deposition stage (P = 0.011) and fiber injury stage (P = 0.023). The contents of NOS (P = 0.039) and NO (P = 0.047) in WD patients at the stage of fiber injury were higher than those of the normal control, while GSH-PX (P = 0.025) and CAT (P = 0.041) were lower in the neuronal necrosis stage. In the stage of neuronal necrosis, the levels of IL-1 (P = 0.030) and TNF-alpha were higher than those of the normal control (P = 0.042). The neurological symptom scores in patients with fiber injury (P = 0.013) and neuron injury were higher than those with metal deposition (P = 0.026). CONCLUSION: There are different pathogenic factors in different stages of WD. At the neuronal necrosis stage, copper deposition was decreased in WD patients. In the stage of fiber injury and neuronal necrosis, there is oxidative stress injury in WD patients. In the neuronal necrosis phase, WD patients have an inflammatory response.

The genetic defect is caused by various mutations in the copper-transporting enzyme ATP7B, located mainly in the liver and brain. Clinical symptoms are highly variable, with any combination of hepatic and/or neurological or psychiatric manifestations. The age of onset varies from early childhood to young adults and can even be manifested in later ages. The clinical diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical, biochemical and molecular markers. Treatment using chelating agents and zinc salts is effective when started early or even better at presymptomatic stages of the disease.

Commonly used medical therapy shows satisfactory results with regard to hepatic disease but only limited effects in neurologically affected patients. In recent years several new therapy options have been developed, showing promising results that might improve the management of Wilson disease in the near future. Optimization of treatment regimens depending on biochemical response pattern seems worthwhile, especially in the decoppering phase of therapy. The chelator tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) is a promising therapy option, currently under clinical investigation. TTM is a fast-acting and very potent chelator and appears to be associated with early neurologic deterioration after initiation of therapy to a lower extent than the drugs currently used. Treatment with nonchelating drugs characterized by alternative modes of action is under investigation, but restricted to animal or in vitro studies to date. This includes basic research studies demonstrating proof of principle for successful cell or gene therapy in Wilson disease in order to restore sufficient biliary copper excretion, even before the onset of disease.

Sleep disorders are highly prevalent in patients with WD. However, both prevalence rates and severity of different sleep disorders in patients with WD vary widely. The aims of the current study were to systematically review and perform a meta-analysis of the association between WD and prevalent sleep disorders, including insomnia, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD), excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), restless legs syndrome (RLS), periodic limb movement in sleep (PLM), cataplexy-like episodes (CLEs) and sleep paralysis, and objective sleep characteristics. METHODS: We performed a systematic search of PubMed, EMBase, the Cochrane Library, PsycINFO and ISI Web of Science for case-control studies. A total of 7 studies with 501 participants were included. RESULTS: We found that 54.1% of patients with WD experience sleep disorders and up to 7.65-fold higher odds compared to control patients. Specifically, patients with WD had higher rates of RBD, insomnia, and EDS based on self-reported questionnaires. No differences were observed in terms of RLS, PLM, or SDB between patients with WD and control patients. Furthermore, objective sleep disruptions based on polysomnographic studies included prolonged sleep onset latency and REM sleep onset latency, reduced total sleep time and sleep efficiency, higher percentage of stage N1 sleep and lower percentage of stage N2 sleep were observed in patients with WD. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that sleep disorders are frequent in patients with WD. Future studies should examine the longitudinal association of WD with sleep disturbances.

Early diagnosis and treatment could lead to improved survival of patients. Patients are best treated at pre-symptomatic stages but early diagnosis of Wilson disease is challenging owing to complex diagnosis. Evidence based genetic counseling requires characterization of underlying mutations in Wilson disease families. The aim was to characterize the causative mutation(s) in a Pakistani Wilson disease family by custom developed ARMS-PCR assay. A proband (19 years old boy) having Wilson disease with evidence of K-F ring, severe neurological and psychiatric manifestations and clinical findings supported by biochemical abnormalities was followed. Following screening for 12 putative mutations in ATP7B, we identified a homozygous mutation (p.Cys271*, c.813C > A) in proband by T-ARMS-PCR assay and validated by Sanger DNA sequencing. Furthermore, on screening of his family members, a younger sister (aged 9 years) was found to have the same homozygous mutation even though she was clinically asymptomatic except for a light K-F ring. Parents were heterozygous for this mutation and an elder brother was homozygous normal. Molecular diagnosis by PCR based assays (M-ARMS-PCR and T-ARMS-PCR) is cost effective, reliable, and efficient for preliminary screening of mutations in the ATP7B gene in developing countries like Pakistan, which can be successfully applied to Wilson disease families for genetic testing and follow-up evidence based genetic counseling.
33275388		A New Onset of Mania in a 49-Year-Old Man: An Interesting Case of Wilson Disease.Wilson disease is a rare copper metabolism disorder that generally occurs in individuals between 5 and 35 years of age. Common clinical manifestations are hepatic, neurological, and psychiatric symptoms. Roughly, 4% of all cases occur in patients over 40 years of age and, among these patients, the presenting symptoms are generally neuropsychiatric, which often leads to misdiagnosis as a primary psychiatric disorder and a delay in correct diagnosis. This report presents the case of a 49-year-old man with no formal psychiatric history who presented with a new onset of mania. We outline the distinctive characteristics that appeared inconsistent with a primary psychiatric disorder and pointed toward secondary mania. Despite low serum ceruloplasmin, the absence of brain abnormalities more typical of Wilson disease on magnetic resonance imaging led a neurology consultant to advise that the diagnosis was likely primarily psychiatric. Due to atypical components of the patient's presentation, such as his late age of onset for bipolar disorder and acute cognitive decline, the psychiatric team advocated for further diagnostic workup. The subsequent evaluation confirmed Wilson disease based on specific ophthalmological and hepatic abnormalities and further copper studies. In addition, once diagnosed, the management of Wilson disease involves distinct clinical considerations given patients' presumed vulnerability to neurological side effects. This case illustrates the role psychiatric providers play in advocating for diagnostic workup in patients with atypical presentations of primary psychiatric disorders and the distinct diagnostic and treatment considerations associated with Wilson disease.
29274796		[Compliance with treatment in Wilson's disease: On the interest of a multidisciplinary closer follow-up].BACKGROUND: Compliance with treatment is very important for patients who suffer from Wilson's disease, a rare genetic disorder. They can benefit a long-life and effective treatment. The purpose of our study is to identify the level of compliance in Wilson's disease patients and features associated with compliance as well. METHODS: This is a prospective study carried out in the National Reference Center for Wilson Disease (based in Paris and Lyon) over a 8 months period. Patients were evaluated on the first (M0) and last month (M8) with a questionnaire evaluating the number of missed treatment doses, a self-questionnaire collecting the reasons for non-compliance, and analogic scales analyzing the doctor-patient relationship and their behavior towards the treatment. The severity of depression symptoms was investigated by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). A detailed phone call interview was conducted by a psychologist every two months to evaluate their compliance and feeling. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients were included. The mean age of patients was 34 years (+-9.9). At M0, 84.6% had a poor compliance with treatment. They were diagnosed more recently (P=0.049) with a higher proportion involving neurological disorders (P=0.007). Age, the type of treatment and the quality of the doctor-patient relationship were not associated with the outcome; 38.5% suffered from depressive symptoms. At M8, 56.8% of patients were poor compliants and 21.6% presented depressive symptoms. CONCLUSION: Wilsons's disease patients have important problems with compliance, without necessary being depressed. A close follow-up may help them become compliant, particularly those with neurological symptoms.
31277686		Social and demographic characteristics of a Polish cohort with Wilson disease and the impact of treatment persistence.BACKGROUND: Wilson disease (WD) is a genetic disorder involving impaired copper metabolism, which presents with hepatic, neurological, and/or psychiatric manifestations. WD requires lifelong pharmacotherapy and treatment persistence may be problematic. We studied social characteristics, education, and work-related activities and how they are affected by WD symptoms and treatment persistence. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, data on demographic characteristics, achieved education level, household and marital status, plus a primary source of income were collected from 202 Polish subjects (mean +- standard deviation age of 36.4 +- 9.9 years at assessment) with WD. RESULTS: Overall, WD appeared to have a negative impact on achieved level of education and influenced the ability to work as compared with the general Polish population. Patients with neurological manifestations less often achieved upper-secondary/post-secondary or higher education compared with those with hepatic manifestations (65.5% vs. 83.6%; p = 0.003). They also significantly less frequently stated salary (19.6% vs. 56.2%; p < 0.0001) as the primary income and more often were on disability pension (53.3% vs. 26.0%; p = 0.0003). The percentage of married patients with WD appeared lower than in the general population (47.0% vs. 54.6%), although the difference was not significant (p = 0.2). The 27.6% of patients who were non-persistent with WD treatment less frequently achieved upper/post-secondary or higher education compared with persistent patients (66.0% vs. 76.3%; NS) and their primary source of outcome was significantly less often a salary (18.9% vs. 40.3%; p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Neurological manifestations had an adverse effect on education level and work ability. Treatment non-persistence had a further negative impact regardless of the disease form. Patients with WD should receive appropriate treatment, with the need for persistence emphasized and monitored to avoid a detrimental effect on their lives.

32520831		Pediatric Wilson Disease Presenting as Acute Liver Failure: An Individual Patient Data Meta-analysis.OBJECTIVES: Wilson disease (WD) presenting as acute liver failure (ALF) is rare and typically fatal without liver transplantation (LT). Its rarity has hindered comprehensive studies. We undertook an individual patient data meta-analysis to characterize a cohort of pediatric patients presenting with ALF whose final diagnosis was WD to examine outcomes and identify predictors of poor outcomes. METHODS: Database searches were conducted in PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar, restricted to English-language articles published between January 1984 and May 2018. Articles were excluded if pediatric (<18 years old) data were not extractable or if LT was not readily available at reporting institutions. Extracted data included clinical and biochemical characteristics, genotype, treatment, and outcome. RESULTS: Data were available on 249 subjects from 52 articles, plus 7 additional subjects identified from our institution's WD database (N = 256). Females represented 69% (n = 170/245). Median age at presentation was 13.4 years (n = 204, range 4.0-17.9). Of the total 256 subjects, 87% underwent LT, 11% achieved spontaneous recovery and 2% died before LT. International normalized ratio >2.0 at presentation was a predictor of LT/death (odds ratio 7.6, 95% confidence interval 1.5-28), with a trend observed for hepatic encephalopathy (HE) (odds ratio 4.18, 95% confidence interval 0.99-18). Arithmetic diagnostic scores proved inferior in the pediatric age-bracket compared to adults. CONCLUSIONS: This large international pediatric cohort has permitted an individual patient data analysis of WD presenting as ALF. Notably, 11% of subjects achieved spontaneous survival; the rest required LT. Coagulopathy (international normalized ratio >2:0) and HE at presentation heralded poor outcomes. Further prospective studies may identify additional early predictors of outcomes.

WND presentations vary from liver steatosis to inflammation, fibrosis, and liver failure. Diets influence the liver phenotype in WND, but findings are inconsistent. To better understand the impact of excess calories on liver phenotype in WND, the study compared C57BL/6J Atp7b-/- and C57BL/6J mice fed for 12 weeks with Western diet or normal chow. Serum and liver metabolites, body fat content, liver histology, hepatic proteome, and copper content were analyzed. Wild-type and Atp7b-/- livers showed striking similarities in their responses to Western diet, most notably down-regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis, altered nuclear receptor signaling, and changes in cytoskeleton. Western diet increased body fat content and induced liver steatosis in males and females regardless of genotype; however, the effects were less pronounced in Atp7b-/- mice compared with those in the wild type mice. Although hepatic copper remained elevated in Atp7b-/- mice, liver inflammation was reduced. The diet diminished signaling by Rho GTPases, integrin, IL8, and reversed changes in cell cycle machinery and cytoskeleton. Overall, high calories decreased inflammatory response in favor of steatosis without improving markers of cell viability. Similar changes of cellular pathways during steatosis development in wild-type and Atp7b-/- mice explain histologic overlap between WND and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease despite opposite copper changes in these disorders.

Several studies have reported that besides copper (Cu), iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) are also accumulated at varying levels in various tissues in WD. However, there is not an adequate number of studies investigating the effects of Fe and Zn status on WD presentation and prognosis. We aimed to evaluate serum levels of ferritin (SFr), copper (SCu), and zinc (SZn) in WD and determine their role in disease presentation and prognosis. MATERIALS-METHOD: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 97 pediatric patients with WD who were diagnosed and followed at Inonu University Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition Department between January 2006 and May 2017. Serum Cu and Zn levels were analyzed by using flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Ferritin was analyzed by chemiluminescence immunoassay method. RESULTS: Analysis of serum levels of the elements according to the type of presentation, there was no significant difference between the groups for ceruloplasmin. However, SCU, FSCu, SFr and 24 h urinary copper levels were significantly higher (p = 0.002, p = 0.003, p = 0.023 and p < 0.001, respectively) and SZn and CSZn levels were significantly lower (fulminant WD). p < 0.001, p < 0.001). There was a positive correlation between SFr, SCu serum levels and mortality scores (respectively, r: 0.501, 0.564 for PELD, r:0.490, 0.504 for MELD, r: 0.345, 0.374 for Dhwan), and a negative correlation between SZn level and mortality scores. (r:-0.650 for PELD, r:-0.703 for MELD, r:-0.642 for Dhwan) We used the ROC curves to determine the worst prognosis for fulminant Wilson disease. According to these limit values, we found that the sensitivity and specificity of FWD development was significantly higher. (for SZn sensitivity of 91.5%, a specificity of 100%, p=<0,001, for SCu predicted FWD development with a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 73.7%, p=<0,001, for SFr predicted FWD development with a sensitivity of 92.9%, a specificity of 66.2%, p < 0,001) CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that SFr, SCu, SZn levels might have prognostic importance for WD.
32008504	associate|@CHEMICAL_Copper|@DISEASE_Hepatolenticular_Degeneration	Effect of Liver Transplant on Neurologic Manifestations and Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging Findings in Wilson Disease.OBJECTIVES: Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. It leads to copper accumulation in various organs (liver, eye, brain) and deteriorates their functions. Symptoms usually appear in the second and third decades of life. Neurologic symptoms and manifestations may appear 2 to 5 years after liver involvement, and neurologic symptoms are usually movement disorders. The main treatment objective is to decrease accumulation of copper by increasing urinary copper excretion. With early diagnosis and treatment, the quality of life of patients with Wilson disease evolves. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of liver transplant on neurologic manifestations and radiologic findings in patients with Wilson disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Since 1988, our center has performed 642 liver transplant procedures. Fifty-three patients with Wilson disease received a liver transplant during this period, with 15 adults patients included in our study. All study patients were evaluated by the same neurologist and radiologist. Tremor was scored by the glass scale test. Radiologic evaluations were made by cranial magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Before liver transplant, 4/15 study patients had tremor. In 1 patient, tremor was accompanied by dystonia; the patient's imaging findings and neurologic manifestations had regressed posttransplant. In the other 3 study patients with tremor, tremor decreased without any change in imaging findings. New-onset tremor was seen in 1 patient after liver transplant, but this patient had no observed imaging changes. This situation was correlated with immunosuppressive therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Neurologic recovery can be achieved in patients with Wilson disease with early diagnosis and treatment. Radiologic findings can be improved after therapy.

METHODS: Clinical data of 182 pediatric patients included in the French WD national registry from 01/03/1995 to 01/06/2019 were gathered. RESULTS: Diagnosis of WD was made at a mean age of 10.7 +- 4.2 years (range 1-18 years). At diagnosis, 154 patients (84.6%) had hepatic manifestations, 19 (10.4%) had neurological manifestations, and 9 patients (4.9%) were asymptomatic. The p.His1069Gln mutation was the most frequently encountered (14% of patients).Neurological patients were diagnosed at least 1 year after they presented their first symptoms. At diagnosis, the median urinary copper excretion (UCE) was 4.2 mumol/24 hours (0.2-253). The first-line treatment was d-penicillamine (DP) for 131 (72%) patients, zinc salts for 24 (13%) patients, and Trientine for 17 (9%) patients. Liver transplantation was performed in 39 (21.4%) patients, for hepatic indications in 33 of 39 patients or for neurological deterioration in 6 of 39 patients, mean Unified Wilson's Disease Rating Scale of the latter went from 90 +- 23.1 before liver transplantation (LT) to 26.8 +- 14.1 (P < 0.01) after a mean follow-up of 4.3 +- 2.5 years. Overall survival rate at 20 years of follow-up was 98%, patient and transplant-free combined survival was 84% at 20 years. CONCLUSION: Diagnosis of WD can be challenging in children, particularly at the early stages of liver disease and in case of neurological presentation; hence the support of clinical scores and genetic testing is essential. Diagnosis at early stages and proper treatment ensure excellent outcomes, subject to good long-term treatment compliance. LT is a valid option for end-stage liver disease not responding to treatment and can be discussed for selected cases of neurological deterioration.

Tacrolimus is an effective immunosuppressant that is used to treat acute rejection. Although rare, it can cause toxicity, which is demonstrated by cholestatic liver injury. Here, we present a case of a young male patient who was diagnosed with Wilson disease, had penicillaminechelating therapy, and underwent living related liver transplant. Within 1 month posttransplant, he developed deranged, predominantly cholestatic pattern liver function tests. Laboratory parameters showed total bilirubin of 1.12 mg/ dL, alanine aminotransferase of 553 IU/L, gammaglutamyltransferase of 624 IU/L, and tacrolimus level of 10.2 ng/mL. After thorough evaluation, a liver biopsy was performed. Liver biopsy showed hepatocellular necrosis with centrilobular cholestasis without any evidence of graft rejection. However, with normal level of tacrolimus, the biopsy was suggestive of drug-induced liver injury. Thus, tacrolimus dose was reduced, resulting in improved liver function tests and patient discharge from the hospital. Tacrolimus is an effective immunosuppressant after liver transplant and has the ability to treat early acute rejection. The patient's liver biopsy showed hepatocellular necrosis with centrilobular cholestasis without any evidence of graft rejection. Cholestatic liver injury after tacrolimus usually resolves after dose reduction or by switching to another agent. With demonstrated tacrolimus-induced toxicity in liver transplant recipients, despite normal serum levels, transplant physicians should keep high index of suspicion regarding toxicity in the posttransplant setting.

Eighty-two patients were included, and their phenomenology of MD was categorized. The severity of dystonia was assessed using the Burke-Fahn-Marsden score, and chorea, athetosis, myoclonus, and tremor on a 0-4 scale. The MRI changes were noted. Serum glutamate, cytokines, and oxidative stress markers were measured. Movement disorders were noted in 78/82 (95.1%) patients and included dystonia in 69 (84.1%), chorea in 31 (37.8%), tremor in 24 (29.3%), parkinsonism in 19 (23.2%), athetosis in 13 (15.9%), and myoclonus in 9 (11.0%) patients. Dystonia was more frequently observed in the patients with thalamic (76.8 vs 23.2%), globus pallidus (72.0 vs 28.0%), putamen (69.5 vs 30.5%), caudate (68.3 vs 31.7%) and brainstem (61.0 vs 39.0%) involvement, and tremor with cerebellar involvement (37.5 vs 5.2%). The median age of onset of neurological symptoms was 12 (5-50) years. WD patients had higher levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), glutamate, and cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNFalpha) and lower levels of glutathione and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) compared with the controls. Serum glutamate, IL-6, IL-8, and plasma MDA levels were increased with increasing neurological severity, while glutathione and TAC levels decreased. The severity of dystonia related to the number of MRI lesions. MD is the commonest neurological symptoms in WD. Oxidative stress, glutamate, and cytokine levels are increased in WD and correlate with neurological severity.
30028785	associate|@DISEASE_Acute_On_Chronic_Liver_Failure|@GENE_ALB	Transplant-free Survival in Chronic Liver Disease Presenting as Acute Liver Failure in Childhood.BACKGROUND: In adults, the absence of a preexisting chronic liver disease (CLD) is required to diagnose acute liver failure (ALF). The pediatric classification does not consider this aspect, thus previous studies pooled together children with ALF and children with unknown CLD presenting with acute hepatic decompensation (ALF-CLD). We aimed to compare prevalence, features, and outcome of children with ALF-CLD to those with a proper ALF. METHODS: Patients admitted between 1996 and 2017 because of ALF defined by Pediatric Acute Liver Failure criteria (raised transaminases, International Normal Ratio >=2.0, no history of liver disease) were classified as ALF-CLD if diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson disease, Budd-Chiari syndrome, hepatitis B virus reactivation, inborn errors of metabolism. The others were classified as ALF. RESULTS: Seventy-four children (median age, 4 years; 1.0-8.8; male/female, 36/38] with ALF were found; 18 of <1 year of age were excluded. Fifty-six (median age, 6.6 years; 2.7-11.7; male/female, 23/33], 22 with ALF-CLD (autoimmune hepatitis, n = 14; Wilson disease, n = 6; inborn errors of metabolism, n = 2) and 34 with ALF (paracetamol overdose, n = 6; viral infections, n = 3; mushroom poisoning, n = 5; indeterminate, n = 20) were compared. In ALF-CLD, the median age at onset was higher, alanine aminotransferase, albumin, and International Normal Ratio levels were lower, splenomegaly, ascites, and cirrhosis were more common (all P < 0.01). On multivariate analysis, the diagnosis of ALF-CLD was an independent predictor of transplant-free survival (P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: In children, ALF-CLD is common, has peculiar features, and is associated with a favorable outcome. This study suggests the need to distinguish this entity from other forms of ALF in children.

Similarly, diagnosis of WD on liver biopsy specimens is difficult due to the wide range of histologic appearances. A stain that could help identify WD patients would be of great value. The goal of this study was to use mass spectrometry-based proteomics to identify potential proteins that are differentially expressed in WD compared to controls, and could serve as potential immunohistochemical markers for screening. Several proteins were differentially expressed in WD and immunohistochemical stains for two (metallothionein (MT) and cytochrome C oxidase copper chaperone (COX17)) were tested and compared to other methods of diagnosis in WD including copper staining and quantitative copper assays. We found diffuse metallothionein immunoreactivity in all liver specimens from patients with WD (n = 20); the intensity of the staining was moderate to strong. This staining pattern was distinct from that seen in specimens from the control groups (none of which showed strong, diffuse staining), which included diseases that may be in the clinical or histologic differential of WD (steatohepatitis (n = 51), chronic viral hepatitis (n = 40), autoimmune hepatitis (n = 50), chronic biliary tract disease (n = 42), and normal liver (n = 20)). COX17 immunostain showed no significant difference in expression between the WD and control groups. MT had higher sensitivity than rhodanine for diagnosis of WD. While the quantitative liver copper assays also had high sensitivity, they require more tissue, have a higher cost, longer turnaround time, and are less widely available than an immunohistochemical stain. We conclude that MT IHC is a sensitive immunohistochemical stain for the diagnosis of WD that could be widely deployed as a screening tool for liver biopsies in which WD is in the clinical or histologic differential diagnosis.

This article describes hereditary hemochromatosis, Gilbert syndrome, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, Wilson disease, PFIC, BRIC, and LAL-D. The most common cause of hereditary hemochromatosis is a C282Y mutation in the HFE gene. Gilbert syndrome is a benign cause of indirect hyperbilirubinemia. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency causes both lung and liver disease. Wilson disease can cause neurologic disease and liver disease. Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis and benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis are rare causes of cholestasis. LAL-D is a rare disease that can appear similar to NAFLD in adults.
31077787	associate|@CHEMICAL_Copper|@DISEASE_Hepatolenticular_Degeneration	Assessment of corneal and lens clarity in children with Wilson disease.PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of copper accumulation on corneal and lens clarity in children with Wilson disease (WD) compared to healthy children. METHODS: This multicenter cross-sectional study included 24 subjects with WD and 25 age-matched controls. Clinical and laboratory characteristics of the WD subjects were recorded. The Pentacam HR imaging system was used both for lens densitometry and corneal densitometry. RESULTS: Corneal densitometry values were higher in the posterior 6-10 mm (P = 0.021), posterior 10-12 mm (P < 0.001), posterior total diameter (P = 0.037), total thickness 10-12 mm (P = 0.032), and total thickness 6-10 mm zones and layers (P = 0.040) in the WD eyes than in control eyes. The lens densitometry values of zone 1 were higher in WD eyes (P < 0.001). There was a significant relationship between corneal densitometry values in the posterior 10-12 mm zones (P = 0.012; r = 0.527) and the duration of WD and liver copper content (P = 0.016; r = 0.507). A statistically significant correlation was also detected between lens densitometry values in zone 1 and WD duration (P = 0.018; r = 0.426). CONCLUSION: In this study cohort, children with WD had decreased corneal and lens clarity even in cases without Kayser-Fleischer rings and sunflower cataracts. Densitometry measurements using Scheimpflug imaging provided detection of corneal and lens involvement in the early stages of WD.

The purpose of this study was to clarify the role of brain MRS in detecting early metabolite abnormalities in children with WD. PATIENT AND METHODS: A case-controlled prospective study included 26 children with WD and 26 healthy controls. All children were subjected to examination on a 1.5 T MRI scanner. The spectra of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), and creatine (Cr), as well as the metabolite ratios of NAA/Cho, NAA/Cr, and Cho/Cr, were measured and compared between two groups. RESULTS: Eight patients revealed increased signal intensity in the basal ganglia at T1-weighted images. When compared with healthy controls, WD patients showed a significant decrease (p <  0.05) in NAA (63.8 +- 9.6 vs 97.6 +- 3.8), Cho (46.7 +- 8.9 vs 87.3 +- 4.7), Cr (44 +- 10.1 vs 81.9 +- 4.05), NAA/Cho (1.92 +- 1.2 vs 3.34 +- 0.55), NAA/Cr (1.29 +- 0.7 vs 2.46 +- 0.34), and Cho/Cr (0.78 +- 0.4 vs 2 +- 0.13). Patients complicated with liver cell failure showed a significant decrease in all previous parameters (p <  0.05) than patients without complications. Patients with mixed neurological and hepatic diseases showed a severe reduction in NAA, NAA/Cr, and NAA/Cho compared with patients with hepatic disease only. CONCLUSION: MRS in pediatric WD detects early neurological changes even with normal MRI.

We aimed to provide better therapeutic options for patients with Wilson disease based on the data generated from this study. METHODS: We utilized the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), which stores clinical records of nearly 99% of Taiwan's residents. The database used is a random sample of two-million out of 23-million beneficiaries in Taiwan's NHIRD in 2005. The integrated medical records of these two-million cases were collected from 2000 to 2011. Subjects of Wilson disease were identified as those with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code 275.1 and the specific prescription drugs (including d-penicillamine, zinc, and trientine) in either outpatient clinic or inpatient records. RESULTS: During the study period, 66 cases of Wilson disease were identified. The male to female ratio was 1.75. The average prevalence rate was 1.81 per 100,000 and the average annual diagnosis rate was 0.22 per 100,000. The diagnosis was mostly established at 20-24 and 10-14 years of age, followed by 25-29 years. Fifty four of all subjects (81.8%) started the treatment with d-penicillamine, compared with zinc (12.1%) and trientine (6.1%). Among these 66 cases, 27 (40.9%) had liver cirrhosis and three (4.5%) underwent liver transplantation due to liver failure. CONCLUSION: d-penicillamine is still the most popular prescription of Wilson disease, followed by zinc monotherapy. Although chronic liver injury cannot be avoided, a favorable potential outcome is well demonstrated in this population-based study.

Although the frequency of malignancy is generally increased in chronic liver disease, CC rarely presents in Wilson disease (WD). The incidence of hepatic malignancy in WD is only 1.2%, with CC accounting for 0.5%. A 66 year old male with history of hypertension, diabetes, and compensated cryptogenic cirrhosis presented with acute onset dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain. He was incidentally found to have a sizeable mass in the right hepatic lobe. Ultimately, a liver biopsy revealed dense demoplasia and increased mucin production, consistent with diagnosis of CC. Biopsy also demonstrated increased copper deposition consistent with WD, explaining the patient's underlying cirrhosis. Unlike other forms of chronic liver disease where incidence of liver cancer is increased, the lower rate of malignancy seen in WD may be explained by a protective effect of copper in WD. Copper acts to both directly stabilize DNA and inhibit angiogenesis. In this case, it is possible that the degree of copper deposition in his liver was mild, causing cirrhosis and the chronic liver inflammation that caused his CC. However, it may not have been sufficient to "protect" against development of CC.

Varied prevalence of this disease in Type II Diabetics indicate variability in NAFLD risk factors along with the particular diagnostic methods used. Investigations like liver biopsy and ultrasound abdomen have their limitations. Liver biopsy is invasive on the other hand ultrasound has less sensitivity. Several others are in the list, but are cost ineffective. Among the several non-invasive biomarkers, recently developed Novel Fibrosis Index (NFI) is a new addition. Newly developed NFI was developed by observing the various relationships and variations of serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, platelet count and serum albumin in liver fibrosis. MATERIAL: This hospital based observational cross section study was conducted from June 2020 to May 2021in 76 study population of Assam Medical College and Hospital. Type II Diabetes mellitus patients having more than 18 years were included after consent. Alcoholics, pregnant women and patients with secondary cause of hepatic steatosis [Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, Wilson disease, Autoimmune hepatitis, Hypothyroidism, starvation, Parenteral nutrition, On medications like (valproate, corticosteroids, antivirals)] were excluded. Novel fibrosis Index (NFI) were calculated by [Bilirubinx(ALP)2/Platelet count(Albumin)2] in study population. Fibroscan 402 is used for fibrosis stage assessment. Ziol transient elastography breaking point were used for staging of fibrosis in study population according to Metavir system of fibrosis. Area under the curves of NFI and APRI for different fibrosis stages were obtained by ROC curves using SPSS software edition 21.0. OBSERVATION: NFI and APRI where able to predict fibrosis stage with correlation coefficient indices 0.5174 and 0.5369 respectively. Area under the ROC curve for NFI and APRI were 0.807 and 0.793 respectively for discriminating F0-F1 and above. Area under the ROC curve for discriminating F0-F2 and above for NFI and APRI were 0.814 and 0.810. Area under the ROC curve for discriminating F0-F3 and above for NFI and APRI were 0.935 and 0.913. CONCLUSION: Aggregate measures of performance across all possible classification threshold for NFI is better then APRI.

Methods: Forty patients with WD, including 20 with cerebral type and 20 with hepatic type, and 20 age-matched healthy controls in the First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University between Jul 2013 and May 2016 were enrolled.All study subjects underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) of the brain.Six regions of interest (ROIs) were chosen.The values of fractional anisotropy (FA), lambda in ROIs were determined on DTI, FA and fiber volumes between ROIs were also determined on DTI.The values of amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and regional homogeneity (REHO) in ROIs were determined on rs-fMRI.The values of corrected phase (CP) were calculated on SWI.The copper and iron content were measured.The difference of imaging and metal metrics between cerebral type and hepatic type WD were evaluated. Results: DTI metrics differed between patients with the cerebral and hepatic types of WD.ALFF values in the caudate nucleus, and thalamus were lower (P=0.037, 0.040), and REHO values in the caudate nucleus were lower (P=0.029), in patients of cerebral type than in hepatic type patients.CP values of the right caudate nucleus and left putamen in cerebral type WD patients were lower than in hepatic type patients (P=0.020, 0.23). The serum iron content of hepatic type WD patients was higher than the normal (P=0.013), and the urine copper content was higher than the cerebral type patients (P=0.021). Conclusions: Metal deposition and damage to the structure and functional activity in the brain may occur in hepatic type WD patients.The structural and functional activity damage of the brain in hepatic type is less severe than that in cerebral type patients, while the metal deposition is not significant different between hepatic and cerebral type.

Our aim was to describe clinical features, diagnostic findings, treatments, and outcomes of patients with ALF due to WD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective medical record reviews of all patients with ALF due to WD in eight years in Uruguay. RESULTS: WD was the cause of six (15%) of thirty-nine ALF cases. All patients were females, with a mean age of 18 years. Four patients presented with hyperacute liver failure and two with acute failure. Jaundice was the main complaint of all patients. Mean total bilirubin (TB), alkaline phosphatase (AP), AST, and ALT were 27.5 mg/dL, 45.5 lU/l, 156 IU/L, and 51 IU/L, respectively. Ceruloplasmin levels were low in four patients, urinary cooper was high in four, and two had Kayser-Fleischer rings. All patients had Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia, acute kidney injury, histochemical identifiable copper, and advanced fibrosis on liver histology. The average MELD score was 36. All patients were treated with d-penicillamine and listed for urgent liver transplantation (LT). Prometheus  was performed in one patient. Three patients died: two without LT and one after LT. Three patients survived: one without LT (New Wilson Index<11) and two with LT. The referral time to the program and the total time (referral plus waiting list time) were longer for non-survivors than for survivors (14 vs. 3 days and 23 vs. 8 respectively). CONCLUSION: All cases had typical clinical, analytical and histopathology characteristics. Early referral was determinant of prognosis.

It is caused by mutations in the adenosine triphosphatase copper transporting beta gene (ATP7B), which encodes a protein that transports copper from hepatocytes into the bile. We studied ATP7B-deficient cells and animals to identify strategies to decrease copper toxicity in patients with WD. METHODS: We used RNA-seq to compare gene expression patterns between wild-type and ATP7B-knockout HepG2 cells exposed to copper. We collected blood and liver tissues from Atp7b-/- and Atp7b+/- (control) rats (LPP) and mice; some mice were given 5 daily injections of an autophagy inhibitor (spautin-1) or vehicle. We obtained liver biopsies from 2 patients with WD in Italy and liver tissues from patients without WD (control). Liver tissues were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, cell viability, apoptosis assays, and electron and confocal microscopy. Proteins were knocked down in cell lines using small interfering RNAs. Levels of copper were measured in cell lysates, blood samples, liver homogenates, and subcellular fractions by spectroscopy. RESULTS: After exposure to copper, ATP7B-knockout cells had significant increases in the expression of 103 genes that regulate autophagy (including MAP1LC3A, known as LC3) compared with wild-type cells. Electron and confocal microscopy visualized more autophagic structures in the cytoplasm of ATP7B-knockout cells than wild-type cells after copper exposure. Hepatocytes in liver tissues from patients with WD and from Atp7b-/- mice and rats (but not controls) had multiple autophagosomes. In ATP7B-knockout cells, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) had decreased activity and was dissociated from lysosomes; this resulted in translocation of the mTOR substrate transcription factor EB to the nucleus and activation of autophagy-related genes. In wild-type HepG2 cells (but not ATP7B-knockout cells), exposure to copper and amino acids induced recruitment of mTOR to lysosomes. Pharmacologic inhibitors of autophagy or knockdown of autophagy proteins ATG7 and ATG13 induced and accelerated the death of ATP7B-knockout HepG2 cells compared with wild-type cells. Autophagy protected ATP7B-knockout cells from copper-induced death. CONCLUSION: ATP7B-deficient hepatocytes, such as in those in patients with WD, activate autophagy in response to copper overload to prevent copper-induced apoptosis. Agents designed to activate this autophagic pathway might decrease copper toxicity in patients with WD.
33547549	cause|@CHEMICAL_Copper|@DISEASE_Hepatolenticular_Degeneration	Wilson disease tissue classification and characterization using seven artificial intelligence models embedded with 3D optimization paradigm on a weak training brain magnetic resonance imaging datasets: a supercomputer application.Wilson's disease (WD) is caused by copper accumulation in the brain and liver, and if not treated early, can lead to severe disability and death. WD has shown white matter hyperintensity (WMH) in the brain magnetic resonance scans (MRI) scans, but the diagnosis is challenging due to (i) subtle intensity changes and (ii) weak training MRI when using artificial intelligence (AI). Design and validate seven types of high-performing AI-based computer-aided design (CADx) systems consisting of 3D optimized classification, and characterization of WD against controls. We propose a "conventional deep convolution neural network" (cDCNN) and an "improved DCNN" (iDCNN) where rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function was modified ensuring "differentiable at zero." Three-dimensional optimization was achieved by recording accuracy while changing the CNN layers and augmentation by several folds. WD was characterized using (i) CNN-based feature map strength and (ii) Bispectrum strengths of pixels having higher probabilities of WD. We further computed the (a) area under the curve (AUC), (b) diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), (c) reliability, and (d) stability and (e) benchmarking. Optimal results were achieved using 9 layers of CNN, with 4-fold augmentation. iDCNN yields superior performance compared to cDCNN with accuracy and AUC of 98.28 +- 1.55, 0.99 (p < 0.0001), and 97.19 +- 2.53%, 0.984 (p < 0.0001), respectively. DOR of iDCNN outperformed cDCNN fourfold. iDCNN also outperformed (a) transfer learning-based "Inception V3" paradigm by 11.92% and (b) four types of "conventional machine learning-based systems": k-NN, decision tree, support vector machine, and random forest by 55.13%, 28.36%, 15.35%, and 14.11%, respectively. The AI-based systems can potentially be useful in the early WD diagnosis. Graphical Abstract.
28836933		Intracerebral Hemorrhage Related With Penicillium Species Following Deceased-Donor Liver Transplant.Early or late posttransplant opportunistic infections are among the leading complications after liver transplant. The source of early posttransplant opportunistic infections is usually the patient, the implantation of an infected graft, contamination during a surgical procedure, or invasive interventions performed at the intensive care unit. A 10-year-old male patient with Wilson disease (Pediatric End-Stage Liver Disease Score of 42, Child-Pugh score of 12, total bilirubin 40 mg/dL, platelet count 55000/mL, hemoglobin level 6.3 g/dL, albumin level 1.7 g/dL, urinary copper level 4305 mu/24 h) was closely monitored in the pediatric intensive care unit of our liver transplantation center for care of a worsened general status. A deceased-donor liver transplant was performed using a right lobe liver graft (ex vivo split) obtained through the national organ sharing network. The patient developed rightward deviation of eyes and altered consciousness after the procedure and underwent cranial magnetic resonance imaging and computerized tomography examinations. The cranial magnetic resonance image, taken on the third postoperative day, revealed lesions consistent with embolic infarction, and the computed tomography scan, taken on the eighth day, showed intracerebral hemorrhage. Decompressive craniotomy, which included hematoma drainage and catheter placement, was performed. Culture and histopathologic examinations of the hematoma material revealed a Penicillium species of fungi. However, the patient died before a definitive diagnosis was made. The aim of this report is to raise awareness on early posttransplant opportunistic infections of the central nervous system presenting with intracranial hemorrhage following liver transplant.
31611120		Wilson Disease With Giant Splenic Artery Aneurysms Caused by Fibromuscular Dysplasia During Living Donor Liver Transplantation: A Case Report.Liver cirrhosis can cause splenic artery aneurysms (SAA) that pose a threat to patients undergoing liver transplantation. However, liver transplantation with multiple visceral artery aneurysms including giant SAA caused by arterial fragility has never been reported. We describe a 36-year-old man with decompensated liver cirrhosis due to Wilson disease that was complicated by giant SAA and multiple aneurysms in the bilateral renal arteries caused by fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). The maximal diameter of the triple snowball-shaped SAA was 11 cm. We planned a 2-stage strategy consisting of a splenectomy with distal pancreatectomy to treat the SAA and subsequent living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) to address the liver cirrhosis. This strategy was selected to prevent fatal postoperative infectious complications caused by the potential development of pancreatic fistula during simultaneous procedures and to histopathologically diagnose the arterial lesion before LDLT to promote safe hepatic artery reconstruction. However, a postoperative pancreatic fistula did not develop after a splenectomy with distal pancreatectomy, and the pathologic findings of the artery indicated FMD. The patient underwent ABO-identical LDLT with a right lobe graft donated by his brother. Other than postoperative rupture of the aneurysm in the left renal artery requiring emergency interventional radiology, the patient has remained free of any other arterial complications and continues to do well at 2 years after LDLT.

Among them, COG-CDG, ATP6V0A2-CDG, TMEM199-CDG and CCDC115-CDG have been shown to disturb Golgi vesicular trafficking and/or lumen pH acidification. Here, we report 3 new unrelated cases of CCDC115-CDG with emphasis on diagnosis difficulties related to strong phenotypic similarities with mitochondriopathies, Niemann-Pick disease C and Wilson Disease. Indeed, while two individuals clinically presented with early and severe liver fibrosis and cirrhosis associated with neurological symptoms, the other one "only" showed isolated and late severe liver involvement. Biological results were similar to previously described patients, including hypercholesterolemia, elevated alkaline phosphatases and defects in copper metabolism. CDG screening and glycosylation study finally led to the molecular diagnosis of CCDC115-CDG. Besides pointing to the importance of CDG screening in patients with unexplained and severe liver disease, these reports expand the clinical and molecular phenotypes of CCDC115-CDG. The hepatic involvement is particularly addressed. Furthermore, hypothesis concerning the pathogenesis of the liver disease and of major biological abnormalities are proposed.
28987261		Wilson Disease: Diagnosis, Treatment, and Follow-up.Consideration of a diagnosis of Wilson disease is still the critical factor in testing for and establishing disease diagnosis. In association with other clinical and biochemical tests, liver biopsy results and molecular genetic testing can also be used to generate a score for diagnosing Wilson disease. Medical therapy is effective for most patients; liver transplant can rescue those with acute liver failure or those with advanced liver disease who fail to respond to or discontinue medical therapy. Treatment monitoring must be done at regular intervals and includes clinical evaluation, liver tests and blood counts, and copper metabolic parameters.

METHODS: 100 untreated WD patients (80 cases of cerebral type, 20 cases of hepatic type, age 20.13 +- 9.12 years old) and 20 normal controls were selected. Neurological symptoms were scored using the modified Young scale. Liver function tests and copper indices were collected. All study objects received SWI test of the brain. The values of corrected phase (CP) were calculated on SWI. Cerebral-type WD patients were treated with D-penicillamine (DPA) (group 1) or Dimercaptopropane Sulfonate (DMPS) + Dimercaptosuccinic Acid (DMSA) (group 2). Hepatic-type WD patients were treated with DPA (group 3). All patients received annual neurological symptom score, liver function, copper indices, and SWI examination. RESULTS: At the first year of treatment, score of the modified Young scale in group 2 was lower than that in group 1 (P = 0.023) and lower than that before treatment (P = 0.040). After 2 years of treatment, the score of the modified Young scale in group 1 was lower than that before treatment (P = 0.012). At the second year after treatment, the urinary copper in group 2 was higher than that in group 1 (P = 0.014). Urinary copper was maintained at 200 microg/day in group 1 and 300 microg/day in group 2 after 3 years of treatment. At the first year of treatment, serum copper in group 1 was lower than that in group 2 (P = 0.032). At the first year of treatment, CP values of the pallidum and substantia nigra in group 2 were higher than those in group 1 (P = 0.026, 0.040). At the second year of treatment, CP value of substantia nigra in group 2 was higher than that in group 1 (P = 0.037). After 3 years of treatment, there was no difference in CP values between WD patients and normal controls. CONCLUSIONS: Therapy with DMPS and DMSA improves neurological symptoms of WD patients more quickly and leads to less aggravation, compared with therapy with DPA. The metal content in the brain of WD patients was at a low level after 3 years of treatment. DMPS and DMSA can remove metal from brain tissue faster than DPA.
32804913		Fulminant Wilson Disease in Children: Recovery After Plasma Exchange Without Transplantation.OBJECTIVES: Since 2005, a New Wilson Index (NWI) >=11 is used as a predictor of death without transplantation in fulminant Wilson disease (WD). Plasma exchange is advocated as a new treatment modality. METHODS: We present a patient with fulminant WD treated with plasma exchange. All published cases applying plasma exchange for fulminant WD were reviewed systematically. RESULTS: A 14-year-old girl presented with hemolysis and fulminant liver failure. She had no encephalopathy; NWI was 14. As a bridge to transplantation plasma exchange was started immediately. Complete remission was achieved with plasma exchange and later chelation therapy with D-penicillamine. She is now at 3-year transplant-free survival. Literature review identified 37 patients presenting with fulminant WD and NWI >=11 who were treated with plasma exchange. Seventeen of these patients (ie, 46%) recovered without transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple case reports and case series demonstrate transplant free survival after plasma exchange and subsequent chelation therapy, despite a NWI >=11. Plasma exchange affects the clinical course and is a therapeutic option in children and young adults presenting with fulminant WD.
33275389		Commentary on "A New Onset of Mania in a 49-Year-Old Man: An Interesting Case of Wilson Disease".Wilson disease is a rare copper metabolism disorder that generally occurs in individuals between 5 and 35 years of age. Common clinical manifestations are hepatic, neurological, and psychiatric symptoms. Roughly, 4% of all cases occur in patients over 40 years of age and, among these patients, the presenting symptoms are generally neuropsychiatric, which often leads to misdiagnosis as a primary psychiatric disorder and a delay in correct diagnosis. This report presents the case of a 49-year-old man with no formal psychiatric history who presented with a new onset of mania. We outline the distinctive characteristics that appeared inconsistent with a primary psychiatric disorder and pointed toward secondary mania. Despite low serum ceruloplasmin, the absence of brain abnormalities more typical of Wilson disease on magnetic resonance imaging led a neurology consultant to advise that the diagnosis was likely primarily psychiatric. Due to atypical components of the patient's presentation, such as his late age of onset for bipolar disorder and acute cognitive decline, the psychiatric team advocated for further diagnostic workup. The subsequent evaluation confirmed Wilson disease based on specific ophthalmological and hepatic abnormalities and further copper studies. In addition, once diagnosed, the management of Wilson disease involves distinct clinical considerations given patients' presumed vulnerability to neurological side effects. This case illustrates the role psychiatric providers play in advocating for diagnostic workup in patients with atypical presentations of primary psychiatric disorders and the distinct diagnostic and treatment considerations associated with Wilson disease.

Patients have variable clinical manifestations and laboratory test results, resulting in diagnostic dilemmas. We aimed to identify factors associated with symptoms and features of Wilson disease from a large cohort, over 15 years. METHODS: We collected data from 715 patients (529 with symptoms, 146 without symptoms, and 40 uncategorized) and a genetic confirmation of Wilson's disease (mean age of diagnosis, 18.84 years), recruited from 3 hospitals in China from 2004 through 2019. We analyzed clinical data along with serum levels of ceruloplasmin (available from 636 patients), 24-hr urinary copper excretion (collected from 131 patients), Kayser-Fleisher rings (copper accumulation in eyes, with neurologic data from 355 patients), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities. Differences among the groups were analyzed using 1-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey multiple comparison test. RESULTS: Of the 529 patients with symptoms, 121 had hepatic features, 355 had neurologic features, 28 had osteomuscular features (premature osteoarthritis, skeletal deformities, and pathological bone fractures), and 25 had psychiatric symptoms. Age of onset was significantly younger in patients with hepatic (16.94 +- 1.03 years; P = .0105) or osteomuscular features (13 +- 1.33 years; P = .0001) than patients with neurological features (19.48 +- 0.46 years). Serum levels of ceruloplasmin differed among asymptomatic patients and patients with osteomuscular or neurologic symptoms of Wilson disease. Serum levels of ceruloplasmin ranged from 18.93 mg/L to approximately 120.00 mg/L (quantiles of 0.025 to approximately 0.975). Fifty-one of 131 patients (39%) had urinary copper excretion levels below 100 mug/24 hr; there was significant variation in levels of urinary copper excretion between patients older than 14 years vs 14 years or younger. Of the 355 patients with neurologic features, 244 patients (69%) had abnormal findings from MRI and Kayser-Fleisher rings; only 1 patient with abnormal findings from brain MRI was negative for Kayser-Fleisher rings. CONCLUSIONS: Serum level of ceruloplasmin, 24-hour urinary copper excretion, and Kayser-Fleisher rings can be used to identify patients who might have Wilson disease. Patients with serum levels of ceruloplasmin below 120 mg/L and children with urinary copper excretion above 40 mug should undergo genetic testing for Wilson's disease. Patients with movement disorders and brain MRI abnormalities without Kayser-Fleisher rings are not likely to have Wilson disease.

Present remedies aim at avoiding copper toxicity by chelation, for example, by D-penicillamine (DPA) or bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate (ALXN1840), the latter with a very high copper affinity. Hence, ALXN1840 may potentially avoid neurological deterioration that frequently occurs upon DPA treatment. As the etiology of such worsening is unclear, we reasoned that copper loosely bound to albumin, that is, mimicking a potential liver copper leakage into blood, may damage cells that constitute the blood-brain barrier, which was found to be the case in an in vitro model using primary porcine brain capillary endothelial cells. Such blood-brain barrier damage was avoided by ALXN1840, plausibly due to firm protein embedding of the chelator bound copper, but not by DPA. Mitochondrial protection was observed, a prerequisite for blood-brain barrier integrity. Thus, high-affinity copper chelators may minimize such deterioration in the treatment of neurologic Wilson disease.
32493955	cause|@CHEMICAL_Copper|@DISEASE_Hepatolenticular_Degeneration ;associate|@DISEASE_Hepatolenticular_Degeneration|@GENE_ATP7B	WilsonGen a comprehensive clinically annotated genomic variant resource for Wilson's Disease.Wilson disease (WD) is one of the most prevalent genetic diseases with an estimated global carrier frequency of 1 in 90 and a prevalence of 1 in 30,000. The disease owes its genesis to Kinnier Wilson who described the disease, and is caused by accumulation of Copper (Cu) in various organs including the liver, central nervous system, cornea, kidney, joints and cardiac muscle which contribute to the characteristic clinical features of WD. A number of studies have reported genetic variants in the ATP7B gene from diverse ethnic and geographical origins. The recent advent of next-generation sequencing approaches has also enabled the discovery of a large number of novel variants in the gene associated with the disease. Previous attempts have been made to compile the knowledgebase and spectrum of genetic variants from across the multitude of publications, but have been limited by the utility due to the significant differences in approaches used to qualify pathogenicity of variants in each of the publications. The recent formulation of guidelines and algorithms for assessment of the pathogenicity of variants jointly put forward by the American College of Medical Genetics and the Association of Molecular Pathologists (ACMG &AMP) has provided a framework for evidence based and systematic assessment of pathogenicity of variants. In this paper, we describe a comprehensive resource of genetic variants in ATP7B gene manually curated from literature and data resources and systematically annotated using the ACMG & AMP guidelines for assessing pathogenicity. The resource therefore serves as a central point for clinicians and geneticists working on WD and to the best of our knowledge is the most comprehensive and only clinically annotated resource for WD. The resource is available at URL http://clingen.igib.res.in/WilsonGen/. We compiled a total of 3662 genetic variants from publications and databases associated with WD. Of these variants compiled, a total of 1458 were found to be unique entries. This is the largest WD database comprising 656 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants reported classified according to ACMG & AMP guidelines. We also mapped all the pathogenic variants corresponding to ATP7B protein from literature and other databases. In addition, geographical origin and distribution of ATP7B pathogenic variants reported are also mapped in the database.

METHODS: 40 WD patients (cerebral type 30 cases and hepatic type 10 cases) who stopped using metal chelating agent were selected, 40 WD patients with normal therapy, and 10 normal control cases were selected. All patients underwent neurological symptom evaluation using modified Young scale, Child-Pugh liver function grading, metal metabolism, and disease typing. Magnetic sensitivity imaging (SWI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging (MRS) were performed. According to the imaging results, WD patients were divided into metal deposition stage, fiber damage stage, and neuron necrosis stage. All patients were treated with metal chelating agent for 6 months. RESULTS: The score of modified Young scale in drug withdrawal group was lower than that in normal treatment group before drug withdrawal (p = .032). The score of modified Young scale was higher after drug withdrawal than before (p = .011). The number of Child-Pugh B-grade patients after drug withdrawal was more than that before drug withdrawal and in normal treatment group. The proportion of patients in the stage of neuronal necrosis after drug withdrawal (25%) was higher than that before drug withdrawal (10%) (p = .025). After drug withdrawal, urine copper was significantly higher than that before drug withdrawal and in the normal treatment group (p = .032, .039). After the withdrawal group resumed metal chelating agent treatment, 34.2% of neurological symptoms worsened. CONCLUSIONS: WD patients showed neurological symptoms aggravation and increased liver injury after metal chelating agent withdrawal. Increased metal deposition and new nerve injury occurred in the brain. After re-treatment, the aggravated neurological symptoms of WD patients are difficult to reverse.

This paper describes the new advances and author's long-term experiences in the diagnosis of WD. The characteristics in clinical and routine tests are: the age of presentation can be quite broad, the WD could not be excluded based on age only; the patients usually have mild digestive symptoms but obvious chronic liver disease signs; liver function tests may reveal normal or a mild elevation in bilirubin, ALT and AST, but quite abnormal in serum albumin and prothrombin time in most patients; Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia, normal or markedly subnormal serum alkaline phosphatase (typically < 40 IU/L) are useful for the diagnosis of fulminant WD. In china, Kayser-Fleischer rings are present in 72.2% of patients at the time of diagnosis, the positive rate is significantly higher in patients with a neurological presentation (93.4%) than patients presenting with liver disease (63.3%), however, they are usually absent in children under 6 years old, occasionly present in patients with chronic cholestatic liver disease. The mean serum ceruloplamin level in WD patients is 71.1 +- 48.7 mg/L, the level is < 200 mg/L in 98.9% of patients, < 100 mg/L in about three fourths patients, < 50 mg/L in about half patients, but it may be low in 50% of patients with severe end-stage liver disease of any etiology too, and even lower than 50 mg/L in patients with nephritic syndrome. Basal 24-hour urinary copper excretion may be>=100 g at presentation in 86.7% of patients with WD, but also in 22% of Patients with certain chronic liver diseases, the sensitivity of penicillamine challenge test is lower than basal urinary copper excretion, however, the specificity is significantly higher than former (97% versus 78%). Hepatic copper determination remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of WD. We have designed a standard method for hepatic copper determination. The most useful cut-off value is 209 g/g dry wt using our method, with the sensitivity of 99.4%, and specificity of 96.1%. However, long-standing hepatic failure and or obstruction can cause heptic copper elevations into the WD area. In recent years, direct complete DNA sequencing has become easy, rapid, less expensive and commercially available. Currently reported mutation detection rate is 90%, the specificity is almost 100%. The limitation to the method has been the ability to identify all the affected alleles in suspected individuals. If no mutation is identified, the diagnosis of WD could not be excluded. None of the laboratory parameters alone allows a definite diagnosis of WD. The WD diagnostic scoring system based on a composite of key parameters helps clinicians to gauge the degree of certainty of the diagnosis: WD scores greater than 4, the diagnosis of WD is highly likely; score 0 or 1, the diagnosis is unlikely. However, the WD diagnosis could not be excluded in suspected patients who do not perform genetic test and hepatic copper determination. Patients with chronic cholestatic liver disease may have scores more than 4.
37226184		Medical care of patients with Wilson disease in Germany: a multidisciplinary survey among university centers.BACKGROUND: Wilson disease (WD) is a rare, hereditary disorder of copper metabolism. Due to its variable symptoms and manifestations, diagnosis remains challenging. Affected patients must obtain lifelong medical treatment, as the disease is fatal if untreated. Patients require continuous monitoring, but little is known about the care of these patients in Germany. Therefore, we analyzed the medical care of WD patients at German university centers. We sent a questionnaire containing 20 questions to a total of 108 departments of pediatrics, neurology and gastroenterology in 36 university hospitals. Our questions referred to the characteristics of WD patients at the different sites and internal procedures regarding diagnosis, therapy and follow-up. A descriptive statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: Sixty-three departments (58%) returned our questionnaire. In total, approximately one-third of the estimated WD patients in Germany are seen annually in the outpatient clinics of these departments (approx. 950 patients). There are only a few departments which treat patients in a multidisciplinary setting (12%). Our survey revealed that for diagnosis, 51% of all departments used an algorithm based on the Leipzig score as recommended by international guidelines. Most departments apply essential parameters recommended by WD guidelines. Routine monitoring is performed at least biannually by 84% of the departments, and standard investigations for monitoring are regularly applied. A routine family screening is performed by 84% of all departments. A reduction in medical therapy during pregnancy is recommended by 46% of the departments. Only 14% suggested that WD patients should not breastfeed. Liver transplantation (LT) due to WD is a rare but repeatedly occurring event. Most departments of gastroenterology (72%) reported at least one patient with LT within the last decade. CONCLUSIONS: Medical care of WD patients at German university centers follows the recommendations set forth by international guidelines, but only a few centers treat significant numbers of patients. The surveillance of patients does not follow specified standards, but most departments adhere to the accepted guidelines. The formation of central units and networks in a multidisciplinary setting should be evaluated to improve the care of WD patients.

Differences in copper tissue accumulation lead to various clinical manifestations, including some atypical presentations. The complex clinical features of WD make diagnosis challenging, delaying the best chance for treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 26-year-old man with nephritis-range proteinuria and elevated serum creatinine. The renal pathology indicated immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy and tubular injury, which was inconsistent with glomerular lesions. Cirrhosis was also detected by imaging examination. Considering both kidney injury and liver damage, WD was suspected. Based on results showing abnormal copper metabolism, corneal Kayser-Fleischer rings, and genetic disorders in the ATP7B gene, the patient was finally diagnosed with WD. After treatment with oral penicillamine, zinc sulfate and losartan, the patient showed alleviation of both WD and nephropathy after 3 years of follow-up. He maintained a good quality of daily life. CONCLUSION: This case highlights that unexplained neurological and liver symptoms in patients with IgA nephropathy can be clues for WD.
36872503		Motor Evoked Potentials in Newly Diagnosed and Treated Patients With Wilson Disease.PURPOSE: To investigate whether patients with Wilson disease have abnormal motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation. METHODS: In a prospective, observational, single-center study, transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to examine MEPs recorded from the abductor digiti minimi in 24 newly diagnosed treatment-naive patients and 21 treated patients with Wilson disease. RESULTS: Motor evoked potentials were recorded in 22 (91.7%) newly diagnosed treatment-naive patients and in 20 (95.2%) treated patients. Abnormal MEP parameters were found in a similar proportion of newly diagnosed and treated patients: MEP latency (38% vs. 29%), MEP amplitude (21% vs. 24%), central motor conduction time (29% vs. 29%), and resting motor threshold (68% vs. 52%). Abnormal MEP amplitude (P = 0.044) and resting motor threshold (P = 0.011) were more frequent in treated patients with brain MRI abnormalities but not in newly diagnosed patients. We did not observe significant improvement in MEPs parameters after 1 year of treatment introduction in eight examined patients. However, in one patient where MEPs were initially nondetectable, they were present 1 year after treatment introduction with zinc sulfate, although MEPs were not in the normal range. CONCLUSIONS: Motor evoked potential parameters did not differ between newly diagnosed and treated patients. There was no significant improvement in MEP parameters one year after treatment introduction. Further studies conducted on large cohorts are necessary to determine the usefulness of MEPs in detecting pyramidal tract damage and improvement after anticopper treatment introduction in Wilson disease.
37121747		Late-onset Wilson Disease in a Patient Followed-up for Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.A 73-year-old woman was referred to our hospital for persistent liver dysfunction. When the patient was 45 years old, her youngest sister had been diagnosed with Wilson disease (WD). The patient therefore underwent several family screening tests, all of which were unremarkable. She had an annual medical checkup and was diagnosed with liver dysfunction and fatty liver at 68 years old. A liver biopsy and genetic testing were performed, and she was diagnosed with WD; chelation therapy was then initiated. In patients with hepatic disorders and a family history of WD, multiple medical examinations should be conducted, as the development of WD is possible regardless of age.
29504323	cause|@CHEMICAL_Copper|@DISEASE_Cardiomyopathies	Electrocardiographic Manifestations In Paediatric Wilson Disease.BACKGROUND: Wilson disease (WD) is one of the most common metabolic liver diseases in older children. It has a strong genetic background with autosomal recessive inheritance. WD is a multisystem disorder with predominant hepatic and neurological manifestations and variable age of presentation. The data on cardiac manifestations in children is very limited and only few adult studies are available in the literature. This study was planned to determine the frequency and spectrum of Electrocardiographic (ECG) changes in pediatric WD. METHODS: This was an observational cross-sectional study conducted at The Children Hospital & the Institute of Child Health, Lahore, from January 2015 to January 2017. The children diagnosed as Wilson disease were enrolled for the recording of resting ECG. The ECG changes were seen and discussed with an experienced pediatric cardiologist who was involved and explained about the objectives of study. RESULTS: Total 55 patients were enrolled but record of ECG was missing for 4 patients and excluded from the study. Out of 51 patients 22 had at least one ECG abnormality. Most frequent findings seen were T wave abnormality in 18 patients (35.2%) followed by sinus tachycardia and sinus bradycardia in 12 and 8 patients respectively. Other abnormalities included bifid P waves, ST segment changes each of 2 patients, and one premature ventricular contraction. QRS details including axis, complex, amplitude ratio and QT interval was normal in all the patients. There was no mortality during the study period due to cardiac cause. CONCLUSIONS: ECG abnormalities are not uncommon in pediatric WD but of mild nature. These are presumably related to underlying cardiomyopathy due to deposition of copper in heart which can be quantified by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and echocardiography is required to confirm ECG abnormalities detected.
28619500		Was Cavum Septum Pellucidum the Cause of Intractable Seizure in a 17-Year-Old Boy with Wilson Disease?BACKGROUND: Cavum septum pellucidum (CSP), which is often found incidentally in a few populations, occasionally becomes symptomatic if enlarged significantly. Wilson disease (WD) is an uncommon autosomal recessive inborn defect in copper metabolism characterized by abnormal accumulation of copper in various tissues, particularly in the liver and the brain. Seizure disorder, although rare both in CSP and WD, may happen in a few patients with either of the conditions. CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case of 17-year-old boy, a patient with known WD, who developed intractable seizure for a year, which was not controlled with a large amount of antiepileptics. Magnetic resonance imaging showed enlargement of his preexisting CSP, which was small and asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis of WD. His WD was in a state of remission when he developed the seizure disorder. On endoscopic cyst fenestration, he was relieved of the seizure. CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic CSP is a rare disorder, but the coexistence of WD is even rarer. Endoscopic cyst fenestration is a novel procedure that can be successful in properly selected cases. To the best of our knowledge, CSP associated with WD has not been reported in any English literature. We present this case for its rarity along with a relevant literature review.
34608110	treat|@CHEMICAL_Penicillamine|@DISEASE_Death	Wilson Disease in Children; Chelation Therapy or Liver Transplantation? A 10-Year Experience from Pakistan.BACKGROUND Wilson disease (WD) is a rare genetic disorder with vast clinical presentations and a higher incidence in areas where consanguinity is common. Most patients can be treated with oral chelation, but some require advanced surgical intervention, like liver transplantation (LT). This study aims to review outcomes of WD patients presenting to a tertiary care center over a period of 10 years. MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective analysis was conducted at Shifa International Hospital, Islamabad, Pakistan. Patients <18 years who were diagnosed with WD per ESPAGHAN guidelines from 2010 to 2020 were included. Presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and LT and its complications were recorded. Follow-ups were recorded, and patients were contacted by phone in cases of interrupted follow-up. Frequencies and percentages of variables were calculated. RESULTS A total of 48 patients with WD were identified. Symptomatic disease was seen in 45 patients, with 3 diagnosed on screening. The hepatic form was common (62.2%). Mean age at diagnosis was 9.74 (range 5-17) years, 28 (58.3%) were male, while 17 (35.4%) were female. Urinary copper was increased in all patients (645.82+-528.40). Oral treatment with penicillamine was given to 34 (75.5%) patients; 4 (8.9%) died while on oral treatment. Living donor LT was performed in 11 (22.9%) patients, who had a mean King's Wilson index of 11 (range, 6-14). Currently, all LT patients are alive, with maximum graft survival of 7 years. CONCLUSIONS LT offers a promising treatment with good outcomes in pediatric WD. However, timely diagnosis and management with oral chelation therapy can prolong survival without LT.
34627038	associate|@DISEASE_Inflammation|@GENE_F2RL1 ;associate|@CHEMICAL_Formaldehyde|@CHEMICAL_Paraffin	Delineation of the healthy rabbit liver by immunohistochemistry - A technical note.Liver diseases pose a big global health problem and liver failure may result from viral infection, overnutrition or tumors. Studying pathologic liver tissue demands for accurate and specific histological stainings and immunohistochemical labellings, including chromogenic and fluorescent approaches. Moreover, a reliable set of healthy liver stainings and labellings are required, to provide a baseline or reference for the pathological situation. Here, we used the liver tissue of a healthy rabbit and compared different histological key steps, such as paraffin embedding after formalin fixation versus cryopreservation; or an antigen retrieval (AR) step in processing paraffin sections versus the same procedure without AR; or chromogenic with fluorescent detection system, respectively. Moreover, we provide images of serial sections, where we stained the same morphological structure with different markers, including collagen I, collagen III, fibronectin, alpha-SMA, elastin, protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) which is an inflammation-related marker, ki67 for proliferating cells, and orcein (as negative control for pathological aberrations like Wilson disease). Differences between conditions were quantitatively assessed by measuring the colour intensity. Generally, we observed that cryosections exhibited a stronger signal intensity in immunohistochemically labelled sections than in paraffin sections; however, the strong staining got slurred, which sometimes hampered proper identification of morphological structures at higher magnifications. Moreover, there was a clear increase in signal intensity for paraffin sections when an AR step was performed compared to condition without AR. Results for mouse isotype staining as a negative control clearly supported those findings. Different stainings of the portal triad, the central vein and the bile ducts revealed a clear-cut distribution of extracellular matrix components, with prominent fibronectin and elastin around the lumen of the central vein as well as a patchy PAR-2 expression. As for the bile ducts, complete absence of alpha-SMA and PAR-2 was found at the margins, however, collagen I expression and elastin were positive and showed a strong signal. Like this, we provide useful and valuable reference images for researchers using the rabbit liver model. It may help to decide which of the immunohistochemical protocols are valuable to reach a certain aim and which protocols lead to the best visualization of the target structure.

METHODS: The clinical profile of 36 patients diagnosed in Lebanon was studied and their mutations were determined by molecular testing. All patients underwent full physical exam, including ophthalmologic slit-lamp examination ultrasound imaging of the liver, as well as measurement of serum ceruloplasmin and 24-h urinary-Cu levels. In addition, genetic screening using PCR followed by sequencing to determine disease-causing mutations and polymorphisms in the ATP7B gene was carried on extracted DNA from patients and immediate family members. Our phenotypic-genotypic findings were then compared to reported mutations in Wilson's disease patients from regional Arab and non-European countries. RESULTS: Patients belonged to extended consanguineous families. The majority were homozygous for the disease-causing mutation, with no predominant mutation identified. The most common mutation, detected in 4 out of 13 families, involved the ATP hinge region and was present in patients from Lebanon, Egypt, Iran and Turkey. Otherwise, mutations in Lebanese patients and those of the region were scattered over 17 exons of ATP7B. While the homozygous exon 12 mutation Trp939Cys was only detected in patients from Lebanon but none from the regional countries, the worldwide common mutation H1069Q was not present in the Lebanese and was rare in the region. Pure hepatic phenotype was predominant in patients from both Lebanon and the region (25%-65%). Furthermore, the majority of patients, including those who were asymptomatic, had evidence of some hepatic dysfunction. Pure neurologic phenotype was rare. CONCLUSION: Findings do not support presence of a founder effect. Clinical and genetic screening is recommended for family members with index patients and unexplained hepatic dysfunction.

About sixty per cent of patients present with liver disease. WD is considered a fatal disease if undiagnosed and/or untreated but recent data indicate that disease penetrance may not be 100%. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients underwent liver biopsy as part of the diagnostic workup. Genetic testing for ATP7B was performed by Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: We report on a large family with multiple affected siblings. The first patient (male, 31 years) underwent orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) because of fulminant WD. He was homozygous for p.G710A. One asymptomatic brother (37 years) had the same mutation. He is doing well on chelation therapy. Fifteen years later, a second-degree sibling (female, 16 years) presented with fulminant WD and underwent OLT. She was compound heterozygote (p.G710A/p.G710S). Further family screening revealed a third mutation (p.V536A) in a female (21 years) and male (16 years) compound-heterozygote sibling (p.G710A/p.V536A). In both, serum ceruloplasmin and 24-hour urinary copper excretion were normal. Liver biopsy showed normal histology and a quantitative hepatic copper content within the normal range or only slightly elevated (19 and 75 mug/g dry weight, respectively). No decoppering treatment was initiated so far. CONCLUSION: Genetic testing alone is not always sufficient to diagnose WD in asymptomatic patients, and human mutation databases should be used with caution. Even patients carrying two disease-causing mutations do not necessarily have demonstrable alteration of copper metabolism. Asymptomatic siblings diagnosed by genetic screening require further testing before initiating treatment.
33244627		Structural and functional brain changes in hepatic and neurological Wilson disease.Wilson disease (WD) can manifest with hepatic or neuropsychiatric symptoms. Our understanding of the in vivo brain changes in WD, particularly in the hepatic phenotype, is limited. Thirty subjects with WD and 30 age- and gender-matched controls participated. WD group underwent neuropsychiatric assessment. Unified WD Rating Scale neurological exam scores were used to determine neurological (WDN, score > 0) and hepatic-only (WDH, score 0) subgroups. All subjects underwent 3 Tesla anatomical and resting-state functional MRI. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) were performed only in the WD group. Volumetric, DTI, and functional connectivity analyses were performed to determine between-group differences. WDN and WDH groups were matched in demographic and psychiatric profiles. The entire WD group compared to controls showed significant thinning in the bilateral superior frontal cortex. The WDN group compared to control and WDH groups showed prominent structural brain changes including significant striatal and thalamic atrophy, more subcortical hypointense lesions on SWI, and diminished white matter integrity in the bilateral anterior corona radiata and corpus callosum. However, the WDH group also showed significant white matter volume loss compared to controls. The functional connectivity between the frontostriatal nodes was significantly reduced in the WDN group, whereas that of the hippocampus was significantly increased in the WDH group compared to controls. In summary, structural and functional brain changes were present even in neurologically non-manifesting WD patients in this cross-sectional study. Longitudinal brain MRI scans may be useful as biomarkers for prognostication and optimization of treatment strategies in WD.

Laboratory data showed a low serum copper level and ceruloplasmin. The ratio of urinary copper to urinary creatinine in a spot urinary analysis after 4 days' cessation of D-penicillamine was under 0.1. We concluded that the copper chelation was excessive and changed D-penicillamine to zinc acetate. However, his liver function test results did not normalize. We performed a liver biopsy and discovered a high copper content. The liver dysfunction was improved after resuming chelating therapy. Accurate measurement of the hepatic copper content via a biopsy is important for the adequate management of this disease.

33881171	associate|@CHEMICAL_Copper|@DISEASE_Hepatolenticular_Degeneration	Optical coherence tomography in patients with Wilson's disease.OBJECTIVES: Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder that leads to copper accumulation and deposition in different organs, frequently affecting visual pathways. Recent studies have detected morphological changes of the retina in patients with WD using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Measuring the thickness of the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) with OCT provides an objective assessment of integrity and morphological abnormalities of the retina. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between OCT parameters and form of the disease, therapy and symptoms duration, as well as severity of neurological impairment. METHODS: The study comprised of 52 patients with WD and 52 healthy controls (HC). All the patients were on a regular and stable chelation therapy and/or zinc salts. Patients were divided into two groups, with neurological (NWD) or hepatic form of the disease (HWD). OCT was performed to assess the RNFL thickness. RESULTS: The WD patients had significantly lower intraocular pressure in both eyes and lower RNFL thickness than the HC. There were no differences between NWD and HWD in any of the ophthalmologically tested parameters. No significant correlations were found between clinical features and retinal thickness parameters. Stratification of the cohort according to the disease duration showed that disease duration did not influence the RNFL thickness. CONCLUSION: We found that involvement of the retina represented a subclinical finding in neurologically intact patients in the HWD group. Nevertheless, the value of OCT as a biomarker for the assessment of the clinical course and progression of WD still remains uncertain.
34999690	associate|@CHEMICAL_Copper|@DISEASE_Hepatolenticular_Degeneration ;inhibit|@DISEASE_Hepatolenticular_Degeneration|@GENE_CP	Efficacy of Different Diagnostic Test for Identifying Wilson's Disease.Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder in which copper pathologically accumulates primarily within the liver, brain and other tissues. It can presents clinically as liver disease, as a progressive neurological disorder or as psychiatric illness. The wide array of clinical manifestations of WD can lead to misdiagnosis with subsequent greater risk of irreversible damage to liver and brain. Many tests can be used to investigate patients of Wilson disease, including serum free copper, 24 hours urine copper estimation, hepatic copper estimation and genetic mutation testing. But there is no single ideal diagnostic test that can exclude or confirm the disease with certainty. The aim of the study was to find out the efficacy of different diagnostic test for the diagnosis of Wilson disease. This cross-sectional analytical study was conducted at department of Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Dhaka, Bangladesh from January 2016 through January 2018. A total of 56 cases of Wilson disease and 39 patients with a liver disease other than WD were studied. Wilson disease was diagnosed by Leipzig score. Along with other physical findings and laboratory investigations slit lamp eye examination for KF ring, serum ceruloplasmin and 24 hour urinary copper excretion were done. The mean age of WD patients was 9.69+-2.37 years, male female ratio was 1:1. Serum ceruloplasmin level was significantly lower in WD patient (p<0.001). Median of 24 hour urinary copper in WD was 702.75mug/ 24 hr (range119-11210mug/24 hour) and in non WD group it was 77.41mug/24 hour (range 20.0-478mug/24 hour) and the difference between them is statistically significant (p=0.001). The sensitivity of KF ring was 82.1% and specificity was 100%. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of serum ceruloplasmin were 98.2%, 92.3%, 94.8%, 97.2% and 95.7% respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of 24 hour urinary copper were 100%, 63%, 80% and 85.1% respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of KF ring, serum ceruloplasmin and basal 24 hour urinary copper excretion when combined together came out to be 70.4%, 100%, 100%, 59.3% and 79.3% respectively. This study result showed that serum ceruloplasmin and 24 hour urinary copper can be used as a screening test for the diagnosis of Wilson disease.

ATP7B protein concentration, indicated by direct measurement of surrogate peptides from patient dried blood spot samples, could provide primary evidence of WD. ATP7B concentrations were measured in patient samples from diverse backgrounds, diagnostic potential is determined, and results are compared with biochemical and genetic results from individual patients. METHODS: Two hundred and sixty-four samples from biorepositories at 3 international and 2 domestic academic centers and 150 normal controls were obtained after Institutional Review Board approval. Genetically or clinically confirmed WD patients with a Leipzig score >3 and obligate heterozygote (carriers) from affected family members were included. ATP7B peptide measurements were made by immunoaffinity enrichment mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Two ATP7B peptides were used to measure ATP7B protein concentration. Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis generates an area under the curve of 0.98. ATP7B peptide analysis of the sequence ATP7B 887 was found to have a sensitivity of 91.2%, specificity of 98.1%, positive predictive value of 98.0%, and a negative predictive value of 91.5%. In patients with normal ceruloplasmin concentrations (>20 mg/dL), 14 of 16 (87.5%) were ATP7B-deficient. In patients without clear genetic results, 94% were ATP7B-deficient. CONCLUSIONS: Quantification of ATP7B peptide effectively identified WD patients in 92.1% of presented cases and reduced ambiguities resulting from ceruloplasmin and genetic analysis. Clarity is brought to patients with ambiguous genetic results, significantly aiding in noninvasive diagnosis. A proposed diagnostic score and algorithm incorporating ATP7B peptide concentrations can be rapidly diagnostic and supplemental to current Leipzig scoring systems.

Approval was based on data from Study CLTR0310-301, a randomized, multicenter, open-label, active-controlled trial comparing Vyxeos with a standard combination of daunorubicin and cytarabine ("7+3") in 309 patients 60-75 years of age with newly diagnosed t-AML or AML-MRC. Because of elemental copper concerns with the Vyxeos formulation, patients with Wilson disease were excluded from the study. Vyxeos demonstrated an improvement in overall survival (HR 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.52-0.90; P = 0.005) with an estimated median overall survival of 9.6 months compared with 5.9 months for the "7+3" control arm. The toxicity profile of Vyxeos was similar to that seen with standard "7+3" with the exception of more prolonged neutropenia and thrombocytopenia on the Vyxeos arm. Because the pharmacology of Vyxeos differs from that of other formulations of daunorubicin and cytarabine, labeling includes a warning against interchanging formulations during treatment. This is the first FDA-approved treatment specifically for patients with t-AML or AML-MRC.
36571168		Nomogram for prediction of portal vein system thrombosis after splenectomy for hypersplenism in patients with Wilson disease.BACKGROUND: The occurrence of portal vein system thrombosis (PVST) after splenectomy in patients with Wilson disease (WD) can lead to serious complications. The early identification of high-risk patients can help improve patient prognosis. This study aimed to establish and validate a personalized nomogram for assessing the risk of PVST after splenectomy in patients with WD and hypersplenism. METHODS: We retrospectively collected the data from 81 patients with WD and hypersplenism who underwent splenectomy. Based on whether PVST occurred within a month after the operation, they were divided into the PVST group and the non-PVST group. The clinical data of the 2 groups were compared, and univariate analysis was used to select the statistically significant features and incorporated into the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model for optimization. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the independent risk factors for PVST after splenectomy, which were then applied to establish a personalized nomogram. We calculated the concordance (C)-index and drew the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the model calibration curve, and the clinical decision analysis (DCA) curve to evaluate the accuracy, calibration, and clinical applicability of the model, respectively. We used bootstrapping for internal validation of the model. RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed that the differences in preoperative portal vein diameter and velocity of portal blood flow, postoperative mean platelet volume (MPV), mean platelet distribution width (PDW), D-dimer, prothrombin time (PT), and the increase of platelet count (PLT) were of statistical significance (P<0.05). According to the results of the LASSO and multivariate logistic regression analyses, a model including preoperative portal vein diameter, preoperative portal blood flow velocity, postoperative D-dimer, and the increase of PLT was established to predict the risk of PVST after splenectomy. The model showed good accuracy with a C-index of 0.838 (95% CI: 0.750-0.926) and had a well-fitted calibration curve. Furthermore, internal validation showed it achieved a moderate C-index of 0.805. The DCA curve indicated that the model has clinical applicability when patients are treated at thresholds of 2-100%. CONCLUSIONS: Establishing a predictive model for the risk of PVST in patients with WD and hypersplenism after splenectomy can help clinicians identify patients at high risk of PVST who require intervention measures.

Early diagnosis and proper therapy usually predict a good prognosis, especially in pre-symptomatic WD. Genetic testing provides an accurate and effective diagnostic method for the early diagnosis of WD. METHODS: We recruited 18 clinically diagnosed WD patients from 16 unrelated families and two independent individuals. The next-generation sequencing of the ATP7B gene was performed. The 293T cell lines were divided into wild-type (WT) ATP7B and mutated ATP7B groups. Cell proliferation was determined by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and apoptosis was detected by Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) assays. RESULTS: Pedigree analysis showed that compound heterozygous variants (17/18, 94.44%) were present in the majority of WD patients. A total of 33 ATP7B gene variants were identified, including three variants with uncertain significance (VUS) [two splice mutations (c.51+2T>G, c.1543+40G>A) and one frameshift mutation (c.3532_3535del)]. The CCK-8 and apoptosis assays demonstrated that the VUS of ATP7B could significantly affect the transportation of copper. CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed genetic defects of 16 Chinese families and two independent individuals with WD, which enriched the mutation spectrum of the ATP7B gene worldwide and provided valuable information for studying the mutation types of ATP7B in the Chinese populations. Genetic testing in WD patients is necessary to shorten the time to initiate therapy, reduce damage to the liver and improve the prognosis.

Adoption of initial treatments for WD was based on empirical observations. These therapies are effective, but there are still unmet needs for which treatment modalities are being developed. An increase of therapeutical trials is anticipated. APPROACH AND RESULTS: The first Wilson Disease Aarhus Symposium (May 2019) included a workshop on randomized clinical trial design. The authors of the article were organizers or presented during this workshop, and this article presents their consensus on the design of clinical trials for WD, addressing trial population, treatment comparators, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and treatment endpoints. To achieve adequate recruitment of patients with this rare disorder, the study groups should include all clinical phenotypes and treatment-experienced as well as treatment-naive patients. CONCLUSIONS: The primary study endpoint should be clinical or a composite endpoint until appropriate surrogate endpoints are validated. Standardization of clinical trials will permit pooling of data and allow for better treatment comparisons, as well as reduce the future numbers of patients needed per trial.

The rabbit is a suitable animal model for studies of metabolic diseases. In this study, we generated ATP7B site-directed point mutation rabbits to simulate a major mutation type in Asians (p. Arg778Leu) with Wilson disease (WD) by using the CRISPR/Cas9 system combined with single-strand DNA oligonucleotides (ssODNs). The efficiency of the precision point mutation was 52.94% when zygotes were injected 14 hours after HCG treatment and was significantly higher than that of zygotes injected 19 hours after HCG treatment (14.29%). The rabbits carrying the allele with mutant ATP7B died at approximately three months of age. Additionally, the copper content in the livers of rabbits at the onset of WD increased nine-fold, a level similar to the five-fold increase observed in humans with WD. Thus, the efficiency of precision point mutations increases when RNAs are injected into zygotes at earlier stages, and the ATP7B mutant rabbits are a potential model for human WD disease with applications in pathological analysis, clinical treatment and gene therapy research.

RESULTS: Two novel compound heterozygous mutations (c.525 dupA/ Val176Serfs*28 and c.2930 C>T/ p.Thr977Met) were detected in ATP7B. After d-penicillamine (D-PCA) therapy, serum aminotransferase and ceruloplasmin levels in this patient were normalized and levels of HbA1c decreased. However, when the patient ceased to use D-PCA due to an itchy skin, serum levels of fasting blood glucose increased.

Calf muscle pain might be attributed as growing pain in children. We report calf muscle involvement in Wilson disease and describe the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of leg, differential diagnosis with literature review. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our observations describe calf muscle MRI abnormality in 5 cases of Wilson disease from 2 families. The clinical presentations were neurologic in 3, hepatic in 1, and asymptomatic in 1 patient. We systematically describe the clinical characteristics and their calf muscle MRI findings. RESULTS: Three patients had bilateral calf pain and intermittent cramps. The pain was of mild to moderate intensity and managed symptomatically. Serum alkaline phosphatase, creatinine phosphokinase, and needle electromyography were normal. Turbo inversion recovery magnitude sequence MRI of calf muscle revealed hyperintensity in bilateral gastrocnemii muscles. These muscles appear hyperintense in diffusion-weighted imaging. CONCLUSION: The calf muscle involvement could be attributed to muscle edema due to copper-induced muscle toxicity mediated by inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase on cellular membranes of fast-twitch gastrocnemii muscles which contain predominant type II myofiber. In Wilson disease patients with calf pain or cramps, muscle MRI may show nonspecific gastrocnemius hyperintensity. Further evaluation may give insight into its pathophysiology.
31878905	treat|@CHEMICAL_Copper|@DISEASE_Hepatolenticular_Degeneration	The study of Wilson disease in pregnancy management.INTRODUCTION: Pregnancy management in women with Wilson disease (WD) remains an important clinical problem. This research was conducted to investigate how to avoid worsening of WD symptoms during pregnancy and increase pregnancy success in women with WD by identifying the best pregnancy management approaches in these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical data of 117 pregnancies among 75 women with WD were retrospectively analyzed. Related information of the fetus was also recorded and analyzed. At the same time, regression analysis was performed for data of 22 pregnant women without WD, as normal controls. RESULTS: Of a total of 117 pregnancies among the 75 women with WD and 31 pregnancies among the 22 control womenincluded in this study, there were 108 successful pregnancies and 9 spontaneous abortions. Among the 108 successful pregnancies, 97 women a history of copper chelation therapy before pregnancy; all 97 women stopped anti-copper therapy during pregnancy. The nine women with spontaneous abortion had no pre-pregnancy history of copper displacement therapy. The incidence of lower limb edema was higher in the WD group than in normal controls (P = 0.036). Compared with the control group, there was a higher proportion in the WD group of male infants (P = 0.022) and lower average infant birth weight (t = 3.514, P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: It is relatively safe for women with WD patients to become pregnant. The best management method for pregnancy in women with WD may be intensive pre-pregnancy copper chelation therapy and no anti-copper treatment during pregnancy.
28433100		Diagnosis of Wilson disease.Clinical presentation of Wilson disease can vary widely; therefore diagnosis is not always straightforward. Wilson disease is not just a disease of children and young adults, but may present at any age. The key features of Wilson disease are liver disease and cirrhosis, neuropsychiatric disturbances, Kayser-Fleischer rings, and acute episodes of hemolysis, often in association with acute liver failure. Diagnosis is particularly difficult in children and in adults presenting with active liver disease. None of the available laboratory tests is perfect and may not be specific for Wilson disease. A detailed neurologic examination is required for all cases. Neuroimaging and electrophysiologic methods are helpful. To overcome the diagnostic challenge, several clinical signs (Kayser-Fleischer rings, neurologic symptoms) and laboratory features (copper in serum, urine, liver; serum ceruloplasmin; genetic testing) are scored 0 (absent) to 2 (present) and the Leipzig score is calculated. If the score is >=4, the diagnosis of Wilson disease is very likely. For asymptomatic siblings of index patients, mutation analysis is the most reliable approach.
34405819		Evaluation of Validity and Efficiency of Diagnostic Criteria in Autoimmune Hepatitis in Children.BACKGROUND: Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a progressive inflammatory liver disease with various clinical symptoms, but treatment and prevention of hepatic failure and cirrhosis is possible with early diagnosis. However, no specific test has been approved for the diagnosis of AIH. In 2008, the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group (IAIHG) developed a simplified diagnostic scoring system that has been widely used in practice. Nevertheless, it cannot distinguish AIH from Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) and consensus is lacking with respect to its validity, sensitivity, and applicability for children patients. The newer 2018 version also requires validation. The present study intends to evaluate the validity and efficiency of the IAIHG simplified scoring system and new scoring system in children with AIH. METHODS: The present study is a non-interventional case-control study covering 152 patients with hepatic diseases (83 patients with AIH and 69 patients with Wilson disease (WD)). Titers of autoantibodies, IgG levels, hepatic histology, and absence of viral hepatitis were scored and calculated according to IAIHG diagnostic criteria. Statistics software package (SPSS) and draft receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves was used to analyze data and determine value of diagnostic criteria. RESULT: In our study, both scoring systems' accuracy was good in AIH diagnosis, although new score displays higher sensitivity and specificity, suggestive of greater accuracy and predictive strength. CONCLUSION: Our study is the first validation study of the new scoring system in diagnosing AIH, and further studies require verifying this scoring system.
33368534		Ninety days transplant free survival with high volume plasma exchange in Wilson disease presenting as acute liver failure.OBJECTIVE: To study the efficacy and safety of high volume plasma exchange (HVPE) in Wilson disease presenting as acute liver failure (WD-ALF). METHODS: An analysis of prospectively collected data of consecutively admitted WD-ALF cases was done and patients were divided into two groups: (i) high volume plasma exchange (HVPE) group- who received HVPE + standard medical therapy (SMT), and (ii) SMT group- received only SMT. Outcome measure was transplant free survival (TFS) at 90 days post enrollment, change in biochemical, hemodynamic parameters & incidence of organ dysfunction in HVPE as compared to SMT group, and HVPE related complications. RESULTS: Out of the total 43 cases of WD-ALF reported in the study period, 37 were enrolled (median age 9 years, 62.2% males). All biochemical parameters and prognostic indices except blood ammonia and serum creatinine improved significantly at 72 to 96 hours after enrollment in the HVPE group. Overall, TFS at 90 days was present in 9/19 (47.3%) in HVPE group vs 3/18 (16.6%) in the SMT group (OR 2.84, 95% CI 0.91-8.8, P = .049). Kaplan Meier survival analysis revealed that HVPE group had significantly higher cumulative survival as per the Log Rank test (P = .027); median days of survival was 38 days (IQR 12-63) in HVPE group vs 14 (IQR 5-22) days in SMT group. CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicates that in children with WD-ALF, HVPE not only acts as a bridging therapy to LT but may also improve proportion of the cases with TFS.
29417175	treat|@CHEMICAL_Trientine|@DISEASE_Hepatolenticular_Degeneration	The steady state pharmacokinetics of trientine in Wilson disease patients.PURPOSE: To determine the steady state pharmacokinetics of trientine in children (>= 12 years of age) and adult patients who had been receiving trientine dihydrochloride therapy prior to the study. METHODS: Twenty patients were exposed to trientine (trientine dihydrochloride capsules supplied by Univar) after standard oral dosing as part of ongoing therapy. Plasma trientine concentration was determined pre-dose and at 30 min, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 12 h post-dose. Concentrations of trientine in plasma were determined by LC-MS/MS using a validated bioanalytical method with stable labelled trientine as the internal standard. RESULTS: Trientine was generally absorbed fairly rapidly with a median Tmax of 1.49 h (range, 0.48-4.08 h). There was some variability in exposure, with a 10-fold range in Cmax, and a 13.8-fold range in AUC0-t. This variability was slightly lower when PK parameters were dose-normalised (6.7-fold range in Cmax/D and an 11.6-fold range in AUC0-t/D). The terminal half-life, which could be defined in 14 of the 20 patients, was broadly consistent between patients (range of 2.33 to 6.99 h). There was no marked difference in pharmacokinetics between adult patients (n = 16) and children (n = 4). The Cmax range was 506 to 3100 ng/mL in adults and 309 to 1940 ng/mL in children-the equivalent ranges for AUC0-t were 1240 to 17,100 ng/mL h and 1500 to 8060 ng/mL h. When PK parameters were normalised for administered dose, the Cmax/D and AUC0-t/D for children were contained within the ranges for the adult patients. CONCLUSIONS: The steady state pharmacokinetics of trientine in Wilson disease patients were broadly similar to that reported in healthy subjects.
30601285		Imaging Kayser-Fleischer Ring in Wilson Disease Using In Vivo Confocal Microscopy.PURPOSE: This study analyzes images of Kayser-Fleischer (K-F) rings in patients with Wilson disease (WD) using in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) and explores whether IVCM can be a useful clinical tool in facilitating the diagnosis and characterization of K-F rings. METHODS: One hundred four eyes of 52 patients with WD and K-F rings (K-F group) and 52 normal eyes of 52 age- and gender-matched control subjects (control group) were enrolled in the study. Both K-F and control groups consisted of 29 male patients and 23 female patients. IVCM imaging was performed, and images of the peripheral Descemet membrane were analyzed. RESULTS: All patients in K-F group showed abnormal patterns in the peripheral Descemet membrane from IVCM images. These abnormalities can be generally divided into 3 types: patchy, stripy, and spotty patterns. Each patient may have a combination of these patterns, with patchy pattern being most prevalent (100%), whereas stripy and spotty patterns are present in 30% to 40% of the K-F rings. Notably, these patterns are not correlated with other systematic symptoms of WD. CONCLUSIONS: IVCM images can be used as an objective clinical diagnostic tool to facilitate the identification of K-F rings and the diagnosis of WD.

Different tools were developed to aid diagnosis of NPC, but to date, no study has compared their performance. We aimed to compare the RADIAL algorithm, intended for the differential diagnosis of autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias (ARCAs) and NPC-specific suspicion indices (SIs). This study was a retrospective analysis of data from 834 patients with molecularly confirmed ARCAs, including 57 NPC cases (RADIAL cohort). We aimed to compare the algorithm performance of RADIAL (Top 1 and Top 3) with that of four SIs (Original, Refined, 2/3 and 2/7) in discriminating NPC cases and non-NPC cases. We also identified ARCAs closely related to NPC as those with low specificity to detect non-NPC cases and described differential and overlapping features with NPC. Overall, excellent sensitivity and specificity (> 0.90) were achieved with both RADIAL and SI tools for NPC cases. The highest sensitivity was attained with the 2/7 SI, Refined SI and Top 3 RADIAL algorithms. Top 1 and Top 3 RADIAL were the most specific tools, followed by the Original SI. The individual comparison of each ARCA revealed that Wilson disease, PLA2G6-associated neurodegeneration, and hypomyelinating leukodystrophy (POLR3A) are frequent NPC false positives (PLA2G6 and POL3A only with the SIs). Both RADIAL and SI diagnostic approaches showed strong discriminatory potential and may be useful screening tools in different clinical contexts.

This disease is mainly characterized by dysfunction due to copper accumulation in the liver, kidney, brain, cornea, bone, heart, and blood cells. The clinical spectrum is broad in Wilson disease. Asymptomatic Wilson disease may be present, but findings related to the involvement of an individual organ or multiple organ failure can be seen. These findings can include neurologic and neuropsychiatric complications. Our aim here was to examine the neurologic complications and our clinical experience in patients who underwent liver transplant for Wilson disease in our clinic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of transplant patients with Wilson disease who were seen at Baskent University Faculty of Medicine Transplantation Science between 2005 and 2017. Patient demographics, neurologic complaints, findings from neurologic examinations, and imaging findings were recorded. We also recorded the presence of the Kayser-Fleischer ring, serum ceruloplasmin, 24-hour copper urine levels, and levels of dry copper in liver in each patient. RESULTS: Our study included 19 patients who ranged in age range from 18 to 44 years (mean age of 26 years). Seven of 19 patients (36.8%) had neurologic symptoms, including epileptic seizures in 2 patients (10.5%), encephalopathy in 1 patient (5.2%), tremor in 3 patients (15.7%), and headache in 1 patient (5.2%). The cause of these long-term neurologic complications was the immunosuppressive drugs. Patients with epileptic seizures were provided with seizure control medication (levetiracetam). Tremor did not need treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In Wilson disease, neurologic complications can be severe. The most common complication seen in our patients was tremor. Early diagnosis and treatment may slow down neurologic disability.
34144249		Characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized patients with Wilson's disease in the United States: A national survey.INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by excessive copper disposition predominantly in the liver and brain. Hospitalization data on patients with WD are scarce. Hence, we sought to examine the inpatient characteristics and outcomes of patients with WD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We utilized the National Inpatient Database (2006-2011) and analyzed all adult patients with a diagnosis of WD. RESULTS: There were 9046 hospitalizations during the study period. The leading etiologies for admissions were chronic liver disease (8.58%), WD (6.49%) and infections (septicemia 3.10% and pneumonia 2.50%). The overall inpatient mortality rate for WD patients was 2.58%. Independent predictors of mortality in WD patients were acute respiratory failure (OR: 4.53; 95% CI: 2.44-8.42), acute renal failure (OR: 4.09; 95% CI: 2.19-7.65), decompensated liver disease or liver failure (OR: 3.37; 95% CI: 1.72-6.59), and advanced age (every 10 year increase, OR: 1.48; 95% CI: 1.25-1.75). Propensity-score matched analysis revealed better inpatient survival in WD patients compared to matched non-WD patients (2.84% vs. 4.67%, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated the clinical characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized patients with WD. These findings add important knowledge to our understanding of the healthcare utilization and outcomes of this rare disease in the United States.
30686905	treat|@CHEMICAL_Bilirubin|@DISEASE_Hepatolenticular_Degeneration ;associate|@CHEMICAL_Bilirubin|@DISEASE_Fibrosis	Differential hepatic features presenting in Wilson disease-associated cirrhosis and hepatitis B-associated cirrhosis.BACKGROUND: Cirrhosis is a chronic late stage liver disease associated with hepatitis viruses, alcoholism, and metabolic disorders, such as Wilson disease (WD). There are no clear markers or clinical features that define cirrhosis originating from these disparate origins. We hypothesized that cirrhosis is not one disease and cirrhosis of different etiology may have differential clinical hepatic features. AIM: To delineate the liver features between WD-associated cirrhosis and hepatitis B-associated cirrhosis in the Chinese population. METHODS: In this observational study, we reviewed the medical data of consecutive inpatients who had WD-associated cirrhosis or hepatitis B-associated cirrhosis from January 2010 to August 2018, and excluded patients who had carcinoma, severe heart or pulmonary diseases, or other liver diseases. According to the etiology of cirrhosis, patients were divided into two groups: WD-associated cirrhosis group (60 patients) and hepatitis B-associated cirrhosis group (56 patients). The liver fibrosis degree, liver function indices, and portal hypertension features of these patients were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: No inter-group differences were observed in the diagnostic liver fibrosis markers, however, clinical features clearly defined the origin of cirrhosis. WD-associated cirrhosis patients (16-29 years) had lower levels of alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and bilirubin, lower prothrombin time, lower incidence of hepatic encephalopathy, and lower portal vein diameter (P < 0.05), compared to cirrhosis resulting from hepatitis B in older patients (45-62 years). Importantly, they had decreased risks of progression from Child-Pugh grade A to B (odds ratio = 0.046, 95% confidence interval: 0.006-0.387, P = 0.005) and of ascites (odds ratio = 0.08, 95% confidence interval: 0.01-0.48, P = 0.005). Conversely, WD-associated cirrhosis patients had a higher risk of splenomegaly (odds ratio = 4.15, 95% confidence interval: 1.38-12.45, P = 0.011). CONCLUSION: WD-associated cirrhosis presents a higher risk of splenomegaly associated with leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, although revealing milder liver dysfunction and portal hypertension symptoms, which recommends WD patients to be monitored for associated complications.

We aimed to determine the incremental yield of exome sequencing (ES) in this population. From February 2017 to April 2022, 1,526 fetuses were subjected to ES; 482 of them were structurally normal (31.6%). Only pathogenic and likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants, per the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) classification, were reported. Additionally, ACMG secondary findings relevant to childhood were reported. Four fetuses (4/482; 0.8%) had P/LP variants indicating a moderate to severe disease in ATP7B, NR2E3, SPRED1 and FGFR3, causing Wilson disease, Enhanced S-cone syndrome, Legius and Muenke syndromes, respectively. Two fetuses had secondary findings, in RET and DSP. Our data suggest that offering only CMA for structurally normal fetuses may provide false reassurance. Prenatal ES mandates restrictive analysis and careful management combined with pre and post-test genetic counseling.
29692402		Indian childhood cirrhosis - down but not out: Report of a rare case with a practical clinicopathological diagnostic approach.Indian childhood cirrhosis is an entity believed to be on the verge of extinction. We present the case of a 13-month-old girl presenting acutely with jaundice, fever, and persistently increasing bilirubin. Investigations revealed direct hyperbilirubinemia, elevated transaminases, anemia, a blood with few schistocytes, positive direct coombs test, and deranged prothrombin time. Viral, autoimmune, and metabolic workup was unremarkable. Ultrasonography showed chronic liver disease, portal hypertension, and ascites. Due to numerous confounding factors and a low index of suspicion, the diagnosis of Indian childhood cirrhosis remained elusive and was clinched only on liver biopsy, albeit more than three weeks later, shortly after which the child expired. The timing and technique of the liver biopsy may have profound impact on the ultimate clinical outcome. Close coordination between the clinical and pathological teams is essential for deciphering acute presentations where the etiology is uncertain. We highlight the clinical considerations, varied morphological pointers, and offer a diagnostic algorithm facilitating the consideration of this disease.
30879594		Rendezvous Technique Using Double Balloon Endoscope for Removal of Multiple Intrahepatic Bile Duct Stones in Hepaticojejunostomy After Living Donor Liver Transplant: A Case Report.Cholangitis is a major complication following transplantation. We report a living donor liver transplant (LDLT) patient with cholangitis due to multiple stones in the intrahepatic bile duct during hepaticojejunostomy anastomosis, who was successfully treated with the rendezvous technique using double balloon endoscope. A 64-year-old woman underwent LDLT with right lobe graft and hepaticojejunostomy for Wilson disease. There was bile leakage with biliary peritonitis, which was treated conservatively after transplant. Two years after surgery, she developed reiterated cholangitis due to stenosis of hepaticojejunostomy anastomosis and multiple stones in the intrahepatic bile ducts. Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage was performed. The size of the drainage tube was increased, and the anastomotic area was dilated in a stepwise manner using a balloon catheter. The stones were crushed and lithotomy was performed using electronic hydraulic lithotripsy through cholangioscopy. Finally, lithotomy was performed for the remaining stones through endoscopic retrograde cholangiography with the rendezvous technique using the double balloon endoscope. Rendezvous approach with percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage and double balloon endoscopic retrograde cholangiography was an effective treatment for the multiple intrahepatic stones in hepaticojejunostomy following LDLT with right lobe graft.
34087921		Blind liver biopsy: a 17-year experience.OBJECTIVES: Liver biopsy is the gold standard for assessing liver inflammation, necrosis and fibrosis. The aim of the study is to evaluate clinical indications and histopathological results of percutaneus liver biopsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 516 children who underwent blind liver biopsy were evaluated retrospectively. RESULTS: Blind liver biopsy was performed for chronic active hepatitis B in 50% of the cases (n=260), neonatal cholestasis in 14% (n=68), autoimmune hepatitis in 7.7% (n=40), Wilson disease in 7.3% (n=38), isolated elevation of the liver enzymes in 5% (n=26), chronic active hepatitis C in 4.2% (n=22), metabolic disease in 3.4% (n=17), malignancies in 2.2% (n=11) and the others in 3.4% (n=17). Major complications were observed in 0.19% of the cases (n=1) and minor complications such as pain at the biopsy site in 13.5% of the cases (n=70), hypotension and tachycardia in 1.9% (n=10). CONCLUSIONS: Blind liver biopsy is a safe method in diagnosing liver diseases in childhood.

38175989		Teaching NeuroImage: Neuroimaging Features of Wilson Disease.A 13-year-old boy of nonconsanguineous parents presented with abnormal body movements, gait difficulty, and slurring of speech for 2 years. On examination, he had rigidity, dystonia, dysarthria, and drooling. Ophthalmologic examination revealed bilateral Kayser-Fleischer rings. He had elevated serum "free" copper levels (41.2 mug/dL [range:10-15]), 24-hour urine copper levels (895.7 mug/d [range:<60]), and reduced serum ceruloplasmin levels (4.3 mg/dL (range:20-40]). MRI revealed "face of giant panda" appearance (Figure A), T2-fluid attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensities (Figure, B and C), and frontal cystic encephalomalacic changes (Figure D), suggestive of Wilson disease (WD). Face of giant panda in WD, first described by Hitoshi et al.,1 is due to high signal intensity in tegmentum with normal signals in red nuclei forming the eyes, normal signals of pars reticulata (lateral portion) of substantia nigra forming the ears, and hypointensity of superior colliculus forming the chin.2 Bilateral cystic changes are less commonly reported in WD.3 Recognizing diverse neuroimaging signatures beyond well-known findings in WD enhances diagnostic accuracy.

The gene responsible for WD was discovered in 1993 and is located on chromosome 13 at 13q14.3. It encodes a copper-specific transporting P-type ATPase. Early diagnosis can improve treatment outcome and decrease the rate of disability or even mortality.We used Sanger sequencing to identify mutation hot spots in 55 northern Vietnamese with a clinical diagnosis of WD. Mutations were screened and detected by direct DNA sequencing. A total of 26 different ATP7B gene mutations were identified, including seven novel mutations (five nonsense and two missense mutations). The most frequent mutations were p.Ser105Ter (24.55%), p.Arg778Leu (5.45%) and p.Thr850Ile (4.55%). Mutation detection rate in exon 2 was 34.55% and ranked first, followed by exon 8 with 16.36%, and exon 18 with 10.91% each, thus, exons 2, 8 and 18 are the mutation hot spots for northern VietnameseWD patients. These findings were different from previous studies in Asia. Our research established a suitable strategy for ATP7B gene testing in northern Vietnamese WD patients.

The subcellular lesions caused by an excess of this essential metal accounts for many of the signs of Wilson disease. The drugs used to treat this disease are not always effective, and depending on dose, they may have collateral toxicity. Melatonin is an endogenously-produced molecule that functions as a copper chelator, a potent antioxidant, and as a suppressor of endoplasmic reticulum stress and the unfolded protein response in both the liver and the brain, while also reducing fibrosis/cirrhosis in the liver. Melatonin is inexpensive, non-toxic and can be administered via any route. Melatonin should be tested for its potential utility in experimental models of Wilson disease with extension to the human if melatonin proves to be effective in the animal studies.
33369596		Long-Term Urinary Copper Excretion on Chelation Therapy in Children with Wilson Disease.OBJECTIVES: In Wilson disease (WD), 24-hour urinary copper excretion (UCE) is recommended to be used for diagnosis. It may be a useful tool to assess the efficacy of treatment during follow-up; however, there are limited data regarding the cutoff value of 24-hour UCE during follow-up in children. Therefore, we aim to evaluate the clinical use of 24-hour UCE during follow-up in children with WD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Medical records of children diagnosed with WD at Kings' College Hospital from 2005 to 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. The UCE, serum copper, and ceruloplasmin levels, tested during follow-up, were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Over the median duration of 7 years (range 1.4-14.4), 28 patients (age ranged 3.8-17.3 years) had UCE tests during follow-up. Of those, 21 patients had at least one 24-hour UCE test and 7 children had only spot UCE tests. In comparison with the level of 24-hour UCE collected at the first visit after penicillamine challenge test, the median excretion rate was significantly reduced over the follow-up period (P < 0.001), from 26.2 to 8.9 mumol/day following 1-2 years of therapy (P = 0.15), then reduced significantly to 2.2 mumol/day after 3-4 years (P = 0.009), and 5.6 mumol/day at >5 years of follow-up (P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that within 1 year of treatment, the level of nonceruloplasmin-bound copper concentration (NCC) drops to <0.8 mumol/L. In the absence of progressive liver disease or signs of copper deficiency, 24-hour UCE decreases to <=8 mumol/day and <6 mumol/day after 1 and 5 years of treatment, respectively.
28975833		The Role of Diagnosis and Treatment of Underlying Liver Disease for the Prognosis of Primary Liver Cancer.Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Underlying chronic liver disease has been associated with an increased risk of developing HCC. This study is a review of the current literature regarding the diagnosis, prognostic significance, and role of treating underlying liver disease in patients who are at risk of primary liver cancer. Relevant peer review of the English literature between 1980 and 2017 within PubMed and the Cochrane library was conducted for scientific content on current advances in managing chronic liver diseases and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus (HBV), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, hereditary hemochromatosis, Wilson disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, and certain drugs lead to an increased risk of developing HCC. Patients with underlying liver disease have an increased incidence of HCC. Hepatitis C virus, HBV, and hemochromatosis can directly lead to HCC without the presence of cirrhosis, while HCC related to other underlying liver diseases occurs in patients with cirrhosis. Treating the underlying liver disease and reducing the progression to cirrhosis should lead to a decreased incidence of HCC.
30665472		Clinical Utility of Longitudinal Measurement of Motor Threshold in Wilson's Disease.This study describes the longitudinal changes of resting motor threshold (RMT) and central motor conduction time (CMCT) in 18 patients with Wilson's disease (WD). The RMT, CMCT, and Global Assessment Scale for Wilson Disease (GAS-WD) were measured at baseline and at follow-up after 12.94 +- 7.23 months. There was a significant decrease in the RMT (72.11 +- 18.62 vs. 63.7 +- 15.52%; p-value = 0.002) and GAS-WD scores (14.38 +- 5.35 vs. 9.77 +- 6.47 ms; p-value = 0.04). CMCT did not improve despite chelation therapy. Hence, RMT may serve as a marker of chelation efficacy in WD.

The initiation of protein translation is an important rate-limiting step in eukaryotes and is crucial in many viral infections. Eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) are involved in the initiation step of protein translation and are linked to the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Therefore we aimed to investigate a potential role of eIFs in HCC. We herein report on the immunohistochemical expression of the various eIF subunits in 235 cases of virus-related human HCC. Additionally, we used immunoblot analysis to investigate the expression of virus-related HCC and non-virus-related HCC in comparison to controls. Mammalian target of rapamycin (or mechanistic target of rapamycin as it is known now (mTOR) and activated mTOR were significantly increased in chronic hepatitis C (HCV)-associated HCC, in HCC without a viral background, in alcoholic liver disease and Wilson disease. pPTEN, phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) and pAKT showed a significant increase in HBV- and HCV-associated HCC, chronic hepatitis B, HCC without a viral background, alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) and Wilson disease. Phosphorylated (p)-eIF2alpha, eIF2alpha, eiF3B, eIF3D, eIF3J, p-eIF4B, eIF4G and eIF6 were upregulated in HCV-associated HCC. eIF2alpha, p-eIF4B, eIF5 and various eIF3 subunits were significantly increased in chronic hepatitis B (HBV)-associated HCC. HCC without viral background displayed a significant increase for the eIF subunits p-2alpha, 3C, 3I, 4E and 4G. We noticed engraved differences in the expression pattern between chronic hepatitis B and C, HBV- and HCV-associated HCC and non-virus-related HCC.

With spot urine collected from a control sample of preschool children (aged 3-7 years, n=153), the reference intervals of spot urine copper excretion indexes and their biological variation were defined. In order to investigate their utility performance in screening for WD in this age group, multiple spot urine samples from six WD patients who were diagnosed at presymptomatic stage were also analysed and compared. Cut-off values useful for detection of WD were defined by receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis. Biological (inter-individual) variation of spot urine copper indexes expressed as coefficient of variation (CVg) were around 60% at this age group, which was moderate and similar to other clinically useful urine tests, such as urine albumin excretion ratio. Spot urine copper excretion strongly correlated with both urine creatinine and osmolality. Linear regression against both creatinine and osmolality showed that ~94% of data points in healthy preschool children fell within the prediction interval, suggesting that both were useful normalisation factors. ROC showed that copper to osmolality ratio was the best index with an area under curve (AUC) greater than 0.98. Cut-off values of 0.5 mumol/L, 0.1 mumol/mmol and 0.00085 mumol/mOsmol (32 mug/L, 56 mug/g creatinine and 0.054 mug/mOsmol, respectively, in conventional units) for spot urine copper concentration, copper to creatinine ratio and copper to osmolality ratio, respectively, have potential application in the differentiation of WD patients. Based on the data, a new WD screening strategy targeting preschool children is proposed. Application of a bivariate screening strategy using spot urine copper concentration and urine osmolality may be useful in a population-wide screening program for WD among preschool children.

32067425		The co-occurrence of Wilson disease and X-linked agammaglobulinemia in one family highlights the promising diagnostic potential of proteolytic analysis.BACKGROUND: We report the first case of a family with co-occurrence of Wilson disease (WD), an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism, and X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), a primary immunodeficiency disorder (PIDD) that features marked reduction in circulating B lymphocytes and serum immunoglobulins. METHODS AND RESULTS: Through utilization of a multiplexed biomarker peptide quantification method known as the immuno-SRM assay, we were able to simultaneously and independently identify which family members are affected with WD and which are affected with XLA using dried blood spots (DBS). CONCLUSION: Being able to delineate multiple diagnoses using proteolytic analysis from a single DBS provides support for implementation of this methodology for clinical diagnostic use as well as large-scale population screening, such as newborn screening (NBS). This could allow for early identification and treatment of affected individuals with WD or XLA, which have been shown to reduce morbidity and decrease mortality in these two populations.
30368998	cause|@CHEMICAL_Zinc|@DISEASE_Brain_Diseases	Recovery of severe acute liver failure without transplantation in patients with Wilson disease.Wilson disease (WD) is a disorder of copper metabolism that leads to liver cirrhosis. WD patients with a NWIS > 11 should receive LT; however, we encountered 2 WD patients with an NWIS > 11 who recovered from ALF without LT. The present report aimed to analyze cases of WD patients with a high NWIS who recovered from severe ALF and to discuss the clinical manifestations of the patients and the effects of treatments, including zinc (Zn) therapy, chelator therapy, PE, CHDF, and LT. We retrospectively evaluated the medical records of five patients (male, 2; female, 3) diagnosed with WD along with severe ALF. In cases 1, 2, and 3, complete recovery from ALF was noted without LT. In case 4, initial recovery from ALF was noted without LT; however, ALF worsened owing to bleeding from the esophageal varix. Thus, the patient eventually needed LT. In case 5, recovery from ALF was noted with LT. All cases, except case 2, showed ALF with maximum PELD/MELD scores >=26 and NWISs >= 11, and had indications for LT. In cases of severe ALF with grade I or II encephalopathy, we recommend evaluations of the effects of Zn and chelator treatments while preparing for LT, as the condition may not improve without LT, and pediatricians or physicians can ask transplant surgeons to perform LT urgently if required.
29579829		Mortality Analysis of Acute Liver Failure in Uruguay.BACKGROUND: Acute liver failure (ALF) is a syndrome with high mortality. OBJECTIVE: Describe characteristics and outcomes of patients with ALF in Uruguay, and identify factors associated with mortality. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 33 patients with ALF was performed between 2009 and 2017. RESULTS: The patients' median age was 43 years, and 64% were women. Average Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score at admission was 33. The median referral time to the liver transplant (LT) center was 7 days. The most common etiologies were viral hepatitis (27%), indeterminate (21%), autoimmune (18%), and Wilson disease (15%). Overall mortality was 52% (71% of transplanted and 46% of nontransplanted patients). Dead patients had higher referral time (10 vs 4 days, P = .008), higher MELD scores at admission (37 vs 28) and highest achieved MELD scores (42 vs 29; P < .001), and higher encephalopathy grade III to IV (94% vs 25%, P < .001) than survivors. Patients without LT criteria (n = 4) had lower MELD score at admission (25 vs 34, P = .001) and highest achieved MELD score (27 vs 37, P = .008) compared with the others. Patients with LT criteria but contraindications (n = 7) had higher MELD scores at admission (38 vs 31, P = .02), highest achieved MELD scores (41 vs 34, P = .03), and longer referral time (10 days) than those without contraindications (3.5 days) or those without LT criteria (7.5 days, P = .02). Twenty-two patients were listed; LT was performed in 7, with a median time on waiting list of 6 days. CONCLUSIONS: ALF in Uruguay has high mortality associated with delayed referral to the LT center, MELD score, and encephalopathy. The long waiting times to transplantation might influence mortality.

37936530		Outcome of pediatric living donor liver transplant: Experience from Pakistan; a resource limited setting.INTRODUCTION: Liver transplantation (LT) has emerged as a lifesaving modality for many liver diseases in children. Pediatric LT is an established treatment in the Western world but is relatively a new procedure in resource-limited countries like Pakistan. The study aims to highlight the outcomes and survival of pediatric recipients from the first pediatric liver transplant center in Pakistan. METHOD: A retrospective analysis of pediatric LT was done from 2012 to 2019. The study was conducted in the Hepatobiliary and liver transplant department of Shifa International Hospital (SIH), Islamabad. A detailed analysis for indications for pediatric LT, survival, and complications was done. RESULTS: Forty-five patients under 18 years of age underwent Living donor liver transplant (LDLT) in SIH. Median age was 9 years and M:F of 2:1. Cryptogenic liver disease followed by Wilson disease were the two most common indications of LT. The majority of patients had chronic liver disease 34 (75%) while 11 (24%) had acute liver failure. The right lobe graft was the most common type of graft 19 (42.2%). Thirty days, 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival was 77.8%, 75.6%, 73.3%, and 60.6% respectively. Mortality was highest in patients with biliary atresia 4 (33%). Causes of death included pulmonary embolism, sepsis, surgical complications, and acute kidney injury. Mean survival was 88.850 months (+-7.899) (CI 73.369-104.331). CONCLUSION: Pediatric LDLT has offered disease-free survival for patients. Survival can improve further with nutritional rehabilitation and anticipation and management of post-operative complications.
28861905		Treatable inherited rare movement disorders.There are many rare movement disorders, and new ones are described every year. Because they are not well recognized, they often go undiagnosed for long periods of time. However, early diagnosis is becoming increasingly important. Rapid advances in our understanding of the biological mechanisms responsible for many rare disorders have enabled the development of specific treatments for some of them. Well-known historical examples include Wilson disease and dopa-responsive dystonia, for which specific and highly effective treatments have life-altering effects. In recent years, similarly specific and effective treatments have been developed for more than 30 rare inherited movement disorders. These treatments include specific medications, dietary changes, avoidance or management of certain triggers, enzyme replacement therapy, and others. This list of treatable rare movement disorders is likely to grow during the next few years because a number of additional promising treatments are actively being developed or evaluated in clinical trials.   2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.
28516971		Salivary biomarkers and proteomics: future diagnostic and clinical utilities.Saliva testing is a non-invasive and inexpensive test that can serve as a source of information useful for diagnosis of disease. As we enter the era of genomic technologies and -omic research, collection of saliva has increased. Recent proteomic platforms have analysed the human salivary proteome and characterised about 3000 differentially expressed proteins and peptides: in saliva, more than 90% of proteins in weight are derived from the secretion of three couples of "major" glands; all the other components are derived from minor glands, gingival crevicular fluid, mucosal exudates and oral microflora. The most common aim of proteomic analysis is to discriminate between physiological and pathological conditions. A proteomic protocol to analyze the whole saliva proteome is not currently available. It is possible distinguish two type of proteomic platforms: top-down proteomics investigates intact naturally-occurring structure of a protein under examination; bottom-up proteomics analyses peptide fragments after pre-digestion (typically with trypsin). Because of this heterogeneity, many different biomarkers may be proposed for the same pathology. The salivary proteome has been characterised in several diseases: oral squamous cell carcinoma and oral leukoplakia, chronic graft-versus-host disease Sjogren's syndrome and other autoimmune disorders such as SAPHO, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and genetic diseases like Down's Syndrome and Wilson disease. The results of research reported herein suggest that in the near future human saliva will be a relevant diagnostic fluid for clinical diagnosis and prognosis.
28495941		Pontomesencephalic Atrophy and Postural Instability in Wilson Disease.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The MR Parkinsonism index helps in differentiating progressive supranuclear palsy from Parkinson disease and multisystem atrophy. Pontomesencephalic involvement is common in neurologic Wilson disease, but there is no prior study evaluating the MR Parkinsonism index and its indices in Wilson disease. We report the MR Parkinsonism index and its indices in Wilson disease and correlate these changes with clinical severity and postural reflex. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen individuals with neurologic Wilson disease were included, and their clinical details, including neurologic severity, postural reflex abnormality, and location of signal changes on MR imaging, were noted. The 3D BRAVO T1 sequence was used for measurement of the MR Parkinsonism index and its indices. The MR Parkinsonism index and its indices were also obtained in 6 age- and sex-matched controls. The morphometric parameters in Wilson disease were compared with those in with healthy controls and among the patients with and without abnormal postural reflex. RESULTS: The midbrain area was reduced in patients with Wilson disease compared with controls (112.08 +- 27.94 versus 171.95 +- 23.66 mm2, P = .002). The patients with an abnormal postural reflex had an increased MR Parkinsonism index and pons-to-midbrain ratio compared with controls, whereas these parameters were equivalent in patients with normal postural reflex and controls. The patients with abnormal postural reflex had more severe illness, evidenced by higher Burke-Fahn-Marsden scores (51.0 +- 32.27 versus 13.75 +- 12.37, P = .04) and neurologic severity grades (2.57 +- 0.53 versus 1.67 +- 0.82, P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: An increase in the MR Parkinsonism index in Wilson disease is mainly due to midbrain atrophy and it correlates with neurologic severity and abnormal postural reflex.
36422847		Plugged percutaneous liver biopsy using Tru-cut needle and coils: A retrospective study.BACKGROUND: Plugged percutaneous liver biopsy, though has been in use for many years, is being used more frequently in patients in whom percutaneous liver biopsy is contraindicated due to proven or probable bleeding tendencies. We report our experience with this procedure, its indications, efficacy, and complications in Indian population over 2 years. METHODS: A retrospective study of 127 consecutive patients who had undergone plug liver biopsy from April 2017 to May 2019 was done from the database maintained in our department. The indications, technical success, complications, and impact of histological diagnosis on the management of those patients were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 127 biopsies were performed of which 68 were males and 59 were females, aged between 7 and 73 years. No procedures were abandoned; however, 13 cases needed ultrasonography (USG) guidance because of small size of the liver or presence of right perihepatic fluid. Out of 127 biopsies, none of the samples was inadequate and yielded adequate tissue for histopathological diagnosis. Seven patients required repeat study only because underlying liver disease was suspected clinically and the previous biopsy report had turned out to be normal. Histopathological examination in our study showed autoimmune hepatitis in 61, cirrhotic changes either hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) related in 40, veno-occlusive disease in 3, cholestatic disease in 2, and Wilson's disease in 2 patients. The remaining 19 were normal. Complications occurred in 3 patients - arterioportal fistula, pneumothorax, and inadequate coiling causing mild hemoperitoneum. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous liver biopsy followed by plugging of the tract with coils is a safe, easy, and effective method in patients with underlying bleeding tendencies, minimal ascites, and small liver.
29325220	cause|@CHEMICAL_Bile_Pigments|@DISEASE_Kidney_Tubular_Necrosis_Acute ;cause|@CHEMICAL_Bilirubin|@DISEASE_Acute_Kidney_Injury	Profile, risk factors and outcome of acute kidney injury in paediatric acute-on-chronic liver failure.BACKGROUND & AIMS: There are no studies on acute kidney injury in paediatric acute-on-chronic liver failure. This study was planned with aim to describe the clinical presentation and outcome of acute kidney injury among paediatric acute-on-chronic liver failure patients. METHODS: Data of all children 1-18 years of age presenting with acute chronic liver failure (Asia pacific association for the study of the liver definition) was reviewed. Acute kidney injury was defined as per Kidney Diseases-Improving Global Outcomes guidelines. Poor outcome was defined as death or need for liver transplant within 3 months of development of acute kidney injury. RESULTS: A total of 84 children with acute-on-chronic liver failure were presented to us in the study period. Acute kidney injury developed in 22.6% of patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure. The median duration from acute-on-chronic liver failure to development of acute kidney injury was 4 weeks (Range: 2-10 weeks). The causes of acute kidney injury were hepatorenal syndrome (31.6%), sepsis (31.6%), nephrotoxic drugs (21%), dehydration (10.5%) and bile pigment related acute tubular necrosis in one patient. On univariate analysis, higher baseline bilirubin, higher international normalized ratio, higher paediatric end stage liver disease, presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome and presence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis had significant association with presence of acute kidney injury. On logistic regression analysis, presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (adjusted OR: 8.659, 95% CI: 2.18-34.37, P = .002) and higher baseline bilirubin (adjusted OR: 1.07, 95% CI: 1.008-1.135, P = .025) were independently associated with presence of acute kidney injury. Of the patients with acute kidney injury, 5(26.3%) survived with native liver, 10(52.6%) died and 4 (21.1%) underwent liver transplantation. CONCLUSION: Acute kidney injury developed in 22.6% of children with acute-on-chronic liver failure. Bilirubin more than 17.7 mg/dL and presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome were high risk factors for acute kidney injury. Development of acute kidney injury in a child with acute-on-chronic liver failure suggests poor outcome and need for early intervention.
31276461		Scheimpflug Imaging of the Danish Cohort of Patients With Wilson Disease.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of anterior segment imaging in diagnosing Kayser-Fleischer rings in patients with Wilson disease. METHODS: In a tertiary center for Wilson disease, patients were examined with a Pentacam HR Scheimpflug-based tomography device in addition to conventional slit-lamp examination. The inferior part of the cornea was analyzed using both a built-in densitometry module and ImageJ. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients with Wilson disease (78% of all Danish patients) were included, resulting in 83 examinations over a 5-year period. Ten had a manifest Kayser-Fleischer ring in the inferior part of the cornea on at least 1 examination, 5 had other causes of peripheral corneal scatter, and 16 had normal examinations. The built-in densitometry module performed poorly in discriminating between the presence and absence of a Kayser-Fleischer ring. However, analysis of the images in ImageJ and calculation of a normalized signal (peak posterior value/peak anterior value) with a cutoff value set to 1 detected 28 of 31 Kayser-Fleischer rings and resulted in 96% sensitivity and 95% specificity. In 12 patients who underwent 3 or more examinations during the period, changes in the normalized signal seemed to reflect the efficiency of the treatment, although more studies are needed for this conclusion. CONCLUSIONS: ImageJ-based analysis of Pentacam images has a high sensitivity in detecting Kayser-Fleischer rings and can be used as a diagnostic procedure for Wilson disease and may be a tool to monitor the disease in an objective manner.

Acute and severe hyperammoniemia inducing cellular metabolic alterations, prolonged state of "neuroinflammation", activation of brain microglia, accumulation of manganese and ammonia, and systemic inflammation are the main causative factors of brain damage in liver failure. The most widely recognized neurological complications of serious hepatocellular failure include hepatic encephalopathy, diffuse cerebral edema, Wilson disease, hepatic myelopathy, acquired hepatocerebral degeneration, cirrhosis-related Parkinsonism and osmotic demyelination syndrome. Neurological disorders affecting liver transplant candidates while in the waiting list may not only significantly influence preoperative morbidity and even mortality, but also represent important predictive factors for post-transplant neurological manifestations. Careful pre-transplant neurological evaluation is essential to define severity and distribution of the neurological impairment, to identify the abnormalities still responsive to current treatment, and to potentially predict the inherent post-operative prognosis. The preferred specific indices of neurological pre-transplant assessment may vary among centers, however, even with the aid of the current biochemical, neurophysiological, neuropsychological and neuroimaging diagnostic tools, the correct diagnosis and differential diagnosis of various syndromes may be difficult. In this article the relevant pathophysiological and clinical aspects of the most frequent brain and peripheral nervous system diseases affecting liver transplant candidates with acute or advanced chronic liver failure are briefly reported. The practical diagnostic findings useful for the preoperative assessment and treatment, as well as the expected neurological evolution after liver transplantation are also evaluated.

An early diagnosis is crucial to prevent evolution of the disease, as implantation of early therapeutic measures fully prevents its symptoms. As population genetics data predict a higher than initially expected prevalence, it was important to define the basic diagnostic tools to approach population screening. METHODS: A highly genetically homogeneous cohort of 70 patients, belonging to 50 unrelated families, has been selected as a framework to analyze all their clinical, biochemical and genetic characteristics, to define the disease in our population, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 12,369, and determine the most useful features that reach diagnostic value. RESULTS: Serum ceruloplasmin below 11.5 mg/dL and cupremia below 60 mug/mL, were the best analytical predictors of the disease in asymptomatic individuals, while cupruria or hepatic copper determination were less powerful. Genetic analysis reached a conclusive diagnosis in all 65 patients available for complete testing. Of them, 48 were carriers of at least one p.Leu708Pro mutant allele, with 24 homozygotes. Nine patients carried a promoter deletion mutation, revealing that extended sequencing beyond the ATP7B gene-coding region is essential. All mutations caused hepatic damage since early ages, increasing its severity as diagnosis was delayed, and neurological symptoms appear. CONCLUSION: Serum ceruloplasmin determination followed by genetic screening would reduce costs and favor the prioritization of non-invasive procedures to reach a definitive diagnosis, even for asymptomatic cases.

He was deeply icteric with ascites, hepatosplenomegaly, hyperbilirubinemia, raised transaminases, and coagulopathy. Viral markers and slit lamp examination for Kayser-Fleischer ring were negative. Serum ceruloplasmin and 24-h urinary copper post-D-pencillamine challenge were normal. Anti-smooth muscle antibody was positive 1:20, and liver biopsy showed micronodular cirrhosis with abundant Mallory hyaline and stainable copper deposits. The liver histology was indicative of Indian childhood cirrhosis, whereas the presence of autoantibodies, elevated transaminases, and increased globulin was suggestive of autoimmune hepatitis. Gene studies identified p.R969Q mutation in ATP7B gene, which solved the dilemma and confirmed the diagnosis of Wilson disease (WD). We report a clinicopathological conference of this boy to highlight the challenges faced by pediatricians in the diagnosis of Wilson disease.  .

Bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) is a potent copper chelator that may be associated with a lower risk of inducing paradoxical neurological worsening than conventional therapy for neurologic WD. To better understand the mode of action of TTM, we investigated its effects on copper absorption and biliary excretion. METHODS: In a double-blind randomized setting, hepatic 64Cu activity was examined after orally administered 64Cu by PET/CT in 16 healthy volunteers before and after seven days of TTM treatment (15 mg/d) or placebo. Oral 64Cu was administered one hour after the final TTM dose. Changes in hepatic 64Cu activity reflected changes in intestinal 64Cu uptake. Additionally, in four patients with WD, the distribution of 64Cu in venous blood, liver, gallbladder, kidney, and brain was followed after i.v. 64Cu dosing for up to 68 hours before and after seven days of TTM (15 mg/day), using PET/MRI. Increased gallbladder 64Cu activity was taken as evidence of increased biliary 64Cu excretion. RESULTS: In healthy volunteers, TTM reduced intestinal 64Cu uptake by 82% 15 hours after the oral 64Cu dose. In patients with WD, gallbladder 64Cu activity was negligible before and after TTM, while TTM effectively retained 64Cu in the blood, significantly reduced hepatic 64Cu activity at all time-points and significantly reduced cerebral 64Cu activity two hours after the intravenous 64Cu dose. CONCLUSIONS: While we did not show an increase in biliary excretion of 64Cu following TTM administration, we demonstrated that TTM effectively inhibited most intestinal 64Cu uptake and retained 64Cu in the blood stream, limiting the exposure of 64Cu to organs like the liver and the brain. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: Bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) is an investigational copper chelator being developed for the treatment of Wilson disease. In animal models of Wilson disease, TTM has been shown to facilitate biliary copper excretion. In the present human study, TTM surprisingly did not facilitate biliary copper excretion but instead reduced intestinal copper uptake to a clinically significant degree. Our study builds on our understanding of human copper metabolism and the mechanism of action of TTM.
31899725		Management of Wilson Disease Diagnosed in Infancy: An Appraisal of Available Experience to Generate Discussion.Increased access to molecular genetic testing is changing the demographics for diagnosing inherited disorders and imposing new challenges for medical management. Wilson disease (WD), typically diagnosed in older children and adults, can now be detected in utero and in infants (children younger than 24 months, including neonates) via genetic testing. An evidence-based approach to management of these neonates and extremely young children, who are typically asymptomatic, has been hampered by lack of clinical experience. We present a case of an infantile diagnosis of WD, review available experience, and discuss current trends in antenatal genetic testing of parents and fetus that may lead to a very early diagnosis of WD. Based on physiological and nutritional considerations, we propose an algorithmic approach to management of infantile WD as a starting point for further discussion. Future collaboration amongst specialists is essential to identify evidence-based approaches and best practice for managing treatment of infants with genetically diagnosed WD.

We report a pediatric case of D-penicillamine induced ANCA-associated vasculitis that manifests as a pulmonary-renal syndrome with a mild renal manifestation. A 13-year-old girl who has been taking D-penicillamine for five years under the diagnosis of Wilson disease visited the emergency room because of hemoptysis and dyspnea. She had diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage, microscopic hematuria, and proteinuria. Myeloperoxidase ANCA was positive, and a renal biopsy revealed pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis. Under the diagnosis of D-penicillamine-induced ANCA-associated vasculitis, D-penicillamine was switched to trientine, and the patient was treated with plasmapheresis, glucocorticoid, cyclophosphamide, and mycophenolate mofetil. Pulmonary hemorrhage improved rapidly followed by the disappearance of the hematuria and proteinuria five months later.

AIMS: Describe a common founder pathogenic variant among Bukharan Jews and to assess its prevalence, clinical features, and outcome. METHODS: The cohort consisted of patients of Bukharan Jewish descent diagnosed with Wilson disease at a tertiary pediatric medical center in 2013-2018. Clinical and genetic data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Six patients from 4 unrelated families who were homozygous for the c.3784G>T p.(Val1262Phe) pathogenic variant in ATP7B were identified. Five presented with elevated aminotransferase levels, and one, with acute liver failure. Mean age at diagnosis was 8.7 years (5-12.5). Serum ceruloplasmin level was extremely low in all patients (1.9-7 mg/dL; mean 3.2(. The variant was identified in a heterozygous state in 5/153 Bukharan Jews; 2/33 from our local exome database and 3/120 healthy unrelated Bukharan Jews in another cohort, for an estimated carrier frequency of ~1:30. CONCLUSIONS: We report a common founder pathogenic variant in the ATP7B gene among Bukharan Jews associated with severe early-onset Wilson disease. Given the clinical severity, high frequency of the variant, and being a treatable disease, its inclusion in pre-symptomatic screening in the Bukharan Jewish community should be considered. Furthermore, WD should be part of future genetic newborn screening programs in Israel and worldwide, to enable early treatment and prevention of future life-threatening complications.

Mutants of ATP7B cause Wilson disease (WD), an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. Here, we present cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of human ATP7B in the E1 state in the apo, the putative copper-bound, and the putative cisplatin-bound forms. In ATP7B, the N-terminal sixth metal-binding domain (MBD6) binds at the cytosolic copper entry site of the transmembrane domain (TMD), facilitating the delivery of copper from the MBD6 to the TMD. The sulfur-containing residues in the TMD of ATP7B mark the copper transport pathway. By comparing structures of the E1 state human ATP7B and E2-Pi state frog ATP7B, we propose the ATP-driving copper transport model of ATP7B. These structures not only advance our understanding of the mechanisms of ATP7B-mediated copper export but can also guide the development of therapeutics for the treatment of WD.
31897936	treat|@CHEMICAL_Copper|@DISEASE_Hepatolenticular_Degeneration	Eye movement abnormalities are associated with brainstem atrophy in Wilson disease.BACKGROUNDS: This study aims to characterize eye movement abnormalities in Wilson disease and examine their association with the degree of brainstem atrophy. METHODS: Twenty patients (10 males, mean age 46.8, SD 8.9 years) with genetically confirmed neurological WD on stable anti-copper treatment and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects were examined. Eye movements, including prosaccade and antisaccade tasks, were evaluated using infrared videooculography. MRI was performed using 1.5 T system, and T2-weighted images were used for the measurement of midbrain and pontine area on mid-sagittal slices. Clinical severity was assessed using the Unified Wilson's Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS). RESULTS: Compared to healthy controls, WD patients showed prolonged latencies of horizontal prosaccades and hypometry of both horizontal (p = 0.04) and vertical (p = 0.0046) prosaccades. In the antisaccade task, WD patients showed prolonged latency of both horizontal (p = 0.04) and vertical antisaccades (p = 0.047) and increased error rate of vertical antisaccades (p = 0.04). There is a significant association between midbrain area and horizontal latencies (r = -0.53; p = 0.02) and vertical maximum speed in prosaccades (r = 0.47; p = 0.04). The pons area inversely correlated with horizontal prosaccade and antisaccade latencies (p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: We showed impairments of ocular saccades such as prolonged latencies, hypometry, and increased error rate in antisaccades. The strong association between prolonged latencies of prosaccades and the brainstem atrophy suggests that VOG might serve as a sensitive electrophysiological marker of brainstem dysfunction in WD.
33754827	treat|@CHEMICAL_Copper|@DISEASE_Hepatolenticular_Degeneration	Associations of Brain Atrophy and Cerebral Iron Accumulation at MRI with Clinical Severity in Wilson Disease.Background Abnormal findings at brain MRI in patients with neurologic Wilson disease (WD) are characterized by signal intensity changes and cerebral atrophy. T2 signal hypointensities and atrophy are largely irreversible with treatment; their relationship with permanent disability has not been systematically investigated. Purpose To investigate associations of regional brain atrophy and iron accumulation at MRI with clinical severity in participants with neurologic WD who are undergoing long-term anti-copper treatment. Materials and Methods Participants with WD and controls were compared in a prospective study performed from 2015 to 2019. MRI at 3.0 T included three-dimensional T1-weighted and six-echo multigradient-echo pulse sequences for morphometry and quantitative susceptibility mapping, respectively. Neurologic severity was assessed with the Unified WD Rating Scale (UWDRS). Automated multi-atlas segmentation pipeline with dual contrast (susceptibility and T1) was used for the calculation of volumes and mean susceptibilities in deep gray matter nuclei. Additionally, whole-brain analysis using deformation and surface-based morphometry was performed. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression was used to assess the association of regional volumes and susceptibilities with the UWDRS score. Results Twenty-nine participants with WD (mean age, 47 years +- 9 [standard deviation]; 15 women) and 26 controls (mean age, 45 years +- 12; 14 women) were evaluated. Whole-brain analysis demonstrated atrophy of the deep gray matter nuclei, brainstem, internal capsule, motor cortex and corticospinal pathway, and visual cortex and optic radiation in participants with WD (P < .05 at voxel level, corrected for family-wise error). The UWDRS score was negatively correlated with volumes of putamen (r = -0.63, P < .001), red nucleus (r = -0.58, P = .001), globus pallidus (r = -0.53, P = .003), and substantia nigra (r = -0.50, P = .006) but not with susceptibilities. Only the putaminal volume was identified as a stable factor associated with the UWDRS score (R2 = 0.38, P < .001) using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression. Conclusion Individuals with Wilson disease (WD) had widespread brain atrophy most pronounced in the central structures. The putaminal volume was associated with the Unified WD Rating Scale score and can be used as a surrogate imaging marker of clinical severity.

31884064		Assessment of the Hallmarks of Wilson Disease in CT Scan Imaging.INTRODUCTION: Owing to nonspecific clinical symptoms, Wilson disease (WD) diagnosis is often missed or delayed; hence, many patients reach end-stage liver disease. When cirrhosis takes place, it is difficult to distinguish between WD and other causes of cirrhosis by imaging alone. This study outlines abdominal computed tomography (CT) imaging findings that occur more frequently in patients with WD cirrhosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with WD who had referred for liver transplantation took part in this study and underwent dynamic liver CT examination before transplantation. Qualitative and quantitative parameters including liver density, contour irregularity, dysmorphia, hypertrophy of caudate lobe, presence of focal parenchymal lesion, thickness of perihepatic fat layer, periportal thickness, lymphadenopathy, and other associated findings were recorded and evaluated. RESULTS: Among these patients, 85.9% had contour irregularity, 28% had hepatic dysmorphia, and periportal thickening and cholelithiasis were found in 25.5% and 12.3% of patients, respectively. Splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and portosystemic shunting were observed in all patients. Also, hyperdense nodules (>20 mm) and honeycomb pattern were detected in 65.2% and 15.2% of patients, respectively, in the arterial phase. In the portal phase, these findings were detected only in 13% and 4.3% of patients. Hypertrophy of caudate lobe was seen only in 12.2% of patients. CONCLUSION: WD-associated cirrhosis has many CT imaging findings, although most of them are nonspecific. Some findings, such as hyperdense nodules and honeycomb pattern in non-contrast-enhanced CT scan and arterial phase of triphasic CT scan with lack of hypertrophy of caudate lobes, are hallmarks of WD.
30836904		Evaluation of Underlying Liver Disease and Its Severity in Children Referred for Liver Transplant: a Single-Center Report From Nemazee Hospital of Shiraz.OBJECTIVES: Liver transplant has been used as a curative approach for children with end-stage liver diseases. Here, we describe the underlying causes for pediatric liver transplant performed at the Shiraz Organ Transplantation Center, Nemazee Hospital, Shiraz, Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional descriptive study, children < 18 years old who were candidates for liver transplant from 2007 to 2010 at the Shiraz Organ Transplantation Center were included. Patients were evaluated for their underlying diseases leading to liver failure. Disease severity was assessed and compared with Pediatric End-Stage Liver Disease model and the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease scores. RESULTS: Of 107 patients, 60.8% were males and 39.2% were females. The mean age was 11.6 +- 4.9 years. Thirteen patients (12.5%) were < 2 years old, 26 (24%) were 2 to 6 years old, 33 (30.8%) were 6 to 12 years old, and 35 (32.7%) were 12 to 18 years old. Underlying liver diseases comprised biliary atresia (27.1%), cryptogenic cirrhosis (21.5%), autoimmune cirrhosis (13.1%), familial intrahepatic cholestasis (11.2%), Wilson disease (9.3%), tyrosinemia (7.4%), neonatal hepatitis (4.7%), congenital hepatic fibrosis (3.7%), and Caroli disease (1.9%). Jaundice (83.2%), ascites (57%), and esophageal varices (43%) were the most common clinical findings. Mean serum direct bilirubin, total bilirubin, international normalized ratio, and serum creatinine values were 3.6 +- 0.8 mg/dL, 9.3 +- 9.1 mg/dL, 2.1 +- 1.1, and 0.6 +- 0.2 mg/dL, respectively. The mean Pediatric End-Stage Liver Disease score in children < 12 years old was 11.4 +- 9.1. The mean Model for EndStage Liver Disease score in children > 12 years old was 13.7 +- 5.9. There were no differences in scores among sex, age groups, or different etiologies. CONCLUSIONS: Scores for disease severity were not significantly different with regard to different causes of underlying diseases for liver transplant in Iranian children.

The gene responsible for WD, ATP7B, is involved in the cellular transport of Cu, and mutations in the ATP7B gene induce accumulation of Cu in the liver and ultimately in the brain. In a pilot study, the natural variations of copper stable isotope ratios (65Cu/63Cu) in the serum of WD patients have been shown to differ from that of healthy controls. In the present study, we challenged these first results by measuring the 65Cu/63Cu ratios in the blood of treated (n = 25), naive patients (n = 11) and age matched healthy controls (n = 75). The results show that naive patients and healthy controls exhibit undistinguishable 65Cu/63Cu ratios, implying that the Cu isotopic ratio cannot serve as a reliable diagnostic biomarker. The type of treatment (d-penicillamine vs. triethylenetetramine) does not affect the 65Cu/63Cu ratios in WD patients, which remain constant regardless of the type and duration of the treatment. In addition, the 65Cu/63Cu ratios do not vary in naive patients after the onset of the treatment. However, the 65Cu/63Cu ratios decrease with the degree of liver fibrosis and the gradient of the phenotypic presentation, i.e. presymptomatic, hepatic and neurologic. To get insights into the mechanisms at work, we study the effects of the progress of the WD on the organism by measuring the Cu concentrations and the 65Cu/63Cu ratios in the liver, feces and plasma of 12 and 45 week old Atp7b-/- mice. The evolution of the 65Cu/63Cu ratios is marked by a decrease in all tissues. The results show that 63Cu accumulates in the liver preferentially to 65Cu due to the preferential cellular entry of 63Cu and the impairment of the 63Cu exit by ceruloplasmin. The hepatic accumulation of monovalent 63Cu+ is likely to fuel the production of free radicals, which is potentially an explanation of the pathogenicity of WD. Altogether, the results suggest that the blood 65Cu/63Cu ratio recapitulates WD progression and is a potential prognostic biomarker of WD.

Report of 24 Cases.OBJECTIVES: Wilson disease is an inherited disorder that results in copper accumulation in the tissues with liver injury and failure. Orthotopic liver transplant is one of the treatments of choice for this disease. The aim of this study was to compare the neurological symptoms, before and after orthotopic livertransplant, of patients with liver cirrhosis due to Wilson disease, who represent a special group of patients with liver failure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2007 and 2020, there were 24 patients with Wilson disease resistant to medical treatment who underwent deceased donor orthotopic livertransplant and were followed up for 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years for evaluation with neurological scoring systems. Patients were also evaluated for postoperative complications and survival. RESULTS: Of the 24 patients evaluated, there were 13 (54.2%) female patients and 11 (45.8%) male patients, and the mean age was 34 years (range, 14-57 years). One of the patients died from early postoperative sepsis. After orthotopic livertransplant, disease scores returned to normal in 16 patients and improved in the remaining patients. Before transplant, all patients required help in their daily activities. After transplant, there were significant improvements in some symptoms, and the patients became more independent in their daily lives. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that orthotopic liver transplant provides significant improvement in neurological symptoms and quality of life in patients with Wilson disease.
28060027		Advantages of Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography Evaluation of the Kayser-Fleischer Ring in Wilson Disease.PURPOSE: To present anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) findings of the Kayser-Fleischer (KF) ring in Wilson disease (WD) and to discuss the potential advantages of evaluating the KF ring by AS-OCT. METHODS: This is a retrospective case series of 7 patients with WD with KF rings seen in our institute during the study period (August 2015 to June 2016). All patients underwent slit-lamp examination of the cornea and AS-OCT (Optovue RTVue Premier). In 2 patients, the length of the KF ring was measured using the gray scale of AS-OCT. RESULTS: The KF ring on the gray scale of AS-OCT was visualized as a hyperreflective deep corneal layer at the level of Descemet membrane in all eyes. The OCT color scale revealed the KF ring as a greenish, greenish-yellow, yellow, or yellow-orange band. The gray scale of AS-OCT could easily measure the length of the KF ring in patients 6 and 7. CONCLUSIONS: AS-OCT is an alternative method of evaluating the KF ring in WD, which can be used in combination with slit-lamp examination. The KF ring can be easily measured using the gray scale of AS-OCT. Further studies are required to study the potential advantages of AS-OCT including assessing the density of the KF ring, as a tool to assess response to treatment in WD, in differentiating the KF ring of WD disease from copper deposits in other situations and pigmented corneal rings in non-Wilsonian liver disease.
29961769		Population genomics in South East Asia captures unexpectedly high carrier frequency for treatable inherited disorders.PURPOSE: Genomic studies have demonstrated the necessity of ethnicity-specific population data to ascertain variant pathogenicity for disease diagnosis and treatment. This study examined the carrier prevalence of treatable inherited disorders (TIDs), where early diagnosis of at-risk offspring can significantly improve clinical outcomes. METHODS: Existing exome/ genome sequencing data of 831 Singaporeans were aggregated and examined for disease causing variants in 104 genes associated with 80 TIDs. RESULTS: Among the 831 Singaporean participants, genomic variant filtering and analysis identified 1 in 18 individuals (6%) to be carriers amongst one of 13 TIDs. Citrin deficiency and Wilson disease had the highest carrier frequency of 1 in 41, and 1 in 103 individuals, respectively. The pathogenic variants associated with citrin deficiency were 24 times more prevalent in our local cohorts when compared to Western cohorts. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the value of a population specific genomic database to determine true disease prevalence and has enabled the discovery of carrier frequencies of treatable genetic conditions specific to South East Asian populations, which are currently underestimated in existing data sources. This study framework can be adapted to other population groups and expanded to multiple genetic conditions to inform health policies directing precision medicine.
38171926		Liver-directed gene therapy for inherited metabolic diseases.Gene therapy clinical trials are rapidly expanding for inherited metabolic liver diseases whilst two gene therapy products have now been approved for liver based monogenic disorders. Liver-directed gene therapy has recently become an option for treatment of haemophilias and is likely to become one of the favoured therapeutic strategies for inherited metabolic liver diseases in the near future. In this review, we present the different gene therapy vectors and strategies for liver-targeting, including gene editing. We highlight the current development of viral and nonviral gene therapy for a number of inherited metabolic liver diseases including urea cycle defects, organic acidaemias, Crigler-Najjar disease, Wilson disease, glycogen storage disease Type Ia, phenylketonuria and maple syrup urine disease. We describe the main limitations and open questions for further gene therapy development: immunogenicity, inflammatory response, genotoxicity, gene therapy administration in a fibrotic liver. The follow-up of a constantly growing number of gene therapy treated patients allows better understanding of its benefits and limitations and provides strategies to design safer and more efficacious treatments. Undoubtedly, liver-targeting gene therapy offers a promising avenue for innovative therapies with an unprecedented potential to address the unmet needs of patients suffering from inherited metabolic diseases.

The resultant defective handling of copper results in toxic effects on the hepatocytes and increased copper in the circulation. Copper accumulates in other organ sites especially the central nervous system. WD occurs worldwide, usually between 5 and 35 years; a wider age range is now recognized. Clinical presentations are diverse and include combinations of hepatic, neurological, ophthalmic and psychiatric manifestations. Biochemical abnormalities such as serum ceruloplasmin and 24-h urinary copper excretion are important for the diagnosis but are not always abnormal in WD. They can overlap with non-WD causes. Patients may present with hepatic or neurological disease or combinations thereof. Approx. 50% of WD patients present with liver disease. Liver presentation is variable: asymptomatic abnormal liver tests, chronic hepatitis picture, cirrhosis, and acute liver failure. Similarly, the histology has several different patterns: mild nonspecific changes, steatosis or steatohepatitis, chronic hepatitis, and acute hepatitis with submassive or massive necrosis. None of these are specific for WD. Aids to the histologic diagnosis include special stains for copper and copper associated protein, and copper concentration in liver tissue. The biopsy is performed in the context of the clinical algorithms for the diagnosis of WD put forth by the clinical hepatology organizations such as the European Association for the Study of Liver Disease and the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease. The discovery of the responsible gene ATP7B has made the molecular diagnosis feasible through genetic testing and sequencing of the gene.

Genetic analysis revealed single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes CCM2 and CCM3, associated with cavernous malformations, and homozygote mutation in the ATP7B gene, responsible for Wilson disease. FCCMs were symptomatic in 3 generations. The patient also had multiple lipomatosis, which is suggested to be a familial syndrome. In recent years there has been an increasing amount of publications linking FCCMs with other pathology, predominantly with extracranial and intracranial mesenchymal anomalies. The present study is the description of an unusual association between 2 independent hereditary diseases of confirmed genetic origin-a combination that has not been described previously.
36343759		Botulinum toxin type A treatment of four cases of Wilson disease with lower limb dystonia: A prospective study.Botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) has been recommended in various neurological disorders as a useful tool for alleviating dystonia. In Wilson disease (WD) patients with dystonia, BoNT-A injection can be used as a treatment modality when conventional treatment is ineffective for alleviating symptoms. The purpose of this study was to thoroughly evaluate the efficacy of BoNT-A injection in treating WD complicated by lower extremity dystonia. The efficacy of these injections was assessed by clinical scales, surface electromyography (EMG), and gait analysis. A comparative analysis of all gait parameters, EMG parameters, and clinical scales revealed a significant increase in velocity, decrease in integrated EMG (iEMG), and improvement in modified Ashworth scale (MAS), Burke Fahn Marsden (BFM), and activities of daily living (ADL) scores (all P < 0.05). Overall, our findings indicated that BoNT-A injection led to marked relief of symptoms in patients with WD with lower extremity dystonia.

Particularly, when POA is the only complaint of a WD patient for a long time, there would be misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis and then treatment delay. PATIENT CONCERNS AND DIAGNOSIS: Two Chinese Han siblings were diagnosed as WD by corneal K-F rings, laboratory test, and mutation analysis. They presented with isolated POA during the first 2 decades or more of their disease course, and were of missed diagnosis during that long time. The older affected sib became disabled due to his severe osteoarthritis when he was as young as 38 years old. Two compound heterozygous pathogenic variants c.2790_2792del and c.2621C>T were revealed in the ATP7B gene through targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS). LESSONS: Adolescent-onset POA could be the only complaint of WD individual for at least 2 decades. Long delay in the treatment of WD's POA could lead to disability in early adulthood. Detailed physical examination, special biochemical test, and genotyping through targeted NGS should greatly reduce diagnosis delay in atypical WD patients with isolated POA phenotype.

Early diagnosis and therapy can result in good prognosis of WD. Thus, it is highly recommended to perform familial screening. In this study, we aimed to investigate the range of familial screening of children with WD and determine the appropriate screening methods.We enrolled 20 children with WD and 50 family members of each of these patients (40 parents and 10 siblings). All the subjects underwent a physical examination, Kayser-Fleischer (K-F) rings in the cornea, abdominal ultrasonography (Abdl Ur), cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), serum ceruloplasmin, serum copper, 24-hour urine copper, blood alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), and ATP7B gene.Two new patients with presymptomatic WD (1 mother and 1 brother) in 2 families were found by screening. They had no clinical symptoms and K-F rings in corneal. Biochemical examination indicated decreased serum ceruloplasmin and serum copper in the mother and decreased serum ceruloplasmin in the brother. Gene sequencing revealed compound heterozygous mutations in them. In addition, 48 heterozygous carriers of Wilson disease (WHDzc) were found in this study. The levels of ceruloplasmin and serum copper in patients of WD were significantly less than WHDzc and 24-hour urinary copper were significantly higher than WHDzc (P = .000). The biochemical profiles of WD and WDHzc overlapped in range of 0.8 to 1.5 g/L in ceruloplasmin, above 9 mumol/L in serum copper and below 100 mug/24 h in urinary copper. Gene sequencing showed 2 pathological mutations in all patients with WD and 1 pathological mutation in all WDHzc.Not only siblings but also the previous generation of children probands with WD should be screened. Genetic testing should be conducted for the diagnosis of presymptomatic patients with WD.
28433114	associate|@CHEMICAL_Copper|@DISEASE_Hepatolenticular_Degeneration	Hepatic features of Wilson disease.In Wilson disease (WD) defective AT7B function leads to biliary copper excretion and pathologic copper accumulation, particularly in liver and brain, where it induces cellular damage. Liver disease most often precedes neurologic or psychiatric manifestations. In most patients with neurologic or psychiatric symptoms there is some degree of liver disease at the time of disease presentation. Hepatic manifestations of WD can be extremely variable. Patients with clinically asymptomatic WD are often found by family screening or identified on routine laboratory testing. Others may have a clinical picture of chronic active hepatitis or of end-stage liver disease with cirrhosis. A minority present with acute liver failure, often on the background of advanced fibrosis. Complications from liver disease may be related to portal hypertension and concomitant liver disease may accelerate the course of liver disease. Liver cancer may occur in patients with WD, most commonly when cirrhosis and inflammation are present. The prognosis of patients with WD is excellent, especially for those without cirrhosis at the time of diagnosis, but requires timely initiation of appropriate therapy specific for WD and for the patient's liver disease independent of WD.

There is no study correlating Cu-induced excitotoxicity, apoptosis, and astrocytic reaction with memory dysfunction. We report excitotoxicity, apoptosis, and astrocytic reaction of the hippocampus and frontal cortex with memory dysfunction in rat model of Cu toxicity. Thirty-six rats were divided into group I (control) and group II (100 mg/kgBwt/day CuSO4 orally). Y-maze was performed for memory and learning at 0, 30, 60, and 90 days. Frontal and hippocampal free Cu concentration, oxidative stress markers [glutathione (GSH), total antioxidant toxicity (TAC), and malondialdehyde (MDA)], and glutamate were measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy, spectrophotometry, and ELISA, respectively. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) NR1, NR2A, and NR2B were done by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Immunohistochemistry for caspase-3 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were done and quantified using the ImageJ software. The glutamate level in hippocampus was increased, and NMDAR expression was decreased at 30, 60, and 90 days in group II compared to group I. In the frontal cortex, glutamate was increased at 90 days, but NMDARs were not significantly different in group II compared to group I. Caspase-3 and GFAP expressions were also higher in group II compared to group I, and these changes were more marked in hippocampus than frontal cortex. These changes correlated with respective free tissue Cu, oxidative stress, and Y-maze attention score. Cu toxicity induces apoptosis and astrocytosis of the hippocampus and frontal cortex through direct or glutamate and oxidative stress pathways, and results in impaired memory and learning.
29723692		A Learning Collaborative Approach Increases Specificity of Diagnosis of Acute Liver Failure in Pediatric Patients.BACKGROUND & AIMS: Many pediatric patients with acute liver failure (PALF) do not receive a specific diagnosis (such as herpes simplex virus or Wilson disease or fatty acid oxidation defects)-they are left with an indeterminate diagnosis and are more likely to undergo liver transplantation, which is contraindicated for some disorders. Strategies to facilitate complete diagnostic testing should increase identification of specific liver diseases and might reduce liver transplantation. We investigated whether performing recommended age-specific diagnostic tests (AS-DTs) at the time of hospital admission reduces the percentage PALFs with an indeterminate diagnosis. METHODS: We performed a multinational observational cohort study of 658 PALF participants in the United States and Canada, enrolled at 10 medical centers, during 3 study phases from December 1999 through December 2014. A learning collaborative approach was used to implement AS-DT using an electronic medical record admission order set at hospital admission in phase 3 of the study. Data from 10 study sites participating in all 3 phases were compared before (phases 1 and 2) and after (phase 3) diagnostic test recommendations were inserted into electronic medical record order sets. RESULTS: The percentage of subjects with an indeterminate diagnosis decreased significantly between phases 1-2 (48.0%) and phase 3 (to 30.8%) (P = .0003). The 21-day cumulative incidence rates for liver transplantation were significantly different among phase 1 (34.6%), phase 2 (31.9%), and phase 3 (20.2%) (P = .030). The 21-day cumulative incidence rates for death did not differ significantly among phase 1 (17.9%), phase 2 (11.9%), and phase 3 (11.3%) (P = .20). CONCLUSIONS: In a multinational study of children with acute liver failure, we found that incorporating diagnostic test recommendations into electronic medical record order sets accessed at time of admission reduced the percentage with an indeterminate diagnosis that may have reduced liver transplants without increasing mortality. Widespread use of this approach could significantly enhance care of acute liver failure in children.

The objective of the study was to comparatively assess two clinical rating scales for WD, the Unified Wilson's Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS) and the Global Assessment Scale for Wilson's disease (GAS for WD), and to test the feasibility of the patient reported part of the UWDRS neurological subscale (termed the "minimal UWDRS"). METHODS: In this prospective, monocentric, cross-sectional study, 65 patients (median age 35 [range: 15-62] years; 33 female, 32 male) with treated WD were scored according to the two rating scales. RESULTS: The UWDRS neurological subscore correlated with the GAS for WD Tier 2 score (r = 0.80; p < 0.001). Correlations of the UWDRS hepatic subscore and the GAS for WD Tier 1 score with both the Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score (r = 0.44/r = 0.28; p < 0.001/p = 0.027) and the Child-Pugh score (r = 0.32/r = 0.12; p = 0.015/p = 0.376) were weak. The "minimal UWDRS" score significantly correlated with the UWDRS total score (r = 0.86), the UWDRS neurological subscore (r = 0.89), and the GAS for WD Tier 2 score (r = 0.86). CONCLUSIONS: The UWDRS neurological and psychiatric subscales and the GAS for WD Tier 2 score are valuable tools for the clinical assessment of WD patients. The "minimal UWDRS" is a practical prescreening tool outside scientific trials.

The aim of our study is to determine the performance of REC for the diagnosis of Wilson disease in a population of patients with chronic liver diseases. METHODS: Measuring of exchangeable serum copper levels and relative exchangeable copper was performed in a group of Wilson disease patients at diagnosis or at clinical deterioration because of non-compliance (group 1, n=9), a group of stable WD patients (group 2, n=40), and two groups of patients (adult and paediatric) followed for non-Wilsonian liver diseases (group 3, n=103 and group 4, n=49 respectively). RESULTS: Exchangeable serum copper (N: 0.6-1.1 mumol/L) was significantly higher in group 1 (mean 2.2+-0.7 mumol/L) compared to the other three groups: group 2=0.9+-0.4 mumol/L, group 3=1.2+-0.4 mumol/L, group 4=1.1+-0.3 mumol/L (P<0.05). Relative exchangeable copper was significantly higher in Wilson disease patients group 1 and 2 (mean 52.6% and 43.8%) compared to patients suffering from other liver diseases (mean 7.1% and 5.9%) (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that the determination of relative exchangeable copper is a highly valuable tool for the diagnosis of Wilson disease.
31161407	associate|@CHEMICAL_Copper|@DISEASE_Copper_Toxicosis_Idiopathic	Idiopathic copper toxicosis: is abnormal copper metabolism a primary cause of this disease?Idiopathic copper toxicosis (ICT) is characterized by marked copper deposition, Mallory-Denk body (MDB) formation and severe hepatic injury. Although the characteristics are apparently different from Wilson disease, large amounts of copper accumulate in the liver of the patients. We extensively treated a patient with ICT to reduce the body copper, however, the patient needed liver transplantation. Previous liver biopsy revealed high copper content. But extirpated liver contained an extremely small amount of copper, although MDBs and severe inflammation remained. These phenomena suggest abnormal copper metabolism is not the principle cause of ICT but some other abnormality must exist.

How to safely pass the critical period to liver transplantation is still a big challenge to doctors especially to pediatricians facing more difficult situations in blood purification. Here, we report about a 7-year-old child (weight 21 kg) presenting with severe hemolysis and impending ALF that made a rapid recovery with prompt initiation of plasmapheresis combined with continuous plasma filtration adsorption (CPFA) and chelation therapy. Rapidly efficient removal of copper, bilirubin, and albumin-binding toxins by hybrid blood purification alleviated hemolysis and liver injury and successfully bridged the patient over the critical period to late liver transplantation. Moreover, a review of the literature was performed examining the use of plasmapheresis, molecular adsorbent recirculation system, single-pass albumin dialysis, and continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration in Wilson disease. The experience of our case points to that plasmapheresis combined with CPFA treatment can improve clinical symptoms and bridge children over through Wilsonian crisis to late live transplantation, and CPFA treatment is feasible and safe in children weighing more than 20 kg.

We herein report a novel endoscopic finding in three men with Wilson disease. These patients underwent upper endoscopy due to gastrointestinal symptoms or during follow-up. In each case, endoscopy revealed lustrous white erosions surrounded by an erythematous mucosa in the greater curvature of the gastric body. A biopsy of the lesions showed orcein-positive tissue, indicating copper deposition, in the interstitial stroma and fundic glands of the mucosa. All patients had been receiving treatment with zinc acetate. These endoscopic findings might have been related to the cytotoxicity of the accumulated copper and zinc acetate.
38317346		Challenges faced in establishing a pediatric liver transplant program in a lower-middle-income country with free healthcare service.BACKGROUND: Liver transplant is the cure for children with liver failure. Sri Lanka is a lower-middle-income country with a predominant free, state health system. Pediatric liver transplant program in Sri Lanka is still in the budding state where the initial experience of the program is yet to be documented. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed including the clinical characteristics of all pediatric liver transplant recipients of Colombo North Centre for Liver Diseases since the inception of the program from June 2020 to May 2023. RESULTS: There were 14 PLT performed in 3 years. The median recipient age and weight were 8 years (6 months-15 years) and 23.3 kg (6.4-49.2), respectively. The majority were boys (64%). All were from low-income backgrounds. Indications for LT were acute liver failure (5/14), decompensated chronic liver disease (5/14), and acute on chronic liver failure (4/14). Underlying liver diseases were Wilson disease (6/14), autoimmune liver disease (3/14), biliary atresia (2/14) and progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 (1/14), and unknown etiology (2/14). The majority were living donor liver transplants (86%). Of the living donors, 42% (5/12) were Buddhist priests. There were three immediate deaths and two late deaths. The 3-month survival was 78%, and overall survival was 64%. Living donor transplants carried a higher success rate (92%) compared to diseased donor transplants (0%; 2/2). CONCLUSIONS: Initial experience of pediatric liver transplant program of Sri Lanka is promising despite being established in a free healthcare system amidst the crisis circumstances.
28433103		Liver transplantation for Wilson disease.Liver transplantation (LT) is a life-saving and curative treatment for Wilson disease (WD), providing restoration of function of the liver and mitigation of portal hypertension. Indications for LT in patients with WD include acute liver failure or end-stage liver disease not treatable by medical therapy. LT is also used to treat hepatocellular carcinoma when it develops in patients with WD when tumor resection is not feasible. LT solely for neurologic or psychiatric WD remains controversial. Living liver donation as well as cadaveric orthotopic and auxiliary LT are options for transplantation for WD. Outcomes for LT for WD are excellent, and supportive measures while awaiting transplantation help bridge the patient to a more successful outcome. Future hepatocyte or stem cell transplantation may augment or supplant current LT for WD.

However, the size of the genome (5.2 kilobases [kb]) surpasses the optimal packaging capacity of the vector, which resulted in low-yield production; in addition, further analyses in WD female mice and in animals with a more advanced disease revealed reduced therapeutic efficacy, as compared to younger males. To improve efficacy of the treatment, an optimized shorter AAV vector was generated, in which four out of six metal-binding domains (MBDs) were deleted from the ATP7B coding sequence, giving rise to the miniATP7B protein (Delta57-486-ATP7B). In contrast to AAV8-ATP7B, AAV8-miniATP7B could be produced at high titers and was able to restore copper homeostasis in 6- and 12-week-old male and female WD mice. In addition, a recently developed synthetic AAV vector, AAVAnc80, carrying the miniATP7B gene was similarly effective at preventing liver damage, restoring copper homeostasis, and improving survival 1 year after treatment. Transduction of approximately 20% of hepatocytes was sufficient to normalize copper homeostasis, suggesting that corrected hepatocytes are acting as a sink to eliminate excess of copper. Importantly, administration of AAVAnc80-miniATP7B was safe in healthy mice and did not result in copper deficiency. Conclusion: In summary, gene therapy using an optimized therapeutic cassette in different AAV systems provides long-term correction of copper metabolism regardless of sex or stage of disease in a clinically relevant WD mouse model. These results pave the way for the implementation of gene therapy in WD patients.
30635331		MR Imaging of the Brain in Neurologic Wilson Disease.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Neurologic Wilson disease is an inherited disease characterized by a copper metabolic disorder that causes damage to many organs, especially the brain. Few studies report the relationships between these neurologic symptoms and MR imaging of the brain. Therefore, we investigated the correlation of brain abnormalities in patients with neurologic Wilson disease with their clinical symptoms, age of onset, and lag time to diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort of 364 patients was recruited in China between January 2003 and December 2017. Age of onset, lag time until diagnosis, and neurologic symptoms were recorded, and cranial MR imaging was performed. Patients were divided into groups within each of these factors for correlation analysis with the MR imaging brain scans. RESULTS: Abnormal signals in the MR imaging brain scans were seen in all 364 cases. Affected regions included the putamen, pons, midbrain, and thalamus, while the medulla and occipital lobe were unaffected. The putamen was the most frequently damaged brain region in this study. With the age of onset younger than 10 years, cranial MR imaging scans showed only impairment in the putamen. Patients with a longer lag time before diagnosis were more likely to have impairment in the pons, midbrain, and cortex. Among neurologic symptoms of Wilson disease, torsion spasm is associated with the midbrain and cortex, and choreoathetosis is related to the caudate nucleus. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormalities in the putamen, pons, midbrain, and thalamus are part of the neuroimaging spectrum of Wilson disease. There is a significant correlation between the site of brain injury and diagnosis lag time.

Subjects with only one mutation may show clinical signs and individuals with biallelic changes may remain asymptomatic. We aimed to achieve a conclusive genetic diagnosis for 34 patients clinically diagnosed of WD. Genetic analysis comprised from analysis of exons to WES (whole exome sequencing), including promoter, introns, UTRs (untranslated regions), besides of study of large deletions/duplications by MLPA (multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification). Biallelic ATP7B mutations were identified in 30 patients, so that four patients were analyzed using WES. Two affected siblings resulted to be compound heterozygous for mutations in CCDC115, which is involved in a form of congenital disorder of glycosylation. In sum, the majority of patients with a WD phenotype carry ATP7B mutations. However, if genetic diagnosis is not achieved, additional genes should be considered because other disorders may mimic WD.
33663358		Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure in Children: A Single-Center Experience.OBJECTIVES: Acute-on-chronic liver failure and its outcomes have not yet been evaluated in detail in children. We aimed to evaluate the etiology, acute events, and prognostic factors of acute-on-chronic liver failure in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pediatric patients (age 2-18 years) diagnosed with acute-on-chronic liver failure between April 2014 and April 2020 were evaluated retrospectively. Acute-on-chronic liver failure was defined as the presence of acute hepatic insult in previously diagnosed or undiagnosed chronic liver disease causing jaundice (total serum bilirubin >=5 mg/dL) and coagulopathy (international normalized ratio of >=2.0) and clinical and/or radiological ascites and/or hepatic encephalopathy within 4 weeks. Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure Research Consortium and Chronic Liver Failure-Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores were calculated for patients at first admission and at end of day 5 or before liver transplant. RESULTS: Our study included 29 patients. Underlying chronic liver diseases were mostly autoimmune hepatitis (51.72%) and Wilson disease (27.58%), with flare-ups of these diseases also the most common acute events (48.28% and 27.58%, respectively). Seven patients (24.14%) received liver transplants. At first admission, Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure Research Consortium and Chronic Liver Failure-Sequential Organ Failure Assessment cut-off scores to predict liver transplant were 7.5 and 6.5; at end of day 5 or before transplant, cut-off scores were 8.5 and 7.5, respectively. The 8.5 cut-off score on day 5 was the most specific and sensitive to predict liver transplant. International normalized ratio cut-off of 3.04 predicted transplant requirement with maximum sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Wilson disease and autoimmune hepatitis were the most common underlying chronic and acute events of acute-on-chronic liver failure in children. Although an Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure Research Consortium score >= 8.5 best predicted liver transplant, for patients with scores >= 7.5 and being followed in a nontransplant center, patient referral to a transplant center is appropriate.
30888628		AARC-ACLF score: best predictor of outcome in children and adolescents with decompensated Wilson disease.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Doubts have been raised about efficacy of New Wilson's index (NWI) in predicting Liver Transplant (LT) or mortality in decompensated Wilson Disease (WD) patients. APASL ACLF Research Consortium (AARC) has introduced a new score (AARC-ACLF) which has not been studied in children. METHODS: Data of all pediatric WD cases were prospectively collected and analyzed. Cox regression and Area Under Receiver Operative Curve (AUROC) analyses were used to identify best predictive score for mortality at 90 days. RESULTS: Sixty-six confirmed cases of decompensated WD, 39 (59%) improved on medical management and 27 (41%) either died (20) or were transplanted (7). Among those with NWI >= 11 (42/66 cases) 19 survived versus those with NWI < 11 (24/66), 4 died. NWI (HR 1.23, 95% CI 1.07-1.42, p = 0.005), AARC-ACLF (HR 1.66, 95% CI 1.34-2.05, p = 0.000) and Chronic Liver Failure-Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score also known as CLIF-SOFA (HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.13-1.50, p = 0.000) were all significantly associated with death on univariate Cox regression analysis. On comparative evaluation of the predictive scores in the present cohort, the highest positive (6.02) and lowest negative (0.09) likelihood ratios as well as highest accuracy (87.88%) revealed AARC-ACLF as the best predictor of mortality. AARC-ACLF had the best predictability with AUROC of 0.939 and the minimum standard error of 0.027. For every unit increase in AARC-ACLF score, there is likelihood of 66% increase in 90 day mortality. The optimal cutoff for the AARC-ACLF score to predict mortality was 11 or more. CONCLUSION: AARC-ACLF is the best score for the prediction of mortality at 90 days in decompensated WD cases.

32401363		Diagnostic Performance of Ultrasound Elastography and Serologic Fibrosis Indices for Evaluation of Hepatic Involvement in Wilson Disease.OBJECTIVES: To investigate the diagnostic value of transient elastography (TE), 2-dimensional (2D) shear wave elastography (SWE), and the serologic fibrosis indices aspartate transaminase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score for Wilson disease (WD). METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients with a diagnosis of WD who underwent TE and 2D SWE on the same day. Their APRI and FIB-4 scores were calculated. Hepatic involvement was classified into 5 clinical categories (I-V) based on the laboratory findings, hepatic morphologic characteristics on ultrasound (US) imaging, and clinical symptoms of cirrhosis: I, normal (n = 17); II, only biochemical abnormality (n = 15); III, altered hepatic morphologic characteristics (n = 10); IV, compensated liver cirrhosis (n = 3); and V, decompensated liver cirrhosis (n = 0). We compared the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) data for TE, 2D SWE, the APRI, and the FIB-4 score. A combined assessment of the serologic markers and US elastography was performed, and the AUROCs of the combinations were compared. RESULTS: Forty-five patients were included in the study (median age, 16.0 years; range, 3-35 years). Transient elastography, 2D SWE, and APRI were comparable in distinguishing the clinical categories (AUROC, 0.799-0.928). The FIB-4 score showed lower diagnostic value in distinguishing clinical category I from the other categories (AUROC, 0.647). Combining the serologic markers and US elastography significantly increased the AUROC value of the FIB-4 score (with TE and 2D SWE, P = .01 and .02). CONCLUSIONS: Transient elastography and 2D SWE showed excellent diagnostic accuracy for differentiating the clinical categories of hepatic involvement. The APRI showed better diagnostic performance than the FIB-4 score. The assessment of hepatic manifestations in WD can be improved by combining US elastography with serologic indices.
33785637		Alternative Etiologies of Liver Disease in Children With Suspected NAFLD.OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of alternative causes of liver disease in a cohort of youth with overweight and obesity undergoing evaluation for suspected nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). METHODS: Multicenter, retrospective cohort study of patients aged <=18 years with overweight and obesity and evidence of elevated serum aminotransferases and/or hepatic steatosis on imaging, referred for suspected NAFLD to Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (2009-2017) or Yale New Haven Children's Hospital (2012-2017). Testing was performed to exclude the following: autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), Wilson disease, viral hepatitis (B and C), thyroid dysfunction, celiac disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, and hemochromatosis. RESULTS: A total of 900 children with overweight and obesity (63% boys, 26% Hispanic ethnicity) were referred, with a median age of 13 years (range: 2-18). Most had severe obesity (n = 666; 76%) with a median BMI z score of 2.45 (interquartile range [IQR]: 2.2-2.7). Median alanine aminotransferase level at presentation was 64 U/L (IQR: 42-95). A clinically indicated liver biopsy was performed in 358 children (40%) at a median of 6 months (IQR: 1-14) post initial visit; of those, 46% had confirmed nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Positive autoantibodies were observed in 13% of the cohort, but none met criteria for AIH. Only 19 (2%) were found to have other causes of liver disease, with no cases of viral hepatitis or Wilson disease detected. CONCLUSIONS: In a large, multicenter cohort, the vast majority of children with overweight and obesity with presumed or confirmed NAFLD tested negative for other causes of liver disease. In contrast to a previous pediatric report, no patient was diagnosed with AIH.

Forty-three consecutive patients with NWD from a tertiary care teaching hospital were evaluated prospectively who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The neuropsychiatric evaluation was done using Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) battery that assesses 12 domains including delusion, hallucination, agitation/aggression, dysphoria/depression, anxiety, euphoria, apathy, disinhibition, irritability, aberrant motor activity, appetite change, and abnormal nighttime behavior. Cranial MRI was done using a 3 T machine, and locations of signal changes were noted including the total number of MRI lesions. Serum glutamate level was measured by a fluorescence microplate reader. Abnormal NPI in various domains and total NPI scores were correlated with MRI lesions, serum and urinary copper, and glutamate level. The median age of the patients was 16 years. Forty-one (48.8%) patients had cognitive impairment and 37 (86%) had movement disorder. Neurobehavioral abnormality was detected in all-commonest being agitation (90.7%) followed by appetite change (81.4%), elation (74.4%), irritability (69.8%), anxiety (67.4%), depression (65.1%), apathy (44.2%), night time abnormal behavior (32.6%), aberrant motor behavior (20.9%), delusions (16.3%), and hallucination (18.6%). The thalamic lesion was associated with depression, globus pallidus with depression and anxiety, caudate with anxiety and agitation, brainstem with irritability, and frontal cortex with apathy. Serum glutamate level was higher in NWD. NPI sum score correlated with MRI load and glutamate level. Varying severity of neurobehavioral abnormalities are common in the patients with NWD and correlate with the location of MRI lesion and glutamate level.

Thus far, three functional classes of CRMs have been described: inhibitors of acetyltransferases (such as spermidine), inhibitors of acetyl coenzyme (AcCoA) synthesis (such as hydroxycitrate) and activators of deacetylases/sirtuins (such as resveratrol). Triethylenetetramine (also called trientine, abbreviated TETA) is a synthetic polyamine with resemblance in its structure to spermidine, a natural polyamine reputed for its pro-autophagic, anti-obesity and anti-aging effects. TETA, which is approved for the treatment of Wilson disease, has no effects on the longevity of mice, yet does induce autophagy and reduces weight gain in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Mechanistically, these effects of TETA involve an increased activity of the TETA-metabolizing enzyme, SAT1 (spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase 1). SAT1 overactivation ultimately results in the depletion of intracellular AcCoA with a consequent de-acetylation of cytoplasmic proteins and induction of autophagy. Accordingly, TETA fails to induce autophagy or to control HFD-induced weight gain in SAT1-deficient mice. Altogether, these findings indicate that TETA induces autophagy through a novel mode of action, namely, by the activation of an AcCoA-depleting enzyme.
34908013		Re-evaluation of King Wilson Index in Children With Acutely Decompensated Hepatic Wilson Disease.OBJECTIVES: Liver transplantation (LT) in Wilson disease (WD) is a life-saving option for patients presenting with liver failure and encephalopathy. Patients without encephalopathy can avoid LT and treated successfully with chelation therapy. It is essential to predict the risk of fatal outcomes where LT is required. We aim to critically analyse the validity of the WD Index prospectively from a cohort of WD patients managed at our institution. METHODS: WD Index and other clinical data from 2005 to 2018, recorded prospectively as part of clinical management, were analysed. RESULTS: Over 13-year period, 52 children with WD (29 boys) with median age at diagnosis of 11.69 (range 3.92-17.26) years were studied. Of these, 17 were diagnosed as part of family screening, 17 presented with abnormal liver enzyme, and 18 with acute hepatic decompensation (AHD) as per PALF definition. Patients presented with abnormal liver enzyme and in the pre-symptomatic group had WD Index <11, and none of them required LT. WD Index is still a good predictor for LT in WD patients with AHD, providing a sensitivity of 80%, specificity of 100%, positive-predictive, and negative-predictive value of 100% and 80%, respectively. Patients presented with an index of 8-10 also required LT at median duration of 58 days (IQR 48-135 days). CONCLUSIONS: WD patients presenting with AHD who had an index of >=11 do require LT. Children with a WD Index of 8 to 10 within the first 2 months of admission require close monitoring as LT may become necessary.

In neurological disorders, astrocyte disintegration leads to the release of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) from tissue into the bloodstream. Elevated serum levels of GFAP can serve as blood biomarkers, and a useful prognostic tool to facilitate the early diagnosis of several neurological diseases ranging from stroke to neurodegenerative disorders. This systematic review synthesizes studies published between January 2012 and September 2021 that used GFAP as a potential blood biomarker to detect neurological disorders. The following electronic databases were accessed: MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science. In all the databases, the following search strategy was used:  GFAP  OR  glial fibrillary acidic protein  AND  neurological  OR  neurodegenerative  AND  plasma  OR  serum . The initial search identified 1152 articles. After the exclusion criteria were applied, 48 publications that reported GFAP levels in neurological disorders were identified. A total of16 different neurological disorders that have plasmatic GFAP levels as a possible biomarker for the disease were described in the articles, being: multiple sclerosis, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson disease, COVID-19, epileptic seizures, Wilson Disease, diabetic ketoacidosis, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, major depressive disorder, glioblastoma, spinal cord injury, asthma, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and Friedreich's ataxia. Our review shows an association between GFAP levels and the disease being studied, suggesting that elevated GFAP levels are a potentially valuable diagnostic biomarker in the evaluation of different neurological diseases.
37347440		Pediatric Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure.Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is characterized by an acute hepatic insult happening in a patient with underlying cirrhosis with compromised hepatic reserve leading to development of systemic inflammation, sepsis, and organ failure resulting in poor outcome in majority. While Asia Pacific Association for Study of Liver Diseases (APASL) emphasizes on early diagnosis before development of organ failure, European Association for Study of Liver Diseases (EASL) mandates the presence of organ failures to define ACLF. There is a lack of consensus definition of pediatric ACLF although recent APASL guidelines have tried to address the issue. While Wilson disease (WD) and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) are the most common cause of underlying cirrhosis in children, acute viral hepatitis and flares of WD and AIH are the commonest acute precipitating events. Poor outcomes [death and liver transplantation (LT)] ranging from 19 to 59% have been reported. Prognosis in pediatric ACLF is usually better than that in adults due to greater proportion of treatable etiologies, lesser organ failures, comorbidities and better hepatic reserves. APASL ACLF Research Consortium (AARC) score more than or equal to 11 is predictive of poor 28-90 d mortality. Treatment of pediatric ACLF relies mainly on prompt diagnosis and medical management of a potentially treatable etiology of underlying cirrhosis. Bridging therapies, especially high volume plasma exchange can be initiated early as a bridge to LT or native liver recovery. Those with no improvement in 4-7 d should undergo LT before development of sepsis or multi-organ failure.
32726213		A Rare Constrictive Pericarditis with Complete Separation between the Visceral and Parietal Pericardium: A Case Report.BACKGROUND: Pericarditis is the most common form of pericardial disease, while constrictive pericarditis is challenging in diagnosis and is easily overlooked. CASE REPORT: A 30-year-old female presented with abdominal distension and mild lower extremity edema for 3 months. The patient was initially suspected of having cirrhosis caused by Wilson Disease. Following liver biopsy and multiple investigation, thickened, calcified pericardium was detected by echocardiography and chest computed tomography. The patient was finally diagnosed with chronic constrictive pericarditis and received pericardiectomy. Intraoperatively, we found that the heart was entirely constricted by the thickened and calcified visceral pericardium, which was completely separated from the parietal pericardium. The patient received successful pericardiectomy and had relief of symptoms after surgery. CONCLUSION: Patients with constrictive pericarditis may present with symptoms similar to that of chronic liver diseases, which makes it difficult and complicated for diagnosis. This case highlights the importance of comprehensive preoperative evaluation and maintaining clinical suspicion of pericarditis in patients with features of elevated systemic venous pressure. In addition, constrictive pericarditis with complete separation between visceral and parietal pericardium has seldom been reported.
32398357		Liver transplantation as a rescue therapy for severe neurologic forms of Wilson disease.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of liver transplantation (LT) in patients with Wilson disease (WD) with severe neurologic worsening resistant to active chelation. METHODS: French patients with WD who underwent LT for pure neurologic indication were retrospectively studied. Before LT and at the last follow-up, neurologic impairment was evaluated with the Unified Wilson's Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS) score, disability with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score, and hepatic function with the Model for End-stage Liver Disease score, together with the presence of a Kayser-Fleischer ring (KFR), brain MRI scores, and copper balance. The survival rate and disability at the last follow-up were the coprimary outcomes; evolution of KFR and brain MRI were the secondary outcomes. Prognosis factors were further assessed. RESULTS: Eighteen patients had LT. All were highly dependent before LT (median mRS score 5). Neurologic symptoms were severe (median UWDRS score 105), dominated by dystonia and parkinsonism. The cumulated survival rate was 88.8% at 1 year and 72.2% at 3 and 5 years. At the last follow-up, 14 patients were alive. Their mRS and UWDRS scores improved (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0003). Eight patients had a major improvement (78% decrease of the UWDRS score), 4 a moderate one (41% decrease), and 2 a stable status. KFR and brain MRI scores improved (p = 0.0007). Severe sepsis (p = 0.011) and intensive care unit admission (p = 0.001) before LT were significantly associated with death. CONCLUSIONS: LT is a rescue therapeutic option that should be carefully discussed in selected patients with neurologic WD resistant to anticopper therapies (chelators or zinc salts) as it might allow patients to gain physical independency with a reasonable risk. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class IV evidence that for patients with WD with severe neurologic worsening resistant to active pharmacologic therapy, LT might decrease neurologic impairment.
37565896	associate|@DISEASE_Thrombosis|@GENE_SERPINE1	Acute mesenteric ischemia secondary to superior mesenteric vein thrombosis in a patient with liver cirrhosis: A case report.RATIONALE: Acute mesenteric ischemia due to superior mesenteric vein (SMV) thrombosis is a rare yet potentially life-threatening emergency. Our case report explores this condition in the context of a patient with liver cirrhosis due to Wilson disease. We specifically highlight the complex derangement of the coagulative balance in liver cirrhosis. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 34-year-old female with Wilson disease-related cirrhosis presented with intractable abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting that showed no response to antispasmodic medication. DIAGNOSES: A contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography scan and Doppler ultrasound confirmed an intraluminal filling defect in the SMV, leading to the diagnosis of SMV thrombosis. INTERVENTIONS: Prompt anticoagulation, intravenous fluids, and an antibiotic were initiated. Surgical consultation recommended conservative therapy with close monitoring. OUTCOMES: Over the following 2 days, the patient's condition improved considerably, with almost complete resolution of her symptoms. Genetic testing identified a 4G/4G homozygous genotype of the plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 gene, associated with a higher risk of thrombosis in the vessels of internal organs. After 2 months of sustained anticoagulant therapy, a follow-up contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan revealed near-complete recanalization of the SMV, and the patient remained symptom-free. LESSONS: This case underscores the importance of early detection and treatment of acute mesenteric ischemia in patients with liver cirrhosis, as well as the potential role of genetic factors in thrombosis.
31653639	associate|@DISEASE_Hepatolenticular_Degeneration|@GENE_CP ;cause|@CHEMICAL_Alcohols|@DISEASE_Liver_Diseases ;cause|@CHEMICAL_Alcohols|@DISEASE_Acute_Kidney_Injury	Wilson disease: a diagnostic challenge in a patient with alcoholic liver disease.A 32-year-old man with alcoholic cirrhosis presented with worsening abdominal distension and jaundice. He was diagnosed with cirrhosis 2 years prior after a hospitalisation for acute liver failure, during which viral, autoimmune and metabolic workup was unrevealing. Heavy alcohol consumption was his only obvious risk factor for liver disease, so his decompensation was attributed to alcohol. At the present time, he was admitted with acute-on-chronic liver failure and acute renal failure. The severity of his presentation and the disproportionately mild elevation in alkaline phosphatase relative to his hyperbilirubinaemia prompted repeating a ceruloplasmin level, which, though previously normal, was now low, and eventually led to a diagnosis of Wilson disease (WD) with concomitant alcoholic liver disease. Clinicians must recognise limitations in ceruloplasmin and copper levels when screening for WD and maintain suspicion for WD in young patients, even if there is an already established aetiology of liver disease.

We aimed to fill a literature gap in this respect by studying urinary abnormalities in children and adolescents with WD. METHODS: This study included 60 children with WD presenting to the Pediatric Hepatology Unit, Cairo University. The following data were retrieved from the patients' files including age, sex, liver function tests, serum ceruloplasmin, 24-h urinary copper, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, urinalysis, urinary albumin/creatinine ratio, urinary calcium/creatinine ratio, urinary beta2-microglobulin, liver and renal biopsy results when available. RESULTS: All studied cases had no symptoms related to renal involvement. Microscopic hematuria was detected in 11% and 12% at baseline and within 5 years of therapy, respectively. Moderate microalbuminuria was detected in 34%, 50%, and 33% at baseline, within 5 years and > 5 years after therapy, respectively. Hypercalciuria was detected in 23% at baseline, 34% in those patients treated for up to 5 years and 37.5% > 5 years of therapy. Age and international normalized ratio were significantly higher in patients with high calcium/creatinine ratio compared with those with normal values at initial evaluation. Frequency of elevated urinary beta2-microglobulin was 36%, 36%, and 37% in patients at baseline, up to 5 years and > 5 years of therapy, respectively. CONCLUSION: Asymptomatic urinary abnormalities are present in patients with WD at any time point of the disease and during treatment with d-penicillamine. They have to be searched for, as early intervention may prevent progression to renal insufficiency.

In this study we first describe on the successful treatment of HCV infection with direct antiviral drugs in patients with Wilson disease. Establishment of all factors of liver damage and successful treatment (elimination of the virus, adequate lifelong medical treatment) allow to expect a favorable prognosis in patients with a combination of Wilson disease and HCV infection.

The copper accumulates in the liver, brain, cornea, kidney, and other organs. This disease should be considered any individual with liver abnormality except infant, any patient older than teenage with neurological (especially for extra pyramidal signs) or neuropsychiatric disorder with or without liver disease and sibling of Wilson disease patient. Typically, a combination of low serum ceruloplasmine levels and high levels of urinary copper contents is sufficient to establish a diagnosis. As other diagnostic tests, measurement of hepatic copper content and ATP7B gene analysis are available. The key strategy of treatment is to reduce the amount of copper in the liver and other tissues by administering both copper-chelating agents, such as D-penicillamine or Trientine, and/or zinc acetate. The author recommend zinc acetate monotherapy for mild to moderate hepatic disorder, Trientine mono therapy for mild to moderate neurologic disorder and combination therapy of Trientine and zinc acetate for sever hepatic or neurologic disorder.

Presented are two cases of neurologic Wilson disease with progressive movement disorder and Kayser-Fleischer rings with low serum copper, low ceruloplasmin, and increased 24-hour urine copper against a background of normal transaminases. Cranial imaging revealed symmetric basal ganglia hyperintensities in T2/FLAIR. More often than not, these cases go unnoticed and misdiagnosed because of its rarity and varied presentation. Extensive workup is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. As for management, the earlier the intervention is initiated, the better prognosis would be for recovery. There are several treatment options which should be tailored to every patient with neurologic Wilson disease. Neurologic Wilson disease is considered as a copper toxicity; immediate diagnostic evaluation and early treatment initiation is a must.

Here, we report on a patient with coexisting WD and OCA, initially presenting episodes of tremors. PATIENT CONCERNS: WD is a disorder of copper metabolism. The main sites of copper accumulation are the liver and the brain, resulting in hepatic symptoms. OCA is a disorder of melanin biosynthesis, characterized by a generalized reduction in pigmentation of the eyes (oculo-), skin (-cutaneous), and hair. DIAGNOSIS: The diagnosis of WD was confirmed by neurological symptoms, metabolism tests, and MRI scans. Interestingly, the patient also had very light skin color, blond hair and eyebrows, and dark brown eyelashes and irises. Because the association of dermatologic signs in WD has rarely been reported, OCA was highly suspected based on these clinical findings. Genetic analysis was subsequently conducted, and the results revealed the p. (Arg778Leu) mutation in 1 allele and the p. (Asn1270Ser) mutation in the other allele of the ATP7B gene, confirming the diagnosis of WD; the p. (D456fs) mutation in 1 allele and the p. (R299H) mutation in the other allele of the TYR gene, confirming the diagnosis of OCA. The family history was positive for WD with a 14-year-old younger brother also being diagnosed with it. Her parents are negative for OCA and WD. INTERVENTIONS: Sodium dimercaptopropanesulfonate (DMPS) was given during hospitalization. D-penicillamine and zinc sulfate treatment was initiated after discharge for long-term control. OUTCOMES: Postural and intention tremor disappeared, and other symptoms and signs markedly improved after treatment. LESSONS: In this study, we reported on the first case of a child who simultaneously presented WD and OCA, bringing up the possibility of a presumable link between these 2 rare diseases.

Yet, there is a huge unexplored potential of molecular imaging to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders in children and provide radiological biomarkers that can be applied clinically. The obstacles in performing PET scans on children include sedation, radiation exposure, and access but, as will be illustrated, these barriers can be easily overcome. This review summarizes findings from PET studies that have been performed over the past three decades on children with various neurodegenerative disorders, including the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, juvenile Huntington disease, Wilson disease, Niemann-Pick disease type C, Dravet syndrome, dystonia, mitochondrial disorders, inborn errors of metabolism, lysosomal storage diseases, dysmyelinating disorders, Rett syndrome, neurotransmitter disorders, glucose transporter Glut 1 deficiency, and Lesch-Nyhan disease. Because positron emission tomographic scans have often been clinically useful and have contributed to the management of these disorders, we suggest that the time has come for glucose metabolism positron emission tomographic scans to be reimbursed by insurance carriers for children with neurodegenerative disorders, and not restricted only to epilepsy surgery evaluation.
29528784	cause|@CHEMICAL_Penicillamine|@DISEASE_Liver_Failure ;treat|@CHEMICAL_Penicillamine|@DISEASE_Nervous_System_Diseases	Wilson disease and lupus nephritis: is it coincidence or a true association?A 12-year-old girl born to third-degree consanguineous parents presented with recurrent episodes of haematuria for 8 months in association with peri-orbital and lower limb oedema for 20 days. There was no jaundice, hepatomegaly or neurological abnormality at presentation. An older brother had died following jaundice at 10 years of age. Urinalysis showed multiple dysmorphic erythrocytes without proteinuria and there was leucopenia, thrombocytopenia and hypo-albuminaemia (23 g/L). C3 component of complementaemia was low and anti-nuclear antibodies and anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies were strongly positive by immunofluorescence. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was considered but the severe hypo-albuminaemia was unexplained. During the pre-renal biopsy work-up, a deranged coagulation profile with raised transaminases prompted evaluation for chronic liver disease which culminated in the diagnosis of Wilson disease. Treatment with penicillamine and immunosuppressants was initiated, but there was neurological deterioration on Day 30 of admission and she died owing to worsening liver failure on the Day 41. Post-mortem liver biopsy demonstrated cirrhosis and post-mortem renal biopsy showed features of class-II lupus nephritis. Auto-immune antibodies and autoimmune disorders have been reported in Wilson disease and there are anecdotal reports of an association of SLE with Wilson disease. However, this case is unique in that lupus nephritis was the presenting manifestation before Wilson disease was diagnosed. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of this association requires further research.

We aim to describe long-term treatment outcomes in the chronic liver disease (CLD) phenotype and evaluate an association with LOF variants. METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective review of WD patients with at least 1 variant in ATP7B. Demographic, biochemical, genetic, and clinical parameters were obtained. The composite clinical endpoint of liver transplantation or death was used for probands with CLD phenotype on chelators. RESULTS: Of 117 patients with hepatic WD: 71 had CLD, 27 had fulminant hepatic failure requiring urgent liver transplantation, and 19 were diagnosed through family screening. Median age at diagnosis was 13.1 (interquartile range, 9.7-17.6) years. In total, 91 variants in ATP7B were identified in the study population. At least 1 LOF variant was present in 60 (51.3%) patients. During median follow-up of 10.7 (interquartile range, 6.7-18.9) years, 10 (14.1%) of the probands with CLD reached the composite endpoint. There was a worse transplant-free survival for patients prescribed chelation therapy in patients with at least 1 LOF variant (P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with WD and CLD phenotype on chelators, who have at least 1 LOF variant in ATP7B, have a worse prognosis during long-term follow up. This subgroup of patients requires close monitoring for signs of progressive liver disease. Sequencing of ATP7B may be used in the diagnosis of WD, and in addition, it may provide useful prognostic information for patients with hepatic WD.

The diagnosis of WD is challenged by its variable clinical course, onset, morbidity, and ATP7B variant type. Currently it is diagnosed by a combination of clinical symptoms/signs, aberrant copper metabolism parameters (e.g., low ceruloplasmin serum levels and high urinary and hepatic copper concentrations), and genetic evidence of ATP7B mutations when available. As early diagnosis and treatment are key to favorable outcomes, it is critical to identify subjects before the onset of overtly detrimental clinical manifestations. To this end, we sought to improve WD diagnosis using artificial neural network algorithms (part of artificial intelligence) by integrating available clinical and molecular parameters. Surprisingly, WD diagnosis was based on plasma levels of glutamate, asparagine, taurine, and Fischer's ratio. As these amino acids are linked to the urea-Krebs' cycles, our study not only underscores the central role of hepatic mitochondria in WD pathology but also that most WD patients have underlying hepatic dysfunction. Our study provides novel evidence that artificial intelligence utilized for integrated analysis for WD may result in earlier diagnosis and mechanistically relevant treatments for patients with WD.

This study sought to investigate the prevalence, manifestation and predictors of myocardial tissue abnormalities in WD patients. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled WD patients and an age-matched group of healthy individuals. We applied cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) to analyze myocardial function, strain, and tissue characteristics. A subgroup analysis of WD patients with predominant neurological (WD-neuro+) or hepatic manifestation only (WD-neuro-) was performed. RESULTS: Seventy-six patients (37 years (27-49), 47% women) with known WD and 76 age-matched healthy control subjects were studied. The prevalence of atrial fibrillation in WD patients was 5% and the prevalence of symptomatic heart failure was 2.6%. Compared to healthy controls, patients with WD had a reduced left ventricular global circumferential strain (LV-GCS), and also showed abnormalities consistent with global and regional myocardial fibrosis. WD-neuro+ patients presented with more severe structural remodeling and functional impairment when compared to WD-neuro- patients. CONCLUSIONS: In a large cohort, WD was not linked to a distinct cardiac phenotype except CMR indexes of myocardial fibrosis. More research is warranted to assess the prognostic implications of these findings. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered at the local institutional ethics committee (S-188/2018).
31898387		Non-invasive diagnosis of cirrhosis and long-term disease monitoring by transient elastography in patients with Wilson disease.BACKGROUND & AIMS: The value of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by transient elastography (TE) for non-invasive fibrosis staging and disease monitoring has not been established in patients with Wilson disease (WD). METHODS: Liver stiffness measurement by TE and non-invasive fibrosis scores (APRI, FIB-4) were analysed from 188 WD patients with liver biopsy (LBX). Longitudinal LSM was performed in 128 (68.1%) patients. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-eight patients (mean age: 35 +- 14 years, 54.8% women; 27.1% with histological cirrhosis) were studied. Forty-four[23.4%] patients were recently diagnosed with WD, while 144[76.6%] were previously diagnosed (>1 year between LBX and LSM). Overall, LSM (11.3 vs 6.1 kPa, P < .001), APRI (0.72 vs 0.38, P < .001) and FIB-4 (1.54 vs 0.89, P < .001) were higher in cirrhotic than in non-cirrhotic patients. This was even more pronounced in recently diagnosed patients (35.2 kPa vs 6.4 kPa, P < .001). Accuracy for diagnosing cirrhosis at an LSM cut-off >=9.9 kPa was better in recently diagnosed (PPV: 74%, NPV: 100%) vs previously diagnosed (PPV: 53%, NPV: 82%) patients. Recently diagnosed patients had higher Area Under the Curve (AUC) for APRI (0.79 vs 0.61) and FIB-4 (0.84 vs 0.65) than previously diagnosed patients. At APRI <1.5 and FIB-4 <3.25 cirrhosis was ruled out with a specificity of 93% and 95% respectively. During a median follow-up of 46 (24-66) months, only 5.9% (5/85) of non-cirrhotic WD patients showed progression to cirrhotic LSM values, while 30.8% (4/13) of cirrhotic WD patients showed LSM suggestive of cirrhosis regression. CONCLUSION: TE-based LSM >=9.9 kPa accurately identifies cirrhosis in WD patients. Next to TE-LSM <9.9 kPa, APRI <1.5 and FIB-4 <3.25 values assist to non-invasively rule out cirrhosis. LSM remains stable in most non-cirrhotic patients on WD therapy, while one-third of cirrhotic patients present clinically relevant decreases in LSM.

Radiolabeled copper has been used for decades in studying basic human and animal copper metabolism and copper-related disorders, such as Wilson disease (WD) and Menke's disease. A recent addition to this toolkit is 64-copper (64Cu) positron emission tomography (PET), combining the accurate anatomical imaging of modern computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners with the biodistribution of the 64Cu PET tracer signal. This allows the in vivo tracking of copper fluxes and kinetics, thereby directly visualizing human and animal copper organ traffic and metabolism. Consequently, 64Cu PET is well-suited for evaluating clinical and preclinical treatment effects and has already demonstrated the ability to diagnose WD accurately. Furthermore, 64Cu PET/CT studies have proven valuable in other scientific areas like cancer and stroke research. The present article shows how to perform 64Cu PET/CT or PET/MR in humans. Procedures for 64Cu handling, patient preparation, and scanner setup are demonstrated here.
32314442		Retrospective analysis of long-term outcome 10 years after liver transplantation for Wilson disease: experience over three decades.We evaluated long-term outcomes for patients with Wilson disease (WD) after liver transplantation (LT) and searched for risk factors for poor survival. Retrospective analysis of UNOS/OPTN data identified 156 pediatric and 515 adult cases of LT for WD between 1987 and 2016. Comparison cases were 10 442 pediatric and 104 874 adult non-WD transplant recipients. Survival was calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Recipient, donor, and surgical variables were compared by Cox regression. Survival rates 3, 5, and 10 years after LT for adult WD patients (87.5%, 85.4%, and 80.5%, respectively) were significantly higher than those for non-WD patients (P < 0.001); survival rates for pediatric WD patients (90.5%, 89.7%, and 86.5%, respectively) did not differ significantly from non-WD patients. Graft survival in adult and pediatric patients followed similar trends. Regression analysis identified older age, female gender, and use of life support at the time of transplant as risk factors for decreased survival for adults with WD, and younger age, male gender, obesity, and high serum creatinine at the time of transplant as risk factors for poor survival in pediatric recipients with WD. Presentation with fulminant liver failure was not associated with survival in WD patients. No donor characteristic predicted poor survival. Long-term patient and graft survival after LT is excellent for both adult and pediatric WD patients.

This is based on nationwide data of drug prescriptions and contractional data of outpatient offices. The prevalence is set in ratio to the found prevalence of prescriptions in Germany. METHOD:  The descriptive evaluation is based on the database of the Central Research Institute of Ambulatory Health Care (Zi) in Germany. Additionally, data of the Federal Office of Statistics regarding inpatient treatment are available. RESULTS:  It can be seen that there is a notable difference between the prevalence of patients undergoing therapy and the patients with verified diagnoses. In total, prevalence is increasing. The incidence on hand and the given dynamic of the patient population could indicate that, possibly, there is an increased rate of misdiagnosis in the first year of diagnosis. According to data, the hepatic form is the more often diagnosed form. The human genetic diagnostic increases, on average, are most distinct.

28433104	cause|@CHEMICAL_Alcohols|@DISEASE_Chemical_and_Drug_Induced_Liver_Injury	Wilson disease: symptomatic liver therapy.Wilson disease leads to symptomatic impairment of liver function or liver cirrhosis. Strict adherence to decoppering agents is essential in these patients. Secondary prevention of additional hepatic damage by avoidance of other toxic substances (e.g., alcohol, drugs) and sufficient calorie intake is recommended. Routine examinations in cirrhotic patients include screening for signs of portal hypertension (esophagus varices), development of ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy. Where varices are present, primary or secondary preventive interventions may include treatment with nonselective beta-blockers or variceal ligation, similar to the approach in patients with liver cirrhosis due to other etiologies. For patients presenting with ascites, diuretics are the treatment of choice. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis can be diagnosed by paracentesis and should be treated with antibiotics. Liver cirrhosis can also lead to accumulation of neurotoxins causing hepatic encephalopathy. It is characterized by unspecific neuropsychiatric impairment and is treated with laxatives and nonresorbable antibiotics. The best prophylaxis is regular defecation. Patients with liver cirrhosis are susceptible for bacterial infections of any cause and sepsis is one of the leading causes of death in these patients. In advanced stages of cirrhosis renal function impairment is a common feature. The hepatorenal syndrome shows a high mortality. Where Wilson disease patients have decompensated liver cirrhosis, liver transplantation should be evaluated.
37204330		Factors affecting activities of daily living among patients with Wilson disease.Wilson disease (WD) is a congenital copper metabolism disorder with various manifestations and can be treated with oral medication. This study examined the factors related to decline in activities of daily living (ADL) in patients with WD as research in this area remains limited. We enrolled 308 patients with WD, including patients who participated in a national survey and those who sought cares at the Department of Pediatrics, Toho University Ohashi Medical Center, from 2016 to 2017. We analyzed the association between ADL decline and factors including age at diagnosis, period from diagnosis to survey, hepatic symptoms, neurological signs, and psychiatric presentation at diagnosis. The relative risks (RRs) for ADL decline were estimated for each factor using multivariate modified Poisson regression analysis. Overall, 97 out of 308 (31.5%) patients experienced ADL decline. After adjusting for explanatory variables, regression analysis revealed that factors significantly associated with ADL decline were a period of >=20 years from diagnosis to survey (adjusted RR = 2.34, 95% CI: 1.47-3.74), hepatic symptoms with splenomegaly (adjusted RR = 2.57, 95% CI: 1.26-5.24), mild neurological signs (adjusted RR = 3.20, 95% CI: 1.96-5.23), and severe neurological signs (adjusted RR = 3.63, 95% CI: 2.28-5.77). Neurological signs, hepatic symptoms with splenomegaly, and a period of 20 years from diagnosis to survey are associated with ADL decline. Thus, careful assessment of patients for these factors is necessary, and these findings may guide future efforts to improve patient prognosis. Neurological signs, hepatic symptoms with splenomegaly, and a period of 20 years from diagnosis to survey are associated with a decline in activities of daily living in patients with Wilson disease.

30059866	associate|@CHEMICAL_Carbon|@CHEMICAL_Metformin	Application of carbon sensors for potentiometric determination of copper(II) in water and biological fluids of Wilson disease patients. Studying the surface reaction using SEM, EDX, IR and DFT.The performance characteristics of a new selective and sensitive modified screen printed electrode (MSPE; electrode I) and carbon paste electrode (MCPE; electrode II) based on 2-N, N-dimethylcarbamimidoyl (metformin) as modifier for the potentiometric determination of copper (II) in water sample, serum and urine samples of Wilson disease patients have been optimized. The chemical reaction which happens between Cu (II) and the modifier on the surface of the sensors was investigated with scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), IR spectra measurement and computational calculations at DFT/B3LYP. The sensors showed perfect potentiometric response for Cu (II) over concentration range of 1.0 x 10-6 - 1.0 x 10-2 and 1.0 x 10-6 - 5.0 x 10-2 mol L-1 with a detection limit of 1.0 x 10-6 mol L-1with divalent slope value 30.2 and 31.8 mV decade-1 over the pH range of 2-6 for MCPE and MSPE, respectively. MSPE was stable with repeatable potential over period of 37 days and exhibits fast response time of 6 and 10 s for MSPE and MCPE, respectively. Also, these sensors exhibited good selectivity towards Cu(II) with respect to other metal ions and have higher antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus as Gram-positive bacteria and Escherichia coli as Gram-negative bacteria. The obtained results using the sensors were in agreement with those obtained using the reported method.

31269566		[Clinical characteristics of patients with delayed hepatolenticular degeneration].Objective: To evaluate the clinical manifestations, metal metabolism, imaging characteristics and treatment response in patients with delayed Wilson disease (WD). Methods: Patients with untreated WD (40 with delayed onset and 40 with non-delayed onset) were enrolled. Twenty healthy people were included as normal controls. All patients were evaluated with modified Young scale neural symptom scores, grade of Child liver function and mental symptoms rating scale, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, magnetic sensitive imaging (susceptibility weighted imaging, SWI), metal metabolism. Corrected phase (CP) was measured at SWI. After 2 week treatment, neurologic symptoms, liver function, and metal metabolism were reviewed. Results: The total score of neurological symptoms in WD patients with delayed onset was lower than that of non-delayed onset (13.00+-6.87 vs. 21.13+-5.53, P=0.033). The scores of SCL-90 and HAMA depression scales in patients with delayed onset were lower than those of non-delayed onset. On T(2) weighted imaging, areas including substantia nigra and thalamus, the caudate nucleus, globus pallidus, putamen presented high signal rate in patients with delated onset than those with non-delayed (P=0.022, 0.037, 0.022, 0.037, 0.029 respectively). The SWI CP values of cangbai sphere and shell nucleus in patients with delayed onset were lower than those with non-delayed onset. Patients with delayed onset had higher urinary copper than those with non-delayed onset before and after treatment (P=0.040, 0.036). After treatment, the score of abnormal tremor and gait in patients with delayed onset was decreased (P=0.037, 0.044), while as the occurrence of neurological symptoms was increased by 10%, and the liver function level in patients with delayed WD was decreased in 3 cases. Conclusions: The brain of WD patients with delayed onset is mainly composed of metal deposits, however the cell damage is not apparent. Clinical symptoms are characterized by significant liver injury, but relatively mild neurological and psychiatric symptoms. Patients with delayed WD have higher urinary copper excretion than those with non-delayed WD. Chelating agents improves the neurological symptoms in patients with delayed onset.

Due to WD's myriad manifestations, its rarity, and its broad range of symptoms, differential diagnosis may be challenging, leading to delays in treatment initiation. This Neuroscience Commentary reviews diagnostic acumen and the latest updates in the field, including key clinical data and novel therapies in late-stage development, all of which ensure optimal management of WD in the coming years.

PFIC3 is characterised by production of hydrophilic bile with lithogenic properties which is harmful to the hepatobiliary epithelia. Chronic cholestasis in some patients may be accompanied by excessive accumulation of copper in the liver and by increased urinary copper excretion, the findings mimicking Wilson disease (WD). METHODS AND RESULTS: We report an 11 y/o male patient with growth retardation, mild craniofacial dysmorphic features and chronic liver disease, initially diagnosed and treated as WD. Whereas genetic testing for WD was negative, further molecular and histopathological analysis revealed two novel mutations (c.833+1G>T and c.1798T>A) in ABCB4 and complete absence of the ABCB4/MDR3 protein in the liver, determining PFIC3 as the correct diagnosis. CONCLUSION: PFIC3 and WD display pleomorphic and sometimes overlapping clinical and laboratory features, which may pose a differential diagnostic problem. Since the patient management in WD and PFIC3 differs significantly, an early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for optimising of therapeutic approach and prevention of possible complications.
30635971	associate|@CHEMICAL_Copper|@DISEASE_Hepatolenticular_Degeneration	Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) as a new method of detecting copper deposits forming the Kayser-Fleischer ring in patients with Wilson disease.PURPOSE: Kayser-Fleischer ring pathognomonic for Wilson disease (WD) is formed of corneal copper deposits present predominantly within the anterior chamber angle at the Schwalbe's line. The slit-lamp assessment commonly used as a standard of care cannot detect them early enough, as the angle view is obscured by the corneal limbus. The aim of the research was to evaluate the anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT), as objective diagnostic assessment of copper deposits forming KF ring in patients with WD. METHODS: Twenty-nine subjects (17 women) and twenty-nine controls (14 women) were enrolled and underwent slit lamp and AS-OCT assessment. RESULTS: Kayser-Fleischer ring was not detected - either with a slit lamp or with AS-OCT - in any of the controls. Fifteen subjects presenting without KF ring at a slit-lamp examination were found to have a KF ring when examined with AS-OCT (p < 0.001), which confirms improved accuracy of AS-OCT, as compared to the slit-lamp examination. CONCLUSION: Our results support AS-OCT as a diagnostic procedure to offer better objectivity and accuracy as compared to a slit-lamp examination, both at the diagnostic stage and when monitoring changes in KF ring during medical therapy to assess its efficacy and patient compliance.
28433112		Wilson disease - liver pathology.The liver in Wilson disease may demonstrate a wide range of damage patterns. Some patients may present almost no detectable microscopic pathology, while others display lesions consistent with fulminant hepatitis or acute liver failure. Most liver biopsy specimens show moderate to severe steatosis, variable degree of portal and/or lobular inflammation, and fibrosis eventually progressing to cirrhosis. Additional findings include liver cell degeneration and ballooning, Mallory hyaline bodies, liver cell necrosis, and glycogenation of periportal hepatocytic nuclei. None of the above lesions are specific for Wilson disease and should be interpreted in a wider medical context and particular clinical setting. The main message concerning liver pathology is that Wilson disease may be microscopically misinterpreted as many other liver diseases, including viral or autoimmune hepatitis, alcoholic/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, toxic liver injury, cryptogenic cirrhosis, metabolic liver disease, and many others. The possibility of Wilson disease should be considered in all patients, especially young ones presenting unexplained liver diseases with many variable patterns of microscopic liver involvement.

In children, as in older age brackets, clinical disease is highly diverse. Although hepatic disease is the common presentation in children/adolescents, neurologic, psychiatric, and hematologic clinical presentations do occur. Very young children may have clinically evident liver disease due to WD. Early diagnosis, preferably when the child/adolescent is asymptomatic, is most likely to result in near-normal longevity with generally good health so long as the patient tolerates effective medication, is adherent to the lifelong treatment regimen, and has consistent access to the medication. Apart from a lively index of clinical suspicion on the part of physicians, biochemical tests including liver tests, serum ceruloplasmin, and basal 24-hour urinary copper excretion and genotype determination are key to diagnosis. Oral chelation treatment remains central to medical management, although zinc appears to be an attractive option for the presymptomatic child. Pediatric patients presenting with Wilsonian fulminant hepatic failure must be differentiated from those with decompensated cirrhosis, since the latter may respond to intensive medical interventions and not require liver transplantation. Recently identified WD-mimic disorders reveal important aspects of WD pathogenesis.
33763932		Biopsy-proven liver cirrhosis in young children: A 10-year cohort study.Young children with liver cirrhosis have a significantly high risk of mortality. However, there are few studies regarding early childhood-onset cirrhosis. This study aims to explore the causes, clinical findings and prognosis of biopsy-proven cirrhosis in infants, toddlers and preschoolers. We enroled young children with biopsy-proven cirrhosis from January 2010. Till January 2020, the study has been going on for 10 years. A total of 139 cirrhotic children were enrolled, including 87 boys and 52 girls. The median age at initially histological diagnosis of cirrhosis was 2 years old (range: 1 month-6 years). Sixty-two patients reported yellowish discoloration of sclera and/or skin as an initial symptom. Ninety-three patients had definite aetiologies while 46 had indeterminate causes. Among the confirmed cases, 31 had hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, accounting for 33.3%. Subsequently, glycogen storage disease was diagnosed in 16 cases and Wilson disease in 14 cases. In these patients with HBV infection, nine finally achieved hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) loss (29.0%) after effective antiviral therapy during the follow-up. Logistic regression revealed that baseline alanine aminotransferase (odds ratio 1.008, p = 0.028) was the independent predictor of HBsAg loss. Furthermore, one patient who underwent second biopsies showed histological reverse. HBV infection is an important cause of paediatric cirrhosis in our study. The pathogenesis of HBV-related cirrhosis in early childhood deserves further studies.
28452067		Zinc monotherapy for young children with presymptomatic Wilson disease: A multicenter study in Japan.BACKGROUND AND AIM: Few studies of zinc monotherapy for presymptomatic Wilson disease have focused on young children. We therefore evaluated long-term efficacy and safety of zinc monotherapy for such children and established benchmarks for maintenance therapy. METHODS: We retrospectively and prospectively examined children under 10 years old with presymptomatic Wilson disease who received zinc monotherapy from time of diagnosis at 12 participating pediatric centers in Japan. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients met entry criteria. Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase decreased significantly beginning 1 month after initiation of treatment and usually remained under 50 U/L from 1 to 8 years of treatment. Twenty four-hour urinary copper decreased significantly at 6 months and usually remained under 75 mug/day and between 1 and 3 mug/kg/day for the remainder of the study. All patients continued to take zinc, and none became symptomatic. In patients under 6 years old who received 50 mg/day of zinc as an initial dose, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase significantly decreased at 1 month after initiation of treatment, as did gamma-glutamyltransferase and 24-h urinary copper at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first multicenter study of zinc monotherapy for young children with presymptomatic Wilson disease. Such monotherapy proved highly effective and safe. Maintaining normal transaminase values (or values under 50 U/L when normalization is difficult) and 24-h urinary copper excretion between 1 and 3 mug/kg/day and under 75 mug/day is a reasonable goal. An initial dose of 50 mg/day is appropriate for patients under 6 years old.
38306527	associate|@DISEASE_Hepatolenticular_Degeneration|@GENE_ATP7B	A rare presentation of Wilson disease with neurological symptoms: Case report and genetic analysis.RATIONALE: Wilson disease is a rare genetic disorder primarily associated with hepatic symptoms; however, its unique neurological presentation remains a subject of interest in the medical literature. This case report contributes to existing knowledge by highlighting the unusual manifestation of Wilson disease with significant neurological symptoms. PATIENT CONCERNS: The patient, pseudonym John Smith, presented with prominent neurological symptoms, including tremors, dystonia, and psychiatric manifestations. Clinical findings corroborated copper accumulation in the brain, prompting a thorough diagnostic investigation. DIAGNOSES: Genetic analysis revealed two ATP7B mutations, confirming the primary diagnosis of Wilson disease. This case underscores the importance of recognizing atypical neurological presentations in the context of this rare genetic disorder. INTERVENTIONS: Chelation therapy, initiated promptly upon diagnosis, targeted copper overload. The intervention led to notable improvements in neurological symptoms and psychiatric manifestations. The dosage and duration of treatment were adjusted based on regular monitoring. OUTCOMES: Regular follow-up revealed a positive trajectory, with reduced tremors and improved overall well-being. Genetic testing, coupled with clinical assessments, contributed to monitoring treatment efficacy and optimizing therapeutic interventions. LESSONS: The main takeaway lessons from this case include the significance of a comprehensive diagnostic approach, personalized therapeutic interventions, and the imperative to acknowledge the diverse clinical spectrum of Wilson disease. Early recognition and tailored treatment contribute to favorable outcomes in cases with atypical neurological presentations.

We aim to provide better experience for the diagnosis and treatment for WD patients with epilepsy in the future. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed in 13 Chinese WD patients with generalized epilepsy. Each patient was diagnosed with WD by clinical evaluation and genetic screening. Patients were given small doses of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), followed by copper-chelation therapy when the seizures stabilized. Clinical manifestations, brain imaging changes, and treatment and outcome after a long-term follow-up were analyzed. RESULTS: Four out of 13 (30.8%) patients stopped taking copper-chelation drugs for more than 1 year before they were admitted for epilepsy. The incidence of epilepsy of WD patients in our cohort is 1.43% (13/910), lower than those (4.5%-5.9%) in other populations. After the attack of epilepsy, frontal lobes were the most common abnormalities (13/13, 100%) in patients, followed by brain stem (8/13, 61.5%) and thalamus (7/13, 53.8%). After a long-term follow-up, brain imaging and clinical manifestations of 8 (8/9, 88.9%) WD patients were significantly improved. CONCLUSIONS: We firstly described WD patients with generalized epilepsy in the Chinese population. WD patients with aggravation of neuropsychiatric symptoms are prone to occur epilepsy; thus, brain MRI should be performed regularly in those patients. Cortical abnormality in brain MRI is a warning sign of epilepsy. Irregular use of copper-chelation drugs and excessive copper deposition in the brain may be the cause of seizures. Long-term standardized treatment for WD can effectively prevent the extensive brain damage and reduce the incidence of epilepsy in WD patients.
28260463	associate|@CHEMICAL_Copper|@DISEASE_Hepatolenticular_Degeneration	Auxiliary Partial Orthotopic Living Liver Transplant for Wilson Disease.Wilson disease is a genetic disease involving copper metabolism disturbances that result in copper accumulations, especially in the liver and brain. Wilson disease can be treated with pharmacologic agents, such as chelators that induce urinary excretion of copper or zinc salts that inhibit copper absorption in the digestive tract. Liver transplant is the only treatment option for Wilson disease when liver failure has occurred. In some patients, that is, in those with Child-Pugh A score, neurologic disease can be seen without hepatic failure. Our recommendation is for these patients to have auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplant. Here, we present a 36-year-old male patient with neurologic disease associated with Wilson disease who had successful related living-donor auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplant using a left lobe. The patient, as a result of neurologic symptoms that included tremor walking and speaking problems and low serum ceruloplasmin level of 7 mg/dL, was diagnosed with Wilson disease, and a liver biopsy was performed. Chronic necroinflammatory disease activity was 4/18, and the patient received chelation treatment. His hepatic functions were normal. The donor was the patient's 57-year-old father whose liver function tests were also normal. The graft-to-recipient weight ratio was 1% using a left lobe graft. After transplant, serum ceruloplasmin levels on day 15 and month 1 were 14 and 19 mg/dL. At month 1, liver function tests were normal. Doppler ultrasonography showed normal vascular flow of the native liver and the graft. The patient's neurologic symptoms were progressively reduced. Progressive neurologic deterioration with no hepatic insufficiency is considered a suitable indication for auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplant; this procedure is suggested before the neurologic and liver failure symptoms of Wilson disease occur.

However, both diseases are copper storage disorders despite completely opposite clinical pictures. Clinically, Menkes disease is characterized by copper deficiency secondary to poor loading of copper-requiring enzymes although sufficient body copper. Copper accumulates in non-hepatic tissues, but is deficient in blood, liver, and brain. In contrast, Wilson disease is characterized by symptoms of copper toxicity secondary to accumulation of copper in several organs most notably brain and liver, and a saturated blood copper pool. It is a challenge to correct copper dyshomeostasis in either disease though copper depletion in Menkes disease is most challenging. Both diseases are caused by defective copper export from distinct cells, and we seek to give new angles and guidelines to improve treatment of these two complementary diseases. Therapy of Menkes disease with copper-histidine, thiocarbamate, nitrilotriacetate or lipoic acid is discussed. In Wilson disease combination of a hydrophilic chelator e.g. trientine or dimercaptosuccinate with a brain shuttle e.g. thiomolybdate or lipoate, is discussed. New chelating principles for copper removal or delivery are outlined.

ATP7B encodes an enzyme called transmembrane copper-transporting ATPase, which is essential for copper incorporation into ceruloplasmin and for copper excretion into the bile. A lack or dysfunction of this enzyme results in a progressive accumulation of copper in several organs, especially in the liver, the nervous system, corneas, kidneys, and heart. Children with WD can present with asymptomatic liver disease, cirrhosis, or acute liver failure, with or without neurological and psychiatric symptoms. Approximately 20%-30% of WD patients present with ALF, while most of the other patients have chronic progressive hepatitis or cirrhosis if untreated. Although genetic testing has become a more important diagnostic tool for WD, the diagnosis remains based on both clinical features and laboratory investigations. The aims of treatment are to reduce copper levels and prevent its accumulation in the liver and other organs, especially in the central nervous system. Liver transplantation in WD is a life-saving option for patients presenting with liver failure and encephalopathy. For WD patients treated with chelating agents, adherence to the therapy is essential for long-term success. In this review, we also address specific issues in young adults as compared to children.

WD can cause fatal neurological and hepatic disorders if not diagnosed and treated. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the disease-causing mutations of 14 Chinese WD children, 11 of whom are diagnosed with hepatic disorders, 2 with neurological degeneration and 1 with both hepatic and neurological disorders. METHODS: All ATP7B coding regions were analyzed by Sanger sequencing. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) functional impacts were assessed by combining the results of four bioinformatics tools (Poly-phen-2, SIFT, PANTHER-PSEP and PhD-SNPs) in an index that reflects the combined probability (cPdel) of an amino acid change to be deleterious to the protein function. RESULTS: Two novel variants involved in WD development, c.1448_1455del (p.Arg483SerfsX19) and c.4144G>T (p.Glu1382Stop), and 11 previously reported mutations were detected. Both new variants result in shortened and dysfunctional ATP7B proteins. cPdel score suggests that SNPs may be deleterious to the ATP7B functionality. CONCLUSIONS: This study enriches the library of the ATP7B mutations that lead to WD and can be used as a basis for genetic counseling, for WD prevention and clinical and prenatal diagnosis. Those SNPs that are believed to be harmless to ATP7B protein may be involved in the pathogenesis of WD.
34923539		Case Report: Bilateral Valsalva Retinopathy in an Acutely Anemic Patient.SIGNIFICANCE: The Valsalva maneuver is known to cause pre-retinal hemorrhages, which have a predilection to affect the macula. Certain conditions may increase the risk of developing Valsalva retinopathy including anemia. Knowing these associations can aid in uncovering underlying systemic conditions for which a patient may not otherwise be aware. PURPOSE: This case report reviews the presentation of Valsalva retinopathy and the impacts of acute anemia on retinal findings. Recommendations for management are also reviewed and reported. CASE REPORT: A 30-year-old Hispanic man presented to the emergency department for progressing weakness over the previous month. He had a history of polysubstance abuse and had not been eating for the previous month except for water intake. He was diagnosed with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypercoagulable state, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesia and admitted to the intensive care unit for treatment and observation. He was referred to the eye clinic to be examined for Kayser-Fleischer rings because of concern for Wilson disease. On ophthalmological examination, the patient had reduced vision in both eyes attributed to bilateral subinternal limiting membrane macular hemorrhages likely due to Valsalva, with acute anemia and thrombocytopenia as contributing factors. The patient was referred to a retinal specialist, and observation was recommended with follow-up in 3 months. The patient, unfortunately, never followed up despite multiple attempts to reschedule. CONCLUSIONS: Patient history and the common location of retinal hemorrhages aid in diagnosing Valsalva retinopathy. In this case, the patient had a known history of acute anemia and thrombocytopenia with a recent history of straining. Anemia, among other systemic conditions, can increase the risk of developing retinopathy after a Valsalva maneuver. Although Valsalva retinopathy can occur in healthy patients without underlying conditions, it is important to rule out other conditions that might present with retinal hemorrhage or that may increase the risk of Valsalva retinopathy.

In particular, with the exception of hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma, the incidence of cancer is significantly lower in WD patients compared with the general population. This case study presents a rare case of WD complicated with primary breast cancer. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 40-year-old woman who was diagnosed with WD at 25 years of age found a lump in her left breast. She has a family history of cancer. DIAGNOSES: Ultrasound and mammography results were highly suggestive of a malignant lesion. After core needle biopsy, it was confirmed that she had invasive breast cancer. INTERVENTIONS: A modified radical mastectomy was performed for the left breast. As the tumor was defined as a stage IIa triple negative breast cancer, the patient would have been recommended epirubicin/cyclophosphamide + docetaxel for 8 cycles if WD was not a comorbidity. As the patient had cirrhosis and abnormal liver function, she was given paclitaxel weekly for 6 cycles instead. OUTCOMES: The patient showed good tolerance, and has not had a recurrence in 2 years. LESSONS: We reviewed the literature for studies of patients with WD complicated with cancers, and to our knowledge, this is the first report on WD complicated with breast cancer. The patient received chemotherapy even with liver dysfunction, which suggests that patients with WD can be safely treated with paclitaxel chemotherapy under close surveillance.
28573989		Evaluation of Kayser-Fleischer ring in Wilson disease by anterior segment optical coherence tomography.PURPOSE: The purpose of the study is to present anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) as an alternative method of evaluating Kayser-Fleischer (KF) ring in Wilson disease (WD) not only by ophthalmologists but also by other clinicians dealing with WD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective case series of six WD patients with KF ring. Evaluation of KF ring was done by naked eye examination using torch light, slit lamp biomicroscopy (SL), and AS-OCT. SL examination was done using a narrow slit of the superior cornea. AS-OCT was done using the Optovue RTvue PremierTM device (Fremont, CA, USA). RESULTS: AS-OCT revealed KF ring as an intense hyperreflective band at the level of Descemet membrane (DM). Color scale of AS-OCT showed KF ring as greenish/greenish yellow/orange yellow/yellowish/red band. Validation of AS-OCT findings was done by second ophthalmologist, medical gastroenterologist, surgical gastroenterologist, and neurophysician. After seeing the first observation, they could identify the AS-OCT features in all pictures with ease. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first observation of KF ring in WD on AS-OCT. On AS-OCT, KF ring is visualized as intense hyperreflectivity at the level of DM in the peripheral cornea. Further, studies are needed to evaluate the usefulness of AS-OCT in WD management.

Idiopathic or secondary brain calcification can be also associated with neurological involvement and brain-MRI T2/T2*GRE-hypointensity. Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), characterized by systemic iron loading, usually does not involve the CNS, and only sporadic cases of neurological abnormalities or brain-MRI T2/T2*GRE-hypointensity have been reported. CASE PRESENTATION: A 59-year-old man came to our observation after a diagnosis of HH carried out in another hospital 2 years before. First-level genetic test had revealed a homozygous HFE p.Cys282Tyr (C282Y) mutation compatible with the diagnosis of HFE-related HH, thus phlebotomy treatment was started. The patient had a history of metabolic syndrome, type-2 diabetes, autoimmune thyroiditis and severe chondrocalcinosis. Brain-MRI showed the presence of bilateral T2*GRE hypointensities within globus pallidus, substantia nigra, dentate nucleus and left pulvinar that were considered expression of cerebral siderosis. No neurological symptoms or family history of neurological disease were reported. Neurological examination revealed only mild right-sided hypokinetic-rigid syndrome. Vitamin D-PTH axis, measurements of serum ceruloplasmin and copper, and urinary copper were within the normal range. A brain computed tomography (CT) was performed to better characterize the suspected and unexplained brain iron accumulation. On the CT images, the hypointense regions in the brain MRI were hyperdense. DNA sequence analysis of genes associated with primary familial brain calcification and NBIA was negative. CONCLUSIONS: This report highlights the importance of brain CT-scan in ambiguous cases of suspected cerebral siderosis, and suggests that HH patients with a severe phenotype, and likely associated with chondrocalcinosis, may display also brain calcifications. Further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis. So far, we can speculate that iron and calcium homeostasis could be reciprocally connected within the basal ganglia.
37996345		Efficacy of therapeutic plasma exchange in pediatric cases of acute liver failure as an extracorporeal liver support system.BACKGROUND: Acute liver failure in the pediatric population is often accompanied by deranged metabolism, severe encephalopathy and coagulopathy. A liver transplant is the most viable option for the management of such patients. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is helpful in improving the liver biochemistry profile, thereby, increasing their likelihood of undergoing a liver transplant METHOD: The study was conducted over a period of 3 years (January 2018 to December 2021). Indications mainly consisted of ALF with hepatic encephalopathy, worsening liver parameters in spite of medical management, and candidacy for undergoing a liver transplant. Plasma exchange was performed daily or alternatively until the patient recovered, succumbed, or was stable enough to undergo a transplant. Biochemical parameters serum bilirubin, ALT, AST serum ammonia serum urea, serum creatinine were recorded before and after TPE sessions. RESULTS: The study group comprised 14 patients of which a total of 28 TPE was performed. There were a total of 5 cases of cryptogenic ALF, 4 of Wilson disease, 2 cases each of infection-related ALF and autoimmune hepatitis, and a single case of drug-induced hepatitis. A total of 5 out of 14 patients underwent a liver transplant and amongst the 9 who did not undergo a transplant, 4 patients expired due to septic shock syndrome; the remaining 5 were discharged in a stable condition following TPE sessions. The disease-free survival was 78.9% and the transplant-free survival was 35.71%. CONCLUSION: TPE plays a crucial role in improving the biochemistry profile of the liver in children with liver failure.

Available treatments for Wilson disease (WD) prevent longterm complications of copper accumulation. Current anti-copper agents include zinc salts, penicillamine, and trientine. Patients with WD may switch between the agents for a number of reasons. Due to the different mechanisms of action between the copper chelators and zinc salts, transitioning could require a period of overlap and increased monitoring. There are no large studies that investigate the best transition strategies between agents. In this article, we review the treatments for WD and how to monitor for treatment efficacy. Case Summary. The patient had been diagnosed with WD for over 20 years prior to establishing care in our Hepatology Clinic. During his initial course, he was transitioned from penicillamine to zinc due to evidence suggesting penicillamine had greater adverse effects in the long term. Later, he was switched to trientine. His liver enzymes and 24-hour urine copper were monitored. During these years, he intermittently had some financial hardship, requiring him to be on penicillamine rather than trientine. He also had developed acute kidney injury. Overall, his liver disease remained under control and he never had signs of decompensated cirrhosis, but had fluctuations of liver enzymes over the years. Conclusion. Anti-copper treatment for WD has to be tailored to medication side effects profile, patient's chronic and emerging comorbidities, as well as costs. Transitioning regimens is often challenging, and it requires closer monitoring, with no predictors of response.

Drug therapy is currently the main treatment method for WD. Liver transplantation should be considered for poor drug response or acute liver failure. However, it faces problems such as medication adherence, adverse reactions and shortage of liver source. Gene therapy in WD may permanently correct abnormal copper metabolism, which is why it is the focus of current research. This article summarizes the research progress of WD around gene therapy vectors and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system.

After anti-neoplastic polychemotherapy treatment, the remission of lymphoma was confirmed and maintained for over four years. The patient, a 27 year old female had liver transplantation at the age of 17, due to acute liver failure, caused by non-diagnosed Wilson disease. Nearly seven years post-transplantation, the patient was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma (NHBCL), potentially induced by Cephalosporin A therapy. After the treatment with rituximab and CHOP therapy (r-CHOP protocol), remission was determined using computer tomography. Remission is maintained to date. A review of reported cases of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs) in liver transplanted (LT) patients showed that the onset of PTLDs is the highest in the first year after transplantation. In addition, remission rates of NHBCL in LT patients are not much elaborated in the literature. It is our opinion that the presented case is rare, both from the aspect of timeline of occurrence of the PTLD and the achieved remission, using r-CHOP protocol.
33662781	associate|@CHEMICAL_Copper|@DISEASE_Hepatolenticular_Degeneration	Zinc monotherapy for young patients with oligosymptomatic Wilson disease: A single center, retrospective study.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Few studies have focused on the treatment failure of zinc monotherapy for oligosymptomatic Wilson disease (WD) patients. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the long-term efficacy of zinc monotherapy in oligosymptomatic patients and to analyze the possible factors that may influence the outcome of this treatment. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of oligosymptomatic WD patients who received zinc monotherapy from the time of diagnosis. Then, the characteristics of patients who were treated with zinc monotherapy successfully and those who experienced treatment failure were investigated. RESULTS: Forty oligosymptomatic WD patients were identified that have received zinc monotherapy as initial treatment, with a median age of 3.83 years at the time of diagnosis. 36 (90%) patients had abnormal alanine transaminase/aspartate transaminase levels at baseline. None of the patients became symptomatic during zinc monotherapy. 28 (70%, Group 1) patients were treated with zinc monotherapy successfully for a median period of 2.4 years. In Group 1, serum aminotransferase levels significantly decreased 6 and 12 months after zinc therapy compared to the baseline levels (P <  0.05). 12 (30%, Group 2) patients experienced treatment failure with zinc monotherapy due to uncontrolled serum liver enzyme levels, and d-penicillamine was combined. The baseline 24-hour urine copper levels before treatment were significantly higher in Group 2 compared to that in Group 1 (182.5 vs 90.92 mug /day, P = 0.018). Comparing the age at onset; ceruloplasmin, serum copper, ALT, and AST levels; and proportions of abdominal ultrasonography abnormality at baseline between Group 1 and 2 revealed no statistically significant differences. CONCLUSIONS: We found that high initial 24 -h urinary copper levels may lead to treatment failure of zinc monotherapy in oligosymptomatic WD patients. It might be reasonable to follow up liver function tests more closely during zinc monotherapy and to begin combination treatment with chelators early in patients with high level of 24 -h urinary copper.
33181595		Evoked Potentials in Patients With Wilson Disease.INTRODUCTION: Wilson disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism presenting with a variety of symptoms but commonly as a liver or neuropsychiatric disease. Abnormal evoked responses are constantly found among patients with neurologic manifestations and sometimes in patients with hepatic presentation or in presymptomatic siblings. The aim of our study was to assess visual and brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP) in patients with various presentation of WD. METHODS: Visual evoked potentials (VEP) were performed in 36 WD patients and BAEP were done in 37 WD patients. RESULTS: Brainstem auditory evoked potentials were normal in patients with isolated hepatic presentation, whereas they were abnormal in 93.5% of patients with neurologic symptoms. There was significant prolongation of the latencies of the III and V waves and of the interpeak III-V and I-V latencies in comparison with the healthy controls (T-test P = 0). Abnormal VEP were observed in 81% of the patients including six of seven neurologically asymptomatic patients. The values of N75, P100, and N145 latencies were significantly longer in all patients than in healthy controls (T-test). CONCLUSIONS: The data showed that VEP and BAEP are more frequently abnormal in WD than previously reported. The abnormal VEP and BAEP even without clinical signs and brain MRI abnormalities point to subclinical involvement of visual and auditory pathways caused by copper toxicity. Because VEP and BAEP are noninvasive and widely available, they should be performed in all patents with WD.

In more common conditions, however, exome sequencing for diagnostic purposes remains the exception. Here we describe a patient initially diagnosed with a common, complex liver disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), who was determined to have Wilson disease (WD) upon research-related exome sequencing. The patient presented as a 14.5-yr-old adolescent with chronically elevated aminotransferases, normal ceruloplasmin, and histologic examination consistent with NAFLD with advanced fibrosis. He was enrolled in a large longitudinal study of patients with NAFLD and was found to have WD by exome sequencing performed 4 yr later. This new diagnosis, confirmed clinically by 24 h urine copper quantification, led to a change in the therapy from lifestyle counseling to directed treatment with d-penicillamine, a copper chelating agent. In this case, the likelihood of making the correct diagnosis and thereby choosing the appropriate treatment was increased by exome sequencing and careful interpretation. This example illustrates the utility of exome sequencing diagnostically in more common conditions not currently considered as targets for genome-wide evaluation and adds to a growing body of evidence that patients diagnosed with more common conditions often in fact have rarer genetically determined syndromes that have escaped clinical detection.

While copper damage to mitochondria is an established feature in WD livers, much less is known about such detrimental copper effects in other organs. We therefore assessed the mitochondrial sensitivity to copper in a tissue specific manner, namely of isolated rat liver, kidney, heart, and brain mitochondria. Brain mitochondria presented with exceptional copper sensitivity, as evidenced by a comparatively early membrane potential loss, profound structural changes already at low copper dose, and a dose-dependent reduced capacity to produce ATP. This sensitivity was likely due to a copper-dependent attack on free protein thiols and due to a decreased copper reactive defense system, as further evidenced in neuroblastoma SHSY5Y cells. In contrast, an increased production of reactive oxygen species was found to be a late-stage event, only occurring in destroyed mitochondria. We therefore propose mitochondrial protein thiols as major targets of mitochondrial copper toxicity.
28433099		Other organ involvement and clinical aspects of Wilson disease.Wilson disease (WD) is a rare disorder of copper metabolism that presents mainly with hepatic and neuropsychiatric features. Copper accumulates not only in the liver and brain, but also in other organs. Liver injury can also be the cause of secondary impairment of other tissues. Therefore, the clinical manifestation of WD may be renal, cardiac, skin, osteoarticular, or endocrinologic and include other organ disturbances. Renal abnormalities include tubular dysfunction (e.g., renal tubular acidosis, aminoaciduria) and nephrolithiasis. Bone demineralization is a common manifestation in patients with WD. Cardiac injury may include arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, and autonomic dysfunction. Different endocrine system manifestations, such as infertility or repeated miscarriages, growth and puberty disturbances, and hypoparathyroidism, are observed. Other important clinical aspects of WD include pancreas involvement, immunologic abnormalities, the presence of lipomas, and skin changes. Although other organ involvement is not common in WD and usually not severe, delayed diagnosis may lead to irreversible changes in organs and tissues. Therefore, awareness of other possible WD presentations is important in the differential diagnosis of WD.

Copper overload can be assessed as non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper (NCC) in blood. Current therapies are limited by efficacy, safety concerns, and multiple-daily dosing. Areas covered: This article reviews the literature on WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate), an oral first-in-class copper-protein-binding agent in development for the treatment of WD. Expert opinion: In a proof-of-concept phase II trial, once-daily WTX101 over 24 weeks rapidly lowered NCC levels and this was accompanied by improved neurological status without apparent initial drug-induced paradoxical worsening, reduced disability, stable liver function, with a favorable safety profile. WTX101 directly removes excess copper from intracellular hepatic copper stores and also forms an inert tripartite complex with copper and albumin in the circulation and promotes biliary copper excretion. These mechanisms may explain the rapid biochemical and clinical improvements observed. A phase III trial of WTX101 is ongoing and results are eagerly awaited to confirm if WTX101 can improve the treatment of this devastating disease.

METHODS: Data from 143 pediatric patients with WD treated at our center between January 1996 and November 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: A review of the 143 pediatric patients with WD identified 21 (10 girls, 11 boys) with first symptoms or abnormal liver function test results at age <=5 years. The diagnosis of WD was confirmed in 8 patients younger than 5 years. At baseline the mean serum alanine aminotransferase level was 222 U/L and the mean serum aspartate aminotransferase level was 130 U/L. The mean serum ceruloplasmin concentration in 16 tested patients was <20 mg/dL. Of the 15 patients who underwent urinary copper excretion testing, 8 had levels between 40 and 100 mug/day, with only 4 having levels >100 mug/day. Liver copper quantification was >250 mug/g dry weight in 16 patients. The most common mutation was p.H1069Q, with compound heterozygosity in 5 patients and homozygosity in 9. Sixteen patients were treated with zinc salts and 5 with D-penicillamine. Both treatments were effective, with no serious side effects observed after 3 to 24 months. CONCLUSIONS: WD can present as early as 2 years of age. Because biochemical tests may be less sensitive in very young children, diagnoses may require a combination of tests. If molecular tests are inconclusive, liver copper content should be measured.

Chelation of excessive copper is recommended but data on the pharmacokinetics of trientine are limited. The aim of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetics of a new trientine tetrahydrochloride formulation (TETA 4HCl) with those of an established trientine dihydrochloride (TETA 2HCl) salt. METHODS: A randomised single-centre crossover study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of two different oral formulations of trientine (TETA 4HCl tablets vs TETA 2HCl capsules) in 23 healthy adult subjects receiving a single dose equivalent to 600 mg of trientine base was performed. RESULTS: Following oral administration, the median time to reach maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) was 2.00 h (TETA 4HCl) and 3.00 h (TETA 2HCl). The rate (maximum plasma concentration [Cmax]) and extent (area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity [AUC0- ]) of absorption of the active moiety, trientine, were greater (by approximately 68% and 56%, respectively) for TETA 4HCl than for the TETA 2HCl formulation. The two formulations presented a similar terminal elimination rate (lambdaz) and a similar terminal half-life (t1/2) for trientine. Differences between TETA 4HCl and TETA 2HCl in the levels of the two main mono- and diacetylated metabolites were less than seen for trientine. For both tested formulations, healthy male volunteers demonstrated higher trientine plasma levels but lower mono- and diacetylated metabolite levels compared with females, with no sex differences in terminal half-life (t1/2) observed. Single oral doses of both formulations were safe and well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with an identical dose of a TETA 2HCl formulation, the TETA 4HCl formulation provided more rapid absorption of trientine and greater systemic exposure in healthy subjects.

Methods: Forty WD carriers, 40 WD patients and 20 normal controls from the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University from July 2007 to May 2018 were included. The modified Young scale was used for neural symptom scoring, and Child grading of liver function, mental symptoms rating scale, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) inspection, metal metabolism tests were also applied to all the included subjects. Corrected phase (CP) was measured by SWI. WD carriers were divided into symptomatic group and asymptomatic group. Symptomatic WD carriers were treated with penicillamine for 2 weeks and zinc gluconate for 3 months, then their neurological symptoms, liver function grade, metal metabolism index were rechecked. Results: Six WD carriers presented with some clinical symptoms, including 5 with neurological symptoms and 4 with liver dysfunction. The score of Hamilton anxiety (HAMA) scale of symptomatic WD carriers was higher than that of normal control group (P=0.021). 85% of carriers had ceruloplasmin level less than 0.26 g/L. 80% of carriers had serum copper between normal controls and WD patients. The free copper level of WD carriers was lower than that of WD patients (P=0.012, 0.019). Urinary copper in symptomatic WD carriers was higher than normal controls (P=0.047). The CP values of thalamus, globus pallidus and putamen in symptomatic WD carriers were lower than those in normal control group. After treatment with penicillamine in symptomatic WD carriers, urinary copper was higher than that before treatment (P=0.036). After treatment, the liver enzymes of symptomatic WD carriers returned to normal, and the score of modified Young scale was lower than before treatment (P=0.031). Conclusions: Mild copper metabolism abnormality is seen in WD carriers. A few carriers have neurological symptoms such as limb tremors, or liver symptoms such as abnormal liver enzymes. Abnormal copper metabolism is more serious in symptomatic WD carriers than in asymptomatic WD carriers. Symptomatic WD carriers can be treated with zinc gluconate.

This disease is currently treated with the lifelong use of copper chelation therapy, which has side effects and does not fix copper metabolism. Here, we thoroughly characterized a mouse model of WD, the toxic milk mouse, and used the model to test a gene therapy approach for treating WD. WD mice accumulated copper in the liver from birth; severe copper accumulation and concurrent liver disease were evident by 2 months of age. Intravenously administering an adeno-associated viral (AAV) 8 vector expressing a codon-optimized version of the human ATP7B transgene into 2-month-old WD mice significantly decreased liver copper levels compared with age-matched, uninjected, WD mice. We also observed a significant dose-dependent decrease in liver disease. Male mice injected with 1011 genome copies of AAV8 vector showed only mild histopathological findings with a complete lack of liver fibrosis. Therefore, we conclude that administering gene therapy at the early stages of disease onset is a promising approach for reducing liver damage and correcting copper metabolism in WD.

Wilson disease, but also other treatable metabolic and/or genetic diseases, and auto-immune diseases will be systematically considered. Therapeutic management is symptomatic and based on specific oral drugs appropriate to each movement disorders. In some cases, radiosurgery and deep brain stimulation should be helpful, especially for tremor and generalized dystonia.

Exchangeable copper (ExC) is a novel potential marker, but its long-term changes have never been described in patients under chelation therapy. Our aim was to describe the long-term changes in ExC levels compared to UCE levels in symptomatic WD pediatric patients under chelation therapy. METHODS: A retrospective, descriptive, and analytical study including all patients under 18 years of age, diagnosed between 2006 and 2020, and treated with chelation therapy was conducted at the National Reference Center for WD in Lyon. Ceruloplasmin levels, serum copper, 24 h-UCE, ExC, and liver enzymes at diagnosis and during follow-up were analyzed. RESULTS: Our study included 36 patients, predominantly with hepatic form of WD (n = 31). The median [interquartile range (IQR)] age at diagnosis was 10.5 (8.4-13.1) years, and the median (IQR) follow-up duration was 6.3 (3.3-8.8) years. At diagnosis, the median (IQR) ExC value was 1.01 (0.60-1.52) micromol/L. There was a significant decrease during the first year of chelation treatment ( P = 0.0008), then a stabilization. The median (IQR) ExC values was 0.38 (0.22-0.63) micromol/L at 12-18 months and 0.43 (0.31-0.54) micromol/L at 5 years of chelation treatment ( P = 0.4057). Similarly, there was a significant decrease in 24-hour UCE ( P < 0.001) during the first year of chelation treatment, then a stabilization. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed a significant decrease in ExC and 24-hour UCE levels during the first year of follow-up; The dynamics of both biomarkers were similar along the follow-up, demonstrating their usefulness in clinical practice for monitoring WD.

It requires life-long treatment and is mainly characterized by hepatic and neurological features. Copper accumulation has been reported to be related to the occurrence of heart disease, although little is known regarding this association. We have conducted a systematic review of the literature to document the association between WD and cardiac involvement. Thirty-two articles were retained. We also described three cases of sudden death. Cardiac manifestations in WD include cardiomyopathy (mainly left ventricular (LV) remodeling, hypertrophy, and LV diastolic dysfunction, and less frequently LV systolic dysfunction), increased levels of troponin, and/or brain natriuretic peptide, electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities, and rhythm or conduction abnormalities, which can be life-threatening. Dysautonomia has also been reported. The mechanism of cardiac damage in WD has not been elucidated. It may be the result of copper accumulation in the heart, and/or it could be due to a toxic effect of copper, resulting in the release of free oxygen radicals. Patients with signs and/or symptoms of cardiac involvement or who have cardiovascular risk factors should be examined by a cardiologist in addition to being assessed by their interdisciplinary treating team. Furthermore, ECG, cardiac biomarkers, echocardiography, and 24-hours or more of Holter monitoring at the diagnosis and/or during the follow-up of patients with WD need to be evaluated. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, although not always available, could also be a useful diagnostic tool, allowing assessment of the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and further guidance of the cardiac workup.
33097693	associate|@DISEASE_Carcinoma_Hepatocellular|@GENE_CTNNB1	Prime editing for functional repair in patient-derived disease models.Prime editing is a recent genome editing technology using fusion proteins of Cas9-nickase and reverse transcriptase, that holds promise to correct the vast majority of genetic defects. Here, we develop prime editing for primary adult stem cells grown in organoid culture models. First, we generate precise in-frame deletions in the gene encoding beta-catenin (CTNNB1) that result in proliferation independent of Wnt-stimuli, mimicking a mechanism of the development of liver cancer. Moreover, prime editing functionally recovers disease-causing mutations in intestinal organoids from patients with DGAT1-deficiency and liver organoids from a patient with Wilson disease (ATP7B). Prime editing is as efficient in 3D grown organoids as in 2D grown cell lines and offers greater precision than Cas9-mediated homology directed repair (HDR). Base editing remains more reliable than prime editing but is restricted to a subgroup of pathogenic mutations. Whole-genome sequencing of four prime-edited clonal organoid lines reveals absence of genome-wide off-target effects underscoring therapeutic potential of this versatile and precise gene editing strategy.
32624691		Cirrhosis in Wilson Disease is characterized by Impaired Hepatic Synthesis, Leukopenia and Thrombocytopenia.Background: Patients with Wilson disease (WD) progress to cirrhosis at an early age but have good prognoses. This study aimed to delineate hepatic features in WD patients with or without cirrhosis. Methods: Medical data were retrospectively collected from 27 July 2015 to 27 June 2018. WD patients were divided into two groups based on whether or not they progressed to cirrhosis. Liver function, portal hypertension features and hematocytopenia rates were compared between groups. Results: The study enrolled 119 WD patients with cirrhosis and 53 WD patients without cirrhosis. There were no differences between groups for liver enzyme levels or incidence rates of Kayser-Fleischer ring (all P > 0.05). Ascites and hepatic encephalopathy were nearly absent in both groups, and almost all patients were Child-Pugh group A. However, WD-associated cirrhotic patients had a higher prothrombin time (beta = 0.908, P = 0.004) and international normalized ratio (beta = 0.089, P = 0.040), wider portal vein diameter (beta = 1.330, P < 0.001), and an increased risk of splenomegaly/splenectomy (odds ratio [OR] = 4.36, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.15-8.84, P < 0.001). Moreover, WD-associated cirrhotic patients have significantly increased risks of leukopenia (OR = 2.30, 95% CI: 1.00-5.25, P = 0.049) and thrombocytopenia (OR = 6.89, 95% CI: 2.01-23.59, P = 0.002). Conclusions: Despite presenting good outcomes, mild hepatocyte injury, and good hepatic metabolic function, WD-associated cirrhotic patients show more serious impairment of hepatic synthetic function, wider portal vein diameter, and higher risk of splenomegaly due to portal hypertension.
32181965		Semiquantitative Scale for Assessing Brain MRI Abnormalities in Wilson Disease: A Validation Study.BACKGROUND: MRI is a sensitive method for the assessment of brain abnormalities in Wilson disease, that is, T2 hyperintensities, T2 hypointensities, and atrophy, but a validated scoring system for the classification of radiological severity is lacking. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a brain MRI visual rating scale for Wilson disease. METHODS: The proposed Wilson disease brain MRI severity scale consists of acute toxicity and chronic damage subscores from predefined structures. The former, calculated by summing scores of T2 hyperintensities (excluding cavitation), is likely to be partially reversible with treatment. The latter, representing the sum of scores of T2 hypointensities and brain atrophy, reflects pathology that is not readily reversible. Validation was performed on MRI scans acquired using 1.5T system from 39 Wilson disease patients examined at baseline and after 24 months on anticopper treatment. Intraclass correlation coefficients of 5 ratings from 3 raters were calculated. Temporal evolution of the MRI severity score and its association with clinical severity, assessed using the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale part III, was calculated. RESULTS: Intrarater and interrater agreement were good (r > 0.93; P < 0.001; and r > 0.74; P < 0.001, respectively). In neurologic Wilson disease patients, the total MRI severity score improved over 2 years (P = 0.032), mainly because of reduced acute toxicity (P = 0.0015), whereas the chronic damage score deteriorated (P = 0.035). Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale part III score was positively associated with chronic damage and total score at baseline (P = 0.005 and P = 0.003, respectively) and in month 24 (P < 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The Wilson disease brain MRI severity scale is a simple, reliable, and valid instrument that allows semiquantitative assessment of radiological Wilson disease severity.   2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

Literature describing its toxicity in humans is scarce. CASE REPORT: A 47-year-old man presented to us for sensory and gait problems. He had unremarkable past health except dystrophic nails. He further volunteered a history of receiving chronic oral and intravenous administration of colloidal silver. We confirmed his plasma silver was 1200-fold elevated, measuring 11990 nmol/L (normal < 10 nmol/L). He had deranged liver function tests, and liver biopsy showed distorted acinar architecture, bridging fibrosis and lymphocytic infiltrate with silver particles clustering along the vascular endothelium and portal venules. Brain magnetic resonance imagining showed features of mineralization over bilateral globus pallidi. There was biochemical evidence of central adrenal insufficiency, intracellular iron overload and hypoceruloplasminemia (<0.05 g/L). Gradual clinical and biochemical improvement was noted after silver cessation: his plasma silver dropped to 4800 nmol/L (3 months) and 1650 nmol/L (12 months), and serum ceruloplasmin reverted to 0.13 g/L (10 months) and 0.29 g/L (20 months). CONCLUSIONS: The potential effects of silver to liver and copper metabolism were shown in this case. Serum ceruloplasmin also serves as a surrogate marker in monitoring silver intoxication.

RESULTS: Of the 111 WD children (aged 9 [3-15] years; PELD score 16 [-11 to 60]), 65 with follow-up of 3.6 (0.8-12) years on chelation (83% D-penicillamine monotherapy, 17% D-penicillamine and zinc) were analyzed. 81% had severe disease at presentation. Favorable outcome (complete and or partial remission), progression of disease and drug toxicity were seen in 71%, 29% and 10.8%, respectively. Two-thirds had esophageal varices which did not show progression. Large esophageal varices (16%) were effectively downgraded in 3 (2-6) therapeutic endoscopic sessions. Nazar score and PELD score at baseline were independent predictors of outcome with favorable correlation with each other (r = .864, P < .001). PELD cutoff 9.45 (AUC: 71%, sensitivity: 87%, specificity: 50%; P = .009) and Nazar score cut off 3.5 (AUC: 68%, sensitivity: 83%, specificity: 50%; P = .02) were associated with poor prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: Despite severe liver disease, the majority of hepatic WD can be managed on D-penicillamine monotherapy. PELD score and Nazar score effectively determine the outcome.
