input_text: 'Diagnostic Performance of Ultrasound Elastography and Serologic Fibrosis
  Indices for Evaluation of Hepatic Involvement in Wilson Disease.OBJECTIVES: To investigate
  the diagnostic value of transient elastography (TE), 2-dimensional (2D) shear wave
  elastography (SWE), and the serologic fibrosis indices aspartate transaminase-to-platelet
  ratio index (APRI) and Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score for Wilson disease (WD). METHODS:
  We retrospectively identified patients with a diagnosis of WD who underwent TE and
  2D SWE on the same day. Their APRI and FIB-4 scores were calculated. Hepatic involvement
  was classified into 5 clinical categories (I-V) based on the laboratory findings,
  hepatic morphologic characteristics on ultrasound (US) imaging, and clinical symptoms
  of cirrhosis: I, normal (n = 17); II, only biochemical abnormality (n = 15); III,
  altered hepatic morphologic characteristics (n = 10); IV, compensated liver cirrhosis
  (n = 3); and V, decompensated liver cirrhosis (n = 0). We compared the area under
  the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) data for TE, 2D SWE, the APRI,
  and the FIB-4 score. A combined assessment of the serologic markers and US elastography
  was performed, and the AUROCs of the combinations were compared. RESULTS: Forty-five
  patients were included in the study (median age, 16.0 years; range, 3-35 years).
  Transient elastography, 2D SWE, and APRI were comparable in distinguishing the clinical
  categories (AUROC, 0.799-0.928). The FIB-4 score showed lower diagnostic value in
  distinguishing clinical category I from the other categories (AUROC, 0.647). Combining
  the serologic markers and US elastography significantly increased the AUROC value
  of the FIB-4 score (with TE and 2D SWE, P = .01 and .02). CONCLUSIONS: Transient
  elastography and 2D SWE showed excellent diagnostic accuracy for differentiating
  the clinical categories of hepatic involvement. The APRI showed better diagnostic
  performance than the FIB-4 score. The assessment of hepatic manifestations in WD
  can be improved by combining US elastography with serologic indices.'
