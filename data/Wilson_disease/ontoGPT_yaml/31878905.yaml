input_text: 'The study of Wilson disease in pregnancy management.INTRODUCTION: Pregnancy
  management in women with Wilson disease (WD) remains an important clinical problem.
  This research was conducted to investigate how to avoid worsening of WD symptoms
  during pregnancy and increase pregnancy success in women with WD by identifying
  the best pregnancy management approaches in these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS:
  The clinical data of 117 pregnancies among 75 women with WD were retrospectively
  analyzed. Related information of the fetus was also recorded and analyzed. At the
  same time, regression analysis was performed for data of 22 pregnant women without
  WD, as normal controls. RESULTS: Of a total of 117 pregnancies among the 75 women
  with WD and 31 pregnancies among the 22 control womenincluded in this study, there
  were 108 successful pregnancies and 9 spontaneous abortions. Among the 108 successful
  pregnancies, 97 women a history of copper chelation therapy before pregnancy; all
  97 women stopped anti-copper therapy during pregnancy. The nine women with spontaneous
  abortion had no pre-pregnancy history of copper displacement therapy. The incidence
  of lower limb edema was higher in the WD group than in normal controls (P = 0.036).
  Compared with the control group, there was a higher proportion in the WD group of
  male infants (P = 0.022) and lower average infant birth weight (t = 3.514, P = 0.001).
  CONCLUSION: It is relatively safe for women with WD patients to become pregnant.
  The best management method for pregnancy in women with WD may be intensive pre-pregnancy
  copper chelation therapy and no anti-copper treatment during pregnancy.'
