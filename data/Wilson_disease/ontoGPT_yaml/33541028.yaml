input_text: '[Advances in the treatment of Wilson Disease].Wilson Disease is kind
  of an autosomal recessive genetic disease. Early diagnosis and timely treatment
  are very important for prognosis. This article reviews the treatment of Wilson Disease,
  focusing on penicillamine, sodium dimercaptopropane sulfonate, ammonium tetrathiomolybdate
  and zinc, liver transplantation and gene therapy. At the same time, the problems
  of medication adherence and follow-up evaluation in patients with Wilson Disease
  are also discussed.'
