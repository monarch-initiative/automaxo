input_text: '[Acute hemolysis crisis revealed a Wilson disease].Wilson disease is
  a rare inherited disorder of copper metabolism that affects liver and brain due
  to copper tissue accumulation. The mechanism involved is based on mutations of the
  ATP7B gene. Children have predominant hepatic manifestations while adult are more
  often diagnosed by neurological and psychiatric symptoms. However, others features
  are tubulopathy, articular disorders and hemolytic anemia. We report the diagnostic
  of Wilson disease in a 14 years old girl and her sibling after investigation of
  hemolytic anemia, hepatic insufficiency, and hypophosphatemia.'
