input_text: 'Sleep disorders in Wilson disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.STUDY
  OBJECTIVES: Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder of
  copper metabolism resulting in pathologic accumulation of copper in many organs
  and tissues. Sleep disorders are highly prevalent in patients with WD. However,
  both prevalence rates and severity of different sleep disorders in patients with
  WD vary widely. The aims of the current study were to systematically review and
  perform a meta-analysis of the association between WD and prevalent sleep disorders,
  including insomnia, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD), excessive
  daytime sleepiness (EDS), sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), restless legs syndrome
  (RLS), periodic limb movement in sleep (PLM), cataplexy-like episodes (CLEs) and
  sleep paralysis, and objective sleep characteristics. METHODS: We performed a systematic
  search of PubMed, EMBase, the Cochrane Library, PsycINFO and ISI Web of Science
  for case-control studies. A total of 7 studies with 501 participants were included.
  RESULTS: We found that 54.1% of patients with WD experience sleep disorders and
  up to 7.65-fold higher odds compared to control patients. Specifically, patients
  with WD had higher rates of RBD, insomnia, and EDS based on self-reported questionnaires.
  No differences were observed in terms of RLS, PLM, or SDB between patients with
  WD and control patients. Furthermore, objective sleep disruptions based on polysomnographic
  studies included prolonged sleep onset latency and REM sleep onset latency, reduced
  total sleep time and sleep efficiency, higher percentage of stage N1 sleep and lower
  percentage of stage N2 sleep were observed in patients with WD. CONCLUSIONS: Our
  study indicates that sleep disorders are frequent in patients with WD. Future studies
  should examine the longitudinal association of WD with sleep disturbances.'
