input_text: Importance of a Liver Biopsy in the Management of Wilson Disease.A 37-year-old
  Wilson disease patient treated with D-penicillamine visited our hospital for the
  evaluation of his liver function. Laboratory data showed a low serum copper level
  and ceruloplasmin. The ratio of urinary copper to urinary creatinine in a spot urinary
  analysis after 4 days' cessation of D-penicillamine was under 0.1. We concluded
  that the copper chelation was excessive and changed D-penicillamine to zinc acetate.
  However, his liver function test results did not normalize. We performed a liver
  biopsy and discovered a high copper content. The liver dysfunction was improved
  after resuming chelating therapy. Accurate measurement of the hepatic copper content
  via a biopsy is important for the adequate management of this disease.
