input_text: "Wilson's disease in Lebanon and regional countries: Homozygosity and
  hepatic phenotype predominance.AIM: To determine the phenotypes and predominant
  disease-causing mutations in Lebanese patients with Wilson's disease, as compared
  to regional non-European data. METHODS: The clinical profile of 36 patients diagnosed
  in Lebanon was studied and their mutations were determined by molecular testing.
  All patients underwent full physical exam, including ophthalmologic slit-lamp examination
  ultrasound imaging of the liver, as well as measurement of serum ceruloplasmin and
  24-h urinary-Cu levels. In addition, genetic screening using PCR followed by sequencing
  to determine disease-causing mutations and polymorphisms in the ATP7B gene was carried
  on extracted DNA from patients and immediate family members. Our phenotypic-genotypic
  findings were then compared to reported mutations in Wilson's disease patients from
  regional Arab and non-European countries. RESULTS: Patients belonged to extended
  consanguineous families. The majority were homozygous for the disease-causing mutation,
  with no predominant mutation identified. The most common mutation, detected in 4
  out of 13 families, involved the ATP hinge region and was present in patients from
  Lebanon, Egypt, Iran and Turkey. Otherwise, mutations in Lebanese patients and those
  of the region were scattered over 17 exons of ATP7B. While the homozygous exon 12
  mutation Trp939Cys was only detected in patients from Lebanon but none from the
  regional countries, the worldwide common mutation H1069Q was not present in the
  Lebanese and was rare in the region. Pure hepatic phenotype was predominant in patients
  from both Lebanon and the region (25%-65%). Furthermore, the majority of patients,
  including those who were asymptomatic, had evidence of some hepatic dysfunction.
  Pure neurologic phenotype was rare. CONCLUSION: Findings do not support presence
  of a founder effect. Clinical and genetic screening is recommended for family members
  with index patients and unexplained hepatic dysfunction."
