input_text: 'Study on different pathogenic factors in different disease stages of
  patients with Wilson disease.OBJECTIVE: To investigate in different stages of patients
  with Wilson disease (WD), there are different pathogenic factors such as metal deposition,
  oxidative stress, and inflammatory response in the brain. METHODS: A total of 32
  untreated WD patients and 10 normal controls were enrolled in the study. The neurological
  symptoms were evaluated using the modified Young scale. Liver function, metal metabolism,
  susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and magnetic
  resonance spectroscopy (MRS) examination were done. The clinical disease stages
  were divided into metal deposition period, fiber damage period, and neuronal necrosis
  period according to the imaging results. The content of 24-h urine copper, serum
  copper, and serum iron; and the levels of catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase
  (GSH-PX), malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), nitric oxide synthase (NOS),
  superoxide dismutase (SOD), interleukin (IL-1), and tumor necrosis factor alpha
  (TNF-alpha) were detected. RESULTS: The contents of urinary copper in WD patients
  at neuronal necrosis stage were lower than those in patients at the metal deposition
  stage (P = 0.011) and fiber injury stage (P = 0.023). The contents of NOS (P = 0.039)
  and NO (P = 0.047) in WD patients at the stage of fiber injury were higher than
  those of the normal control, while GSH-PX (P = 0.025) and CAT (P = 0.041) were lower
  in the neuronal necrosis stage. In the stage of neuronal necrosis, the levels of
  IL-1 (P = 0.030) and TNF-alpha were higher than those of the normal control (P =
  0.042). The neurological symptom scores in patients with fiber injury (P = 0.013)
  and neuron injury were higher than those with metal deposition (P = 0.026). CONCLUSION:
  There are different pathogenic factors in different stages of WD. At the neuronal
  necrosis stage, copper deposition was decreased in WD patients. In the stage of
  fiber injury and neuronal necrosis, there is oxidative stress injury in WD patients.
  In the neuronal necrosis phase, WD patients have an inflammatory response.'
