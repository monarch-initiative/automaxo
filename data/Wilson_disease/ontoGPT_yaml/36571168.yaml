input_text: 'Nomogram for prediction of portal vein system thrombosis after splenectomy
  for hypersplenism in patients with Wilson disease.BACKGROUND: The occurrence of
  portal vein system thrombosis (PVST) after splenectomy in patients with Wilson disease
  (WD) can lead to serious complications. The early identification of high-risk patients
  can help improve patient prognosis. This study aimed to establish and validate a
  personalized nomogram for assessing the risk of PVST after splenectomy in patients
  with WD and hypersplenism. METHODS: We retrospectively collected the data from 81
  patients with WD and hypersplenism who underwent splenectomy. Based on whether PVST
  occurred within a month after the operation, they were divided into the PVST group
  and the non-PVST group. The clinical data of the 2 groups were compared, and univariate
  analysis was used to select the statistically significant features and incorporated
  into the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model
  for optimization. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine
  the independent risk factors for PVST after splenectomy, which were then applied
  to establish a personalized nomogram. We calculated the concordance (C)-index and
  drew the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the model calibration curve,
  and the clinical decision analysis (DCA) curve to evaluate the accuracy, calibration,
  and clinical applicability of the model, respectively. We used bootstrapping for
  internal validation of the model. RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed that the differences
  in preoperative portal vein diameter and velocity of portal blood flow, postoperative
  mean platelet volume (MPV), mean platelet distribution width (PDW), D-dimer, prothrombin
  time (PT), and the increase of platelet count (PLT) were of statistical significance
  (P<0.05). According to the results of the LASSO and multivariate logistic regression
  analyses, a model including preoperative portal vein diameter, preoperative portal
  blood flow velocity, postoperative D-dimer, and the increase of PLT was established
  to predict the risk of PVST after splenectomy. The model showed good accuracy with
  a C-index of 0.838 (95% CI: 0.750-0.926) and had a well-fitted calibration curve.
  Furthermore, internal validation showed it achieved a moderate C-index of 0.805.
  The DCA curve indicated that the model has clinical applicability when patients
  are treated at thresholds of 2-100%. CONCLUSIONS: Establishing a predictive model
  for the risk of PVST in patients with WD and hypersplenism after splenectomy can
  help clinicians identify patients at high risk of PVST who require intervention
  measures.'
