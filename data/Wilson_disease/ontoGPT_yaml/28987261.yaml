input_text: 'Wilson Disease: Diagnosis, Treatment, and Follow-up.Consideration of
  a diagnosis of Wilson disease is still the critical factor in testing for and establishing
  disease diagnosis. In association with other clinical and biochemical tests, liver
  biopsy results and molecular genetic testing can also be used to generate a score
  for diagnosing Wilson disease. Medical therapy is effective for most patients; liver
  transplant can rescue those with acute liver failure or those with advanced liver
  disease who fail to respond to or discontinue medical therapy. Treatment monitoring
  must be done at regular intervals and includes clinical evaluation, liver tests
  and blood counts, and copper metabolic parameters.'
