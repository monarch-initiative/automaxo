input_text: 'Complications of Liver Transplant in Adult Patients With the Hepatic
  Form of Wilson Disease.OBJECTIVES: Wilson disease is an autosomal, recessive, inherited
  disorder of copper metabolism that results in the accumulation of copper in many
  organs and tissues. This disease is mainly characterized by dysfunction due to copper
  accumulation in the liver, kidney, brain, cornea, bone, heart, and blood cells.
  The clinical spectrum is broad in Wilson disease. Asymptomatic Wilson disease may
  be present, but findings related to the involvement of an individual organ or multiple
  organ failure can be seen. These findings can include neurologic and neuropsychiatric
  complications. Our aim here was to examine the neurologic complications and our
  clinical experience in patients who underwent liver transplant for Wilson disease
  in our clinic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records
  of transplant patients with Wilson disease who were seen at Baskent University Faculty
  of Medicine Transplantation Science between 2005 and 2017. Patient demographics,
  neurologic complaints, findings from neurologic examinations, and imaging findings
  were recorded. We also recorded the presence of the Kayser-Fleischer ring, serum
  ceruloplasmin, 24-hour copper urine levels, and levels of dry copper in liver in
  each patient. RESULTS: Our study included 19 patients who ranged in age range from
  18 to 44 years (mean age of 26 years). Seven of 19 patients (36.8%) had neurologic
  symptoms, including epileptic seizures in 2 patients (10.5%), encephalopathy in
  1 patient (5.2%), tremor in 3 patients (15.7%), and headache in 1 patient (5.2%).
  The cause of these long-term neurologic complications was the immunosuppressive
  drugs. Patients with epileptic seizures were provided with seizure control medication
  (levetiracetam). Tremor did not need treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In Wilson disease,
  neurologic complications can be severe. The most common complication seen in our
  patients was tremor. Early diagnosis and treatment may slow down neurologic disability.'
