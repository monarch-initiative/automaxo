input_text: "Liver transplantation as a rescue therapy for severe neurologic forms
  of Wilson disease.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of liver transplantation (LT)
  in patients with Wilson disease (WD) with severe neurologic worsening resistant
  to active chelation. METHODS: French patients with WD who underwent LT for pure
  neurologic indication were retrospectively studied. Before LT and at the last follow-up,
  neurologic impairment was evaluated with the Unified Wilson's Disease Rating Scale
  (UWDRS) score, disability with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score, and hepatic
  function with the Model for End-stage Liver Disease score, together with the presence
  of a Kayser-Fleischer ring (KFR), brain MRI scores, and copper balance. The survival
  rate and disability at the last follow-up were the coprimary outcomes; evolution
  of KFR and brain MRI were the secondary outcomes. Prognosis factors were further
  assessed. RESULTS: Eighteen patients had LT. All were highly dependent before LT
  (median mRS score 5). Neurologic symptoms were severe (median UWDRS score 105),
  dominated by dystonia and parkinsonism. The cumulated survival rate was 88.8% at
  1 year and 72.2% at 3 and 5 years. At the last follow-up, 14 patients were alive.
  Their mRS and UWDRS scores improved (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0003). Eight patients
  had a major improvement (78% decrease of the UWDRS score), 4 a moderate one (41%
  decrease), and 2 a stable status. KFR and brain MRI scores improved (p = 0.0007).
  Severe sepsis (p = 0.011) and intensive care unit admission (p = 0.001) before LT
  were significantly associated with death. CONCLUSIONS: LT is a rescue therapeutic
  option that should be carefully discussed in selected patients with neurologic WD
  resistant to anticopper therapies (chelators or zinc salts) as it might allow patients
  to gain physical independency with a reasonable risk. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE:
  This study provides Class IV evidence that for patients with WD with severe neurologic
  worsening resistant to active pharmacologic therapy, LT might decrease neurologic
  impairment."
