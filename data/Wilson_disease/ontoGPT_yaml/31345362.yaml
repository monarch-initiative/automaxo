input_text: "The effects of iron and zinc status on prognosis in pediatric Wilson's
  disease.OBJECTIVES: Wilson's disease (WD) is a metabolic disorder leading to hepatic
  and extrahepatic copper deposition. Several studies have reported that besides copper
  (Cu), iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) are also accumulated at varying levels in various
  tissues in WD. However, there is not an adequate number of studies investigating
  the effects of Fe and Zn status on WD presentation and prognosis. We aimed to evaluate
  serum levels of ferritin (SFr), copper (SCu), and zinc (SZn) in WD and determine
  their role in disease presentation and prognosis. MATERIALS-METHOD: We retrospectively
  reviewed the medical records of 97 pediatric patients with WD who were diagnosed
  and followed at Inonu University Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition
  Department between January 2006 and May 2017. Serum Cu and Zn levels were analyzed
  by using flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Ferritin was analyzed by chemiluminescence
  immunoassay method. RESULTS: Analysis of serum levels of the elements according
  to the type of presentation, there was no significant difference between the groups
  for ceruloplasmin. However, SCU, FSCu, SFr and 24 h urinary copper levels were significantly
  higher (p = 0.002, p = 0.003, p = 0.023 and p < 0.001, respectively) and SZn and
  CSZn levels were significantly lower (fulminant WD). p < 0.001, p < 0.001). There
  was a positive correlation between SFr, SCu serum levels and mortality scores (respectively,
  r: 0.501, 0.564 for PELD, r:0.490, 0.504 for MELD, r: 0.345, 0.374 for Dhwan), and
  a negative correlation between SZn level and mortality scores. (r:-0.650 for PELD,
  r:-0.703 for MELD, r:-0.642 for Dhwan) We used the ROC curves to determine the worst
  prognosis for fulminant Wilson disease. According to these limit values, we found
  that the sensitivity and specificity of FWD development was significantly higher.
  (for SZn sensitivity of 91.5%, a specificity of 100%, p=<0,001, for SCu predicted
  FWD development with a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 73.7%, p=<0,001, for
  SFr predicted FWD development with a sensitivity of 92.9%, a specificity of 66.2%,
  p < 0,001) CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that SFr, SCu, SZn levels might have prognostic
  importance for WD."
