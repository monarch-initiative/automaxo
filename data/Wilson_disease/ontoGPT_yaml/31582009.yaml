input_text: 'Genetic Causes of Liver Disease: When to Suspect a Genetic Etiology,
  Initial Lab Testing, and the Basics of Management.Genetic causes of liver disease
  lead to a wide range of presentations. This article describes hereditary hemochromatosis,
  Gilbert syndrome, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, Wilson disease, PFIC, BRIC, and
  LAL-D. The most common cause of hereditary hemochromatosis is a C282Y mutation in
  the HFE gene. Gilbert syndrome is a benign cause of indirect hyperbilirubinemia.
  Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency causes both lung and liver disease. Wilson disease
  can cause neurologic disease and liver disease. Progressive familial intrahepatic
  cholestasis and benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis are rare causes of cholestasis.
  LAL-D is a rare disease that can appear similar to NAFLD in adults.'

  Split the following piece of text into fields in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
  object: <A sign or symptom associated with the disease and targeted by the medical action. For example, Low serum calcitriol, hypoplasia of the thymus, chronic cough, aortic stiffness, low pulse pressure>
  qualifier: <The primary disease the relationship is about, or specifically the disease the symptom is related to. For example, Beck-Fahrner syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, progeria, diabetes mellitus, infectious otitis media>
