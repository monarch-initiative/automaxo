input_text: Structural and functional brain changes in hepatic and neurological Wilson
  disease.Wilson disease (WD) can manifest with hepatic or neuropsychiatric symptoms.
  Our understanding of the in vivo brain changes in WD, particularly in the hepatic
  phenotype, is limited. Thirty subjects with WD and 30 age- and gender-matched controls
  participated. WD group underwent neuropsychiatric assessment. Unified WD Rating
  Scale neurological exam scores were used to determine neurological (WDN, score >
  0) and hepatic-only (WDH, score 0) subgroups. All subjects underwent 3 Tesla anatomical
  and resting-state functional MRI. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and susceptibility-weighted
  imaging (SWI) were performed only in the WD group. Volumetric, DTI, and functional
  connectivity analyses were performed to determine between-group differences. WDN
  and WDH groups were matched in demographic and psychiatric profiles. The entire
  WD group compared to controls showed significant thinning in the bilateral superior
  frontal cortex. The WDN group compared to control and WDH groups showed prominent
  structural brain changes including significant striatal and thalamic atrophy, more
  subcortical hypointense lesions on SWI, and diminished white matter integrity in
  the bilateral anterior corona radiata and corpus callosum. However, the WDH group
  also showed significant white matter volume loss compared to controls. The functional
  connectivity between the frontostriatal nodes was significantly reduced in the WDN
  group, whereas that of the hippocampus was significantly increased in the WDH group
  compared to controls. In summary, structural and functional brain changes were present
  even in neurologically non-manifesting WD patients in this cross-sectional study.
  Longitudinal brain MRI scans may be useful as biomarkers for prognostication and
  optimization of treatment strategies in WD.
