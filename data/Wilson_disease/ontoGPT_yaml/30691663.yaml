input_text: "Brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) as a diagnostic tool for
  detecting early neurological changes in children with Wilson's disease.PURPOSE:
  Although brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) imaging findings in adult Wilson
  disease (WD) have been explained in extensive details, a paucity of information
  currently exists regarding brain MRS imaging findings in pediatric WD. The purpose
  of this study was to clarify the role of brain MRS in detecting early metabolite
  abnormalities in children with WD. PATIENT AND METHODS: A case-controlled prospective
  study included 26 children with WD and 26 healthy controls. All children were subjected
  to examination on a 1.5 T MRI scanner. The spectra of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA),
  choline (Cho), and creatine (Cr), as well as the metabolite ratios of NAA/Cho, NAA/Cr,
  and Cho/Cr, were measured and compared between two groups. RESULTS: Eight patients
  revealed increased signal intensity in the basal ganglia at T1-weighted images.
  When compared with healthy controls, WD patients showed a significant decrease (p
  <  0.05) in NAA (63.8 +- 9.6 vs 97.6 +- 3.8), Cho (46.7 +- 8.9 vs 87.3 +- 4.7),
  Cr (44 +- 10.1 vs 81.9 +- 4.05), NAA/Cho (1.92 +- 1.2 vs 3.34 +- 0.55), NAA/Cr (1.29
  +- 0.7 vs 2.46 +- 0.34), and Cho/Cr (0.78 +- 0.4 vs 2 +- 0.13). Patients complicated
  with liver cell failure showed a significant decrease in all previous parameters
  (p <  0.05) than patients without complications. Patients with mixed neurological
  and hepatic diseases showed a severe reduction in NAA, NAA/Cr, and NAA/Cho compared
  with patients with hepatic disease only. CONCLUSION: MRS in pediatric WD detects
  early neurological changes even with normal MRI."
