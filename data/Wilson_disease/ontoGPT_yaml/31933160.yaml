input_text: 'Recessive Ataxia Differential Diagnosis Algorithm (RADIAL) Versus Specific
  Niemann-Pick Type C Suspicion Indices: A Retrospective Algorithm Comparison.Early
  diagnosis of Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is crucial to slow the progression
  of neurological manifestations. Different tools were developed to aid diagnosis
  of NPC, but to date, no study has compared their performance. We aimed to compare
  the RADIAL algorithm, intended for the differential diagnosis of autosomal recessive
  cerebellar ataxias (ARCAs) and NPC-specific suspicion indices (SIs). This study
  was a retrospective analysis of data from 834 patients with molecularly confirmed
  ARCAs, including 57 NPC cases (RADIAL cohort). We aimed to compare the algorithm
  performance of RADIAL (Top 1 and Top 3) with that of four SIs (Original, Refined,
  2/3 and 2/7) in discriminating NPC cases and non-NPC cases. We also identified ARCAs
  closely related to NPC as those with low specificity to detect non-NPC cases and
  described differential and overlapping features with NPC. Overall, excellent sensitivity
  and specificity (> 0.90) were achieved with both RADIAL and SI tools for NPC cases.
  The highest sensitivity was attained with the 2/7 SI, Refined SI and Top 3 RADIAL
  algorithms. Top 1 and Top 3 RADIAL were the most specific tools, followed by the
  Original SI. The individual comparison of each ARCA revealed that Wilson disease,
  PLA2G6-associated neurodegeneration, and hypomyelinating leukodystrophy (POLR3A)
  are frequent NPC false positives (PLA2G6 and POL3A only with the SIs). Both RADIAL
  and SI diagnostic approaches showed strong discriminatory potential and may be useful
  screening tools in different clinical contexts.'
