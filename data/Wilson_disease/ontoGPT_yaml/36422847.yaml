input_text: "Plugged percutaneous liver biopsy using Tru-cut needle and coils: A retrospective
  study.BACKGROUND: Plugged percutaneous liver biopsy, though has been in use for
  many years, is being used more frequently in patients in whom percutaneous liver
  biopsy is contraindicated due to proven or probable bleeding tendencies. We report
  our experience with this procedure, its indications, efficacy, and complications
  in Indian population over 2 years. METHODS: A retrospective study of 127 consecutive
  patients who had undergone plug liver biopsy from April 2017 to May 2019 was done
  from the database maintained in our department. The indications, technical success,
  complications, and impact of histological diagnosis on the management of those patients
  were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 127 biopsies were performed of which 68 were
  males and 59 were females, aged between 7 and 73 years. No procedures were abandoned;
  however, 13 cases needed ultrasonography (USG) guidance because of small size of
  the liver or presence of right perihepatic fluid. Out of 127 biopsies, none of the
  samples was inadequate and yielded adequate tissue for histopathological diagnosis.
  Seven patients required repeat study only because underlying liver disease was suspected
  clinically and the previous biopsy report had turned out to be normal. Histopathological
  examination in our study showed autoimmune hepatitis in 61, cirrhotic changes either
  hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) related in 40, veno-occlusive
  disease in 3, cholestatic disease in 2, and Wilson's disease in 2 patients. The
  remaining 19 were normal. Complications occurred in 3 patients - arterioportal fistula,
  pneumothorax, and inadequate coiling causing mild hemoperitoneum. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous
  liver biopsy followed by plugging of the tract with coils is a safe, easy, and effective
  method in patients with underlying bleeding tendencies, minimal ascites, and small
  liver."
