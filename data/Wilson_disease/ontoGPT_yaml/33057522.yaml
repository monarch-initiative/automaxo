input_text: The blood copper isotopic composition is a prognostic indicator of the
  hepatic injury in Wilson disease.Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder
  of copper (Cu) metabolism. The gene responsible for WD, ATP7B, is involved in the
  cellular transport of Cu, and mutations in the ATP7B gene induce accumulation of
  Cu in the liver and ultimately in the brain. In a pilot study, the natural variations
  of copper stable isotope ratios (65Cu/63Cu) in the serum of WD patients have been
  shown to differ from that of healthy controls. In the present study, we challenged
  these first results by measuring the 65Cu/63Cu ratios in the blood of treated (n
  = 25), naive patients (n = 11) and age matched healthy controls (n = 75). The results
  show that naive patients and healthy controls exhibit undistinguishable 65Cu/63Cu
  ratios, implying that the Cu isotopic ratio cannot serve as a reliable diagnostic
  biomarker. The type of treatment (d-penicillamine vs. triethylenetetramine) does
  not affect the 65Cu/63Cu ratios in WD patients, which remain constant regardless
  of the type and duration of the treatment. In addition, the 65Cu/63Cu ratios do
  not vary in naive patients after the onset of the treatment. However, the 65Cu/63Cu
  ratios decrease with the degree of liver fibrosis and the gradient of the phenotypic
  presentation, i.e. presymptomatic, hepatic and neurologic. To get insights into
  the mechanisms at work, we study the effects of the progress of the WD on the organism
  by measuring the Cu concentrations and the 65Cu/63Cu ratios in the liver, feces
  and plasma of 12 and 45 week old Atp7b-/- mice. The evolution of the 65Cu/63Cu ratios
  is marked by a decrease in all tissues. The results show that 63Cu accumulates in
  the liver preferentially to 65Cu due to the preferential cellular entry of 63Cu
  and the impairment of the 63Cu exit by ceruloplasmin. The hepatic accumulation of
  monovalent 63Cu+ is likely to fuel the production of free radicals, which is potentially
  an explanation of the pathogenicity of WD. Altogether, the results suggest that
  the blood 65Cu/63Cu ratio recapitulates WD progression and is a potential prognostic
  biomarker of WD.
