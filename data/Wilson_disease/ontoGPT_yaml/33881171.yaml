input_text: "Optical coherence tomography in patients with Wilson's disease.OBJECTIVES:
  Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder that leads to copper accumulation
  and deposition in different organs, frequently affecting visual pathways. Recent
  studies have detected morphological changes of the retina in patients with WD using
  optical coherence tomography (OCT). Measuring the thickness of the retinal nerve
  fibre layer (RNFL) with OCT provides an objective assessment of integrity and morphological
  abnormalities of the retina. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship
  between OCT parameters and form of the disease, therapy and symptoms duration, as
  well as severity of neurological impairment. METHODS: The study comprised of 52
  patients with WD and 52 healthy controls (HC). All the patients were on a regular
  and stable chelation therapy and/or zinc salts. Patients were divided into two groups,
  with neurological (NWD) or hepatic form of the disease (HWD). OCT was performed
  to assess the RNFL thickness. RESULTS: The WD patients had significantly lower intraocular
  pressure in both eyes and lower RNFL thickness than the HC. There were no differences
  between NWD and HWD in any of the ophthalmologically tested parameters. No significant
  correlations were found between clinical features and retinal thickness parameters.
  Stratification of the cohort according to the disease duration showed that disease
  duration did not influence the RNFL thickness. CONCLUSION: We found that involvement
  of the retina represented a subclinical finding in neurologically intact patients
  in the HWD group. Nevertheless, the value of OCT as a biomarker for the assessment
  of the clinical course and progression of WD still remains uncertain."
