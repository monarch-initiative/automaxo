input_text: 'The dilemma to diagnose Wilson disease by genetic testing alone.BACKGROUND:
  Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of hepatic copper excretion.
  About sixty per cent of patients present with liver disease. WD is considered a
  fatal disease if undiagnosed and/or untreated but recent data indicate that disease
  penetrance may not be 100%. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients underwent liver
  biopsy as part of the diagnostic workup. Genetic testing for ATP7B was performed
  by Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: We report on a large family with multiple affected
  siblings. The first patient (male, 31 years) underwent orthotopic liver transplantation
  (OLT) because of fulminant WD. He was homozygous for p.G710A. One asymptomatic brother
  (37 years) had the same mutation. He is doing well on chelation therapy. Fifteen
  years later, a second-degree sibling (female, 16 years) presented with fulminant
  WD and underwent OLT. She was compound heterozygote (p.G710A/p.G710S). Further family
  screening revealed a third mutation (p.V536A) in a female (21 years) and male (16
  years) compound-heterozygote sibling (p.G710A/p.V536A). In both, serum ceruloplasmin
  and 24-hour urinary copper excretion were normal. Liver biopsy showed normal histology
  and a quantitative hepatic copper content within the normal range or only slightly
  elevated (19 and 75 mug/g dry weight, respectively). No decoppering treatment was
  initiated so far. CONCLUSION: Genetic testing alone is not always sufficient to
  diagnose WD in asymptomatic patients, and human mutation databases should be used
  with caution. Even patients carrying two disease-causing mutations do not necessarily
  have demonstrable alteration of copper metabolism. Asymptomatic siblings diagnosed
  by genetic screening require further testing before initiating treatment.'
