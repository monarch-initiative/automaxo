input_text: "Comparative assessment of clinical rating scales in Wilson's disease.BACKGROUND:
  Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism resulting
  in multifaceted neurological, hepatic, and psychiatric symptoms. The objective of
  the study was to comparatively assess two clinical rating scales for WD, the Unified
  Wilson's Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS) and the Global Assessment Scale for Wilson's
  disease (GAS for WD), and to test the feasibility of the patient reported part of
  the UWDRS neurological subscale (termed the \"minimal UWDRS\"). METHODS: In this
  prospective, monocentric, cross-sectional study, 65 patients (median age 35 [range:
  15-62] years; 33 female, 32 male) with treated WD were scored according to the two
  rating scales. RESULTS: The UWDRS neurological subscore correlated with the GAS
  for WD Tier 2 score (r = 0.80; p < 0.001). Correlations of the UWDRS hepatic subscore
  and the GAS for WD Tier 1 score with both the Model for End Stage Liver Disease
  (MELD) score (r = 0.44/r = 0.28; p < 0.001/p = 0.027) and the Child-Pugh score (r
  = 0.32/r = 0.12; p = 0.015/p = 0.376) were weak. The \"minimal UWDRS\" score significantly
  correlated with the UWDRS total score (r = 0.86), the UWDRS neurological subscore
  (r = 0.89), and the GAS for WD Tier 2 score (r = 0.86). CONCLUSIONS: The UWDRS neurological
  and psychiatric subscales and the GAS for WD Tier 2 score are valuable tools for
  the clinical assessment of WD patients. The \"minimal UWDRS\" is a practical prescreening
  tool outside scientific trials."
