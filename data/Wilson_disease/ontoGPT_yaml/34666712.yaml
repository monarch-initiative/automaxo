input_text: 'Immunoglobulin a nephropathy as the first clinical presentation of Wilson
  disease: a case report and literature review.BACKGROUND: Wilson disease (WD) is
  a rare genetic disorder of copper metabolism. Differences in copper tissue accumulation
  lead to various clinical manifestations, including some atypical presentations.
  The complex clinical features of WD make diagnosis challenging, delaying the best
  chance for treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 26-year-old man with
  nephritis-range proteinuria and elevated serum creatinine. The renal pathology indicated
  immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy and tubular injury, which was inconsistent with
  glomerular lesions. Cirrhosis was also detected by imaging examination. Considering
  both kidney injury and liver damage, WD was suspected. Based on results showing
  abnormal copper metabolism, corneal Kayser-Fleischer rings, and genetic disorders
  in the ATP7B gene, the patient was finally diagnosed with WD. After treatment with
  oral penicillamine, zinc sulfate and losartan, the patient showed alleviation of
  both WD and nephropathy after 3 years of follow-up. He maintained a good quality
  of daily life. CONCLUSION: This case highlights that unexplained neurological and
  liver symptoms in patients with IgA nephropathy can be clues for WD.'
