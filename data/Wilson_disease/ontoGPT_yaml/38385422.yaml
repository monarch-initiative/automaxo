input_text: Management of Tacrolimus-Induced Toxicity With Normal Serum Levels After
  Liver Transplant.Drug-induced liver injury after liver transplant occurs in 1.7%
  of patients. Tacrolimus is an effective immunosuppressant that is used to treat
  acute rejection. Although rare, it can cause toxicity, which is demonstrated by
  cholestatic liver injury. Here, we present a case of a young male patient who was
  diagnosed with Wilson disease, had penicillaminechelating therapy, and underwent
  living related liver transplant. Within 1 month posttransplant, he developed deranged,
  predominantly cholestatic pattern liver function tests. Laboratory parameters showed
  total bilirubin of 1.12 mg/ dL, alanine aminotransferase of 553 IU/L, gammaglutamyltransferase
  of 624 IU/L, and tacrolimus level of 10.2 ng/mL. After thorough evaluation, a liver
  biopsy was performed. Liver biopsy showed hepatocellular necrosis with centrilobular
  cholestasis without any evidence of graft rejection. However, with normal level
  of tacrolimus, the biopsy was suggestive of drug-induced liver injury. Thus, tacrolimus
  dose was reduced, resulting in improved liver function tests and patient discharge
  from the hospital. Tacrolimus is an effective immunosuppressant after liver transplant
  and has the ability to treat early acute rejection. The patient's liver biopsy showed
  hepatocellular necrosis with centrilobular cholestasis without any evidence of graft
  rejection. Cholestatic liver injury after tacrolimus usually resolves after dose
  reduction or by switching to another agent. With demonstrated tacrolimus-induced
  toxicity in liver transplant recipients, despite normal serum levels, transplant
  physicians should keep high index of suspicion regarding toxicity in the posttransplant
  setting.
