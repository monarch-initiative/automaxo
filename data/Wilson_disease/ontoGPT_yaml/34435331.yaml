input_text: 'Neuropsychiatric Manifestations of Wilson Disease: Correlation with MRI
  and Glutamate Excitotoxicity.This study aims to identify neuropsychiatric manifestations
  in neurological Wilson disease (NWD), and their correlation with MRI changes and
  glutamate excitotoxicity. Forty-three consecutive patients with NWD from a tertiary
  care teaching hospital were evaluated prospectively who fulfilled the inclusion
  criteria. The neuropsychiatric evaluation was done using Neuropsychiatric Inventory
  (NPI) battery that assesses 12 domains including delusion, hallucination, agitation/aggression,
  dysphoria/depression, anxiety, euphoria, apathy, disinhibition, irritability, aberrant
  motor activity, appetite change, and abnormal nighttime behavior. Cranial MRI was
  done using a 3 T machine, and locations of signal changes were noted including the
  total number of MRI lesions. Serum glutamate level was measured by a fluorescence
  microplate reader. Abnormal NPI in various domains and total NPI scores were correlated
  with MRI lesions, serum and urinary copper, and glutamate level. The median age
  of the patients was 16 years. Forty-one (48.8%) patients had cognitive impairment
  and 37 (86%) had movement disorder. Neurobehavioral abnormality was detected in
  all-commonest being agitation (90.7%) followed by appetite change (81.4%), elation
  (74.4%), irritability (69.8%), anxiety (67.4%), depression (65.1%), apathy (44.2%),
  night time abnormal behavior (32.6%), aberrant motor behavior (20.9%), delusions
  (16.3%), and hallucination (18.6%). The thalamic lesion was associated with depression,
  globus pallidus with depression and anxiety, caudate with anxiety and agitation,
  brainstem with irritability, and frontal cortex with apathy. Serum glutamate level
  was higher in NWD. NPI sum score correlated with MRI load and glutamate level. Varying
  severity of neurobehavioral abnormalities are common in the patients with NWD and
  correlate with the location of MRI lesion and glutamate level.'
