input_text: 'Blind liver biopsy: a 17-year experience.OBJECTIVES: Liver biopsy is
  the gold standard for assessing liver inflammation, necrosis and fibrosis. The aim
  of the study is to evaluate clinical indications and histopathological results of
  percutaneus liver biopsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 516 children who underwent
  blind liver biopsy were evaluated retrospectively. RESULTS: Blind liver biopsy was
  performed for chronic active hepatitis B in 50% of the cases (n=260), neonatal cholestasis
  in 14% (n=68), autoimmune hepatitis in 7.7% (n=40), Wilson disease in 7.3% (n=38),
  isolated elevation of the liver enzymes in 5% (n=26), chronic active hepatitis C
  in 4.2% (n=22), metabolic disease in 3.4% (n=17), malignancies in 2.2% (n=11) and
  the others in 3.4% (n=17). Major complications were observed in 0.19% of the cases
  (n=1) and minor complications such as pain at the biopsy site in 13.5% of the cases
  (n=70), hypotension and tachycardia in 1.9% (n=10). CONCLUSIONS: Blind liver biopsy
  is a safe method in diagnosing liver diseases in childhood.'
