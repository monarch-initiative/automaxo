input_text: 'Differential hepatic features presenting in Wilson disease-associated
  cirrhosis and hepatitis B-associated cirrhosis.BACKGROUND: Cirrhosis is a chronic
  late stage liver disease associated with hepatitis viruses, alcoholism, and metabolic
  disorders, such as Wilson disease (WD). There are no clear markers or clinical features
  that define cirrhosis originating from these disparate origins. We hypothesized
  that cirrhosis is not one disease and cirrhosis of different etiology may have differential
  clinical hepatic features. AIM: To delineate the liver features between WD-associated
  cirrhosis and hepatitis B-associated cirrhosis in the Chinese population. METHODS:
  In this observational study, we reviewed the medical data of consecutive inpatients
  who had WD-associated cirrhosis or hepatitis B-associated cirrhosis from January
  2010 to August 2018, and excluded patients who had carcinoma, severe heart or pulmonary
  diseases, or other liver diseases. According to the etiology of cirrhosis, patients
  were divided into two groups: WD-associated cirrhosis group (60 patients) and hepatitis
  B-associated cirrhosis group (56 patients). The liver fibrosis degree, liver function
  indices, and portal hypertension features of these patients were compared between
  the two groups. RESULTS: No inter-group differences were observed in the diagnostic
  liver fibrosis markers, however, clinical features clearly defined the origin of
  cirrhosis. WD-associated cirrhosis patients (16-29 years) had lower levels of alanine
  transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and bilirubin, lower prothrombin time, lower
  incidence of hepatic encephalopathy, and lower portal vein diameter (P < 0.05),
  compared to cirrhosis resulting from hepatitis B in older patients (45-62 years).
  Importantly, they had decreased risks of progression from Child-Pugh grade A to
  B (odds ratio = 0.046, 95% confidence interval: 0.006-0.387, P = 0.005) and of ascites
  (odds ratio = 0.08, 95% confidence interval: 0.01-0.48, P = 0.005). Conversely,
  WD-associated cirrhosis patients had a higher risk of splenomegaly (odds ratio =
  4.15, 95% confidence interval: 1.38-12.45, P = 0.011). CONCLUSION: WD-associated
  cirrhosis presents a higher risk of splenomegaly associated with leukopenia and
  thrombocytopenia, although revealing milder liver dysfunction and portal hypertension
  symptoms, which recommends WD patients to be monitored for associated complications.'
