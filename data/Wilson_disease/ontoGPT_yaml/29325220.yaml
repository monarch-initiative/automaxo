input_text: 'Profile, risk factors and outcome of acute kidney injury in paediatric
  acute-on-chronic liver failure.BACKGROUND & AIMS: There are no studies on acute
  kidney injury in paediatric acute-on-chronic liver failure. This study was planned
  with aim to describe the clinical presentation and outcome of acute kidney injury
  among paediatric acute-on-chronic liver failure patients. METHODS: Data of all children
  1-18 years of age presenting with acute chronic liver failure (Asia pacific association
  for the study of the liver definition) was reviewed. Acute kidney injury was defined
  as per Kidney Diseases-Improving Global Outcomes guidelines. Poor outcome was defined
  as death or need for liver transplant within 3 months of development of acute kidney
  injury. RESULTS: A total of 84 children with acute-on-chronic liver failure were
  presented to us in the study period. Acute kidney injury developed in 22.6% of patients
  with acute-on-chronic liver failure. The median duration from acute-on-chronic liver
  failure to development of acute kidney injury was 4 weeks (Range: 2-10 weeks). The
  causes of acute kidney injury were hepatorenal syndrome (31.6%), sepsis (31.6%),
  nephrotoxic drugs (21%), dehydration (10.5%) and bile pigment related acute tubular
  necrosis in one patient. On univariate analysis, higher baseline bilirubin, higher
  international normalized ratio, higher paediatric end stage liver disease, presence
  of systemic inflammatory response syndrome and presence of spontaneous bacterial
  peritonitis had significant association with presence of acute kidney injury. On
  logistic regression analysis, presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome
  (adjusted OR: 8.659, 95% CI: 2.18-34.37, P = .002) and higher baseline bilirubin
  (adjusted OR: 1.07, 95% CI: 1.008-1.135, P = .025) were independently associated
  with presence of acute kidney injury. Of the patients with acute kidney injury,
  5(26.3%) survived with native liver, 10(52.6%) died and 4 (21.1%) underwent liver
  transplantation. CONCLUSION: Acute kidney injury developed in 22.6% of children
  with acute-on-chronic liver failure. Bilirubin more than 17.7 mg/dL and presence
  of systemic inflammatory response syndrome were high risk factors for acute kidney
  injury. Development of acute kidney injury in a child with acute-on-chronic liver
  failure suggests poor outcome and need for early intervention.'
