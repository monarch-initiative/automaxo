input_text: 'CCDC115-CDG: A new rare and misleading inherited cause of liver disease.Congenital
  disorders of glycosylation (CDG) linked to defects in Golgi apparatus homeostasis
  constitute an increasing part of these rare inherited diseases. Among them, COG-CDG,
  ATP6V0A2-CDG, TMEM199-CDG and CCDC115-CDG have been shown to disturb Golgi vesicular
  trafficking and/or lumen pH acidification. Here, we report 3 new unrelated cases
  of CCDC115-CDG with emphasis on diagnosis difficulties related to strong phenotypic
  similarities with mitochondriopathies, Niemann-Pick disease C and Wilson Disease.
  Indeed, while two individuals clinically presented with early and severe liver fibrosis
  and cirrhosis associated with neurological symptoms, the other one "only" showed
  isolated and late severe liver involvement. Biological results were similar to previously
  described patients, including hypercholesterolemia, elevated alkaline phosphatases
  and defects in copper metabolism. CDG screening and glycosylation study finally
  led to the molecular diagnosis of CCDC115-CDG. Besides pointing to the importance
  of CDG screening in patients with unexplained and severe liver disease, these reports
  expand the clinical and molecular phenotypes of CCDC115-CDG. The hepatic involvement
  is particularly addressed. Furthermore, hypothesis concerning the pathogenesis of
  the liver disease and of major biological abnormalities are proposed.'
