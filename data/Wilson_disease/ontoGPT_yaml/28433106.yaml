input_text: Novel perspectives on Wilson disease treatment.Wilson disease is an autosomal-recessive
  copper overload disorder causing hepatic and neurologic symptoms. Commonly used
  medical therapy shows satisfactory results with regard to hepatic disease but only
  limited effects in neurologically affected patients. In recent years several new
  therapy options have been developed, showing promising results that might improve
  the management of Wilson disease in the near future. Optimization of treatment regimens
  depending on biochemical response pattern seems worthwhile, especially in the decoppering
  phase of therapy. The chelator tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) is a promising therapy option,
  currently under clinical investigation. TTM is a fast-acting and very potent chelator
  and appears to be associated with early neurologic deterioration after initiation
  of therapy to a lower extent than the drugs currently used. Treatment with nonchelating
  drugs characterized by alternative modes of action is under investigation, but restricted
  to animal or in vitro studies to date. This includes basic research studies demonstrating
  proof of principle for successful cell or gene therapy in Wilson disease in order
  to restore sufficient biliary copper excretion, even before the onset of disease.
