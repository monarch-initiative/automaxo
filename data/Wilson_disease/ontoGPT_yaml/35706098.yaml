input_text: "Long-Term Urinary Copper Excretion and Exchangeable Copper in Children
  With Wilson Disease Under Chelation Therapy.OBJECTIVES: Determining 24-hour urinary
  copper excretion (UCE) levels is useful for diagnosing Wilson's disease (WD) and
  for treatment monitoring. Exchangeable copper (ExC) is a novel potential marker,
  but its long-term changes have never been described in patients under chelation
  therapy. Our aim was to describe the long-term changes in ExC levels compared to
  UCE levels in symptomatic WD pediatric patients under chelation therapy. METHODS:
  A retrospective, descriptive, and analytical study including all patients under
  18 years of age, diagnosed between 2006 and 2020, and treated with chelation therapy
  was conducted at the National Reference Center for WD in Lyon. Ceruloplasmin levels,
  serum copper, 24 h-UCE, ExC, and liver enzymes at diagnosis and during follow-up
  were analyzed. RESULTS: Our study included 36 patients, predominantly with hepatic
  form of WD (n = 31). The median [interquartile range (IQR)] age at diagnosis was
  10.5 (8.4-13.1) years, and the median (IQR) follow-up duration was 6.3 (3.3-8.8)
  years. At diagnosis, the median (IQR) ExC value was 1.01 (0.60-1.52) micromol/L.
  There was a significant decrease during the first year of chelation treatment (
  P = 0.0008), then a stabilization. The median (IQR) ExC values was 0.38 (0.22-0.63)
  micromol/L at 12-18 months and 0.43 (0.31-0.54) micromol/L at 5 years of chelation
  treatment ( P = 0.4057). Similarly, there was a significant decrease in 24-hour
  UCE ( P < 0.001) during the first year of chelation treatment, then a stabilization.
  CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed a significant decrease in ExC and 24-hour UCE levels
  during the first year of follow-up; The dynamics of both biomarkers were similar
  along the follow-up, demonstrating their usefulness in clinical practice for monitoring
  WD."
