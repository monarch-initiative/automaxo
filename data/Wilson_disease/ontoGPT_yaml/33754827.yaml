input_text: Associations of Brain Atrophy and Cerebral Iron Accumulation at MRI with
  Clinical Severity in Wilson Disease.Background Abnormal findings at brain MRI in
  patients with neurologic Wilson disease (WD) are characterized by signal intensity
  changes and cerebral atrophy. T2 signal hypointensities and atrophy are largely
  irreversible with treatment; their relationship with permanent disability has not
  been systematically investigated. Purpose To investigate associations of regional
  brain atrophy and iron accumulation at MRI with clinical severity in participants
  with neurologic WD who are undergoing long-term anti-copper treatment. Materials
  and Methods Participants with WD and controls were compared in a prospective study
  performed from 2015 to 2019. MRI at 3.0 T included three-dimensional T1-weighted
  and six-echo multigradient-echo pulse sequences for morphometry and quantitative
  susceptibility mapping, respectively. Neurologic severity was assessed with the
  Unified WD Rating Scale (UWDRS). Automated multi-atlas segmentation pipeline with
  dual contrast (susceptibility and T1) was used for the calculation of volumes and
  mean susceptibilities in deep gray matter nuclei. Additionally, whole-brain analysis
  using deformation and surface-based morphometry was performed. Least absolute shrinkage
  and selection operator regression was used to assess the association of regional
  volumes and susceptibilities with the UWDRS score. Results Twenty-nine participants
  with WD (mean age, 47 years +- 9 [standard deviation]; 15 women) and 26 controls
  (mean age, 45 years +- 12; 14 women) were evaluated. Whole-brain analysis demonstrated
  atrophy of the deep gray matter nuclei, brainstem, internal capsule, motor cortex
  and corticospinal pathway, and visual cortex and optic radiation in participants
  with WD (P < .05 at voxel level, corrected for family-wise error). The UWDRS score
  was negatively correlated with volumes of putamen (r = -0.63, P < .001), red nucleus
  (r = -0.58, P = .001), globus pallidus (r = -0.53, P = .003), and substantia nigra
  (r = -0.50, P = .006) but not with susceptibilities. Only the putaminal volume was
  identified as a stable factor associated with the UWDRS score (R2 = 0.38, P < .001)
  using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression. Conclusion Individuals
  with Wilson disease (WD) had widespread brain atrophy most pronounced in the central
  structures. The putaminal volume was associated with the Unified WD Rating Scale
  score and can be used as a surrogate imaging marker of clinical severity.   RSNA,
