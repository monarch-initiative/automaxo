input_text: 'Movement Disorder in Wilson Disease: Correlation with MRI and Biomarkers
  of Cell Injury.To report the phenomenology of movement disorder (MD) in neurological
  Wilson disease (NWD), and correlate these with MRI, and biomarkers of oxidative
  stress, excitotoxicity, and inflammation. Eighty-two patients were included, and
  their phenomenology of MD was categorized. The severity of dystonia was assessed
  using the Burke-Fahn-Marsden score, and chorea, athetosis, myoclonus, and tremor
  on a 0-4 scale. The MRI changes were noted. Serum glutamate, cytokines, and oxidative
  stress markers were measured. Movement disorders were noted in 78/82 (95.1%) patients
  and included dystonia in 69 (84.1%), chorea in 31 (37.8%), tremor in 24 (29.3%),
  parkinsonism in 19 (23.2%), athetosis in 13 (15.9%), and myoclonus in 9 (11.0%)
  patients. Dystonia was more frequently observed in the patients with thalamic (76.8
  vs 23.2%), globus pallidus (72.0 vs 28.0%), putamen (69.5 vs 30.5%), caudate (68.3
  vs 31.7%) and brainstem (61.0 vs 39.0%) involvement, and tremor with cerebellar
  involvement (37.5 vs 5.2%). The median age of onset of neurological symptoms was
  12 (5-50) years. WD patients had higher levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), glutamate,
  and cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNFalpha) and lower levels of glutathione
  and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) compared with the controls. Serum glutamate,
  IL-6, IL-8, and plasma MDA levels were increased with increasing neurological severity,
  while glutathione and TAC levels decreased. The severity of dystonia related to
  the number of MRI lesions. MD is the commonest neurological symptoms in WD. Oxidative
  stress, glutamate, and cytokine levels are increased in WD and correlate with neurological
  severity.'
