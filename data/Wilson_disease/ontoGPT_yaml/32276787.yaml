input_text: Reference intervals of spot urine copper excretion in preschool children
  and potential application in pre-symptomatic screening of Wilson disease.The objectives
  were to determine the reference intervals of spot urine copper excretion indexes
  in pre-school children and to evaluate their utility in screening for Wilson disease
  (WD). With spot urine collected from a control sample of preschool children (aged
  3-7 years, n=153), the reference intervals of spot urine copper excretion indexes
  and their biological variation were defined. In order to investigate their utility
  performance in screening for WD in this age group, multiple spot urine samples from
  six WD patients who were diagnosed at presymptomatic stage were also analysed and
  compared. Cut-off values useful for detection of WD were defined by receiver operator
  curve (ROC) analysis. Biological (inter-individual) variation of spot urine copper
  indexes expressed as coefficient of variation (CVg) were around 60% at this age
  group, which was moderate and similar to other clinically useful urine tests, such
  as urine albumin excretion ratio. Spot urine copper excretion strongly correlated
  with both urine creatinine and osmolality. Linear regression against both creatinine
  and osmolality showed that ~94% of data points in healthy preschool children fell
  within the prediction interval, suggesting that both were useful normalisation factors.
  ROC showed that copper to osmolality ratio was the best index with an area under
  curve (AUC) greater than 0.98. Cut-off values of 0.5 mumol/L, 0.1 mumol/mmol and
  0.00085 mumol/mOsmol (32 mug/L, 56 mug/g creatinine and 0.054 mug/mOsmol, respectively,
  in conventional units) for spot urine copper concentration, copper to creatinine
  ratio and copper to osmolality ratio, respectively, have potential application in
  the differentiation of WD patients. Based on the data, a new WD screening strategy
  targeting preschool children is proposed. Application of a bivariate screening strategy
  using spot urine copper concentration and urine osmolality may be useful in a population-wide
  screening program for WD among preschool children.
