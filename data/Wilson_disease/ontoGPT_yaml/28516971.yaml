input_text: "Salivary biomarkers and proteomics: future diagnostic and clinical utilities.Saliva
  testing is a non-invasive and inexpensive test that can serve as a source of information
  useful for diagnosis of disease. As we enter the era of genomic technologies and
  -omic research, collection of saliva has increased. Recent proteomic platforms have
  analysed the human salivary proteome and characterised about 3000 differentially
  expressed proteins and peptides: in saliva, more than 90% of proteins in weight
  are derived from the secretion of three couples of \"major\" glands; all the other
  components are derived from minor glands, gingival crevicular fluid, mucosal exudates
  and oral microflora. The most common aim of proteomic analysis is to discriminate
  between physiological and pathological conditions. A proteomic protocol to analyze
  the whole saliva proteome is not currently available. It is possible distinguish
  two type of proteomic platforms: top-down proteomics investigates intact naturally-occurring
  structure of a protein under examination; bottom-up proteomics analyses peptide
  fragments after pre-digestion (typically with trypsin). Because of this heterogeneity,
  many different biomarkers may be proposed for the same pathology. The salivary proteome
  has been characterised in several diseases: oral squamous cell carcinoma and oral
  leukoplakia, chronic graft-versus-host disease Sjogren's syndrome and other autoimmune
  disorders such as SAPHO, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and genetic diseases
  like Down's Syndrome and Wilson disease. The results of research reported herein
  suggest that in the near future human saliva will be a relevant diagnostic fluid
  for clinical diagnosis and prognosis."
