input_text: Pediatric Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure.Acute-on-chronic liver failure
  (ACLF) is characterized by an acute hepatic insult happening in a patient with underlying
  cirrhosis with compromised hepatic reserve leading to development of systemic inflammation,
  sepsis, and organ failure resulting in poor outcome in majority. While Asia Pacific
  Association for Study of Liver Diseases (APASL) emphasizes on early diagnosis before
  development of organ failure, European Association for Study of Liver Diseases (EASL)
  mandates the presence of organ failures to define ACLF. There is a lack of consensus
  definition of pediatric ACLF although recent APASL guidelines have tried to address
  the issue. While Wilson disease (WD) and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) are the most
  common cause of underlying cirrhosis in children, acute viral hepatitis and flares
  of WD and AIH are the commonest acute precipitating events. Poor outcomes [death
  and liver transplantation (LT)] ranging from 19 to 59% have been reported. Prognosis
  in pediatric ACLF is usually better than that in adults due to greater proportion
  of treatable etiologies, lesser organ failures, comorbidities and better hepatic
  reserves. APASL ACLF Research Consortium (AARC) score more than or equal to 11 is
  predictive of poor 28-90 d mortality. Treatment of pediatric ACLF relies mainly
  on prompt diagnosis and medical management of a potentially treatable etiology of
  underlying cirrhosis. Bridging therapies, especially high volume plasma exchange
  can be initiated early as a bridge to LT or native liver recovery. Those with no
  improvement in 4-7 d should undergo LT before development of sepsis or multi-organ
  failure.
