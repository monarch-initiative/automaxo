input_text: "Evaluation of Validity and Efficiency of Diagnostic Criteria in Autoimmune
  Hepatitis in Children.BACKGROUND: Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a progressive inflammatory
  liver disease with various clinical symptoms, but treatment and prevention of hepatic
  failure and cirrhosis is possible with early diagnosis. However, no specific test
  has been approved for the diagnosis of AIH. In 2008, the International Autoimmune
  Hepatitis Group (IAIHG) developed a simplified diagnostic scoring system that has
  been widely used in practice. Nevertheless, it cannot distinguish AIH from Primary
  Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) and consensus is lacking with respect to its validity,
  sensitivity, and applicability for children patients. The newer 2018 version also
  requires validation. The present study intends to evaluate the validity and efficiency
  of the IAIHG simplified scoring system and new scoring system in children with AIH.
  METHODS: The present study is a non-interventional case-control study covering 152
  patients with hepatic diseases (83 patients with AIH and 69 patients with Wilson
  disease (WD)). Titers of autoantibodies, IgG levels, hepatic histology, and absence
  of viral hepatitis were scored and calculated according to IAIHG diagnostic criteria.
  Statistics software package (SPSS) and draft receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
  curves was used to analyze data and determine value of diagnostic criteria. RESULT:
  In our study, both scoring systems' accuracy was good in AIH diagnosis, although
  new score displays higher sensitivity and specificity, suggestive of greater accuracy
  and predictive strength. CONCLUSION: Our study is the first validation study of
  the new scoring system in diagnosing AIH, and further studies require verifying
  this scoring system."
