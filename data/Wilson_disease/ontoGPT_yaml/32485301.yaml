input_text: "Role for Biochemical Assays and Kayser-Fleischer Rings in Diagnosis of
  Wilson's Disease.BACKGROUND & AIMS: Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder
  that impairs copper homeostasis and is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous
  mutations in ATP7B, which encodes a copper-transporting P-type ATPase. Patients
  have variable clinical manifestations and laboratory test results, resulting in
  diagnostic dilemmas. We aimed to identify factors associated with symptoms and features
  of Wilson disease from a large cohort, over 15 years. METHODS: We collected data
  from 715 patients (529 with symptoms, 146 without symptoms, and 40 uncategorized)
  and a genetic confirmation of Wilson's disease (mean age of diagnosis, 18.84 years),
  recruited from 3 hospitals in China from 2004 through 2019. We analyzed clinical
  data along with serum levels of ceruloplasmin (available from 636 patients), 24-hr
  urinary copper excretion (collected from 131 patients), Kayser-Fleisher rings (copper
  accumulation in eyes, with neurologic data from 355 patients), and magnetic resonance
  imaging (MRI) abnormalities. Differences among the groups were analyzed using 1-way
  analysis of variance followed by Tukey multiple comparison test. RESULTS: Of the
  529 patients with symptoms, 121 had hepatic features, 355 had neurologic features,
  28 had osteomuscular features (premature osteoarthritis, skeletal deformities, and
  pathological bone fractures), and 25 had psychiatric symptoms. Age of onset was
  significantly younger in patients with hepatic (16.94 +- 1.03 years; P = .0105)
  or osteomuscular features (13 +- 1.33 years; P = .0001) than patients with neurological
  features (19.48 +- 0.46 years). Serum levels of ceruloplasmin differed among asymptomatic
  patients and patients with osteomuscular or neurologic symptoms of Wilson disease.
  Serum levels of ceruloplasmin ranged from 18.93 mg/L to approximately 120.00 mg/L
  (quantiles of 0.025 to approximately 0.975). Fifty-one of 131 patients (39%) had
  urinary copper excretion levels below 100 mug/24 hr; there was significant variation
  in levels of urinary copper excretion between patients older than 14 years vs 14
  years or younger. Of the 355 patients with neurologic features, 244 patients (69%)
  had abnormal findings from MRI and Kayser-Fleisher rings; only 1 patient with abnormal
  findings from brain MRI was negative for Kayser-Fleisher rings. CONCLUSIONS: Serum
  level of ceruloplasmin, 24-hour urinary copper excretion, and Kayser-Fleisher rings
  can be used to identify patients who might have Wilson disease. Patients with serum
  levels of ceruloplasmin below 120 mg/L and children with urinary copper excretion
  above 40 mug should undergo genetic testing for Wilson's disease. Patients with
  movement disorders and brain MRI abnormalities without Kayser-Fleisher rings are
  not likely to have Wilson disease."
