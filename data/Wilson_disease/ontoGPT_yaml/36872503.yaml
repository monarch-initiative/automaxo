input_text: 'Motor Evoked Potentials in Newly Diagnosed and Treated Patients With
  Wilson Disease.PURPOSE: To investigate whether patients with Wilson disease have
  abnormal motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation.
  METHODS: In a prospective, observational, single-center study, transcranial magnetic
  stimulation was used to examine MEPs recorded from the abductor digiti minimi in
  24 newly diagnosed treatment-naive patients and 21 treated patients with Wilson
  disease. RESULTS: Motor evoked potentials were recorded in 22 (91.7%) newly diagnosed
  treatment-naive patients and in 20 (95.2%) treated patients. Abnormal MEP parameters
  were found in a similar proportion of newly diagnosed and treated patients: MEP
  latency (38% vs. 29%), MEP amplitude (21% vs. 24%), central motor conduction time
  (29% vs. 29%), and resting motor threshold (68% vs. 52%). Abnormal MEP amplitude
  (P = 0.044) and resting motor threshold (P = 0.011) were more frequent in treated
  patients with brain MRI abnormalities but not in newly diagnosed patients. We did
  not observe significant improvement in MEPs parameters after 1 year of treatment
  introduction in eight examined patients. However, in one patient where MEPs were
  initially nondetectable, they were present 1 year after treatment introduction with
  zinc sulfate, although MEPs were not in the normal range. CONCLUSIONS: Motor evoked
  potential parameters did not differ between newly diagnosed and treated patients.
  There was no significant improvement in MEP parameters one year after treatment
  introduction. Further studies conducted on large cohorts are necessary to determine
  the usefulness of MEPs in detecting pyramidal tract damage and improvement after
  anticopper treatment introduction in Wilson disease.'
