input_text: Exome sequencing for structurally normal fetuses-yields and ethical issues.The
  yield of chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) is well established in structurally
  normal fetuses (0.4-1.4%). We aimed to determine the incremental yield of exome
  sequencing (ES) in this population. From February 2017 to April 2022, 1,526 fetuses
  were subjected to ES; 482 of them were structurally normal (31.6%). Only pathogenic
  and likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants, per the American College of Medical Genetics
  and Genomics (ACMG) classification, were reported. Additionally, ACMG secondary
  findings relevant to childhood were reported. Four fetuses (4/482; 0.8%) had P/LP
  variants indicating a moderate to severe disease in ATP7B, NR2E3, SPRED1 and FGFR3,
  causing Wilson disease, Enhanced S-cone syndrome, Legius and Muenke syndromes, respectively.
  Two fetuses had secondary findings, in RET and DSP. Our data suggest that offering
  only CMA for structurally normal fetuses may provide false reassurance. Prenatal
  ES mandates restrictive analysis and careful management combined with pre and post-test
  genetic counseling.
