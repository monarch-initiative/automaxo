input_text: 'Re-evaluation of King Wilson Index in Children With Acutely Decompensated
  Hepatic Wilson Disease.OBJECTIVES: Liver transplantation (LT) in Wilson disease
  (WD) is a life-saving option for patients presenting with liver failure and encephalopathy.
  Patients without encephalopathy can avoid LT and treated successfully with chelation
  therapy. It is essential to predict the risk of fatal outcomes where LT is required.
  We aim to critically analyse the validity of the WD Index prospectively from a cohort
  of WD patients managed at our institution. METHODS: WD Index and other clinical
  data from 2005 to 2018, recorded prospectively as part of clinical management, were
  analysed. RESULTS: Over 13-year period, 52 children with WD (29 boys) with median
  age at diagnosis of 11.69 (range 3.92-17.26) years were studied. Of these, 17 were
  diagnosed as part of family screening, 17 presented with abnormal liver enzyme,
  and 18 with acute hepatic decompensation (AHD) as per PALF definition. Patients
  presented with abnormal liver enzyme and in the pre-symptomatic group had WD Index
  <11, and none of them required LT. WD Index is still a good predictor for LT in
  WD patients with AHD, providing a sensitivity of 80%, specificity of 100%, positive-predictive,
  and negative-predictive value of 100% and 80%, respectively. Patients presented
  with an index of 8-10 also required LT at median duration of 58 days (IQR 48-135
  days). CONCLUSIONS: WD patients presenting with AHD who had an index of >=11 do
  require LT. Children with a WD Index of 8 to 10 within the first 2 months of admission
  require close monitoring as LT may become necessary.'
