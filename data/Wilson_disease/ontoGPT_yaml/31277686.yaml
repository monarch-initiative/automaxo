input_text: 'Social and demographic characteristics of a Polish cohort with Wilson
  disease and the impact of treatment persistence.BACKGROUND: Wilson disease (WD)
  is a genetic disorder involving impaired copper metabolism, which presents with
  hepatic, neurological, and/or psychiatric manifestations. WD requires lifelong pharmacotherapy
  and treatment persistence may be problematic. We studied social characteristics,
  education, and work-related activities and how they are affected by WD symptoms
  and treatment persistence. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, data on demographic
  characteristics, achieved education level, household and marital status, plus a
  primary source of income were collected from 202 Polish subjects (mean +- standard
  deviation age of 36.4 +- 9.9 years at assessment) with WD. RESULTS: Overall, WD
  appeared to have a negative impact on achieved level of education and influenced
  the ability to work as compared with the general Polish population. Patients with
  neurological manifestations less often achieved upper-secondary/post-secondary or
  higher education compared with those with hepatic manifestations (65.5% vs. 83.6%;
  p = 0.003). They also significantly less frequently stated salary (19.6% vs. 56.2%;
  p < 0.0001) as the primary income and more often were on disability pension (53.3%
  vs. 26.0%; p = 0.0003). The percentage of married patients with WD appeared lower
  than in the general population (47.0% vs. 54.6%), although the difference was not
  significant (p = 0.2). The 27.6% of patients who were non-persistent with WD treatment
  less frequently achieved upper/post-secondary or higher education compared with
  persistent patients (66.0% vs. 76.3%; NS) and their primary source of outcome was
  significantly less often a salary (18.9% vs. 40.3%; p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Neurological
  manifestations had an adverse effect on education level and work ability. Treatment
  non-persistence had a further negative impact regardless of the disease form. Patients
  with WD should receive appropriate treatment, with the need for persistence emphasized
  and monitored to avoid a detrimental effect on their lives.'
