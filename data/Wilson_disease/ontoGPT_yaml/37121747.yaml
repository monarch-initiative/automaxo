input_text: Late-onset Wilson Disease in a Patient Followed-up for Nonalcoholic Fatty
  Liver Disease.A 73-year-old woman was referred to our hospital for persistent liver
  dysfunction. When the patient was 45 years old, her youngest sister had been diagnosed
  with Wilson disease (WD). The patient therefore underwent several family screening
  tests, all of which were unremarkable. She had an annual medical checkup and was
  diagnosed with liver dysfunction and fatty liver at 68 years old. A liver biopsy
  and genetic testing were performed, and she was diagnosed with WD; chelation therapy
  was then initiated. In patients with hepatic disorders and a family history of WD,
  multiple medical examinations should be conducted, as the development of WD is possible
  regardless of age.
