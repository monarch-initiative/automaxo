input_text: 'Wilson Disease With Novel Compound Heterozygote Mutations in the ATP7B
  Gene Presenting With Severe Diabetes.OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between
  ATP7B mutations and diabetes in Wilson disease (WD). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:
  A total of 21 exons and exon-intron boundaries of ATP7B were identified by Sanger
  sequencing. RESULTS: Two novel compound heterozygous mutations (c.525 dupA/ Val176Serfs*28
  and c.2930 C>T/ p.Thr977Met) were detected in ATP7B. After d-penicillamine (D-PCA)
  therapy, serum aminotransferase and ceruloplasmin levels in this patient were normalized
  and levels of HbA1c decreased. However, when the patient ceased to use D-PCA due
  to an itchy skin, serum levels of fasting blood glucose increased. Dimercaptosuccinic
  acid capsules were prescribed and memory recovered to some extent, which was accompanied
  by decreased insulin dosage for glucose control by 5 units. CONCLUSIONS: This is
  the first report of diabetes caused by WD.'
