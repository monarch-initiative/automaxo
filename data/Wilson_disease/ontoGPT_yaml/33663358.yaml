input_text: 'Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure in Children: A Single-Center Experience.OBJECTIVES:
  Acute-on-chronic liver failure and its outcomes have not yet been evaluated in detail
  in children. We aimed to evaluate the etiology, acute events, and prognostic factors
  of acute-on-chronic liver failure in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pediatric
  patients (age 2-18 years) diagnosed with acute-on-chronic liver failure between
  April 2014 and April 2020 were evaluated retrospectively. Acute-on-chronic liver
  failure was defined as the presence of acute hepatic insult in previously diagnosed
  or undiagnosed chronic liver disease causing jaundice (total serum bilirubin >=5
  mg/dL) and coagulopathy (international normalized ratio of >=2.0) and clinical and/or
  radiological ascites and/or hepatic encephalopathy within 4 weeks. Acute-on-Chronic
  Liver Failure Research Consortium and Chronic Liver Failure-Sequential Organ Failure
  Assessment scores were calculated for patients at first admission and at end of
  day 5 or before liver transplant. RESULTS: Our study included 29 patients. Underlying
  chronic liver diseases were mostly autoimmune hepatitis (51.72%) and Wilson disease
  (27.58%), with flare-ups of these diseases also the most common acute events (48.28%
  and 27.58%, respectively). Seven patients (24.14%) received liver transplants. At
  first admission, Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure Research Consortium and Chronic
  Liver Failure-Sequential Organ Failure Assessment cut-off scores to predict liver
  transplant were 7.5 and 6.5; at end of day 5 or before transplant, cut-off scores
  were 8.5 and 7.5, respectively. The 8.5 cut-off score on day 5 was the most specific
  and sensitive to predict liver transplant. International normalized ratio cut-off
  of 3.04 predicted transplant requirement with maximum sensitivity and specificity.
  CONCLUSIONS: Wilson disease and autoimmune hepatitis were the most common underlying
  chronic and acute events of acute-on-chronic liver failure in children. Although
  an Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure Research Consortium score >= 8.5 best predicted
  liver transplant, for patients with scores >= 7.5 and being followed in a nontransplant
  center, patient referral to a transplant center is appropriate.'
