input_text: 'Pontomesencephalic Atrophy and Postural Instability in Wilson Disease.BACKGROUND
  AND PURPOSE: The MR Parkinsonism index helps in differentiating progressive supranuclear
  palsy from Parkinson disease and multisystem atrophy. Pontomesencephalic involvement
  is common in neurologic Wilson disease, but there is no prior study evaluating the
  MR Parkinsonism index and its indices in Wilson disease. We report the MR Parkinsonism
  index and its indices in Wilson disease and correlate these changes with clinical
  severity and postural reflex. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen individuals with neurologic
  Wilson disease were included, and their clinical details, including neurologic severity,
  postural reflex abnormality, and location of signal changes on MR imaging, were
  noted. The 3D BRAVO T1 sequence was used for measurement of the MR Parkinsonism
  index and its indices. The MR Parkinsonism index and its indices were also obtained
  in 6 age- and sex-matched controls. The morphometric parameters in Wilson disease
  were compared with those in with healthy controls and among the patients with and
  without abnormal postural reflex. RESULTS: The midbrain area was reduced in patients
  with Wilson disease compared with controls (112.08 +- 27.94 versus 171.95 +- 23.66
  mm2, P = .002). The patients with an abnormal postural reflex had an increased MR
  Parkinsonism index and pons-to-midbrain ratio compared with controls, whereas these
  parameters were equivalent in patients with normal postural reflex and controls.
  The patients with abnormal postural reflex had more severe illness, evidenced by
  higher Burke-Fahn-Marsden scores (51.0 +- 32.27 versus 13.75 +- 12.37, P = .04)
  and neurologic severity grades (2.57 +- 0.53 versus 1.67 +- 0.82, P = .04). CONCLUSIONS:
  An increase in the MR Parkinsonism index in Wilson disease is mainly due to midbrain
  atrophy and it correlates with neurologic severity and abnormal postural reflex.'
