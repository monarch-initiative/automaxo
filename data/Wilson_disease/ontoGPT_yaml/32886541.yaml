input_text: 'Skeletal Muscle Involvement in Wilson Disease: Clinical and Magnetic
  Resonance Imaging (MRI) Observations in 2 Families.OBJECTIVE: Skeletal muscle involvement
  in Wilson disease is rare. Calf muscle pain might be attributed as growing pain
  in children. We report calf muscle involvement in Wilson disease and describe the
  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of leg, differential diagnosis with literature
  review. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our observations describe calf muscle MRI abnormality
  in 5 cases of Wilson disease from 2 families. The clinical presentations were neurologic
  in 3, hepatic in 1, and asymptomatic in 1 patient. We systematically describe the
  clinical characteristics and their calf muscle MRI findings. RESULTS: Three patients
  had bilateral calf pain and intermittent cramps. The pain was of mild to moderate
  intensity and managed symptomatically. Serum alkaline phosphatase, creatinine phosphokinase,
  and needle electromyography were normal. Turbo inversion recovery magnitude sequence
  MRI of calf muscle revealed hyperintensity in bilateral gastrocnemii muscles. These
  muscles appear hyperintense in diffusion-weighted imaging. CONCLUSION: The calf
  muscle involvement could be attributed to muscle edema due to copper-induced muscle
  toxicity mediated by inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase on cellular membranes of fast-twitch
  gastrocnemii muscles which contain predominant type II myofiber. In Wilson disease
  patients with calf pain or cramps, muscle MRI may show nonspecific gastrocnemius
  hyperintensity. Further evaluation may give insight into its pathophysiology.'
