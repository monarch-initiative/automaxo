input_text: '[Wilson disease].Wilson disease is a rare hereditary disorder of copper
  metabolism. The genetic defect is caused by various mutations in the copper-transporting
  enzyme ATP7B, located mainly in the liver and brain. Clinical symptoms are highly
  variable, with any combination of hepatic and/or neurological or psychiatric manifestations.
  The age of onset varies from early childhood to young adults and can even be manifested
  in later ages. The clinical diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical, biochemical
  and molecular markers. Treatment using chelating agents and zinc salts is effective
  when started early or even better at presymptomatic stages of the disease.'
