input_text: "A New Onset of Mania in a 49-Year-Old Man: An Interesting Case of Wilson
  Disease.Wilson disease is a rare copper metabolism disorder that generally occurs
  in individuals between 5 and 35 years of age. Common clinical manifestations are
  hepatic, neurological, and psychiatric symptoms. Roughly, 4% of all cases occur
  in patients over 40 years of age and, among these patients, the presenting symptoms
  are generally neuropsychiatric, which often leads to misdiagnosis as a primary psychiatric
  disorder and a delay in correct diagnosis. This report presents the case of a 49-year-old
  man with no formal psychiatric history who presented with a new onset of mania.
  We outline the distinctive characteristics that appeared inconsistent with a primary
  psychiatric disorder and pointed toward secondary mania. Despite low serum ceruloplasmin,
  the absence of brain abnormalities more typical of Wilson disease on magnetic resonance
  imaging led a neurology consultant to advise that the diagnosis was likely primarily
  psychiatric. Due to atypical components of the patient's presentation, such as his
  late age of onset for bipolar disorder and acute cognitive decline, the psychiatric
  team advocated for further diagnostic workup. The subsequent evaluation confirmed
  Wilson disease based on specific ophthalmological and hepatic abnormalities and
  further copper studies. In addition, once diagnosed, the management of Wilson disease
  involves distinct clinical considerations given patients' presumed vulnerability
  to neurological side effects. This case illustrates the role psychiatric providers
  play in advocating for diagnostic workup in patients with atypical presentations
  of primary psychiatric disorders and the distinct diagnostic and treatment considerations
  associated with Wilson disease."
