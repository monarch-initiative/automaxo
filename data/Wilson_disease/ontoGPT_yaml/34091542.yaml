input_text: "Pediatric Wilson's Disease: Phenotypic, Genetic Characterization and
  Outcome of 182 Children in France.OBJECTIVES: To describe a cohort of Wilson disease
  (WD) pediatric cases, and to point out the diagnostic particularities of this age
  group and the long-term outcome. METHODS: Clinical data of 182 pediatric patients
  included in the French WD national registry from 01/03/1995 to 01/06/2019 were gathered.
  RESULTS: Diagnosis of WD was made at a mean age of 10.7 +- 4.2 years (range 1-18
  years). At diagnosis, 154 patients (84.6%) had hepatic manifestations, 19 (10.4%)
  had neurological manifestations, and 9 patients (4.9%) were asymptomatic. The p.His1069Gln
  mutation was the most frequently encountered (14% of patients).Neurological patients
  were diagnosed at least 1 year after they presented their first symptoms. At diagnosis,
  the median urinary copper excretion (UCE) was 4.2 mumol/24 hours (0.2-253). The
  first-line treatment was d-penicillamine (DP) for 131 (72%) patients, zinc salts
  for 24 (13%) patients, and Trientine for 17 (9%) patients. Liver transplantation
  was performed in 39 (21.4%) patients, for hepatic indications in 33 of 39 patients
  or for neurological deterioration in 6 of 39 patients, mean Unified Wilson's Disease
  Rating Scale of the latter went from 90 +- 23.1 before liver transplantation (LT)
  to 26.8 +- 14.1 (P < 0.01) after a mean follow-up of 4.3 +- 2.5 years. Overall survival
  rate at 20 years of follow-up was 98%, patient and transplant-free combined survival
  was 84% at 20 years. CONCLUSION: Diagnosis of WD can be challenging in children,
  particularly at the early stages of liver disease and in case of neurological presentation;
  hence the support of clinical scores and genetic testing is essential. Diagnosis
  at early stages and proper treatment ensure excellent outcomes, subject to good
  long-term treatment compliance. LT is a valid option for end-stage liver disease
  not responding to treatment and can be discussed for selected cases of neurological
  deterioration."
