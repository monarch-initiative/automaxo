input_text: 'Idiopathic brain calcification in a patient with hereditary hemochromatosis.BACKGROUND:
  Detection of brain-MRI T2/T2* gradient echo images (T2*GRE)-hypointensity can be
  compatible with iron accumulation and leads to a differential diagnosis work-up
  including neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) and Wilson Disease.
  Idiopathic or secondary brain calcification can be also associated with neurological
  involvement and brain-MRI T2/T2*GRE-hypointensity. Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH),
  characterized by systemic iron loading, usually does not involve the CNS, and only
  sporadic cases of neurological abnormalities or brain-MRI T2/T2*GRE-hypointensity
  have been reported. CASE PRESENTATION: A 59-year-old man came to our observation
  after a diagnosis of HH carried out in another hospital 2 years before. First-level
  genetic test had revealed a homozygous HFE p.Cys282Tyr (C282Y) mutation compatible
  with the diagnosis of HFE-related HH, thus phlebotomy treatment was started. The
  patient had a history of metabolic syndrome, type-2 diabetes, autoimmune thyroiditis
  and severe chondrocalcinosis. Brain-MRI showed the presence of bilateral T2*GRE
  hypointensities within globus pallidus, substantia nigra, dentate nucleus and left
  pulvinar that were considered expression of cerebral siderosis. No neurological
  symptoms or family history of neurological disease were reported. Neurological examination
  revealed only mild right-sided hypokinetic-rigid syndrome. Vitamin D-PTH axis, measurements
  of serum ceruloplasmin and copper, and urinary copper were within the normal range.
  A brain computed tomography (CT) was performed to better characterize the suspected
  and unexplained brain iron accumulation. On the CT images, the hypointense regions
  in the brain MRI were hyperdense. DNA sequence analysis of genes associated with
  primary familial brain calcification and NBIA was negative. CONCLUSIONS: This report
  highlights the importance of brain CT-scan in ambiguous cases of suspected cerebral
  siderosis, and suggests that HH patients with a severe phenotype, and likely associated
  with chondrocalcinosis, may display also brain calcifications. Further studies are
  needed to confirm this hypothesis. So far, we can speculate that iron and calcium
  homeostasis could be reciprocally connected within the basal ganglia.'
