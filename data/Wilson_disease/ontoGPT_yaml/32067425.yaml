input_text: 'The co-occurrence of Wilson disease and X-linked agammaglobulinemia in
  one family highlights the promising diagnostic potential of proteolytic analysis.BACKGROUND:
  We report the first case of a family with co-occurrence of Wilson disease (WD),
  an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism, and X-linked agammaglobulinemia
  (XLA), a primary immunodeficiency disorder (PIDD) that features marked reduction
  in circulating B lymphocytes and serum immunoglobulins. METHODS AND RESULTS: Through
  utilization of a multiplexed biomarker peptide quantification method known as the
  immuno-SRM assay, we were able to simultaneously and independently identify which
  family members are affected with WD and which are affected with XLA using dried
  blood spots (DBS). CONCLUSION: Being able to delineate multiple diagnoses using
  proteolytic analysis from a single DBS provides support for implementation of this
  methodology for clinical diagnostic use as well as large-scale population screening,
  such as newborn screening (NBS). This could allow for early identification and treatment
  of affected individuals with WD or XLA, which have been shown to reduce morbidity
  and decrease mortality in these two populations.'
