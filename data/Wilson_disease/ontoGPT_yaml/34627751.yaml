input_text: Hepatic Steatosis in the Mouse Model of Wilson Disease Coincides with
  a Muted Inflammatory Response.Wilson disease (WND) is caused by inactivation of
  the copper transporter ATP7B and copper accumulation in tissues. WND presentations
  vary from liver steatosis to inflammation, fibrosis, and liver failure. Diets influence
  the liver phenotype in WND, but findings are inconsistent. To better understand
  the impact of excess calories on liver phenotype in WND, the study compared C57BL/6J
  Atp7b-/- and C57BL/6J mice fed for 12 weeks with Western diet or normal chow. Serum
  and liver metabolites, body fat content, liver histology, hepatic proteome, and
  copper content were analyzed. Wild-type and Atp7b-/- livers showed striking similarities
  in their responses to Western diet, most notably down-regulation of cholesterol
  biosynthesis, altered nuclear receptor signaling, and changes in cytoskeleton. Western
  diet increased body fat content and induced liver steatosis in males and females
  regardless of genotype; however, the effects were less pronounced in Atp7b-/- mice
  compared with those in the wild type mice. Although hepatic copper remained elevated
  in Atp7b-/- mice, liver inflammation was reduced. The diet diminished signaling
  by Rho GTPases, integrin, IL8, and reversed changes in cell cycle machinery and
  cytoskeleton. Overall, high calories decreased inflammatory response in favor of
  steatosis without improving markers of cell viability. Similar changes of cellular
  pathways during steatosis development in wild-type and Atp7b-/- mice explain histologic
  overlap between WND and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease despite opposite copper
  changes in these disorders.
