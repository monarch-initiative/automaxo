input_text: 'Challenges faced in establishing a pediatric liver transplant program
  in a lower-middle-income country with free healthcare service.BACKGROUND: Liver
  transplant is the cure for children with liver failure. Sri Lanka is a lower-middle-income
  country with a predominant free, state health system. Pediatric liver transplant
  program in Sri Lanka is still in the budding state where the initial experience
  of the program is yet to be documented. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed
  including the clinical characteristics of all pediatric liver transplant recipients
  of Colombo North Centre for Liver Diseases since the inception of the program from
  June 2020 to May 2023. RESULTS: There were 14 PLT performed in 3 years. The median
  recipient age and weight were 8 years (6 months-15 years) and 23.3 kg (6.4-49.2),
  respectively. The majority were boys (64%). All were from low-income backgrounds.
  Indications for LT were acute liver failure (5/14), decompensated chronic liver
  disease (5/14), and acute on chronic liver failure (4/14). Underlying liver diseases
  were Wilson disease (6/14), autoimmune liver disease (3/14), biliary atresia (2/14)
  and progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 (1/14), and unknown etiology
  (2/14). The majority were living donor liver transplants (86%). Of the living donors,
  42% (5/12) were Buddhist priests. There were three immediate deaths and two late
  deaths. The 3-month survival was 78%, and overall survival was 64%. Living donor
  transplants carried a higher success rate (92%) compared to diseased donor transplants
  (0%; 2/2). CONCLUSIONS: Initial experience of pediatric liver transplant program
  of Sri Lanka is promising despite being established in a free healthcare system
  amidst the crisis circumstances.'
