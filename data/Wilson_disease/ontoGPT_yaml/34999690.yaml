input_text: Efficacy of Different Diagnostic Test for Identifying Wilson's Disease.Wilson
  disease is an autosomal recessive disorder in which copper pathologically accumulates
  primarily within the liver, brain and other tissues. It can presents clinically
  as liver disease, as a progressive neurological disorder or as psychiatric illness.
  The wide array of clinical manifestations of WD can lead to misdiagnosis with subsequent
  greater risk of irreversible damage to liver and brain. Many tests can be used to
  investigate patients of Wilson disease, including serum free copper, 24 hours urine
  copper estimation, hepatic copper estimation and genetic mutation testing. But there
  is no single ideal diagnostic test that can exclude or confirm the disease with
  certainty. The aim of the study was to find out the efficacy of different diagnostic
  test for the diagnosis of Wilson disease. This cross-sectional analytical study
  was conducted at department of Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition of Bangabandhu
  Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Dhaka, Bangladesh from January 2016 through January
  2018. A total of 56 cases of Wilson disease and 39 patients with a liver disease
  other than WD were studied. Wilson disease was diagnosed by Leipzig score. Along
  with other physical findings and laboratory investigations slit lamp eye examination
  for KF ring, serum ceruloplasmin and 24 hour urinary copper excretion were done.
  The mean age of WD patients was 9.69+-2.37 years, male female ratio was 1:1. Serum
  ceruloplasmin level was significantly lower in WD patient (p<0.001). Median of 24
  hour urinary copper in WD was 702.75mug/ 24 hr (range119-11210mug/24 hour) and in
  non WD group it was 77.41mug/24 hour (range 20.0-478mug/24 hour) and the difference
  between them is statistically significant (p=0.001). The sensitivity of KF ring
  was 82.1% and specificity was 100%. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive
  value, negative predictive value and accuracy of serum ceruloplasmin were 98.2%,
  92.3%, 94.8%, 97.2% and 95.7% respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive
  predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of 24 hour urinary copper
  were 100%, 63%, 80% and 85.1% respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive
  predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of KF ring, serum ceruloplasmin
  and basal 24 hour urinary copper excretion when combined together came out to be
  70.4%, 100%, 100%, 59.3% and 79.3% respectively. This study result showed that serum
  ceruloplasmin and 24 hour urinary copper can be used as a screening test for the
  diagnosis of Wilson disease.
