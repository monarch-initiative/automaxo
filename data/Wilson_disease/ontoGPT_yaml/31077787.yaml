input_text: 'Assessment of corneal and lens clarity in children with Wilson disease.PURPOSE:
  To investigate the effect of copper accumulation on corneal and lens clarity in
  children with Wilson disease (WD) compared to healthy children. METHODS: This multicenter
  cross-sectional study included 24 subjects with WD and 25 age-matched controls.
  Clinical and laboratory characteristics of the WD subjects were recorded. The Pentacam
  HR imaging system was used both for lens densitometry and corneal densitometry.
  RESULTS: Corneal densitometry values were higher in the posterior 6-10 mm (P = 0.021),
  posterior 10-12 mm (P < 0.001), posterior total diameter (P = 0.037), total thickness
  10-12 mm (P = 0.032), and total thickness 6-10 mm zones and layers (P = 0.040) in
  the WD eyes than in control eyes. The lens densitometry values of zone 1 were higher
  in WD eyes (P < 0.001). There was a significant relationship between corneal densitometry
  values in the posterior 10-12 mm zones (P = 0.012; r = 0.527) and the duration of
  WD and liver copper content (P = 0.016; r = 0.507). A statistically significant
  correlation was also detected between lens densitometry values in zone 1 and WD
  duration (P = 0.018; r = 0.426). CONCLUSION: In this study cohort, children with
  WD had decreased corneal and lens clarity even in cases without Kayser-Fleischer
  rings and sunflower cataracts. Densitometry measurements using Scheimpflug imaging
  provided detection of corneal and lens involvement in the early stages of WD.'
