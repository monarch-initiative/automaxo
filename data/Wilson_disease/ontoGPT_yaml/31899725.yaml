input_text: 'Management of Wilson Disease Diagnosed in Infancy: An Appraisal of Available
  Experience to Generate Discussion.Increased access to molecular genetic testing
  is changing the demographics for diagnosing inherited disorders and imposing new
  challenges for medical management. Wilson disease (WD), typically diagnosed in older
  children and adults, can now be detected in utero and in infants (children younger
  than 24 months, including neonates) via genetic testing. An evidence-based approach
  to management of these neonates and extremely young children, who are typically
  asymptomatic, has been hampered by lack of clinical experience. We present a case
  of an infantile diagnosis of WD, review available experience, and discuss current
  trends in antenatal genetic testing of parents and fetus that may lead to a very
  early diagnosis of WD. Based on physiological and nutritional considerations, we
  propose an algorithmic approach to management of infantile WD as a starting point
  for further discussion. Future collaboration amongst specialists is essential to
  identify evidence-based approaches and best practice for managing treatment of infants
  with genetically diagnosed WD.'
