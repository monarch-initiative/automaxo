input_text: 'Fulminant Wilson Disease in Children: Recovery After Plasma Exchange
  Without Transplantation.OBJECTIVES: Since 2005, a New Wilson Index (NWI) >=11 is
  used as a predictor of death without transplantation in fulminant Wilson disease
  (WD). Plasma exchange is advocated as a new treatment modality. METHODS: We present
  a patient with fulminant WD treated with plasma exchange. All published cases applying
  plasma exchange for fulminant WD were reviewed systematically. RESULTS: A 14-year-old
  girl presented with hemolysis and fulminant liver failure. She had no encephalopathy;
  NWI was 14. As a bridge to transplantation plasma exchange was started immediately.
  Complete remission was achieved with plasma exchange and later chelation therapy
  with D-penicillamine. She is now at 3-year transplant-free survival. Literature
  review identified 37 patients presenting with fulminant WD and NWI >=11 who were
  treated with plasma exchange. Seventeen of these patients (ie, 46%) recovered without
  transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple case reports and case series demonstrate
  transplant free survival after plasma exchange and subsequent chelation therapy,
  despite a NWI >=11. Plasma exchange affects the clinical course and is a therapeutic
  option in children and young adults presenting with fulminant WD.'
