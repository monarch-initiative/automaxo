input_text: "Serum glial fibrillary acidic protein is a body fluid biomarker: A valuable
  prognostic for neurological disease - A systematic review.Astrocytes are the most
  abundant cell type in the human central nervous system, and they play an important
  role in the regulation of neuronal physiology. In neurological disorders, astrocyte
  disintegration leads to the release of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) from
  tissue into the bloodstream. Elevated serum levels of GFAP can serve as blood biomarkers,
  and a useful prognostic tool to facilitate the early diagnosis of several neurological
  diseases ranging from stroke to neurodegenerative disorders. This systematic review
  synthesizes studies published between January 2012 and September 2021 that used
  GFAP as a potential blood biomarker to detect neurological disorders. The following
  electronic databases were accessed: MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science. In all
  the databases, the following search strategy was used:  GFAP  OR  glial fibrillary
  acidic protein  AND  neurological  OR  neurodegenerative  AND  plasma  OR  serum
  . The initial search identified 1152 articles. After the exclusion criteria were
  applied, 48 publications that reported GFAP levels in neurological disorders were
  identified. A total of16 different neurological disorders that have plasmatic GFAP
  levels as a possible biomarker for the disease were described in the articles, being:
  multiple sclerosis, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson
  disease, COVID-19, epileptic seizures, Wilson Disease, diabetic ketoacidosis, schizophrenia,
  autism spectrum disorders, major depressive disorder, glioblastoma, spinal cord
  injury, asthma, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and Friedreich's ataxia.
  Our review shows an association between GFAP levels and the disease being studied,
  suggesting that elevated GFAP levels are a potentially valuable diagnostic biomarker
  in the evaluation of different neurological diseases."
