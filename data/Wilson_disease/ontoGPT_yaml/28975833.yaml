input_text: The Role of Diagnosis and Treatment of Underlying Liver Disease for the
  Prognosis of Primary Liver Cancer.Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading
  cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Underlying chronic liver disease has been
  associated with an increased risk of developing HCC. This study is a review of the
  current literature regarding the diagnosis, prognostic significance, and role of
  treating underlying liver disease in patients who are at risk of primary liver cancer.
  Relevant peer review of the English literature between 1980 and 2017 within PubMed
  and the Cochrane library was conducted for scientific content on current advances
  in managing chronic liver diseases and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma.
  Hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus (HBV), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, autoimmune
  hepatitis, hereditary hemochromatosis, Wilson disease, primary biliary cirrhosis,
  alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, and certain drugs lead to an increased risk of developing
  HCC. Patients with underlying liver disease have an increased incidence of HCC.
  Hepatitis C virus, HBV, and hemochromatosis can directly lead to HCC without the
  presence of cirrhosis, while HCC related to other underlying liver diseases occurs
  in patients with cirrhosis. Treating the underlying liver disease and reducing the
  progression to cirrhosis should lead to a decreased incidence of HCC.
