input_text: "Designing Clinical Trials in Wilson's Disease.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Wilson's
  disease (WD) is an autosomal-recessive disorder caused by ATP7B gene mutations leading
  to pathological accumulation of copper in the liver and brain. Adoption of initial
  treatments for WD was based on empirical observations. These therapies are effective,
  but there are still unmet needs for which treatment modalities are being developed.
  An increase of therapeutical trials is anticipated. APPROACH AND RESULTS: The first
  Wilson Disease Aarhus Symposium (May 2019) included a workshop on randomized clinical
  trial design. The authors of the article were organizers or presented during this
  workshop, and this article presents their consensus on the design of clinical trials
  for WD, addressing trial population, treatment comparators, inclusion and exclusion
  criteria, and treatment endpoints. To achieve adequate recruitment of patients with
  this rare disorder, the study groups should include all clinical phenotypes and
  treatment-experienced as well as treatment-naive patients. CONCLUSIONS: The primary
  study endpoint should be clinical or a composite endpoint until appropriate surrogate
  endpoints are validated. Standardization of clinical trials will permit pooling
  of data and allow for better treatment comparisons, as well as reduce the future
  numbers of patients needed per trial."
