input_text: "Wilson disease tissue classification and characterization using seven
  artificial intelligence models embedded with 3D optimization paradigm on a weak
  training brain magnetic resonance imaging datasets: a supercomputer application.Wilson's
  disease (WD) is caused by copper accumulation in the brain and liver, and if not
  treated early, can lead to severe disability and death. WD has shown white matter
  hyperintensity (WMH) in the brain magnetic resonance scans (MRI) scans, but the
  diagnosis is challenging due to (i) subtle intensity changes and (ii) weak training
  MRI when using artificial intelligence (AI). Design and validate seven types of
  high-performing AI-based computer-aided design (CADx) systems consisting of 3D optimized
  classification, and characterization of WD against controls. We propose a \"conventional
  deep convolution neural network\" (cDCNN) and an \"improved DCNN\" (iDCNN) where
  rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function was modified ensuring \"differentiable
  at zero.\" Three-dimensional optimization was achieved by recording accuracy while
  changing the CNN layers and augmentation by several folds. WD was characterized
  using (i) CNN-based feature map strength and (ii) Bispectrum strengths of pixels
  having higher probabilities of WD. We further computed the (a) area under the curve
  (AUC), (b) diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), (c) reliability, and (d) stability and (e)
  benchmarking. Optimal results were achieved using 9 layers of CNN, with 4-fold augmentation.
  iDCNN yields superior performance compared to cDCNN with accuracy and AUC of 98.28
  +- 1.55, 0.99 (p < 0.0001), and 97.19 +- 2.53%, 0.984 (p < 0.0001), respectively.
  DOR of iDCNN outperformed cDCNN fourfold. iDCNN also outperformed (a) transfer learning-based
  \"Inception V3\" paradigm by 11.92% and (b) four types of \"conventional machine
  learning-based systems\": k-NN, decision tree, support vector machine, and random
  forest by 55.13%, 28.36%, 15.35%, and 14.11%, respectively. The AI-based systems
  can potentially be useful in the early WD diagnosis. Graphical Abstract."
