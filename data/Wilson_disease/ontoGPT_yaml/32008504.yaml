input_text: "Effect of Liver Transplant on Neurologic Manifestations and Brain Magnetic
  Resonance Imaging Findings in Wilson Disease.OBJECTIVES: Wilson disease is an autosomal
  recessive disorder of copper metabolism. It leads to copper accumulation in various
  organs (liver, eye, brain) and deteriorates their functions. Symptoms usually appear
  in the second and third decades of life. Neurologic symptoms and manifestations
  may appear 2 to 5 years after liver involvement, and neurologic symptoms are usually
  movement disorders. The main treatment objective is to decrease accumulation of
  copper by increasing urinary copper excretion. With early diagnosis and treatment,
  the quality of life of patients with Wilson disease evolves. In this study, we aimed
  to evaluate the effects of liver transplant on neurologic manifestations and radiologic
  findings in patients with Wilson disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Since 1988, our
  center has performed 642 liver transplant procedures. Fifty-three patients with
  Wilson disease received a liver transplant during this period, with 15 adults patients
  included in our study. All study patients were evaluated by the same neurologist
  and radiologist. Tremor was scored by the glass scale test. Radiologic evaluations
  were made by cranial magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Before liver transplant,
  4/15 study patients had tremor. In 1 patient, tremor was accompanied by dystonia;
  the patient's imaging findings and neurologic manifestations had regressed posttransplant.
  In the other 3 study patients with tremor, tremor decreased without any change in
  imaging findings. New-onset tremor was seen in 1 patient after liver transplant,
  but this patient had no observed imaging changes. This situation was correlated
  with immunosuppressive therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Neurologic recovery can be achieved
  in patients with Wilson disease with early diagnosis and treatment. Radiologic findings
  can be improved after therapy."
