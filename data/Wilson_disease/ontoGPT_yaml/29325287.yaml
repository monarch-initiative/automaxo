input_text: "[The diagnostic value and limits of diagnostic parameters for Wilson's
  disease].Wilson disease (WD) is a rare and treatable genetic disorder. This paper
  describes the new advances and author's long-term experiences in the diagnosis of
  WD. The characteristics in clinical and routine tests are: the age of presentation
  can be quite broad, the WD could not be excluded based on age only; the patients
  usually have mild digestive symptoms but obvious chronic liver disease signs; liver
  function tests may reveal normal or a mild elevation in bilirubin, ALT and AST,
  but quite abnormal in serum albumin and prothrombin time in most patients; Coombs-negative
  hemolytic anemia, normal or markedly subnormal serum alkaline phosphatase (typically
  < 40 IU/L) are useful for the diagnosis of fulminant WD. In china, Kayser-Fleischer
  rings are present in 72.2% of patients at the time of diagnosis, the positive rate
  is significantly higher in patients with a neurological presentation (93.4%) than
  patients presenting with liver disease (63.3%), however, they are usually absent
  in children under 6 years old, occasionly present in patients with chronic cholestatic
  liver disease. The mean serum ceruloplamin level in WD patients is 71.1 +- 48.7
  mg/L, the level is < 200 mg/L in 98.9% of patients, < 100 mg/L in about three fourths
  patients, < 50 mg/L in about half patients, but it may be low in 50% of patients
  with severe end-stage liver disease of any etiology too, and even lower than 50
  mg/L in patients with nephritic syndrome. Basal 24-hour urinary copper excretion
  may be>=100 g at presentation in 86.7% of patients with WD, but also in 22% of Patients
  with certain chronic liver diseases, the sensitivity of penicillamine challenge
  test is lower than basal urinary copper excretion, however, the specificity is significantly
  higher than former (97% versus 78%). Hepatic copper determination remains the gold
  standard for the diagnosis of WD. We have designed a standard method for hepatic
  copper determination. The most useful cut-off value is 209 g/g dry wt using our
  method, with the sensitivity of 99.4%, and specificity of 96.1%. However, long-standing
  hepatic failure and or obstruction can cause heptic copper elevations into the WD
  area. In recent years, direct complete DNA sequencing has become easy, rapid, less
  expensive and commercially available. Currently reported mutation detection rate
  is 90%, the specificity is almost 100%. The limitation to the method has been the
  ability to identify all the affected alleles in suspected individuals. If no mutation
  is identified, the diagnosis of WD could not be excluded. None of the laboratory
  parameters alone allows a definite diagnosis of WD. The WD diagnostic scoring system
  based on a composite of key parameters helps clinicians to gauge the degree of certainty
  of the diagnosis: WD scores greater than 4, the diagnosis of WD is highly likely;
  score 0 or 1, the diagnosis is unlikely. However, the WD diagnosis could not be
  excluded in suspected patients who do not perform genetic test and hepatic copper
  determination. Patients with chronic cholestatic liver disease may have scores more
  than 4."
