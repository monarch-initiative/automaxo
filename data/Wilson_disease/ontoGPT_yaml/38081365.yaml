input_text: 'Effects of tetrathiomolybdate on copper metabolism in healthy volunteers
  and in patients with Wilson disease.BACKGROUND & AIMS: In Wilson Disease (WD), copper
  accumulates in the liver and brain causing disease. Bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate
  (TTM) is a potent copper chelator that may be associated with a lower risk of inducing
  paradoxical neurological worsening than conventional therapy for neurologic WD.
  To better understand the mode of action of TTM, we investigated its effects on copper
  absorption and biliary excretion. METHODS: In a double-blind randomized setting,
  hepatic 64Cu activity was examined after orally administered 64Cu by PET/CT in 16
  healthy volunteers before and after seven days of TTM treatment (15 mg/d) or placebo.
  Oral 64Cu was administered one hour after the final TTM dose. Changes in hepatic
  64Cu activity reflected changes in intestinal 64Cu uptake. Additionally, in four
  patients with WD, the distribution of 64Cu in venous blood, liver, gallbladder,
  kidney, and brain was followed after i.v. 64Cu dosing for up to 68 hours before
  and after seven days of TTM (15 mg/day), using PET/MRI. Increased gallbladder 64Cu
  activity was taken as evidence of increased biliary 64Cu excretion. RESULTS: In
  healthy volunteers, TTM reduced intestinal 64Cu uptake by 82% 15 hours after the
  oral 64Cu dose. In patients with WD, gallbladder 64Cu activity was negligible before
  and after TTM, while TTM effectively retained 64Cu in the blood, significantly reduced
  hepatic 64Cu activity at all time-points and significantly reduced cerebral 64Cu
  activity two hours after the intravenous 64Cu dose. CONCLUSIONS: While we did not
  show an increase in biliary excretion of 64Cu following TTM administration, we demonstrated
  that TTM effectively inhibited most intestinal 64Cu uptake and retained 64Cu in
  the blood stream, limiting the exposure of 64Cu to organs like the liver and the
  brain. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: Bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) is an investigational
  copper chelator being developed for the treatment of Wilson disease. In animal models
  of Wilson disease, TTM has been shown to facilitate biliary copper excretion. In
  the present human study, TTM surprisingly did not facilitate biliary copper excretion
  but instead reduced intestinal copper uptake to a clinically significant degree.
  Our study builds on our understanding of human copper metabolism and the mechanism
  of action of TTM.'
