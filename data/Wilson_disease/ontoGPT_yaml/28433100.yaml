input_text: Diagnosis of Wilson disease.Clinical presentation of Wilson disease can
  vary widely; therefore diagnosis is not always straightforward. Wilson disease is
  not just a disease of children and young adults, but may present at any age. The
  key features of Wilson disease are liver disease and cirrhosis, neuropsychiatric
  disturbances, Kayser-Fleischer rings, and acute episodes of hemolysis, often in
  association with acute liver failure. Diagnosis is particularly difficult in children
  and in adults presenting with active liver disease. None of the available laboratory
  tests is perfect and may not be specific for Wilson disease. A detailed neurologic
  examination is required for all cases. Neuroimaging and electrophysiologic methods
  are helpful. To overcome the diagnostic challenge, several clinical signs (Kayser-Fleischer
  rings, neurologic symptoms) and laboratory features (copper in serum, urine, liver;
  serum ceruloplasmin; genetic testing) are scored 0 (absent) to 2 (present) and the
  Leipzig score is calculated. If the score is >=4, the diagnosis of Wilson disease
  is very likely. For asymptomatic siblings of index patients, mutation analysis is
  the most reliable approach.
