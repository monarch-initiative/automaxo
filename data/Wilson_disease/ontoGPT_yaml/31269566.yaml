input_text: '[Clinical characteristics of patients with delayed hepatolenticular degeneration].Objective:
  To evaluate the clinical manifestations, metal metabolism, imaging characteristics
  and treatment response in patients with delayed Wilson disease (WD). Methods: Patients
  with untreated WD (40 with delayed onset and 40 with non-delayed onset) were enrolled.
  Twenty healthy people were included as normal controls. All patients were evaluated
  with modified Young scale neural symptom scores, grade of Child liver function and
  mental symptoms rating scale, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, magnetic sensitive
  imaging (susceptibility weighted imaging, SWI), metal metabolism. Corrected phase
  (CP) was measured at SWI. After 2 week treatment, neurologic symptoms, liver function,
  and metal metabolism were reviewed. Results: The total score of neurological symptoms
  in WD patients with delayed onset was lower than that of non-delayed onset (13.00+-6.87
  vs. 21.13+-5.53, P=0.033). The scores of SCL-90 and HAMA depression scales in patients
  with delayed onset were lower than those of non-delayed onset. On T(2) weighted
  imaging, areas including substantia nigra and thalamus, the caudate nucleus, globus
  pallidus, putamen presented high signal rate in patients with delated onset than
  those with non-delayed (P=0.022, 0.037, 0.022, 0.037, 0.029 respectively). The SWI
  CP values of cangbai sphere and shell nucleus in patients with delayed onset were
  lower than those with non-delayed onset. Patients with delayed onset had higher
  urinary copper than those with non-delayed onset before and after treatment (P=0.040,
  0.036). After treatment, the score of abnormal tremor and gait in patients with
  delayed onset was decreased (P=0.037, 0.044), while as the occurrence of neurological
  symptoms was increased by 10%, and the liver function level in patients with delayed
  WD was decreased in 3 cases. Conclusions: The brain of WD patients with delayed
  onset is mainly composed of metal deposits, however the cell damage is not apparent.
  Clinical symptoms are characterized by significant liver injury, but relatively
  mild neurological and psychiatric symptoms. Patients with delayed WD have higher
  urinary copper excretion than those with non-delayed WD. Chelating agents improves
  the neurological symptoms in patients with delayed onset.'
