input_text: Metallothionein immunohistochemistry has high sensitivity and specificity
  for detection of Wilson disease.Diagnosis of Wilson disease (WD) can be difficult
  because of its protean clinical presentations, but early diagnosis is important
  because effective treatment is available and can prevent disease progression. Similarly,
  diagnosis of WD on liver biopsy specimens is difficult due to the wide range of
  histologic appearances. A stain that could help identify WD patients would be of
  great value. The goal of this study was to use mass spectrometry-based proteomics
  to identify potential proteins that are differentially expressed in WD compared
  to controls, and could serve as potential immunohistochemical markers for screening.
  Several proteins were differentially expressed in WD and immunohistochemical stains
  for two (metallothionein (MT) and cytochrome C oxidase copper chaperone (COX17))
  were tested and compared to other methods of diagnosis in WD including copper staining
  and quantitative copper assays. We found diffuse metallothionein immunoreactivity
  in all liver specimens from patients with WD (n = 20); the intensity of the staining
  was moderate to strong. This staining pattern was distinct from that seen in specimens
  from the control groups (none of which showed strong, diffuse staining), which included
  diseases that may be in the clinical or histologic differential of WD (steatohepatitis
  (n = 51), chronic viral hepatitis (n = 40), autoimmune hepatitis (n = 50), chronic
  biliary tract disease (n = 42), and normal liver (n = 20)). COX17 immunostain showed
  no significant difference in expression between the WD and control groups. MT had
  higher sensitivity than rhodanine for diagnosis of WD. While the quantitative liver
  copper assays also had high sensitivity, they require more tissue, have a higher
  cost, longer turnaround time, and are less widely available than an immunohistochemical
  stain. We conclude that MT IHC is a sensitive immunohistochemical stain for the
  diagnosis of WD that could be widely deployed as a screening tool for liver biopsies
  in which WD is in the clinical or histologic differential diagnosis.
