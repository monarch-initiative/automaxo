input_text: "Alternative Etiologies of Liver Disease in Children With Suspected NAFLD.OBJECTIVES:
  To determine the prevalence of alternative causes of liver disease in a cohort of
  youth with overweight and obesity undergoing evaluation for suspected nonalcoholic
  fatty liver disease (NAFLD). METHODS: Multicenter, retrospective cohort study of
  patients aged <=18 years with overweight and obesity and evidence of elevated serum
  aminotransferases and/or hepatic steatosis on imaging, referred for suspected NAFLD
  to Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (2009-2017) or Yale New Haven Children's
  Hospital (2012-2017). Testing was performed to exclude the following: autoimmune
  hepatitis (AIH), Wilson disease, viral hepatitis (B and C), thyroid dysfunction,
  celiac disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, and hemochromatosis. RESULTS: A
  total of 900 children with overweight and obesity (63% boys, 26% Hispanic ethnicity)
  were referred, with a median age of 13 years (range: 2-18). Most had severe obesity
  (n = 666; 76%) with a median BMI z score of 2.45 (interquartile range [IQR]: 2.2-2.7).
  Median alanine aminotransferase level at presentation was 64 U/L (IQR: 42-95). A
  clinically indicated liver biopsy was performed in 358 children (40%) at a median
  of 6 months (IQR: 1-14) post initial visit; of those, 46% had confirmed nonalcoholic
  steatohepatitis. Positive autoantibodies were observed in 13% of the cohort, but
  none met criteria for AIH. Only 19 (2%) were found to have other causes of liver
  disease, with no cases of viral hepatitis or Wilson disease detected. CONCLUSIONS:
  In a large, multicenter cohort, the vast majority of children with overweight and
  obesity with presumed or confirmed NAFLD tested negative for other causes of liver
  disease. In contrast to a previous pediatric report, no patient was diagnosed with
  AIH."
