input_text: 'Case Report: Bilateral Valsalva Retinopathy in an Acutely Anemic Patient.SIGNIFICANCE:
  The Valsalva maneuver is known to cause pre-retinal hemorrhages, which have a predilection
  to affect the macula. Certain conditions may increase the risk of developing Valsalva
  retinopathy including anemia. Knowing these associations can aid in uncovering underlying
  systemic conditions for which a patient may not otherwise be aware. PURPOSE: This
  case report reviews the presentation of Valsalva retinopathy and the impacts of
  acute anemia on retinal findings. Recommendations for management are also reviewed
  and reported. CASE REPORT: A 30-year-old Hispanic man presented to the emergency
  department for progressing weakness over the previous month. He had a history of
  polysubstance abuse and had not been eating for the previous month except for water
  intake. He was diagnosed with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, anemia, thrombocytopenia,
  hypercoagulable state, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesia and admitted to the intensive
  care unit for treatment and observation. He was referred to the eye clinic to be
  examined for Kayser-Fleischer rings because of concern for Wilson disease. On ophthalmological
  examination, the patient had reduced vision in both eyes attributed to bilateral
  subinternal limiting membrane macular hemorrhages likely due to Valsalva, with acute
  anemia and thrombocytopenia as contributing factors. The patient was referred to
  a retinal specialist, and observation was recommended with follow-up in 3 months.
  The patient, unfortunately, never followed up despite multiple attempts to reschedule.
  CONCLUSIONS: Patient history and the common location of retinal hemorrhages aid
  in diagnosing Valsalva retinopathy. In this case, the patient had a known history
  of acute anemia and thrombocytopenia with a recent history of straining. Anemia,
  among other systemic conditions, can increase the risk of developing retinopathy
  after a Valsalva maneuver. Although Valsalva retinopathy can occur in healthy patients
  without underlying conditions, it is important to rule out other conditions that
  might present with retinal hemorrhage or that may increase the risk of Valsalva
  retinopathy.'
