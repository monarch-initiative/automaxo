input_text: 'Ninety days transplant free survival with high volume plasma exchange
  in Wilson disease presenting as acute liver failure.OBJECTIVE: To study the efficacy
  and safety of high volume plasma exchange (HVPE) in Wilson disease presenting as
  acute liver failure (WD-ALF). METHODS: An analysis of prospectively collected data
  of consecutively admitted WD-ALF cases was done and patients were divided into two
  groups: (i) high volume plasma exchange (HVPE) group- who received HVPE + standard
  medical therapy (SMT), and (ii) SMT group- received only SMT. Outcome measure was
  transplant free survival (TFS) at 90 days post enrollment, change in biochemical,
  hemodynamic parameters & incidence of organ dysfunction in HVPE as compared to SMT
  group, and HVPE related complications. RESULTS: Out of the total 43 cases of WD-ALF
  reported in the study period, 37 were enrolled (median age 9 years, 62.2% males).
  All biochemical parameters and prognostic indices except blood ammonia and serum
  creatinine improved significantly at 72 to 96 hours after enrollment in the HVPE
  group. Overall, TFS at 90 days was present in 9/19 (47.3%) in HVPE group vs 3/18
  (16.6%) in the SMT group (OR 2.84, 95% CI 0.91-8.8, P = .049). Kaplan Meier survival
  analysis revealed that HVPE group had significantly higher cumulative survival as
  per the Log Rank test (P = .027); median days of survival was 38 days (IQR 12-63)
  in HVPE group vs 14 (IQR 5-22) days in SMT group. CONCLUSIONS: The present study
  indicates that in children with WD-ALF, HVPE not only acts as a bridging therapy
  to LT but may also improve proportion of the cases with TFS.'
