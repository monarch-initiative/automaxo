input_text: 'Electrocardiographic Manifestations In Paediatric Wilson Disease.BACKGROUND:
  Wilson disease (WD) is one of the most common metabolic liver diseases in older
  children. It has a strong genetic background with autosomal recessive inheritance.
  WD is a multisystem disorder with predominant hepatic and neurological manifestations
  and variable age of presentation. The data on cardiac manifestations in children
  is very limited and only few adult studies are available in the literature. This
  study was planned to determine the frequency and spectrum of Electrocardiographic
  (ECG) changes in pediatric WD. METHODS: This was an observational cross-sectional
  study conducted at The Children Hospital & the Institute of Child Health, Lahore,
  from January 2015 to January 2017. The children diagnosed as Wilson disease were
  enrolled for the recording of resting ECG. The ECG changes were seen and discussed
  with an experienced pediatric cardiologist who was involved and explained about
  the objectives of study. RESULTS: Total 55 patients were enrolled but record of
  ECG was missing for 4 patients and excluded from the study. Out of 51 patients 22
  had at least one ECG abnormality. Most frequent findings seen were T wave abnormality
  in 18 patients (35.2%) followed by sinus tachycardia and sinus bradycardia in 12
  and 8 patients respectively. Other abnormalities included bifid P waves, ST segment
  changes each of 2 patients, and one premature ventricular contraction. QRS details
  including axis, complex, amplitude ratio and QT interval was normal in all the patients.
  There was no mortality during the study period due to cardiac cause. CONCLUSIONS:
  ECG abnormalities are not uncommon in pediatric WD but of mild nature. These are
  presumably related to underlying cardiomyopathy due to deposition of copper in heart
  which can be quantified by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and echocardiography
  is required to confirm ECG abnormalities detected.'
