input_text: Genetics of Wilson disease and Wilson-like phenotype in a clinical series
  from eastern Spain.Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused
  by ATP7B mutations. Subjects with only one mutation may show clinical signs and
  individuals with biallelic changes may remain asymptomatic. We aimed to achieve
  a conclusive genetic diagnosis for 34 patients clinically diagnosed of WD. Genetic
  analysis comprised from analysis of exons to WES (whole exome sequencing), including
  promoter, introns, UTRs (untranslated regions), besides of study of large deletions/duplications
  by MLPA (multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification). Biallelic ATP7B mutations
  were identified in 30 patients, so that four patients were analyzed using WES. Two
  affected siblings resulted to be compound heterozygous for mutations in CCDC115,
  which is involved in a form of congenital disorder of glycosylation. In sum, the
  majority of patients with a WD phenotype carry ATP7B mutations. However, if genetic
  diagnosis is not achieved, additional genes should be considered because other disorders
  may mimic WD.
