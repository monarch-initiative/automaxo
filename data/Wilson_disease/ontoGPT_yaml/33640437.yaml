input_text: 'Direct Measurement of ATP7B Peptides Is Highly Effective in the Diagnosis
  of Wilson Disease.BACKGROUND & AIMS: Both existing clinical criteria and genetic
  testing have significant limitations for the diagnosis of Wilson disease (WD), often
  creating ambiguities in patient identification and leading to delayed diagnosis
  and ineffective management. ATP7B protein concentration, indicated by direct measurement
  of surrogate peptides from patient dried blood spot samples, could provide primary
  evidence of WD. ATP7B concentrations were measured in patient samples from diverse
  backgrounds, diagnostic potential is determined, and results are compared with biochemical
  and genetic results from individual patients. METHODS: Two hundred and sixty-four
  samples from biorepositories at 3 international and 2 domestic academic centers
  and 150 normal controls were obtained after Institutional Review Board approval.
  Genetically or clinically confirmed WD patients with a Leipzig score >3 and obligate
  heterozygote (carriers) from affected family members were included. ATP7B peptide
  measurements were made by immunoaffinity enrichment mass spectrometry. RESULTS:
  Two ATP7B peptides were used to measure ATP7B protein concentration. Receiver operating
  characteristics curve analysis generates an area under the curve of 0.98. ATP7B
  peptide analysis of the sequence ATP7B 887 was found to have a sensitivity of 91.2%,
  specificity of 98.1%, positive predictive value of 98.0%, and a negative predictive
  value of 91.5%. In patients with normal ceruloplasmin concentrations (>20 mg/dL),
  14 of 16 (87.5%) were ATP7B-deficient. In patients without clear genetic results,
  94% were ATP7B-deficient. CONCLUSIONS: Quantification of ATP7B peptide effectively
  identified WD patients in 92.1% of presented cases and reduced ambiguities resulting
  from ceruloplasmin and genetic analysis. Clarity is brought to patients with ambiguous
  genetic results, significantly aiding in noninvasive diagnosis. A proposed diagnostic
  score and algorithm incorporating ATP7B peptide concentrations can be rapidly diagnostic
  and supplemental to current Leipzig scoring systems.'
