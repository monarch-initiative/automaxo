input_text: Delineation of the healthy rabbit liver by immunohistochemistry - A technical
  note.Liver diseases pose a big global health problem and liver failure may result
  from viral infection, overnutrition or tumors. Studying pathologic liver tissue
  demands for accurate and specific histological stainings and immunohistochemical
  labellings, including chromogenic and fluorescent approaches. Moreover, a reliable
  set of healthy liver stainings and labellings are required, to provide a baseline
  or reference for the pathological situation. Here, we used the liver tissue of a
  healthy rabbit and compared different histological key steps, such as paraffin embedding
  after formalin fixation versus cryopreservation; or an antigen retrieval (AR) step
  in processing paraffin sections versus the same procedure without AR; or chromogenic
  with fluorescent detection system, respectively. Moreover, we provide images of
  serial sections, where we stained the same morphological structure with different
  markers, including collagen I, collagen III, fibronectin, alpha-SMA, elastin, protease-activated
  receptor-2 (PAR-2) which is an inflammation-related marker, ki67 for proliferating
  cells, and orcein (as negative control for pathological aberrations like Wilson
  disease). Differences between conditions were quantitatively assessed by measuring
  the colour intensity. Generally, we observed that cryosections exhibited a stronger
  signal intensity in immunohistochemically labelled sections than in paraffin sections;
  however, the strong staining got slurred, which sometimes hampered proper identification
  of morphological structures at higher magnifications. Moreover, there was a clear
  increase in signal intensity for paraffin sections when an AR step was performed
  compared to condition without AR. Results for mouse isotype staining as a negative
  control clearly supported those findings. Different stainings of the portal triad,
  the central vein and the bile ducts revealed a clear-cut distribution of extracellular
  matrix components, with prominent fibronectin and elastin around the lumen of the
  central vein as well as a patchy PAR-2 expression. As for the bile ducts, complete
  absence of alpha-SMA and PAR-2 was found at the margins, however, collagen I expression
  and elastin were positive and showed a strong signal. Like this, we provide useful
  and valuable reference images for researchers using the rabbit liver model. It may
  help to decide which of the immunohistochemical protocols are valuable to reach
  a certain aim and which protocols lead to the best visualization of the target structure.
