input_text: 'Comparison of Novel Fibrosis Index (NFI) with Aspartate aminotransferase
  to platelet ratio index (APRI) in Type II Diabetes mellitus patients with Non alcoholic
  fatty liver disease and fibrosis (NAFLD).With India being the "Diabetes capital
  of the world", nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is becoming the most common
  cause of liver dysfunction. Varied prevalence of this disease in Type II Diabetics
  indicate variability in NAFLD risk factors along with the particular diagnostic
  methods used. Investigations like liver biopsy and ultrasound abdomen have their
  limitations. Liver biopsy is invasive on the other hand ultrasound has less sensitivity.
  Several others are in the list, but are cost ineffective. Among the several non-invasive
  biomarkers, recently developed Novel Fibrosis Index (NFI) is a new addition. Newly
  developed NFI was developed by observing the various relationships and variations
  of serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, platelet count and serum albumin in liver
  fibrosis. MATERIAL: This hospital based observational cross section study was conducted
  from June 2020 to May 2021in 76 study population of Assam Medical College and Hospital.
  Type II Diabetes mellitus patients having more than 18 years were included after
  consent. Alcoholics, pregnant women and patients with secondary cause of hepatic
  steatosis [Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, Wilson disease, Autoimmune hepatitis, Hypothyroidism,
  starvation, Parenteral nutrition, On medications like (valproate, corticosteroids,
  antivirals)] were excluded. Novel fibrosis Index (NFI) were calculated by [Bilirubinx(ALP)2/Platelet
  count(Albumin)2] in study population. Fibroscan 402 is used for fibrosis stage assessment.
  Ziol transient elastography breaking point were used for staging of fibrosis in
  study population according to Metavir system of fibrosis. Area under the curves
  of NFI and APRI for different fibrosis stages were obtained by ROC curves using
  SPSS software edition 21.0. OBSERVATION: NFI and APRI where able to predict fibrosis
  stage with correlation coefficient indices 0.5174 and 0.5369 respectively. Area
  under the ROC curve for NFI and APRI were 0.807 and 0.793 respectively for discriminating
  F0-F1 and above. Area under the ROC curve for discriminating F0-F2 and above for
  NFI and APRI were 0.814 and 0.810. Area under the ROC curve for discriminating F0-F3
  and above for NFI and APRI were 0.935 and 0.913. CONCLUSION: Aggregate measures
  of performance across all possible classification threshold for NFI is better then
  APRI.'
