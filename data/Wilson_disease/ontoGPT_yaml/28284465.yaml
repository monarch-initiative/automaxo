input_text: 'Neurological disorders in liver transplant candidates: Pathophysiology
  and clinical assessment.Compromised liver function, as a consequence of acute liver
  insufficiency or severe chronic liver disease may be associated with various neurological
  syndromes, which involve both central and peripheral nervous system. Acute and severe
  hyperammoniemia inducing cellular metabolic alterations, prolonged state of "neuroinflammation",
  activation of brain microglia, accumulation of manganese and ammonia, and systemic
  inflammation are the main causative factors of brain damage in liver failure. The
  most widely recognized neurological complications of serious hepatocellular failure
  include hepatic encephalopathy, diffuse cerebral edema, Wilson disease, hepatic
  myelopathy, acquired hepatocerebral degeneration, cirrhosis-related Parkinsonism
  and osmotic demyelination syndrome. Neurological disorders affecting liver transplant
  candidates while in the waiting list may not only significantly influence preoperative
  morbidity and even mortality, but also represent important predictive factors for
  post-transplant neurological manifestations. Careful pre-transplant neurological
  evaluation is essential to define severity and distribution of the neurological
  impairment, to identify the abnormalities still responsive to current treatment,
  and to potentially predict the inherent post-operative prognosis. The preferred
  specific indices of neurological pre-transplant assessment may vary among centers,
  however, even with the aid of the current biochemical, neurophysiological, neuropsychological
  and neuroimaging diagnostic tools, the correct diagnosis and differential diagnosis
  of various syndromes may be difficult. In this article the relevant pathophysiological
  and clinical aspects of the most frequent brain and peripheral nervous system diseases
  affecting liver transplant candidates with acute or advanced chronic liver failure
  are briefly reported. The practical diagnostic findings useful for the preoperative
  assessment and treatment, as well as the expected neurological evolution after liver
  transplantation are also evaluated.'
