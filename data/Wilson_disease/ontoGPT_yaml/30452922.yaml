input_text: 'Activation of Autophagy, Observed in Liver Tissues From Patients With
  Wilson Disease and From ATP7B-Deficient Animals, Protects Hepatocytes From Copper-Induced
  Apoptosis.BACKGROUND & AIMS: Wilson disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of copper
  metabolism that leads to copper accumulation and toxicity in the liver and brain.
  It is caused by mutations in the adenosine triphosphatase copper transporting beta
  gene (ATP7B), which encodes a protein that transports copper from hepatocytes into
  the bile. We studied ATP7B-deficient cells and animals to identify strategies to
  decrease copper toxicity in patients with WD. METHODS: We used RNA-seq to compare
  gene expression patterns between wild-type and ATP7B-knockout HepG2 cells exposed
  to copper. We collected blood and liver tissues from Atp7b-/- and Atp7b+/- (control)
  rats (LPP) and mice; some mice were given 5 daily injections of an autophagy inhibitor
  (spautin-1) or vehicle. We obtained liver biopsies from 2 patients with WD in Italy
  and liver tissues from patients without WD (control). Liver tissues were analyzed
  by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, cell viability, apoptosis assays, and
  electron and confocal microscopy. Proteins were knocked down in cell lines using
  small interfering RNAs. Levels of copper were measured in cell lysates, blood samples,
  liver homogenates, and subcellular fractions by spectroscopy. RESULTS: After exposure
  to copper, ATP7B-knockout cells had significant increases in the expression of 103
  genes that regulate autophagy (including MAP1LC3A, known as LC3) compared with wild-type
  cells. Electron and confocal microscopy visualized more autophagic structures in
  the cytoplasm of ATP7B-knockout cells than wild-type cells after copper exposure.
  Hepatocytes in liver tissues from patients with WD and from Atp7b-/- mice and rats
  (but not controls) had multiple autophagosomes. In ATP7B-knockout cells, mammalian
  target of rapamycin (mTOR) had decreased activity and was dissociated from lysosomes;
  this resulted in translocation of the mTOR substrate transcription factor EB to
  the nucleus and activation of autophagy-related genes. In wild-type HepG2 cells
  (but not ATP7B-knockout cells), exposure to copper and amino acids induced recruitment
  of mTOR to lysosomes. Pharmacologic inhibitors of autophagy or knockdown of autophagy
  proteins ATG7 and ATG13 induced and accelerated the death of ATP7B-knockout HepG2
  cells compared with wild-type cells. Autophagy protected ATP7B-knockout cells from
  copper-induced death. CONCLUSION: ATP7B-deficient hepatocytes, such as in those
  in patients with WD, activate autophagy in response to copper overload to prevent
  copper-induced apoptosis. Agents designed to activate this autophagic pathway might
  decrease copper toxicity in patients with WD.'
