input_text: 'Does Liver Transplant Improve Neurological Symptoms in Wilson Disease?
  Report of 24 Cases.OBJECTIVES: Wilson disease is an inherited disorder that results
  in copper accumulation in the tissues with liver injury and failure. Orthotopic
  liver transplant is one of the treatments of choice for this disease. The aim of
  this study was to compare the neurological symptoms, before and after orthotopic
  livertransplant, of patients with liver cirrhosis due to Wilson disease, who represent
  a special group of patients with liver failure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2007
  and 2020, there were 24 patients with Wilson disease resistant to medical treatment
  who underwent deceased donor orthotopic livertransplant and were followed up for
  1 year, 5 years, and 10 years for evaluation with neurological scoring systems.
  Patients were also evaluated for postoperative complications and survival. RESULTS:
  Of the 24 patients evaluated, there were 13 (54.2%) female patients and 11 (45.8%)
  male patients, and the mean age was 34 years (range, 14-57 years). One of the patients
  died from early postoperative sepsis. After orthotopic livertransplant, disease
  scores returned to normal in 16 patients and improved in the remaining patients.
  Before transplant, all patients required help in their daily activities. After transplant,
  there were significant improvements in some symptoms, and the patients became more
  independent in their daily lives. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that orthotopic liver
  transplant provides significant improvement in neurological symptoms and quality
  of life in patients with Wilson disease.'
