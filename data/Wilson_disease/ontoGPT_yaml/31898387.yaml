input_text: 'Non-invasive diagnosis of cirrhosis and long-term disease monitoring
  by transient elastography in patients with Wilson disease.BACKGROUND & AIMS: The
  value of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by transient elastography (TE) for non-invasive
  fibrosis staging and disease monitoring has not been established in patients with
  Wilson disease (WD). METHODS: Liver stiffness measurement by TE and non-invasive
  fibrosis scores (APRI, FIB-4) were analysed from 188 WD patients with liver biopsy
  (LBX). Longitudinal LSM was performed in 128 (68.1%) patients. RESULTS: One hundred
  and eighty-eight patients (mean age: 35 +- 14 years, 54.8% women; 27.1% with histological
  cirrhosis) were studied. Forty-four[23.4%] patients were recently diagnosed with
  WD, while 144[76.6%] were previously diagnosed (>1 year between LBX and LSM). Overall,
  LSM (11.3 vs 6.1 kPa, P < .001), APRI (0.72 vs 0.38, P < .001) and FIB-4 (1.54 vs
  0.89, P < .001) were higher in cirrhotic than in non-cirrhotic patients. This was
  even more pronounced in recently diagnosed patients (35.2 kPa vs 6.4 kPa, P < .001).
  Accuracy for diagnosing cirrhosis at an LSM cut-off >=9.9 kPa was better in recently
  diagnosed (PPV: 74%, NPV: 100%) vs previously diagnosed (PPV: 53%, NPV: 82%) patients.
  Recently diagnosed patients had higher Area Under the Curve (AUC) for APRI (0.79
  vs 0.61) and FIB-4 (0.84 vs 0.65) than previously diagnosed patients. At APRI <1.5
  and FIB-4 <3.25 cirrhosis was ruled out with a specificity of 93% and 95% respectively.
  During a median follow-up of 46 (24-66) months, only 5.9% (5/85) of non-cirrhotic
  WD patients showed progression to cirrhotic LSM values, while 30.8% (4/13) of cirrhotic
  WD patients showed LSM suggestive of cirrhosis regression. CONCLUSION: TE-based
  LSM >=9.9 kPa accurately identifies cirrhosis in WD patients. Next to TE-LSM <9.9
  kPa, APRI <1.5 and FIB-4 <3.25 values assist to non-invasively rule out cirrhosis.
  LSM remains stable in most non-cirrhotic patients on WD therapy, while one-third
  of cirrhotic patients present clinically relevant decreases in LSM.'
