input_text: Bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate prevents copper-induced blood-brain barrier
  damage.In Wilson disease, excessive copper accumulates in patients' livers and may,
  upon serum leakage, severely affect the brain according to current viewpoints. Present
  remedies aim at avoiding copper toxicity by chelation, for example, by D-penicillamine
  (DPA) or bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate (ALXN1840), the latter with a very high
  copper affinity. Hence, ALXN1840 may potentially avoid neurological deterioration
  that frequently occurs upon DPA treatment. As the etiology of such worsening is
  unclear, we reasoned that copper loosely bound to albumin, that is, mimicking a
  potential liver copper leakage into blood, may damage cells that constitute the
  blood-brain barrier, which was found to be the case in an in vitro model using primary
  porcine brain capillary endothelial cells. Such blood-brain barrier damage was avoided
  by ALXN1840, plausibly due to firm protein embedding of the chelator bound copper,
  but not by DPA. Mitochondrial protection was observed, a prerequisite for blood-brain
  barrier integrity. Thus, high-affinity copper chelators may minimize such deterioration
  in the treatment of neurologic Wilson disease.
