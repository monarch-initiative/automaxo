input_text: Wilson Disease in Children; Chelation Therapy or Liver Transplantation?
  A 10-Year Experience from Pakistan.BACKGROUND Wilson disease (WD) is a rare genetic
  disorder with vast clinical presentations and a higher incidence in areas where
  consanguinity is common. Most patients can be treated with oral chelation, but some
  require advanced surgical intervention, like liver transplantation (LT). This study
  aims to review outcomes of WD patients presenting to a tertiary care center over
  a period of 10 years. MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective analysis was conducted
  at Shifa International Hospital, Islamabad, Pakistan. Patients <18 years who were
  diagnosed with WD per ESPAGHAN guidelines from 2010 to 2020 were included. Presentation,
  diagnosis, treatment, and LT and its complications were recorded. Follow-ups were
  recorded, and patients were contacted by phone in cases of interrupted follow-up.
  Frequencies and percentages of variables were calculated. RESULTS A total of 48
  patients with WD were identified. Symptomatic disease was seen in 45 patients, with
  3 diagnosed on screening. The hepatic form was common (62.2%). Mean age at diagnosis
  was 9.74 (range 5-17) years, 28 (58.3%) were male, while 17 (35.4%) were female.
  Urinary copper was increased in all patients (645.82+-528.40). Oral treatment with
  penicillamine was given to 34 (75.5%) patients; 4 (8.9%) died while on oral treatment.
  Living donor LT was performed in 11 (22.9%) patients, who had a mean King's Wilson
  index of 11 (range, 6-14). Currently, all LT patients are alive, with maximum graft
  survival of 7 years. CONCLUSIONS LT offers a promising treatment with good outcomes
  in pediatric WD. However, timely diagnosis and management with oral chelation therapy
  can prolong survival without LT.
