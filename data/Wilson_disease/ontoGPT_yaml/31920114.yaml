input_text: "Switching Pharmacological Treatment in Wilson Disease: Case Report and
  Recommendations.Background. Available treatments for Wilson disease (WD) prevent
  longterm complications of copper accumulation. Current anti-copper agents include
  zinc salts, penicillamine, and trientine. Patients with WD may switch between the
  agents for a number of reasons. Due to the different mechanisms of action between
  the copper chelators and zinc salts, transitioning could require a period of overlap
  and increased monitoring. There are no large studies that investigate the best transition
  strategies between agents. In this article, we review the treatments for WD and
  how to monitor for treatment efficacy. Case Summary. The patient had been diagnosed
  with WD for over 20 years prior to establishing care in our Hepatology Clinic. During
  his initial course, he was transitioned from penicillamine to zinc due to evidence
  suggesting penicillamine had greater adverse effects in the long term. Later, he
  was switched to trientine. His liver enzymes and 24-hour urine copper were monitored.
  During these years, he intermittently had some financial hardship, requiring him
  to be on penicillamine rather than trientine. He also had developed acute kidney
  injury. Overall, his liver disease remained under control and he never had signs
  of decompensated cirrhosis, but had fluctuations of liver enzymes over the years.
  Conclusion. Anti-copper treatment for WD has to be tailored to medication side effects
  profile, patient's chronic and emerging comorbidities, as well as costs. Transitioning
  regimens is often challenging, and it requires closer monitoring, with no predictors
  of response."
