input_text: 'Wilson disease: revision of diagnostic criteria in a clinical series
  with great genetic homogeneity.BACKGROUND: Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive
  disorder of copper metabolism caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene. An early diagnosis
  is crucial to prevent evolution of the disease, as implantation of early therapeutic
  measures fully prevents its symptoms. As population genetics data predict a higher
  than initially expected prevalence, it was important to define the basic diagnostic
  tools to approach population screening. METHODS: A highly genetically homogeneous
  cohort of 70 patients, belonging to 50 unrelated families, has been selected as
  a framework to analyze all their clinical, biochemical and genetic characteristics,
  to define the disease in our population, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 12,369,
  and determine the most useful features that reach diagnostic value. RESULTS: Serum
  ceruloplasmin below 11.5 mg/dL and cupremia below 60 mug/mL, were the best analytical
  predictors of the disease in asymptomatic individuals, while cupruria or hepatic
  copper determination were less powerful. Genetic analysis reached a conclusive diagnosis
  in all 65 patients available for complete testing. Of them, 48 were carriers of
  at least one p.Leu708Pro mutant allele, with 24 homozygotes. Nine patients carried
  a promoter deletion mutation, revealing that extended sequencing beyond the ATP7B
  gene-coding region is essential. All mutations caused hepatic damage since early
  ages, increasing its severity as diagnosis was delayed, and neurological symptoms
  appear. CONCLUSION: Serum ceruloplasmin determination followed by genetic screening
  would reduce costs and favor the prioritization of non-invasive procedures to reach
  a definitive diagnosis, even for asymptomatic cases.'
