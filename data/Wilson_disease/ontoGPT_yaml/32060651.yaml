input_text: 'A study of susceptibility-weighted imaging in patients with Wilson disease
  during the treatment of metal chelator.OBJECTIVE: A randomized-controlled trial
  comparing study of the changes in brain sensitive-weighted imaging (SWI) of Wilson
  disease (WD) patients during the treatment with metal chelator was done. METHODS:
  100 untreated WD patients (80 cases of cerebral type, 20 cases of hepatic type,
  age 20.13 +- 9.12 years old) and 20 normal controls were selected. Neurological
  symptoms were scored using the modified Young scale. Liver function tests and copper
  indices were collected. All study objects received SWI test of the brain. The values
  of corrected phase (CP) were calculated on SWI. Cerebral-type WD patients were treated
  with D-penicillamine (DPA) (group 1) or Dimercaptopropane Sulfonate (DMPS) + Dimercaptosuccinic
  Acid (DMSA) (group 2). Hepatic-type WD patients were treated with DPA (group 3).
  All patients received annual neurological symptom score, liver function, copper
  indices, and SWI examination. RESULTS: At the first year of treatment, score of
  the modified Young scale in group 2 was lower than that in group 1 (P = 0.023) and
  lower than that before treatment (P = 0.040). After 2 years of treatment, the score
  of the modified Young scale in group 1 was lower than that before treatment (P =
  0.012). At the second year after treatment, the urinary copper in group 2 was higher
  than that in group 1 (P = 0.014). Urinary copper was maintained at 200 microg/day
  in group 1 and 300 microg/day in group 2 after 3 years of treatment. At the first
  year of treatment, serum copper in group 1 was lower than that in group 2 (P = 0.032).
  At the first year of treatment, CP values of the pallidum and substantia nigra in
  group 2 were higher than those in group 1 (P = 0.026, 0.040). At the second year
  of treatment, CP value of substantia nigra in group 2 was higher than that in group
  1 (P = 0.037). After 3 years of treatment, there was no difference in CP values
  between WD patients and normal controls. CONCLUSIONS: Therapy with DMPS and DMSA
  improves neurological symptoms of WD patients more quickly and leads to less aggravation,
  compared with therapy with DPA. The metal content in the brain of WD patients was
  at a low level after 3 years of treatment. DMPS and DMSA can remove metal from brain
  tissue faster than DPA.'
