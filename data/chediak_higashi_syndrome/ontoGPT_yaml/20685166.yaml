input_text: "Pre-transplant manipulation processing of umbilical cord blood units:
  Efficacy of Rubinstein's thawing technique used in 40 transplantation procedures.
  BACKGROUND: Umbilical cord blood (UCB) is a valid alternative to be used in transplanted
  patients. Limitations of the use of stem cells depends on the small number of cells
  available; this is the reason why UCB can be used only in very low-weight patients.
  In this study we have evaluated the efficacy of cellular manipulation before transplant
  and in particular, before thawing the units through the Rubinstein method. METHODS:
  We have evaluated the results obtained after thawing 40 UCB to be used for as many
  patients affected by several pathologies (21 ALL, 6 AML, 3 MDS, 2 LNH, 2 histiocytosis,
  2 beta-thalassemia, 1 Chediak-Higashi syndrome, 1 Fanconi anemia, 1 Wiskott-Aldrich
  syndrome and 1 Omenn syndrome). RESULTS: After thawing, nucleated cells (NC) mean
  recovery was 76.81% (SD+-15.41). The quantity of NC obtained was 124.29x107 (SD+-43.18)
  and in only 5 cases the number of NC after the procedure was lower than the requested
  graft dose. Among the last ones, in two cases only we did not achieve the target
  after manipulation. The post-manipulation cellular viability was 83.48% (SD+-10.6).
  For all the units shipment complied with all the necessary procedures; in fact the
  temperature never rose above -120 C. CONCLUSION: In our study we highlighted the
  efficacy of UCB thawing technique, with the same method defined in 1995 at the New
  York Blood Centre that guarantees an excellent NC recovery and maintains a high
  level of cell viability."
