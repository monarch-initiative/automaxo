input_text: 'Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for Chediak-Higashi
  syndrome. The clinical outcome of allogeneic HSCT was retrospectively analyzed in
  eight patients with CHS. In total, six of these eight patients are alive. Four of
  five patients transplanted with MAC achieved prompt engraftment, and three of the
  four patients, including two patients with AP before transplant, are alive without
  disease. In contrast, three patients transplanted with RIC without active AP disease
  achieved prompt engraftment and survive long term. RIC-HSCT might be an alternative
  treatment for CHS similar to other types of HLH, at least for patients without active
  AP disease. '
