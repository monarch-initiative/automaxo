input_text: Fludarabine and once-daily intravenous busulfan for allogeneic bone marrow
  transplantation for Chediak-Higashi syndrome. An HLA-identical sibling bone marrow
  transplant was done for a patient with Chediak-Higashi syndrome. The preparative
  regimen included intravenous fludarabine (40 mg/m2/dx4) and busulfan (130 mg/m2/dx4).
  Busulfan was given once daily. Pharmacokinetic studies showed the area under the
  concentration-time curve of the once-daily intravenous busulfan was similar to that
  seen with the total daily dose administered with an every-6-hourly regimen. Toxicity
  was minimal. Myeloid engraftment occurred on day +17 and donor chimerism was complete.
  Fludarabine and once-daily intravenous busulfan is well tolerated and is adequate
  for engraftment of sibling transplant in Chediak-Higashi syndrome.
