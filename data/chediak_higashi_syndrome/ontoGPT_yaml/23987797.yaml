input_text: 'Cognitive and psychosocial function post hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
  in children with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. OBJECTIVES: This study investigated
  the cognitive and psychosocial outcomes in childhood survivors of hemophagocytic
  lymphohistiocytosis after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. METHODS: Twenty-one
  children were assessed on standardized measures of cognitive and psychosocial functioning
  and compared with an unaffected sibling control group (n = 14). Parent and teacher
  reports were obtained to provide additional information. RESULTS: The average full-scale
  intelligence quotient for the patient cohort was 81 (95% CI, 72-90), which was significantly
  lower than both the population average of 100 (P = .001) and the average for the
  unaffected sibling control group (99.2, P = .002). Fifty-six percent of school-aged
  children were receiving additional support at school, with the majority needing
  high levels of support. These children also experienced significant psychosocial
  difficulties. Lower socioeconomic status was associated with poorer cognitive outcomes,
  but age at transplantation, time to transplantation, type of conditioning, and presence
  of mixed chimerism were not. Ten (48%) of 21 children had evidence of neurologic
  involvement at diagnosis, but surprisingly, this was not significantly associated
  with adverse neurologic outcomes, and some children who did not have any apparent
  neurologic involvement at diagnosis had severe learning difficulties at follow-up.
  CONCLUSIONS: In summary, childhood survivors of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis
  are at risk of long-term cognitive and psychosocial difficulties. Prospective and
  systematic long-term follow-up of these patients is essential for early identification
  and effective management of these problems.'
