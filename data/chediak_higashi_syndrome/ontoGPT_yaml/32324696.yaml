input_text: Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis in Patients With Primary Immunodeficiency.
  Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is characterized by uncontrolled and excessive
  immune responses with high mortality. We aimed to define mortality-related parameters
  in HLH secondary to primary immunodeficiency (PID). A total of 28 patients with
  HLH between the years 2013 and 2017 were enrolled in the study. The patients were
  evaluated in 2 groups including PID with hypopigmentation (n=7) (Chediak-Higashi
  syndrome [CHS] and Griscelli syndrome type 2 [GS2]) and other PIDs (n=21). The median
  age of the study population was 23 (4.3 to 117.0) months at the time of the diagnosis
  of HLH. Central nervous system involvement was recorded in 7 (GS2/CHS patients [n=4],
  other PIDs [n=3], P=0.026), and death was observed in 9 patients (GS2/CHS patients
  [n=1], other PIDs [n=8], P=0.371). Five patients (3 GS2/CHS and 2 other PID patients)
  underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Low serum albumin level was the
  only variable associated with the mortality and albumin levels less than the cut-off
  value of 3.07 g/dL increased mortality 5.8 times in patients with HLH secondary
  to PID. We presented a single-center experience consisting of patients with HLH
  secondary to PID with a mortality rate of 32.1%. Hypoalbuminemia was the only risk
  factor to increase the overall mortality rate of HLH.
