input_text: Split chimerism after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in Chediak-Higashi
  syndrome. Chediak-Higashi Syndrome (CHS) is a hereditary multiorgan disease associated
  with a lymphoproliferative disorder termed 'accelerated phase' (AP). As AP is often
  life-threatening, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been proposed as the
  only curative treatment for CHS. Here, we report a 1-year-old Japanese boy with
  CHS who received an HLA-matched unrelated BMT at the AP stage, which resulted in
  split chimerism. We evaluated the chimerism status of isolated leukocytes and found
  that only a limited population of T and NK cells was of donor origin and the majority
  of these and other hematopoietic cells was of host origin. Clinical outcome was
  successful, and the patient is currently alive and well, free of AP and serious
  infections more than 18 months after BMT.
