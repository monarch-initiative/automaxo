input_text: 'Towards the targeted management of Chediak-Higashi syndrome. Chediak-Higashi
  syndrome (CHS) is a rare, autosomal recessive congenital immunodeficiency caused
  by mutations in CHS1, a gene encoding a putative lysosomal trafficking protein.
  In the majority of patients, this disorder is typically characterized by infantile-onset
  hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), which is lethal unless allogeneic transplantation
  is performed. A small number of individuals have the attenuated form of the disease
  and do not benefit from transplant. Improved outcomes of transplantation have been
  reported when performed before the development of HLH, thus it is important to quickly
  differentiate patients that present with the childhood form of disease and to prematurely
  enroll them into a transplantation protocol. In addition, this would also preclude
  those that exhibit clinical phenotypes of adolescent and adult CHS from this treatment.
  Patients with an absence of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) function have a high risk
  for developing HLH, and could therefore benefit the most from early hematopoietic
  stem cell transplantation (HSCT). However, although normal CTL cytotoxicity or bi-allelic
  missense mutations do not exclude the occurrence of HLH in childhood, a more conservative
  approach is justified. This article summarizes recent advances in the clinical characterization
  of CHS patients, provides updates on promising new testing methods, and focuses
  on specific therapeutic approaches. '
