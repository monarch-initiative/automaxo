input_text: Effect of a thiol proteinase inhibitor, E-64-d, on susceptibility to infection
  with Staphylococcus aureus in Chediak-Higashi syndrome (beige) mice. We previously
  reported that abnormally down-regulated protein kinase C (PKC) activity is responsible
  for the impaired cellular function of natural killer cells and polymorphonuclear
  cells (PMNs), and the giant granule formation in fibroblasts in the beige mouse,
  an animal model of Chediak-Higashi syndrome. Here, we examine the effect of oral
  or intraperitoneal administration of E-64-d, which protects PKC from calpain-mediated
  proteolysis, on the impaired cellular function in PMNs from beige mice. We found
  that oral administration of E-64-d (12.5 mg/kg body weight per day) for three consecutive
  days, significantly improved the abnormally increased concanavalin A (Con A) cap
  formation and the decreased lysosomal enzyme activity in beige PMNs. In addition,
  E-64-d significantly improved the delayed bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus
  aureus. In contrast, E-64-d at the same dose did not affect these cellular functions
  in PMNs from C57BL/6J mice. We confirmed that the abnormal down-regulation of PKC
  after Con A stimulation was eliminated in PMNs from E-64-d-treated beige PMNs. We
  then examined whether the administration of E-64-d to beige mice improved the susceptibility
  to experimental infection with S. aureus (2x10(8)/mouse). Both intraperitoneal and
  oral administration of E-64-d to beige mice resulted in a significant increase in
  survival, whereas E-64-d at the same dose did not alter the survival rate in normal
  mice. These results suggest that the administration of E-64-d may be effective against
  severe bacterial infection in Chediak-Higashi syndrome.
