input_text: 'Clinical characteristics and outcomes of chediak-Higashi syndrome: a
  nationwide survey of Japan. BACKGROUND: Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare
  autosomal recessive disorder characterized by immunodeficiency, neurological dysfunction,
  and oculocutaneous albinism. Recently, several clinical CHS phenotypes have been
  reported. Here, we report results of a nationwide survey performed to clarify clinical
  characteristics and outcomes of CHS patients in Japan. METHODS: Questionnaires were
  sent to 287 institutions to collect data regarding CHS patients diagnosed between
  2000 and 2010, including results of lysosomal trafficking regulator (LYST) gene
  analysis. Cytotoxicity and degranulation activity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes were
  analyzed in available patient samples. RESULTS: A total of 15 patients diagnosed
  with CHS were eligible for enrollment in this study. Of these, 10 (67%) had recurrent
  bacterial infections, five (33%) developed life-threatening hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis
  (HLH), and one patient had complicated malignant lymphoma. Hematopoietic stem cell
  transplantation (HSCT) was performed for six patients including three with HLH,
  and 10 of the enrolled patients have survived at the time of this writing. LYST
  analysis was performed for 10 patients; seven different mutations were detected
  in seven patients, whereas no mutation was identified in three patients. Cytotoxicity
  and degranulation activity were impaired in patients with and without LYST mutation.
  DISCUSSION: Results of this survey indicate that one or two patients with CHS were
  newly diagnosed each year in Japan. The incidence of HLH was not as high as expected.
  Mutations of genes other than LYST were suspected in some cases. We conclude that
  determining indication for HSCT for CHS patients should be based on genetic and
  cytotoxic analysis.'
