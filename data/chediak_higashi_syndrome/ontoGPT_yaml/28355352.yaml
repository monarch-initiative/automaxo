input_text: A novel frameshift mutation of Chediak-Higashi syndrome and treatment
  in the accelerated phase. Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare autosomal recessive
  immunodeficiency disease characterized by frequent infections, hypopigmentation,
  progressive neurologic deterioration and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH),
  known as the accelerated phase. There is little experience in the accelerated phase
  of CHS treatment worldwide. Here, we present a case of a 9-month-old boy with continuous
  high fever, hypopigmentation of the skin, enlarged lymph nodes, hepatosplenomegaly
  and lung infection. He was diagnosed with CHS by gene sequencing, and had entered
  the accelerated phase. After 8 weeks of therapy, the boy had remission and was prepared
  for allogenic stem cell transplantation.
