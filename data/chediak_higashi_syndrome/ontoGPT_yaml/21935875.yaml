input_text: Chediak-Higashi syndrome - a report of two cases with unusual hyperpigmentation
  of the face. Chediak-Higashi syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder due
  to a qualitative defect in leucocyte function characterized clinically by partial
  oculocutaneous albinism, recurrent bacterial infections, photophobia etc. The diagnostic
  feature is the presence of abnormal giant intracytoplasmic granules in neutrophils
  and their precursors. Here we report this syndrome in two siblings who presented
  with an unusual hyperpigmentation of the face and extremities.
