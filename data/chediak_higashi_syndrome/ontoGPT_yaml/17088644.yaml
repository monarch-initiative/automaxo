input_text: 'Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and related disorders. PURPOSE OF
  REVIEW: The rate of diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, a genetically
  heterogeneous and, frequently, rapidly fatal autosomal recessive disorder of immune
  regulation, is increasing worldwide. Awareness has grown through the Histiocyte
  Society and the publication of newly-recognized genetic causes. I summarize current
  knowledge regarding the pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of hemophagocytic
  lymphohistiocytosis. RECENT FINDINGS: Genetic defects leading to life-threatening
  hemophagocytic syndromes have recently been described. Two autosomal recessive gene
  defects underlie 40-50% of primary (familial) cases worldwide: perforin, the major
  immune cytotoxic protein, and MUNC 13-4, a protein involved in exocytosis of perforin-bearing
  cytotoxic granules during apoptosis. Related autosomal recessive defects of secretory
  cytotoxic lysosomes - LYST 1 (Chediak-Higashi syndrome), Rab27A (Griscelli syndrome),
  and X-linked lymphoproliferative disorder - also carry a very high risk of fatal
  hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Concurrently, treatment protocols involving
  multiagent immunomodulatory therapy followed by allogeneic hematopoeitic cell transplantation
  have been tested. With immunomodulatory treatment, 75% of children with hemophagocytic
  lymphohistiocytosis are symptomatically improved after 2 months of therapy. Disease-free
  survival after allogeneic hematopoeitic cell transplantation currently ranges from
  50 to 70%. SUMMARY: Bench and clinical research have advanced understanding of the
  pathophysiology of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and related disorders, and
  significantly improved clinical outcomes during the past decade.'
