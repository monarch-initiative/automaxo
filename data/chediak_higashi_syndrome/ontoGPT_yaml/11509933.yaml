input_text: Failure of sustained engraftment after non-myeloablative conditioning
  with low-dose TBI and T cell-reduced allogeneic peripheral stem cell transplantation.
  We investigated whether a T cell-reduced allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) with
  minimal conditioning and subsequent donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) could reduce
  the incidence and severity of GVHD while retaining stable engraftment. Five patients
  with hematological malignancies (three MM, one CLL, one Chediak-Higashi syndrome)
  were conditioned with TBI (200 cGy). One patient additionally received fludarabine
  (120 mg/m(2)). CsA and mofetyl-mycophenolate (MMF) were administered to prevent
  GVHD. All patients were grafted with >3 x 10(6)/kg highly purified CD34(+) cells
  together with 2 x 10(6)/kg CD3(+) cells (three patients) or 1 x 10(5)/kg CD3(+)
  cells (two patients). Quick hematopoietic recovery and initial mixed donor chimerism
  was observed. Treatment-related toxicity was minimal in all but one patient who
  died of treatment-refractory GVHD on day 112. The four other patients only achieved
  partial donor T cell chimerism. BM and PBMC donor chimerism was lost between day
  40 and 209 despite DLI. Three patients are alive with disease and one is in CR.
  We conclude that T cell-reduced SCT using 200 cGy as the conditioning regimen does
  not result in stable hematopoietic engraftment. Predominant donor T cell chimerism
  is not a prerequisite for initial allogeneic hematopoietic proliferation. However
  for sustained long-term engraftment it is of major importance.
