input_text: 'NK cell effector functions in a Chediak-Higashi patient undergoing cord
  blood transplantation: Effects of in vitro treatment with IL-2. NK cell cytotoxicity
  in Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is strongly impaired as lytic granules are not
  released upon NK-target cell contact, contributing to several defects typical of
  this severe immunodeficiency. Correction of NK cell defects in CHS should improve
  the outcome of hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, proposed as therapy. We
  investigated NK cell functions in a CHS patient before and after cord-blood transplantation,
  and the ability of in vitro IL-2 treatment to restore them. Before the transplant,
  the strong defect in NK cell-mediated natural and antibody-dependent cytotoxicity,
  as well as in IFN-gamma production, could be restored up to normal levels by in
  vitro IL-2 treatment. This cytokine also caused the appearance of smaller lysosomal
  granules and their orientation towards the NK-target cell contact area, thus suggesting
  that IL-2 had a more general capacity to restore NK cell effector functions. Moreover
  after the transplant, although the successful engraftment, NK cell cytotoxicity
  resulted still partially impaired at one year, almost normal at ten years and, anyhow,
  fully recovered by in vitro IL-2 treatment. Taken together, our results indicate
  that IL-2 had a wide capacity to restore NK cell effector functions, being able
  to reverse the altered cytotoxic activity, lytic granule pattern, and cytokine production
  observed in the CHS patient.'
