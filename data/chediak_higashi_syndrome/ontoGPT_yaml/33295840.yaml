input_text: 'Chediak-Higashi syndrome: neurocognitive and behavioral data from infancy
  to adulthood after bone marrow transplantation. Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is
  a rare autosomal disorder characterized by immunodeficiency, albinism, and progressive
  neurologic abnormalities. While survivors of the childhood-onset disease are known
  to exhibit learning disabilities and neuropsychiatric disorders followed by middle-age
  dementia, we lack detailed data on the progression. We present the case of a young
  adult with records from infancy to the first signs of deterioration. An early neuropsychological
  and neuropsychiatric profiling is crucial to intervention selection as children
  with CHS may not benefit from regular special education. Our patient never showed
  neuropsychiatric symptoms but high levels of socioemotional adaptability.'
