input_text: Hematopoietic cell transplantation for Chediak-Higashi syndrome. We reviewed
  outcomes after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in 35 children
  with Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS). Twenty-two patients had a history of the life-threatening
  accelerated phase of CHS before HCT and 11 were in accelerated phase at transplantation.
  Thirteen patients received their allograft from an human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched
  sibling, 10 from an alternative related donor and 12 from an unrelated donor. Eleven
  recipients of HLA-matched sibling donor, three recipients of alternative related
  donor and eight recipients of unrelated donor HCT are alive. With a median follow-up
  of 6.5 years, the 5-year probability of overall survival is 62%. Mortality was highest
  in those with accelerated phase disease at transplantation and after alternative
  related donor HCT. Only four of 11 patients with active disease at transplantation
  are alive. Seven recipients of alternative related donor HCT had active disease
  at transplantation and this may have influenced the poor outcome in this group.
  Although numbers are limited, HCT appears to be effective therapy for correcting
  and preventing hematologic and immunologic complications of CHS, and an unrelated
  donor may be a suitable alternative for patients without an HLA-matched sibling.
  Early referral and transplantation in remission after accelerated phase disease
  may improve disease-free survival.
