input_text: A case of Chediak-Higashi syndrome presented with accelerated phase could
  be treated effectively by unrelated cord blood transplantation. CHS is a rare immunodeficiency
  syndrome with defects in the functions of cytotoxic cells and neutrophils. Approximately
  85% of patients with CHS undergo an AP within the first decade, which is similar
  to FHLH. Chemotherapy could induce transient remission, but only allogeneic HCT
  could correct the underlying genetic defect and prevent relapse. We reported a case
  of CHS diagnosed at 19 months, who had an elder brother who had previously succumbed
  to the same disease. The little girl presented with severe AP manifestations including
  recurrent high fever, enlarged superficial lymph nodes, and extraordinary hepatosplenomegaly
  occupying the whole abdominal and pelvic cavity. Comprehensive therapies including
  HLH 2004 protocol, supportive care, and antibiotics, especially antituberculous
  agents, were given to her to induce remission. After remission, the patient received
  fully HLA-matched UCBT. The transplantation course was uneventful, except for fluctuation
  of donor chimerism. The patient has been alive for 36 months without infection and
  neurologic manifestations and is under further follow-up. Our result provides another
  case that UCBT can be effective for treating patients with CHS and remission before
  HCT is important for good prognosis.
