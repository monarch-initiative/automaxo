input_text: Chediak-Higashi syndrome. A case of Chediak-Higashi syndrome is reported
  in a four-year-old boy who presented with recurrent chest infection, partial albinism,
  hyperpigmentation of the extremities and presence of giant granules in leucocytes
  and melanocytes in the skin. Parental consanguinity was present. Though uncommon,
  hyperpigmentation of sun exposed areas may be the initial symptom in Chediak-Higashi
  syndrome.
