input_text: Rapid ultrastructural detection of success or failure after bone marrow
  transplantation in the Chediak-Higashi syndrome. The present study has used electron
  microscopic techniques to rapidly detect the success or failure of bone marrow transplantation
  in three patients with the Chediak-Higashi Syndrome (CHS). The most rapid procedure
  was the whole mount technique to determine the presence or absence of dense bodies,
  which are inherently electron-opaque, serotonin-containing storage organelles in
  platelets. Dense bodies were present in normal numbers in platelets from two patients
  with successful transplantation and absent in thrombocytes from another patient
  in whom the transplant had failed.

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
  object: <A sign or symptom associated with the disease and targeted by the medical action. For example, Low serum calcitriol, hypoplasia of the thymus, chronic cough, aortic stiffness, low pulse pressure>
  qualifier: <The primary disease the relationship is about, or specifically the disease the symptom is related to. For example, Beck-Fahrner syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, progeria, diabetes mellitus, infectious otitis media>
  subject_qualifier: <An optional qualifier or modifier for the subject of the statement, e.g. "high dose" or "intravenously administered">
  object_qualifier: <An optional qualifier or modifier for the object of the statement, e.g. "severe" or "with additional complications">
