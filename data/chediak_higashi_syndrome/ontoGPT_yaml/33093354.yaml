input_text: 'Haploidentical Stem Cell Transplant With Post-transplant Cyclophosphamide
  for Chediak-Higashi Syndrome: A Very Rare Case Report. Chediak-Higashi syndrome
  is a rare immunodeficiency disorder for which hematopoietic stem cell transplant
  (HSCT) is the only curative treatment option. HSCT only corrects the hematologic
  and immunologic manifestations of the disease but neurologic complications may still
  progress after transplant. Haploidentical HSCT (haplo-HSCT) has evolved as a feasible
  alternative for patients with primary immunodeficiency. More recently, there has
  been use of haplo-HSCT with post-transplant cyclophosphamide. However, only 4 cases
  of Chediak-Higashi syndrome have been reported using this approach. Here, the authors
  describe a case of a 17-month-old boy who was successfully treated by haplo-HSCT
  with reduced-toxicity conditioning (fludarabine/treosulfan/melphalan) and post-transplant
  cyclophosphamide.'
