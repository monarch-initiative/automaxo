input_text: "Chediak-Higashi syndrome: novel mutation of the CHS1/LYST gene in 3 Omani
  patients. BACKGROUND: Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare, autosomal, recessive
  lysosomal disorder with hematological and immunologic abnormalities; however, stem-cell
  transplantation from a matched or related donor may be curative. Many mutations
  of the CHS1/LYST gene have been reported to date. We report a novel nonsense mutation
  of the CHS1/LYST gene in 3 Omani patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three patients from
  2 different families presented with clinical and laboratory features of CHS and
  a history of death of a previous sibling because of a severe illness, suggestive
  of the accelerated phase of CHS. Giant granules were present in the myeloid cell
  lines. Before the stem-cell transplant, the first patient underwent gene sequencing
  of all exons of the lysosome trafficking regulator (CHS1/LYST) gene and revealed
  a nonsense mutation in exon 5 (c.925C>T, p.R309X). Subsequently, upon presentation,
  the second and third patients' direct gene sequencing of exon 5 revealed the same
  mutation. CONCLUSIONS: We report a nonsense mutation in exon 5 (c.925C>T, p.R309X).
  This supports the allelic heterogeneity of CHS and is in line with most reported
  mutation types that lead to a truncated protein. Identification of the mutation
  type will facilitate timely diagnosis, management, and family counseling for those
  with affected children in Oman."
