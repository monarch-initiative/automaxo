input_text: Unrelated cord blood transplantation can restore hematologic and immunologic
  functions in patients with Chediak-Higashi syndrome. CHS is a rare hereditary fatal
  disease, if not treated. APs occur in 85% of patients and are usually the main cause
  of mortality, and HSCT from HLA-matched related and unrelated donors is the only
  effective treatment for CHS and prevents recurrences of APs. We reviewed the records
  of three patients with CHS who underwent UCBT at KHCC. Records were examined for
  clinical features at the time of UCBT, conditioning regimens, morbidities, and outcomes.
  Conditioning comprised BU, cyclophosphamide, horse ATG, and etoposide. All patients
  tolerated the conditioning well. Two patients are alive, one with mixed and the
  other with full donor chimerism; hematologic and immunologic defects of CHS have
  been corrected in both patients. They show no evidence of recurrences of APs and
  have normal growth and development. In patients with CHS who lack HLA-matched related
  and unrelated donors, UCBT is a suitable alternative source of stem cells to restore
  immunologic and hematologic functions and prevent AP relapses, even in mixed chimeric
  states. Long follow-up and close monitoring are essential to evaluate the long-term
  benefits of using UCBT in patients with CHS.
