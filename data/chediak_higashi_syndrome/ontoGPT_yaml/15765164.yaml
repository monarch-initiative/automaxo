input_text: 'Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in Taiwanese children with primary
  immunodeficiency. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Since 1968 it has been known that hematopoietic
  stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can ameliorate primary immunodeficiencies, but
  data on the long-term efficacy of this treatment in Taiwan are limited. This study
  analyzed the outcome of HSCT and the immune reconstruction in 10 children with primary
  immunodeficiencies in Taiwan. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the outcome of
  HSCT in 10 children with primary immunodeficiencies between 1986 and 2002. The primary
  immunodeficiencies in these children included severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)
  in 4, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) in 4, Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) in 1,
  and leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) in 1. The conditioning protocols included
  busulfan and cyclophosphamide in 2 patients with SCID, 3 patients with WAS, 1 patient
  with LAD and 1 patient with CHS. Anti-thymocyte globulin was given to only 1 patient
  with WAS and no conditioning therapy was given in 2 SCID patients. Graft-versus-host
  disease (GVHD) prophylaxis with cyclosporine (CsA) and methotrexate was prescribed
  in 6 children, CsA alone in 1, and CsA and T-cell depletion in 1. RESULTS: Six patients
  were cured and 1 improved during a follow-up period from 3.5 years to 13 years after
  transplantation. Three patients died of severe sepsis. Three patients developed
  acute GVHD, which was grade 2 in 2 patients, and grade 3 in 1. Veno-occlusive disease
  developed in 1 patient and chronic GVHD with contracture of joints in 1. CONCLUSIONS:
  Our results support the benefits of allo-HSCT in children with primary immunodeficiencies.
  However, HSCT should be performed as soon as possible before severe infection develops.'
