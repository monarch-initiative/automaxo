input_text: Hyperpigmentation in Chediak-Higashi syndrome. We describe a 4 1/2 -year-old
  Saudi Arabian boy born to consanguineous parents who was initially seen with gradual
  onset of fever and abdominal distention. The patient was found to have speckled
  hypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation of the sun-exposed areas. The finding of
  large cytoplasmic granules in blood and bone marrow leukocytes established the diagnosis
  of Chediak-Higashi syndrome. We review the literature on this finding, which might
  be underreported, especially in darkly pigmented races.
