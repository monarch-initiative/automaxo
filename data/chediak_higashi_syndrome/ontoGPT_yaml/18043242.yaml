input_text: 'Chediak-Higashi syndrome. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Chediak-Higashi syndrome,
  a rare autosomal recessive disorder, was described over 50 years ago. Patients show
  hypopigmentation, recurrent infections, mild coagulation defects and varying neurologic
  problems. Treatment is bone marrow transplant, which is effective in treating the
  hematologic and immune defects, however the neurologic problems persist. The CHS1/LYST
  gene was identified over 10 years ago and homologous CHS1/LYST genes are present
  in all eukaryotes. This review will discuss the advances made in understanding the
  clinical aspects of the syndrome and the function of CHS1/LYST/Beige. RECENT FINDINGS:
  Clinical reports of Chediak-Higashi syndrome have identified mutations throughout
  the CHS1/LYST gene. The nature of the mutation can be a predictor of the severity
  of the disease. Over the past decade the CHS1/LYST family of proteins has been analyzed
  using model organisms, two-hybrid analysis, overexpression phenotypes and dominant
  negatives. These studies suggest that the CHS1/LYST protein is involved in either
  vesicle fusion or fission. SUMMARY: Although CHS is a rare disease, the Chediak-like
  family of proteins is providing insight into the regulation of vesicle trafficking.
  Understanding the basic mechanisms that govern vesicle trafficking will provide
  essential information regarding how loss of CHS1/LYST affects hematologic, immunologic
  and neurologic processes.'
