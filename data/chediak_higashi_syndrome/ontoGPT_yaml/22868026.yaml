input_text: Chediak-Higashi syndrome presenting in accelerated phase. Chediak-Higashi
  Syndrome (CHS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder, characterized by silver hair,
  recurrent infections, partial oculo-cutaneous albinism, mild coagulation defect
  and progressive neuropathy. The characteristic feature of CHS is the presence of
  huge lysosomes and cytoplasmic inclusions within different body cells like the white
  blood cells. The disease has an early onset but usually presents in an accelerated
  phase. We present a case of a 2 years old boy with high grade fever, bilateral cervical
  lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, abdominal distention of 28 days duration. He
  was diagnosed with Chediak-Higashi syndrome in accelerated phase on the basis of
  clinical presentation, morphological findings on peripheral blood film and bone
  marrow aspirate.
