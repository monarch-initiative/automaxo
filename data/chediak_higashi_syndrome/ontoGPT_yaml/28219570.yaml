input_text: Living-Donor Lung Transplantation After Bone Marrow Transplantation for
  Chediak-Higashi Syndrome. An 8-year-old girl with Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS)
  had pulmonary complications after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)
  for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and eventually underwent single living-donor
  lobar lung transplantation (LDLLT). Electron micrographic findings showed vagus
  nerve tissue in extracted lung having granular inclusions, which are pathognomonic
  for CHS. Because her mother was the donor for both hematopoietic stem cell and lung
  transplantations, she was weaned from immunosuppression and is doing well 3 years
  after lung transplantation. Furthermore, an induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell
  line was established from her skin fibroblasts for investigation and potential future
  treatment for CHS.
