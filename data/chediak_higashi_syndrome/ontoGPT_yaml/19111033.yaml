input_text: Stem cell transplantation; Iranian experience. From March 1991 through
  31st December 2007, 2042 patients underwent stem cell transplantation at the Hematology-Oncology
  and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, affiliated to Tehran University of
  Medical Sciences. These transplantations included 1405 allogeneic stem cell transplantation,
  624 autologous stem cell transplantation, and 13 syngeneic stem cell transplantation.
  Stem cell transplantation was performed for various diseases including acute myelogenous
  leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, chronic lymphoblastic
  leukemia, thalassemia major, sickle cell thalassemia, sickle cell disease, multiple
  myeloma, myelodysplasia, mucopolysaccharidosis, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria,
  non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, severe aplastic anemia, plasma cell leukemia,
  Niemann-Pick disease, Fanconi anemia, severe combine immunodeficiency, congenital
  neutropenia, leukocyte adhesion deficiencies, Chediak-Higashi syndrome, osteopetrosis,
  histiocytosis X, Hurler syndrome, amyloidosis, systemic sclerosis, breast cancer,
  Ewing's sarcoma, testicular cancer, germ cell tumors, neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma,
  renal cell carcinoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, ovarian cancer, Wilms' tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma,
  pancreatoblastoma, and multiple sclerosis. We had 105 cellular therapies for postmyocardial
  infarction, multiple sclerosis, cirrhosis, head of femur necrosis, and renal cell
  carcinoma. About 30 patients were retransplanted in this center. About 74.9% of
  the patients (1530 of 2042) remained alive between one to 168 months after stem
  cell transplantation. Nearly 25.1% (512 of 2042) of our patients died after stem
  cell transplantation. The causes of deaths were relapse, infections, hemorrhagic
  cystitis, graft versus host disease, and others.
