input_text: 'Unrelated donor marrow transplantation for congenital immunodeficiency
  and metabolic disease: an update of the experience of the Japan Marrow Donor Program.
  We retrospectively analyzed the clinical results of 81 patients with congenital
  genetic diseases who were treated with bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from unrelated
  donors identified through the Japan Marrow Donor Program. The patients were aged
  between 1 and 38 years (median, 4 years). Thirty-five patients underwent transplantation
  for metabolic disease (MD), ie, mucopolysaccharidosis (n = 25), adrenoleukodystrophy
  (n = 7), and others (n = 3). The remaining 46 patients had Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome
  (n = 16), hemophagocytic syndrome including the inherited type (n = 9), severe combined
  immunodeficiency (n = 6), hyper-IgM syndrome (n = 4), Chediak-Higashi syndrome (n
  = 3), Kostmann syndrome (n = 3), and others (n = 5). Fifty-two donor-patient pairs
  were fully matched at HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DRB1 alleles. The remaining 24 patients
  received allele-mismatched grafts (20 matched at 5 of 6 loci and 4 matched at 4
  of 6 loci). Engraftment occurred in 82.4% of the MD group and 90.7% of the other
  genetic disease (OGD) group; however, 14 patients (18.2%) experienced either early
  or late graft failure. The cumulative incidence of grade II to IV acute graft-versus-host
  disease (GVHD) was 35.5% - 9.8% in the MD group and 47.3% - 9.5% in the OGD group,
  and the rate of chronic GVHD was 20% in both groups. Forty-nine patients have survived
  for 3 to 96 months (median, 20 months). The probabilities of 5-year overall survival
  and event-free survival were 72.6% - 11.5% and 65.3% - 8.6%, respectively, for MD
  (n = 35) and 72.5% - 7.3% and 63.6% - 7.3% for OGD (n = 46). Although patient status
  before BMT and the occurrence of grade III to IV acute GVHD significantly affected
  outcome, unrelated BMT is a curative therapeutic option for children with congenital
  genetic diseases who have no HLA-matched family donors.'
