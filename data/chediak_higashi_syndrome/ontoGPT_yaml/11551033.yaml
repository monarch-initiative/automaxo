input_text: 'Chediak-Higashi syndrome: hematopoietic chimerism corrects genetic defect.
  Chediak-Higashi syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder, primarily affecting
  neutrophils, and is often lethal by the third decade of life. Bone marrow transplantation
  is the only curative therapy currently available. This case describes a child undergoing
  a bone marrow transplant from a matched sibling donor, resulting in hematopoietic
  chimerism with only a small percentage of donor neutrophils found long term. The
  presence of a small percentage of donor neutrophils has resulted in normal development
  and no increased incidence of infections. Hematopoietic chimerism offers a cure
  with a potential reduction in the side-effects that result from marrow transplantation
  and the associated preparative therapies.'
