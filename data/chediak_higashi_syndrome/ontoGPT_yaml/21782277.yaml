input_text: Distribution, clinical features and treatment in Taiwanese patients with
  symptomatic primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs) in a nationwide population-based
  study during 1985-2010. Primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs) are a group of
  rare diseases with wide geographic and ethnic variations in incidence, prevalence,
  and distribution patterns. The aim of this study was to examine the distribution
  pattern and clinical spectrum of PIDs in Taiwan at a national referral institute.
  From 1985 to 2010, 215 patients from 183 families were diagnosed and grouped according
  to the updated classification of PIDs. Eighty-one (37.7%) patients had "other well-defined
  immunodeficiency syndromes", followed by "predominantly antibody deficiencies" (54
  patients; 25.1%), "T- and B-cell immunodeficiencies" (34; 15.8%), "congenital defects
  of phagocytes" (25; 20.2%), "complement deficiencies" (15; 7.0%), and "disease in
  immune dysregulation" (5; 2.3%). The last category included two patients with Chediak-Higashi
  syndrome, and one each with familial hemophagocytosis, IPEX, and hypogammaglobulinemia
  and albinism. One female had cold-induced auto-inflammatory disease. There were
  no cases of "defects in innate immunity". Pseudomonas and Streptococcus pneumoniae
  were the two most identified microorganisms in septicemia (42.7%; 44/103 episodes).
  Stem cell transplantation was successful in 13 of 22 patients, while 34 patients
  (15.8%) died. Molecular defects were identified in 109 individuals (from 90 families).
  There were relatively fewer cases of "predominantly antibody deficiencies" due to
  there being only a few patients with adult-onset PIDs, implying certainty bias rather
  than ethnic variation. Awareness of under-diagnosis among physicians rather than
  pediatricians is vital for timely diagnosis and consequently adequate treatment.
