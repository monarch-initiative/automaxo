input_text: 'Haploidentical Stem Cell Transplantation with Post-Transplant Cyclophosphamide
  for Primary Immune Deficiency Disorders in Children: Challenges and Outcome from
  a Tertiary Care Center in South India. Haploidentical stem cell transplantation
  (haplo SCT) has emerged as an acceptable alternative to matched family donor transplantation
  for children diagnosed to have primary immune deficiency disorders (PIDs). We present
  data over 4 years on the challenges and efficacy of unmanipulated T cell replete
  haplo SCTs with post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) in children diagnosed to
  have PIDs. We performed a retrospective study in the pediatric blood and marrow
  transplantation unit where all children less than 18 years of age diagnosed to have
  PIDs and who underwent haplo SCT with PTCy from January 2014 to February 2018 were
  included in the study. Of the 16 transplants included in the study, 5 children were
  diagnosed to have Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, 3 with congenital hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis,
  2 each with Griscelli syndrome and Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases,
  and one each with Chediak-Higashi syndrome, ORAI 1 mutation immune deficiency, severe
  combined immune deficiency, and Hyper IgM syndrome. The source of stem cells was
  PBSC in 62.5% and bone marrow in 32.5%. Engraftment by day 16-21 post hematopoietic
  stem cell transplantation was achieved in 75% transplants with 91% of these remaining
  in sustained complete chimerism. Acute skin and gut graft versus host disease of
  grade 2-3 were noted in 50% transplants and cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation in
  43.7% transplants. One child with congenital HLH succumbed to refractory CMV, adenovirus,
  and BK virus infection. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was noted in 75% transplants
  with 2 children succumbing to the illness. Tocilizumab was successfully used early
  in one child. Overall mortality was found to be 37.5% with overall survival of 62.5%
  with a median follow-up of 23.3 months. In resource limited settings, PTCy has the
  potential to provide a cost-effective advantage in terms of accessibility of this
  curative procedure among children with PIDs.'
