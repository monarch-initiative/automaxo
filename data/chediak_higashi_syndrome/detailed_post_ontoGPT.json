                    "abstract": "Inflammatory periodontal diseases are highly prevalent, although most of these diseases develop and progress slowly, often unnoticed by the affected individual. However, a subgroup of these diseases include aggressive and acute forms that have a relatively low prevalence but show a rapid-course, high rate of progression leading to severe destruction of the periodontal tissues, or cause systemic symptoms that often require urgent attention from healthcare providers. Aggressive periodontitis is an early-onset, destructive disease that shows a high rate of periodontal progression and distinctive clinical features. A contemporary case definition of this disease is presented. Population studies show that the disease is more prevalent in certain geographic regions and ethnic groups. Aggressive periodontitis is an infectious disease, and recent data show that in affected subjects the subgingival microbiota is composed of a mixed microbial infection, with a wide heterogeneity in the types and proportions of microorganisms recovered. Furthermore, there are significant differences in the microbiota of the disease among different geographic regions and ethnicities. There is also evidence that the Aggregatibacter actinomycetemycomitans-JP2 clone may play an important role in the development of the disease in certain populations. The host response plays an important role in the susceptibility to aggressive periodontitis, where the immune response may be complex and involve multiple mechanisms. Also, genetic factors seem to play an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease, but the mechanisms of increased susceptibility are complex and not yet fully understood. The available data suggest that aggressive periodontitis is caused by mutations either in a few major genes or in multiple small-effect genes, and there is also evidence of gene-gene and gene-environment interaction effects. Diagnostic methods for this disease, based on a specific microbiologic, immunologic or genetic profile, currently do not exist. Genetic markers have the potential to be implemented as screening tools to identify subjects at risk. This approach may significantly enhance treatment outcome through the early detection and treatment of affected subjects, as well as using future approaches based on gene therapy. At present, the treatment of this disease is directed toward elimination of the subgingival bacterial load and other local risk factors. Adjunctive use of appropriate systemic antibiotics is recommended and may contribute to a longer suppression of the microbial infection. Other aggressive forms of periodontal diseases occur in patients who are affected with certain systemic diseases, including the leukocyte adhesion deficiency syndrome, Papillon-Lefevre syndrome, Chediak-Higashi syndrome and Down syndrome. Management of the periodontal component of these diseases is very challenging. Acute gingival and periodontal lesions include a group of disorders that range from nondestructive to destructive forms, and these lesions are usually associated with pain and are a common reason for emergency dental consultations. Some of these lesions may cause a rapid and severe destruction of the periodontal tissues and loss of teeth. Oral infections, particularly acute infections, can spread to extra-oral sites and cause serious medical complications, and even death. Hence, prompt diagnosis and treatment are paramount. ",

Five patients with hematological malignancies (three MM, one CLL, one Chediak-Higashi syndrome) were conditioned with TBI (200 cGy). One patient additionally received fludarabine (120 mg/m(2)). CsA and mofetyl-mycophenolate (MMF) were administered to prevent GVHD. All patients were grafted with >3 x 10(6)/kg highly purified CD34(+) cells together with 2 x 10(6)/kg CD3(+) cells (three patients) or 1 x 10(5)/kg CD3(+) cells (two patients). Quick hematopoietic recovery and initial mixed donor chimerism was observed. Treatment-related toxicity was minimal in all but one patient who died of treatment-refractory GVHD on day 112. The four other patients only achieved partial donor T cell chimerism. BM and PBMC donor chimerism was lost between day 40 and 209 despite DLI. Three patients are alive with disease and one is in CR. We conclude that T cell-reduced SCT using 200 cGy as the conditioning regimen does not result in stable hematopoietic engraftment. Predominant donor T cell chimerism is not a prerequisite for initial allogeneic hematopoietic proliferation. However for sustained long-term engraftment it is of major importance.",

We present data over 4 years on the challenges and efficacy of unmanipulated T cell replete haplo SCTs with post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) in children diagnosed to have PIDs. We performed a retrospective study in the pediatric blood and marrow transplantation unit where all children less than 18 years of age diagnosed to have PIDs and who underwent haplo SCT with PTCy from January 2014 to February 2018 were included in the study. Of the 16 transplants included in the study, 5 children were diagnosed to have Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, 3 with congenital hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, 2 each with Griscelli syndrome and Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases, and one each with Chediak-Higashi syndrome, ORAI 1 mutation immune deficiency, severe combined immune deficiency, and Hyper IgM syndrome. The source of stem cells was PBSC in 62.5% and bone marrow in 32.5%. Engraftment by day 16-21 post hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was achieved in 75% transplants with 91% of these remaining in sustained complete chimerism. Acute skin and gut graft versus host disease of grade 2-3 were noted in 50% transplants and cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation in 43.7% transplants. One child with congenital HLH succumbed to refractory CMV, adenovirus, and BK virus infection. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was noted in 75% transplants with 2 children succumbing to the illness. Tocilizumab was successfully used early in one child. Overall mortality was found to be 37.5% with overall survival of 62.5% with a median follow-up of 23.3 months. In resource limited settings, PTCy has the potential to provide a cost-effective advantage in terms of accessibility of this curative procedure among children with PIDs.",

Approximately 85% of patients with CHS undergo an AP within the first decade, which is similar to FHLH. Chemotherapy could induce transient remission, but only allogeneic HCT could correct the underlying genetic defect and prevent relapse. We reported a case of CHS diagnosed at 19 months, who had an elder brother who had previously succumbed to the same disease. The little girl presented with severe AP manifestations including recurrent high fever, enlarged superficial lymph nodes, and extraordinary hepatosplenomegaly occupying the whole abdominal and pelvic cavity. Comprehensive therapies including HLH 2004 protocol, supportive care, and antibiotics, especially antituberculous agents, were given to her to induce remission. After remission, the patient received fully HLA-matched UCBT. The transplantation course was uneventful, except for fluctuation of donor chimerism. The patient has been alive for 36 months without infection and neurologic manifestations and is under further follow-up. Our result provides another case that UCBT can be effective for treating patients with CHS and remission before HCT is important for good prognosis.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The rate of diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, a genetically heterogeneous and, frequently, rapidly fatal autosomal recessive disorder of immune regulation, is increasing worldwide. Awareness has grown through the Histiocyte Society and the publication of newly-recognized genetic causes. I summarize current knowledge regarding the pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. RECENT FINDINGS: Genetic defects leading to life-threatening hemophagocytic syndromes have recently been described. Two autosomal recessive gene defects underlie 40-50% of primary (familial) cases worldwide: perforin, the major immune cytotoxic protein, and MUNC 13-4, a protein involved in exocytosis of perforin-bearing cytotoxic granules during apoptosis. Related autosomal recessive defects of secretory cytotoxic lysosomes - LYST 1 (Chediak-Higashi syndrome), Rab27A (Griscelli syndrome), and X-linked lymphoproliferative disorder - also carry a very high risk of fatal hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Concurrently, treatment protocols involving multiagent immunomodulatory therapy followed by allogeneic hematopoeitic cell transplantation have been tested. With immunomodulatory treatment, 75% of children with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis are symptomatically improved after 2 months of therapy. Disease-free survival after allogeneic hematopoeitic cell transplantation currently ranges from 50 to 70%. SUMMARY: Bench and clinical research have advanced understanding of the pathophysiology of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and related disorders, and significantly improved clinical outcomes during the past decade.",

Twenty-two patients had a history of the life-threatening accelerated phase of CHS before HCT and 11 were in accelerated phase at transplantation. Thirteen patients received their allograft from an human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling, 10 from an alternative related donor and 12 from an unrelated donor. Eleven recipients of HLA-matched sibling donor, three recipients of alternative related donor and eight recipients of unrelated donor HCT are alive. With a median follow-up of 6.5 years, the 5-year probability of overall survival is 62%. Mortality was highest in those with accelerated phase disease at transplantation and after alternative related donor HCT. Only four of 11 patients with active disease at transplantation are alive. Seven recipients of alternative related donor HCT had active disease at transplantation and this may have influenced the poor outcome in this group. Although numbers are limited, HCT appears to be effective therapy for correcting and preventing hematologic and immunologic complications of CHS, and an unrelated donor may be a suitable alternative for patients without an HLA-matched sibling. Early referral and transplantation in remission after accelerated phase disease may improve disease-free survival.",

                    "abstract": "Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare, autosomal recessive congenital immunodeficiency caused by mutations in CHS1, a gene encoding a putative lysosomal trafficking protein. In the majority of patients, this disorder is typically characterized by infantile-onset hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), which is lethal unless allogeneic transplantation is performed. A small number of individuals have the attenuated form of the disease and do not benefit from transplant. Improved outcomes of transplantation have been reported when performed before the development of HLH, thus it is important to quickly differentiate patients that present with the childhood form of disease and to prematurely enroll them into a transplantation protocol. In addition, this would also preclude those that exhibit clinical phenotypes of adolescent and adult CHS from this treatment. Patients with an absence of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) function have a high risk for developing HLH, and could therefore benefit the most from early hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). However, although normal CTL cytotoxicity or bi-allelic missense mutations do not exclude the occurrence of HLH in childhood, a more conservative approach is justified. This article summarizes recent advances in the clinical characterization of CHS patients, provides updates on promising new testing methods, and focuses on specific therapeutic approaches. ",

Diffuse PVNS developed in one knee 2.75 years later. Progression of PVNS was accompanied by the development of severe systemic symptoms, which resolved rapidly following subtotal surgical debridement. The patient remains well with minimal elevation of inflammatory marker levels 10.5 years later. As PVNS and Chediak-Higashi syndrome are both very rare diseases we propose a potential unifying hypothesis for this combination. ",

The patients were aged between 1 and 38 years (median, 4 years). Thirty-five patients underwent transplantation for metabolic disease (MD), ie, mucopolysaccharidosis (n = 25), adrenoleukodystrophy (n = 7), and others (n = 3). The remaining 46 patients had Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (n = 16), hemophagocytic syndrome including the inherited type (n = 9), severe combined immunodeficiency (n = 6), hyper-IgM syndrome (n = 4), Chediak-Higashi syndrome (n = 3), Kostmann syndrome (n = 3), and others (n = 5). Fifty-two donor-patient pairs were fully matched at HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DRB1 alleles. The remaining 24 patients received allele-mismatched grafts (20 matched at 5 of 6 loci and 4 matched at 4 of 6 loci). Engraftment occurred in 82.4% of the MD group and 90.7% of the other genetic disease (OGD) group; however, 14 patients (18.2%) experienced either early or late graft failure. The cumulative incidence of grade II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 35.5% - 9.8% in the MD group and 47.3% - 9.5% in the OGD group, and the rate of chronic GVHD was 20% in both groups. Forty-nine patients have survived for 3 to 96 months (median, 20 months). The probabilities of 5-year overall survival and event-free survival were 72.6% - 11.5% and 65.3% - 8.6%, respectively, for MD (n = 35) and 72.5% - 7.3% and 63.6% - 7.3% for OGD (n = 46). Although patient status before BMT and the occurrence of grade III to IV acute GVHD significantly affected outcome, unrelated BMT is a curative therapeutic option for children with congenital genetic diseases who have no HLA-matched family donors.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare and potentially fatal autosomal recessive disease characterized by frequent bacterial infections, bleeding tendency, oculocutaneous albinism, photosensitivity and progressive neurologic dysfunction. Owing to the rarity of this condition, the objective of this study was to describe patients with CHS. METHODS: Retrospective evaluation of patients followed in a paediatric tertiary centre of Allergy and Immunology of Sao Paulo, Brazil, between 1986 and 2018 with a confirmed diagnosis of CHS. Data were obtained from medical records. Demographic aspects, family history, clinical findings, laboratory data, diagnosis, treatment and outcome were described. RESULTS: A total of 14 patients (five male) were included. Clinical manifestations were first recognized at a median age of two months (at birth-20 months). Median age at diagnosis was 1.7 years (0-5 years). All patients had recurrent infections. Albinism was present in 13 patients and silvery or light hair was present in 14. Seven patients developed hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH); the median age at the diagnosis of HLH was 5.7 years (2.6-6.7 years) and the median interval between the diagnosis of CHS and HLH was 3.3 years (0-5 years). Four of the most recently diagnosed patients underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Nine patients are deceased, and one was lost to follow-up. The median age of death was 6.7 years (3.8-22 years). Five patients died of HLH, one of lymphoma, and three of infection. All the patients who had HLH before the year of 2000 died of HLH. The two most recently diagnosed patients with HLH were able to cure the HLH, although they died of other causes. Four patients are alive, three of them after successful BMT. CONCLUSION: Thirty years of follow up showed an improvement in the prognosis in patients with CHS. The better understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms of HLH allowed the standardization of management protocols, resulting in survival improvement. BMT is the only treatment that can change CHS prognosis, which emphasizes the need for early identification of the disease.",

We aimed to define mortality-related parameters in HLH secondary to primary immunodeficiency (PID). A total of 28 patients with HLH between the years 2013 and 2017 were enrolled in the study. The patients were evaluated in 2 groups including PID with hypopigmentation (n=7) (Chediak-Higashi syndrome [CHS] and Griscelli syndrome type 2 [GS2]) and other PIDs (n=21). The median age of the study population was 23 (4.3 to 117.0) months at the time of the diagnosis of HLH. Central nervous system involvement was recorded in 7 (GS2/CHS patients [n=4], other PIDs [n=3], P=0.026), and death was observed in 9 patients (GS2/CHS patients [n=1], other PIDs [n=8], P=0.371). Five patients (3 GS2/CHS and 2 other PID patients) underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Low serum albumin level was the only variable associated with the mortality and albumin levels less than the cut-off value of 3.07 g/dL increased mortality 5.8 times in patients with HLH secondary to PID. We presented a single-center experience consisting of patients with HLH secondary to PID with a mortality rate of 32.1%.

The outcome was uneventful, with sustained mixed chimerism. No subsequent recurrent infections or hemophagocytic syndrome were observed. At the age of 22 to 24 years, these 3 patients developed a neurologic deficit combining difficulty walking, loss of balance, and tremor. Neurologic evaluation demonstrated cerebellar ataxia and signs of peripheral neuropathy. Moderate axon loss and rarefaction of large myelinated fibers were observed on semithin sections of peripheral nerve. Cerebellar atrophy was detected by cerebral magnetic resonance imaging in 2 patients. We also reviewed the very long-term outcome of the other 11 patients with Chediak-Higashi syndrome who had received bone marrow transplants at our center since 1981. All displayed neurologic deficits or low cognitive abilities.",

Approximately 85% of patients with CHS undergo an AP within the first decade, which is similar to FHLH. Chemotherapy could induce transient remission, but only allogeneic HCT could correct the underlying genetic defect and prevent relapse. We reported a case of CHS diagnosed at 19 months, who had an elder brother who had previously succumbed to the same disease. The little girl presented with severe AP manifestations including recurrent high fever, enlarged superficial lymph nodes, and extraordinary hepatosplenomegaly occupying the whole abdominal and pelvic cavity. Comprehensive therapies including HLH 2004 protocol, supportive care, and antibiotics, especially antituberculous agents, were given to her to induce remission. After remission, the patient received fully HLA-matched UCBT. The transplantation course was uneventful, except for fluctuation of donor chimerism. The patient has been alive for 36 months without infection and neurologic manifestations and is under further follow-up. Our result provides another case that UCBT can be effective for treating patients with CHS and remission before HCT is important for good prognosis.",

This study analyzed the outcome of HSCT and the immune reconstruction in 10 children with primary immunodeficiencies in Taiwan. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the outcome of HSCT in 10 children with primary immunodeficiencies between 1986 and 2002. The primary immunodeficiencies in these children included severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) in 4, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) in 4, Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) in 1, and leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) in 1. The conditioning protocols included busulfan and cyclophosphamide in 2 patients with SCID, 3 patients with WAS, 1 patient with LAD and 1 patient with CHS. Anti-thymocyte globulin was given to only 1 patient with WAS and no conditioning therapy was given in 2 SCID patients. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis with cyclosporine (CsA) and methotrexate was prescribed in 6 children, CsA alone in 1, and CsA and T-cell depletion in 1. RESULTS: Six patients were cured and 1 improved during a follow-up period from 3.5 years to 13 years after transplantation. Three patients died of severe sepsis. Three patients developed acute GVHD, which was grade 2 in 2 patients, and grade 3 in 1. Veno-occlusive disease developed in 1 patient and chronic GVHD with contracture of joints in 1. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the benefits of allo-HSCT in children with primary immunodeficiencies. However, HSCT should be performed as soon as possible before severe infection develops.",

Correction of NK cell defects in CHS should improve the outcome of hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, proposed as therapy. We investigated NK cell functions in a CHS patient before and after cord-blood transplantation, and the ability of in vitro IL-2 treatment to restore them. Before the transplant, the strong defect in NK cell-mediated natural and antibody-dependent cytotoxicity, as well as in IFN-gamma production, could be restored up to normal levels by in vitro IL-2 treatment. This cytokine also caused the appearance of smaller lysosomal granules and their orientation towards the NK-target cell contact area, thus suggesting that IL-2 had a more general capacity to restore NK cell effector functions. Moreover after the transplant, although the successful engraftment, NK cell cytotoxicity resulted still partially impaired at one year, almost normal at ten years and, anyhow, fully recovered by in vitro IL-2 treatment. Taken together, our results indicate that IL-2 had a wide capacity to restore NK cell effector functions, being able to reverse the altered cytotoxic activity, lytic granule pattern, and cytokine production observed in the CHS patient.",

Recently, several clinical CHS phenotypes have been reported. Here, we report results of a nationwide survey performed to clarify clinical characteristics and outcomes of CHS patients in Japan. METHODS: Questionnaires were sent to 287 institutions to collect data regarding CHS patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2010, including results of lysosomal trafficking regulator (LYST) gene analysis. Cytotoxicity and degranulation activity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes were analyzed in available patient samples. RESULTS: A total of 15 patients diagnosed with CHS were eligible for enrollment in this study. Of these, 10 (67%) had recurrent bacterial infections, five (33%) developed life-threatening hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), and one patient had complicated malignant lymphoma. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was performed for six patients including three with HLH, and 10 of the enrolled patients have survived at the time of this writing. LYST analysis was performed for 10 patients; seven different mutations were detected in seven patients, whereas no mutation was identified in three patients.

Five patients with hematological malignancies (three MM, one CLL, one Chediak-Higashi syndrome) were conditioned with TBI (200 cGy). One patient additionally received fludarabine (120 mg/m(2)). CsA and mofetyl-mycophenolate (MMF) were administered to prevent GVHD. All patients were grafted with >3 x 10(6)/kg highly purified CD34(+) cells together with 2 x 10(6)/kg CD3(+) cells (three patients) or 1 x 10(5)/kg CD3(+) cells (two patients). Quick hematopoietic recovery and initial mixed donor chimerism was observed. Treatment-related toxicity was minimal in all but one patient who died of treatment-refractory GVHD on day 112. The four other patients only achieved partial donor T cell chimerism. BM and PBMC donor chimerism was lost between day 40 and 209 despite DLI. Three patients are alive with disease and one is in CR. We conclude that T cell-reduced SCT using 200 cGy as the conditioning regimen does not result in stable hematopoietic engraftment. Predominant donor T cell chimerism is not a prerequisite for initial allogeneic hematopoietic proliferation. However for sustained long-term engraftment it is of major importance.",

Twenty-two patients had a history of the life-threatening accelerated phase of CHS before HCT and 11 were in accelerated phase at transplantation. Thirteen patients received their allograft from an human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling, 10 from an alternative related donor and 12 from an unrelated donor. Eleven recipients of HLA-matched sibling donor, three recipients of alternative related donor and eight recipients of unrelated donor HCT are alive. With a median follow-up of 6.5 years, the 5-year probability of overall survival is 62%. Mortality was highest in those with accelerated phase disease at transplantation and after alternative related donor HCT. Only four of 11 patients with active disease at transplantation are alive. Seven recipients of alternative related donor HCT had active disease at transplantation and this may have influenced the poor outcome in this group. Although numbers are limited, HCT appears to be effective therapy for correcting and preventing hematologic and immunologic complications of CHS, and an unrelated donor may be a suitable alternative for patients without an HLA-matched sibling. Early referral and transplantation in remission after accelerated phase disease may improve disease-free survival.",

The resulting hypercytokinemia and cell infiltration of organs lead to the clinical and laboratory features of HLH. Viral infections and other triggers can induce both, inherited and acquired forms of HLH. Disease-causing mutations in the genes encoding perforin (PRF1, FHL2), munc13-4 (UNC13D, FHL3), syntaxin 11 (STX11, FHL4), and munc18-2 (UNC18-2/STXBP2, FHL5) have been previously identified in Familial Hemophagocyic Lymphohistiocytosis (FHL), whereas mutation in RAB27A and LYST account for Griscelli syndome type 2 and Chediak-Higashi syndrome, respectively. These genes all encode proteins which are involved in the cytotoxic activity of lymphocytes. The inability of activated cytotoxic cells to clear antigen-presenting targets results in sustained immune stimulation, likely accounting for the unremitting polyclonal CD8 T-cell activation and hyperimmune reaction which characterizes FHL. Treatment of HLH consists of elimination of the trigger and immunosuppressive treatment in order to induce remission from the uncontrolled inflammation.

                    "abstract": "Inflammatory periodontal diseases are highly prevalent, although most of these diseases develop and progress slowly, often unnoticed by the affected individual. However, a subgroup of these diseases include aggressive and acute forms that have a relatively low prevalence but show a rapid-course, high rate of progression leading to severe destruction of the periodontal tissues, or cause systemic symptoms that often require urgent attention from healthcare providers. Aggressive periodontitis is an early-onset, destructive disease that shows a high rate of periodontal progression and distinctive clinical features. A contemporary case definition of this disease is presented. Population studies show that the disease is more prevalent in certain geographic regions and ethnic groups. Aggressive periodontitis is an infectious disease, and recent data show that in affected subjects the subgingival microbiota is composed of a mixed microbial infection, with a wide heterogeneity in the types and proportions of microorganisms recovered. Furthermore, there are significant differences in the microbiota of the disease among different geographic regions and ethnicities. There is also evidence that the Aggregatibacter actinomycetemycomitans-JP2 clone may play an important role in the development of the disease in certain populations. The host response plays an important role in the susceptibility to aggressive periodontitis, where the immune response may be complex and involve multiple mechanisms. Also, genetic factors seem to play an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease, but the mechanisms of increased susceptibility are complex and not yet fully understood. The available data suggest that aggressive periodontitis is caused by mutations either in a few major genes or in multiple small-effect genes, and there is also evidence of gene-gene and gene-environment interaction effects. Diagnostic methods for this disease, based on a specific microbiologic, immunologic or genetic profile, currently do not exist. Genetic markers have the potential to be implemented as screening tools to identify subjects at risk. This approach may significantly enhance treatment outcome through the early detection and treatment of affected subjects, as well as using future approaches based on gene therapy. At present, the treatment of this disease is directed toward elimination of the subgingival bacterial load and other local risk factors. Adjunctive use of appropriate systemic antibiotics is recommended and may contribute to a longer suppression of the microbial infection. Other aggressive forms of periodontal diseases occur in patients who are affected with certain systemic diseases, including the leukocyte adhesion deficiency syndrome, Papillon-Lefevre syndrome, Chediak-Higashi syndrome and Down syndrome. Management of the periodontal component of these diseases is very challenging. Acute gingival and periodontal lesions include a group of disorders that range from nondestructive to destructive forms, and these lesions are usually associated with pain and are a common reason for emergency dental consultations. Some of these lesions may cause a rapid and severe destruction of the periodontal tissues and loss of teeth. Oral infections, particularly acute infections, can spread to extra-oral sites and cause serious medical complications, and even death. Hence, prompt diagnosis and treatment are paramount. ",

                    "abstract": "Inflammatory periodontal diseases are highly prevalent, although most of these diseases develop and progress slowly, often unnoticed by the affected individual. However, a subgroup of these diseases include aggressive and acute forms that have a relatively low prevalence but show a rapid-course, high rate of progression leading to severe destruction of the periodontal tissues, or cause systemic symptoms that often require urgent attention from healthcare providers. Aggressive periodontitis is an early-onset, destructive disease that shows a high rate of periodontal progression and distinctive clinical features. A contemporary case definition of this disease is presented. Population studies show that the disease is more prevalent in certain geographic regions and ethnic groups. Aggressive periodontitis is an infectious disease, and recent data show that in affected subjects the subgingival microbiota is composed of a mixed microbial infection, with a wide heterogeneity in the types and proportions of microorganisms recovered. Furthermore, there are significant differences in the microbiota of the disease among different geographic regions and ethnicities. There is also evidence that the Aggregatibacter actinomycetemycomitans-JP2 clone may play an important role in the development of the disease in certain populations. The host response plays an important role in the susceptibility to aggressive periodontitis, where the immune response may be complex and involve multiple mechanisms. Also, genetic factors seem to play an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease, but the mechanisms of increased susceptibility are complex and not yet fully understood. The available data suggest that aggressive periodontitis is caused by mutations either in a few major genes or in multiple small-effect genes, and there is also evidence of gene-gene and gene-environment interaction effects. Diagnostic methods for this disease, based on a specific microbiologic, immunologic or genetic profile, currently do not exist. Genetic markers have the potential to be implemented as screening tools to identify subjects at risk. This approach may significantly enhance treatment outcome through the early detection and treatment of affected subjects, as well as using future approaches based on gene therapy. At present, the treatment of this disease is directed toward elimination of the subgingival bacterial load and other local risk factors. Adjunctive use of appropriate systemic antibiotics is recommended and may contribute to a longer suppression of the microbial infection. Other aggressive forms of periodontal diseases occur in patients who are affected with certain systemic diseases, including the leukocyte adhesion deficiency syndrome, Papillon-Lefevre syndrome, Chediak-Higashi syndrome and Down syndrome. Management of the periodontal component of these diseases is very challenging. Acute gingival and periodontal lesions include a group of disorders that range from nondestructive to destructive forms, and these lesions are usually associated with pain and are a common reason for emergency dental consultations. Some of these lesions may cause a rapid and severe destruction of the periodontal tissues and loss of teeth. Oral infections, particularly acute infections, can spread to extra-oral sites and cause serious medical complications, and even death. Hence, prompt diagnosis and treatment are paramount. ",

We present data over 4 years on the challenges and efficacy of unmanipulated T cell replete haplo SCTs with post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) in children diagnosed to have PIDs. We performed a retrospective study in the pediatric blood and marrow transplantation unit where all children less than 18 years of age diagnosed to have PIDs and who underwent haplo SCT with PTCy from January 2014 to February 2018 were included in the study. Of the 16 transplants included in the study, 5 children were diagnosed to have Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, 3 with congenital hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, 2 each with Griscelli syndrome and Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases, and one each with Chediak-Higashi syndrome, ORAI 1 mutation immune deficiency, severe combined immune deficiency, and Hyper IgM syndrome. The source of stem cells was PBSC in 62.5% and bone marrow in 32.5%. Engraftment by day 16-21 post hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was achieved in 75% transplants with 91% of these remaining in sustained complete chimerism. Acute skin and gut graft versus host disease of grade 2-3 were noted in 50% transplants and cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation in 43.7% transplants. One child with congenital HLH succumbed to refractory CMV, adenovirus, and BK virus infection. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was noted in 75% transplants with 2 children succumbing to the illness. Tocilizumab was successfully used early in one child. Overall mortality was found to be 37.5% with overall survival of 62.5% with a median follow-up of 23.3 months. In resource limited settings, PTCy has the potential to provide a cost-effective advantage in terms of accessibility of this curative procedure among children with PIDs.",

Intracellular vesicle formation is deficient, resulting in giant granules in many cells, e.g. giant melanosomes in the melanocytes. Diagnosis has been based on morphological examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow, with giant granules seen in cells of the myeloid lineage and in lymphocytes. The ultimate diagnostic test is to look for a mutated LYST gene. Most patients develop an accelerated phase of the disease with deposition of lymphohistiocytes in the liver, spleen, lymph nodes and bone marrow, resulting in hepatosplenomegaly, bone marrow infiltration and haemophagocytosis. Peripheral blood neutropenia becomes more profound as anaemia and thrombocytopenia develop. Most patients succumb before the age of 10 years. Four patients with CHS are described, one of whom is a long-term survivor after successful allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, two succumbed during the accelerated phase and one is living with a chronic form of the disease. CONCLUSION: Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from an HLA-matched sibling is the therapy of choice and should be performed early. If there is no matched family donor, an unrelated donor or a placental blood graft is a good alternative. The clinical picture of CHS is heterogeneous and therapeutic decisions need to be made on an individual basis.",

Many mutations of the CHS1/LYST gene have been reported to date. We report a novel nonsense mutation of the CHS1/LYST gene in 3 Omani patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three patients from 2 different families presented with clinical and laboratory features of CHS and a history of death of a previous sibling because of a severe illness, suggestive of the accelerated phase of CHS. Giant granules were present in the myeloid cell lines. Before the stem-cell transplant, the first patient underwent gene sequencing of all exons of the lysosome trafficking regulator (CHS1/LYST) gene and revealed a nonsense mutation in exon 5 (c.925C>T, p.R309X). Subsequently, upon presentation, the second and third patients' direct gene sequencing of exon 5 revealed the same mutation. CONCLUSIONS: We report a nonsense mutation in exon 5 (c.925C>T, p.R309X). This supports the allelic heterogeneity of CHS and is in line with most reported mutation types that lead to a truncated protein. Identification of the mutation type will facilitate timely diagnosis, management, and family counseling for those with affected children in Oman.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Since 1968 it has been known that hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can ameliorate primary immunodeficiencies, but data on the long-term efficacy of this treatment in Taiwan are limited. This study analyzed the outcome of HSCT and the immune reconstruction in 10 children with primary immunodeficiencies in Taiwan. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the outcome of HSCT in 10 children with primary immunodeficiencies between 1986 and 2002. The primary immunodeficiencies in these children included severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) in 4, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) in 4, Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) in 1, and leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) in 1. The conditioning protocols included busulfan and cyclophosphamide in 2 patients with SCID, 3 patients with WAS, 1 patient with LAD and 1 patient with CHS. Anti-thymocyte globulin was given to only 1 patient with WAS and no conditioning therapy was given in 2 SCID patients. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis with cyclosporine (CsA) and methotrexate was prescribed in 6 children, CsA alone in 1, and CsA and T-cell depletion in 1. RESULTS: Six patients were cured and 1 improved during a follow-up period from 3.5 years to 13 years after transplantation. Three patients died of severe sepsis. Three patients developed acute GVHD, which was grade 2 in 2 patients, and grade 3 in 1. Veno-occlusive disease developed in 1 patient and chronic GVHD with contracture of joints in 1. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the benefits of allo-HSCT in children with primary immunodeficiencies. However, HSCT should be performed as soon as possible before severe infection develops.",

                    "abstract": "Haploidentical stem cell transplantation (haplo SCT) has emerged as an acceptable alternative to matched family donor transplantation for children diagnosed to have primary immune deficiency disorders (PIDs). We present data over 4 years on the challenges and efficacy of unmanipulated T cell replete haplo SCTs with post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) in children diagnosed to have PIDs. We performed a retrospective study in the pediatric blood and marrow transplantation unit where all children less than 18 years of age diagnosed to have PIDs and who underwent haplo SCT with PTCy from January 2014 to February 2018 were included in the study. Of the 16 transplants included in the study, 5 children were diagnosed to have Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, 3 with congenital hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, 2 each with Griscelli syndrome and Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases, and one each with Chediak-Higashi syndrome, ORAI 1 mutation immune deficiency, severe combined immune deficiency, and Hyper IgM syndrome. The source of stem cells was PBSC in 62.5% and bone marrow in 32.5%. Engraftment by day 16-21 post hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was achieved in 75% transplants with 91% of these remaining in sustained complete chimerism. Acute skin and gut graft versus host disease of grade 2-3 were noted in 50% transplants and cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation in 43.7% transplants. One child with congenital HLH succumbed to refractory CMV, adenovirus, and BK virus infection. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was noted in 75% transplants with 2 children succumbing to the illness. Tocilizumab was successfully used early in one child. Overall mortality was found to be 37.5% with overall survival of 62.5% with a median follow-up of 23.3 months. In resource limited settings, PTCy has the potential to provide a cost-effective advantage in terms of accessibility of this curative procedure among children with PIDs.",

                    "abstract": "We investigated whether a T cell-reduced allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) with minimal conditioning and subsequent donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) could reduce the incidence and severity of GVHD while retaining stable engraftment. Five patients with hematological malignancies (three MM, one CLL, one Chediak-Higashi syndrome) were conditioned with TBI (200 cGy). One patient additionally received fludarabine (120 mg/m(2)). CsA and mofetyl-mycophenolate (MMF) were administered to prevent GVHD. All patients were grafted with >3 x 10(6)/kg highly purified CD34(+) cells together with 2 x 10(6)/kg CD3(+) cells (three patients) or 1 x 10(5)/kg CD3(+) cells (two patients). Quick hematopoietic recovery and initial mixed donor chimerism was observed. Treatment-related toxicity was minimal in all but one patient who died of treatment-refractory GVHD on day 112. The four other patients only achieved partial donor T cell chimerism. BM and PBMC donor chimerism was lost between day 40 and 209 despite DLI. Three patients are alive with disease and one is in CR. We conclude that T cell-reduced SCT using 200 cGy as the conditioning regimen does not result in stable hematopoietic engraftment. Predominant donor T cell chimerism is not a prerequisite for initial allogeneic hematopoietic proliferation. However for sustained long-term engraftment it is of major importance.",

Of the 22 patients, 7 received human leukocyte antigen-matched related hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, 12 received haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and 2 received matched unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The results showed that 5 patients had graft failure. Fourteen patients survived, yielding an overall survival rate of 67%.

Approximately 85% of patients with CHS undergo an AP within the first decade, which is similar to FHLH. Chemotherapy could induce transient remission, but only allogeneic HCT could correct the underlying genetic defect and prevent relapse. We reported a case of CHS diagnosed at 19 months, who had an elder brother who had previously succumbed to the same disease. The little girl presented with severe AP manifestations including recurrent high fever, enlarged superficial lymph nodes, and extraordinary hepatosplenomegaly occupying the whole abdominal and pelvic cavity. Comprehensive therapies including HLH 2004 protocol, supportive care, and antibiotics, especially antituberculous agents, were given to her to induce remission. After remission, the patient received fully HLA-matched UCBT. The transplantation course was uneventful, except for fluctuation of donor chimerism. The patient has been alive for 36 months without infection and neurologic manifestations and is under further follow-up. Our result provides another case that UCBT can be effective for treating patients with CHS and remission before HCT is important for good prognosis.",

We aimed to define mortality-related parameters in HLH secondary to primary immunodeficiency (PID). A total of 28 patients with HLH between the years 2013 and 2017 were enrolled in the study. The patients were evaluated in 2 groups including PID with hypopigmentation (n=7) (Chediak-Higashi syndrome [CHS] and Griscelli syndrome type 2 [GS2]) and other PIDs (n=21). The median age of the study population was 23 (4.3 to 117.0) months at the time of the diagnosis of HLH. Central nervous system involvement was recorded in 7 (GS2/CHS patients [n=4], other PIDs [n=3], P=0.026), and death was observed in 9 patients (GS2/CHS patients [n=1], other PIDs [n=8], P=0.371). Five patients (3 GS2/CHS and 2 other PID patients) underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Low serum albumin level was the only variable associated with the mortality and albumin levels less than the cut-off value of 3.07 g/dL increased mortality 5.8 times in patients with HLH secondary to PID. We presented a single-center experience consisting of patients with HLH secondary to PID with a mortality rate of 32.1%. Hypoalbuminemia was the only risk factor to increase the overall mortality rate of HLH.",

Here, we examine the effect of oral or intraperitoneal administration of E-64-d, which protects PKC from calpain-mediated proteolysis, on the impaired cellular function in PMNs from beige mice. We found that oral administration of E-64-d (12.5 mg/kg body weight per day) for three consecutive days, significantly improved the abnormally increased concanavalin A (Con A) cap formation and the decreased lysosomal enzyme activity in beige PMNs. In addition, E-64-d significantly improved the delayed bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus. In contrast, E-64-d at the same dose did not affect these cellular functions in PMNs from C57BL/6J mice. We confirmed that the abnormal down-regulation of PKC after Con A stimulation was eliminated in PMNs from E-64-d-treated beige PMNs. We then examined whether the administration of E-64-d to beige mice improved the susceptibility to experimental infection with S. aureus (2x10(8)/mouse). Both intraperitoneal and oral administration of E-64-d to beige mice resulted in a significant increase in survival, whereas E-64-d at the same dose did not alter the survival rate in normal mice. These results suggest that the administration of E-64-d may be effective against severe bacterial infection in Chediak-Higashi syndrome.",

Intracellular vesicle formation is deficient, resulting in giant granules in many cells, e.g. giant melanosomes in the melanocytes. Diagnosis has been based on morphological examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow, with giant granules seen in cells of the myeloid lineage and in lymphocytes. The ultimate diagnostic test is to look for a mutated LYST gene. Most patients develop an accelerated phase of the disease with deposition of lymphohistiocytes in the liver, spleen, lymph nodes and bone marrow, resulting in hepatosplenomegaly, bone marrow infiltration and haemophagocytosis. Peripheral blood neutropenia becomes more profound as anaemia and thrombocytopenia develop. Most patients succumb before the age of 10 years. Four patients with CHS are described, one of whom is a long-term survivor after successful allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, two succumbed during the accelerated phase and one is living with a chronic form of the disease. CONCLUSION: Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from an HLA-matched sibling is the therapy of choice and should be performed early. If there is no matched family donor, an unrelated donor or a placental blood graft is a good alternative. The clinical picture of CHS is heterogeneous and therapeutic decisions need to be made on an individual basis.",

The ultimate diagnostic test is to look for a mutated LYST gene. Most patients develop an accelerated phase of the disease with deposition of lymphohistiocytes in the liver, spleen, lymph nodes and bone marrow, resulting in hepatosplenomegaly, bone marrow infiltration and haemophagocytosis. Peripheral blood neutropenia becomes more profound as anaemia and thrombocytopenia develop. Most patients succumb before the age of 10 years. Four patients with CHS are described, one of whom is a long-term survivor after successful allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, two succumbed during the accelerated phase and one is living with a chronic form of the disease. CONCLUSION: Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from an HLA-matched sibling is the therapy of choice and should be performed early. If there is no matched family donor, an unrelated donor or a placental blood graft is a good alternative. The clinical picture of CHS is heterogeneous and therapeutic decisions need to be made on an individual basis.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by immunodeficiency, neurological dysfunction, and oculocutaneous albinism. Recently, several clinical CHS phenotypes have been reported. Here, we report results of a nationwide survey performed to clarify clinical characteristics and outcomes of CHS patients in Japan. METHODS: Questionnaires were sent to 287 institutions to collect data regarding CHS patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2010, including results of lysosomal trafficking regulator (LYST) gene analysis. Cytotoxicity and degranulation activity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes were analyzed in available patient samples. RESULTS: A total of 15 patients diagnosed with CHS were eligible for enrollment in this study. Of these, 10 (67%) had recurrent bacterial infections, five (33%) developed life-threatening hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), and one patient had complicated malignant lymphoma. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was performed for six patients including three with HLH, and 10 of the enrolled patients have survived at the time of this writing. LYST analysis was performed for 10 patients; seven different mutations were detected in seven patients, whereas no mutation was identified in three patients. Cytotoxicity and degranulation activity were impaired in patients with and without LYST mutation. DISCUSSION: Results of this survey indicate that one or two patients with CHS were newly diagnosed each year in Japan. The incidence of HLH was not as high as expected. Mutations of genes other than LYST were suspected in some cases. We conclude that determining indication for HSCT for CHS patients should be based on genetic and cytotoxic analysis.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The rate of diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, a genetically heterogeneous and, frequently, rapidly fatal autosomal recessive disorder of immune regulation, is increasing worldwide. Awareness has grown through the Histiocyte Society and the publication of newly-recognized genetic causes. I summarize current knowledge regarding the pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. RECENT FINDINGS: Genetic defects leading to life-threatening hemophagocytic syndromes have recently been described. Two autosomal recessive gene defects underlie 40-50% of primary (familial) cases worldwide: perforin, the major immune cytotoxic protein, and MUNC 13-4, a protein involved in exocytosis of perforin-bearing cytotoxic granules during apoptosis. Related autosomal recessive defects of secretory cytotoxic lysosomes - LYST 1 (Chediak-Higashi syndrome), Rab27A (Griscelli syndrome), and X-linked lymphoproliferative disorder - also carry a very high risk of fatal hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Concurrently, treatment protocols involving multiagent immunomodulatory therapy followed by allogeneic hematopoeitic cell transplantation have been tested. With immunomodulatory treatment, 75% of children with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis are symptomatically improved after 2 months of therapy. Disease-free survival after allogeneic hematopoeitic cell transplantation currently ranges from 50 to 70%. SUMMARY: Bench and clinical research have advanced understanding of the pathophysiology of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and related disorders, and significantly improved clinical outcomes during the past decade.",

Here, we examine the effect of oral or intraperitoneal administration of E-64-d, which protects PKC from calpain-mediated proteolysis, on the impaired cellular function in PMNs from beige mice. We found that oral administration of E-64-d (12.5 mg/kg body weight per day) for three consecutive days, significantly improved the abnormally increased concanavalin A (Con A) cap formation and the decreased lysosomal enzyme activity in beige PMNs. In addition, E-64-d significantly improved the delayed bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus. In contrast, E-64-d at the same dose did not affect these cellular functions in PMNs from C57BL/6J mice. We confirmed that the abnormal down-regulation of PKC after Con A stimulation was eliminated in PMNs from E-64-d-treated beige PMNs. We then examined whether the administration of E-64-d to beige mice improved the susceptibility to experimental infection with S. aureus (2x10(8)/mouse). Both intraperitoneal and oral administration of E-64-d to beige mice resulted in a significant increase in survival, whereas E-64-d at the same dose did not alter the survival rate in normal mice. These results suggest that the administration of E-64-d may be effective against severe bacterial infection in Chediak-Higashi syndrome.",

Clinically he was suspected to have haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Haematological findings including the presence of several abnormal giant granules in neutrophils and single large azurophilic granules in many lymphocytes and monocytes in the peripheral blood established the diagnosis of Chediak-Higashi syndrome. The patient responded to allogeneic bone marrow transplant. This paper discusses the characteristic features, clinical course and management of this rare disorder. We suggest that peripheral blood film examination for the abnormal giant granules in granulocytes is an essential investigation in all young children with frequent recurrent infections or who are suspected to have virus-associated haemophagocytic syndrome or familial haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.",

                    "abstract": "Inflammatory periodontal diseases are highly prevalent, although most of these diseases develop and progress slowly, often unnoticed by the affected individual. However, a subgroup of these diseases include aggressive and acute forms that have a relatively low prevalence but show a rapid-course, high rate of progression leading to severe destruction of the periodontal tissues, or cause systemic symptoms that often require urgent attention from healthcare providers. Aggressive periodontitis is an early-onset, destructive disease that shows a high rate of periodontal progression and distinctive clinical features. A contemporary case definition of this disease is presented. Population studies show that the disease is more prevalent in certain geographic regions and ethnic groups. Aggressive periodontitis is an infectious disease, and recent data show that in affected subjects the subgingival microbiota is composed of a mixed microbial infection, with a wide heterogeneity in the types and proportions of microorganisms recovered. Furthermore, there are significant differences in the microbiota of the disease among different geographic regions and ethnicities. There is also evidence that the Aggregatibacter actinomycetemycomitans-JP2 clone may play an important role in the development of the disease in certain populations. The host response plays an important role in the susceptibility to aggressive periodontitis, where the immune response may be complex and involve multiple mechanisms. Also, genetic factors seem to play an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease, but the mechanisms of increased susceptibility are complex and not yet fully understood. The available data suggest that aggressive periodontitis is caused by mutations either in a few major genes or in multiple small-effect genes, and there is also evidence of gene-gene and gene-environment interaction effects. Diagnostic methods for this disease, based on a specific microbiologic, immunologic or genetic profile, currently do not exist. Genetic markers have the potential to be implemented as screening tools to identify subjects at risk. This approach may significantly enhance treatment outcome through the early detection and treatment of affected subjects, as well as using future approaches based on gene therapy. At present, the treatment of this disease is directed toward elimination of the subgingival bacterial load and other local risk factors. Adjunctive use of appropriate systemic antibiotics is recommended and may contribute to a longer suppression of the microbial infection. Other aggressive forms of periodontal diseases occur in patients who are affected with certain systemic diseases, including the leukocyte adhesion deficiency syndrome, Papillon-Lefevre syndrome, Chediak-Higashi syndrome and Down syndrome. Management of the periodontal component of these diseases is very challenging. Acute gingival and periodontal lesions include a group of disorders that range from nondestructive to destructive forms, and these lesions are usually associated with pain and are a common reason for emergency dental consultations. Some of these lesions may cause a rapid and severe destruction of the periodontal tissues and loss of teeth. Oral infections, particularly acute infections, can spread to extra-oral sites and cause serious medical complications, and even death. Hence, prompt diagnosis and treatment are paramount. ",

                    "abstract": "We previously reported that abnormally down-regulated protein kinase C (PKC) activity is responsible for the impaired cellular function of natural killer cells and polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs), and the giant granule formation in fibroblasts in the beige mouse, an animal model of Chediak-Higashi syndrome. Here, we examine the effect of oral or intraperitoneal administration of E-64-d, which protects PKC from calpain-mediated proteolysis, on the impaired cellular function in PMNs from beige mice. We found that oral administration of E-64-d (12.5 mg/kg body weight per day) for three consecutive days, significantly improved the abnormally increased concanavalin A (Con A) cap formation and the decreased lysosomal enzyme activity in beige PMNs. In addition, E-64-d significantly improved the delayed bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus. In contrast, E-64-d at the same dose did not affect these cellular functions in PMNs from C57BL/6J mice. We confirmed that the abnormal down-regulation of PKC after Con A stimulation was eliminated in PMNs from E-64-d-treated beige PMNs. We then examined whether the administration of E-64-d to beige mice improved the susceptibility to experimental infection with S. aureus (2x10(8)/mouse). Both intraperitoneal and oral administration of E-64-d to beige mice resulted in a significant increase in survival, whereas E-64-d at the same dose did not alter the survival rate in normal mice. These results suggest that the administration of E-64-d may be effective against severe bacterial infection in Chediak-Higashi syndrome.",

METHODS: Twenty-one children were assessed on standardized measures of cognitive and psychosocial functioning and compared with an unaffected sibling control group (n = 14). Parent and teacher reports were obtained to provide additional information. RESULTS: The average full-scale intelligence quotient for the patient cohort was 81 (95% CI, 72-90), which was significantly lower than both the population average of 100 (P = .001) and the average for the unaffected sibling control group (99.2, P = .002). Fifty-six percent of school-aged children were receiving additional support at school, with the majority needing high levels of support. These children also experienced significant psychosocial difficulties. Lower socioeconomic status was associated with poorer cognitive outcomes, but age at transplantation, time to transplantation, type of conditioning, and presence of mixed chimerism were not. Ten (48%) of 21 children had evidence of neurologic involvement at diagnosis, but surprisingly, this was not significantly associated with adverse neurologic outcomes, and some children who did not have any apparent neurologic involvement at diagnosis had severe learning difficulties at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, childhood survivors of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis are at risk of long-term cognitive and psychosocial difficulties. Prospective and systematic long-term follow-up of these patients is essential for early identification and effective management of these problems.",

The patient diagnoses included severe combined immunodeficiency (n=11), Chediak-Higashi syndrome (n=2), leukocyte adhesion deficiency (n=2), MHC class 2 deficiency (n=2), chronic granulomatous syndrome (n=2), hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (n=1), Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (n=1), and Omenn syndrome (n=1). Of the 22 patients, 7 received human leukocyte antigen-matched related hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, 12 received haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and 2 received matched unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The results showed that 5 patients had graft failure. Fourteen patients survived, yielding an overall survival rate of 67%.

About 74.9% of the patients (1530 of 2042) remained alive between one to 168 months after stem cell transplantation. Nearly 25.1% (512 of 2042) of our patients died after stem cell transplantation. The causes of deaths were relapse, infections, hemorrhagic cystitis, graft versus host disease, and others.",

                    "abstract": "Primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs) are a group of rare diseases with wide geographic and ethnic variations in incidence, prevalence, and distribution patterns. The aim of this study was to examine the distribution pattern and clinical spectrum of PIDs in Taiwan at a national referral institute. From 1985 to 2010, 215 patients from 183 families were diagnosed and grouped according to the updated classification of PIDs. Eighty-one (37.7%) patients had \"other well-defined immunodeficiency syndromes\", followed by \"predominantly antibody deficiencies\" (54 patients; 25.1%), \"T- and B-cell immunodeficiencies\" (34; 15.8%), \"congenital defects of phagocytes\" (25; 20.2%), \"complement deficiencies\" (15; 7.0%), and \"disease in immune dysregulation\" (5; 2.3%). The last category included two patients with Chediak-Higashi syndrome, and one each with familial hemophagocytosis, IPEX, and hypogammaglobulinemia and albinism. One female had cold-induced auto-inflammatory disease. There were no cases of \"defects in innate immunity\". Pseudomonas and Streptococcus pneumoniae were the two most identified microorganisms in septicemia (42.7%; 44/103 episodes). Stem cell transplantation was successful in 13 of 22 patients, while 34 patients (15.8%) died. Molecular defects were identified in 109 individuals (from 90 families). There were relatively fewer cases of \"predominantly antibody deficiencies\" due to there being only a few patients with adult-onset PIDs, implying certainty bias rather than ethnic variation. Awareness of under-diagnosis among physicians rather than pediatricians is vital for timely diagnosis and consequently adequate treatment.",

Diffuse PVNS developed in one knee 2.75 years later. Progression of PVNS was accompanied by the development of severe systemic symptoms, which resolved rapidly following subtotal surgical debridement.

Five patients with hematological malignancies (three MM, one CLL, one Chediak-Higashi syndrome) were conditioned with TBI (200 cGy). One patient additionally received fludarabine (120 mg/m(2)). CsA and mofetyl-mycophenolate (MMF) were administered to prevent GVHD. All patients were grafted with >3 x 10(6)/kg highly purified CD34(+) cells together with 2 x 10(6)/kg CD3(+) cells (three patients) or 1 x 10(5)/kg CD3(+) cells (two patients). Quick hematopoietic recovery and initial mixed donor chimerism was observed. Treatment-related toxicity was minimal in all but one patient who died of treatment-refractory GVHD on day 112. The four other patients only achieved partial donor T cell chimerism. BM and PBMC donor chimerism was lost between day 40 and 209 despite DLI. Three patients are alive with disease and one is in CR. We conclude that T cell-reduced SCT using 200 cGy as the conditioning regimen does not result in stable hematopoietic engraftment. Predominant donor T cell chimerism is not a prerequisite for initial allogeneic hematopoietic proliferation. However for sustained long-term engraftment it is of major importance.",

Limitations of the use of stem cells depends on the small number of cells available; this is the reason why UCB can be used only in very low-weight patients.

RESULTS: After thawing, nucleated cells (NC) mean recovery was 76.81% (SD+-15.41). The quantity of NC obtained was 124.29x107 (SD+-43.18) and in only 5 cases the number of NC after the procedure was lower than the requested graft dose. Among the last ones, in two cases only we did not achieve the target after manipulation. The post-manipulation cellular viability was 83.48% (SD+-10.6). For all the units shipment complied with all the necessary procedures; in fact the temperature never rose above -120 C. CONCLUSION: In our study we highlighted the efficacy of UCB thawing technique, with the same method defined in 1995 at the New York Blood Centre that guarantees an excellent NC recovery and maintains a high level of cell viability.",

The resulting hypercytokinemia and cell infiltration of organs lead to the clinical and laboratory features of HLH. Viral infections and other triggers can induce both, inherited and acquired forms of HLH. Disease-causing mutations in the genes encoding perforin (PRF1, FHL2), munc13-4 (UNC13D, FHL3), syntaxin 11 (STX11, FHL4), and munc18-2 (UNC18-2/STXBP2, FHL5) have been previously identified in Familial Hemophagocyic Lymphohistiocytosis (FHL), whereas mutation in RAB27A and LYST account for Griscelli syndome type 2 and Chediak-Higashi syndrome, respectively. These genes all encode proteins which are involved in the cytotoxic activity of lymphocytes. The inability of activated cytotoxic cells to clear antigen-presenting targets results in sustained immune stimulation, likely accounting for the unremitting polyclonal CD8 T-cell activation and hyperimmune reaction which characterizes FHL. Treatment of HLH consists of elimination of the trigger and immunosuppressive treatment in order to induce remission from the uncontrolled inflammation. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can be indicated in the inherited forms of HLH.",

Five patients with hematological malignancies (three MM, one CLL, one Chediak-Higashi syndrome) were conditioned with TBI (200 cGy). One patient additionally received fludarabine (120 mg/m(2)). CsA and mofetyl-mycophenolate (MMF) were administered to prevent GVHD. All patients were grafted with >3 x 10(6)/kg highly purified CD34(+) cells together with 2 x 10(6)/kg CD3(+) cells (three patients) or 1 x 10(5)/kg CD3(+) cells (two patients). Quick hematopoietic recovery and initial mixed donor chimerism was observed. Treatment-related toxicity was minimal in all but one patient who died of treatment-refractory GVHD on day 112. The four other patients only achieved partial donor T cell chimerism. BM and PBMC donor chimerism was lost between day 40 and 209 despite DLI. Three patients are alive with disease and one is in CR. We conclude that T cell-reduced SCT using 200 cGy as the conditioning regimen does not result in stable hematopoietic engraftment. Predominant donor T cell chimerism is not a prerequisite for initial allogeneic hematopoietic proliferation. However for sustained long-term engraftment it is of major importance.",

Approximately 85% of patients with CHS undergo an AP within the first decade, which is similar to FHLH. Chemotherapy could induce transient remission, but only allogeneic HCT could correct the underlying genetic defect and prevent relapse. We reported a case of CHS diagnosed at 19 months, who had an elder brother who had previously succumbed to the same disease. The little girl presented with severe AP manifestations including recurrent high fever, enlarged superficial lymph nodes, and extraordinary hepatosplenomegaly occupying the whole abdominal and pelvic cavity. Comprehensive therapies including HLH 2004 protocol, supportive care, and antibiotics, especially antituberculous agents, were given to her to induce remission. After remission, the patient received fully HLA-matched UCBT. The transplantation course was uneventful, except for fluctuation of donor chimerism. The patient has been alive for 36 months without infection and neurologic manifestations and is under further follow-up. Our result provides another case that UCBT can be effective for treating patients with CHS and remission before HCT is important for good prognosis.",

In the majority of patients, this disorder is typically characterized by infantile-onset hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), which is lethal unless allogeneic transplantation is performed. A small number of individuals have the attenuated form of the disease and do not benefit from transplant. Improved outcomes of transplantation have been reported when performed before the development of HLH, thus it is important to quickly differentiate patients that present with the childhood form of disease and to prematurely enroll them into a transplantation protocol. In addition, this would also preclude those that exhibit clinical phenotypes of adolescent and adult CHS from this treatment. Patients with an absence of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) function have a high risk for developing HLH, and could therefore benefit the most from early hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). However, although normal CTL cytotoxicity or bi-allelic missense mutations do not exclude the occurrence of HLH in childhood, a more conservative approach is justified. This article summarizes recent advances in the clinical characterization of CHS patients, provides updates on promising new testing methods, and focuses on specific therapeutic approaches. ",

METHODS: Twenty-one children were assessed on standardized measures of cognitive and psychosocial functioning and compared with an unaffected sibling control group (n = 14). Parent and teacher reports were obtained to provide additional information. RESULTS: The average full-scale intelligence quotient for the patient cohort was 81 (95% CI, 72-90), which was significantly lower than both the population average of 100 (P = .001) and the average for the unaffected sibling control group (99.2, P = .002). Fifty-six percent of school-aged children were receiving additional support at school, with the majority needing high levels of support. These children also experienced significant psychosocial difficulties. Lower socioeconomic status was associated with poorer cognitive outcomes, but age at transplantation, time to transplantation, type of conditioning, and presence of mixed chimerism were not. Ten (48%) of 21 children had evidence of neurologic involvement at diagnosis, but surprisingly, this was not significantly associated with adverse neurologic outcomes, and some children who did not have any apparent neurologic involvement at diagnosis had severe learning difficulties at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, childhood survivors of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis are at risk of long-term cognitive and psychosocial difficulties. Prospective and systematic long-term follow-up of these patients is essential for early identification and effective management of these problems.",

We aimed to define mortality-related parameters in HLH secondary to primary immunodeficiency (PID). A total of 28 patients with HLH between the years 2013 and 2017 were enrolled in the study. The patients were evaluated in 2 groups including PID with hypopigmentation (n=7) (Chediak-Higashi syndrome [CHS] and Griscelli syndrome type 2 [GS2]) and other PIDs (n=21). The median age of the study population was 23 (4.3 to 117.0) months at the time of the diagnosis of HLH. Central nervous system involvement was recorded in 7 (GS2/CHS patients [n=4], other PIDs [n=3], P=0.026), and death was observed in 9 patients (GS2/CHS patients [n=1], other PIDs [n=8], P=0.371). Five patients (3 GS2/CHS and 2 other PID patients) underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Low serum albumin level was the only variable associated with the mortality and albumin levels less than the cut-off value of 3.07 g/dL increased mortality 5.8 times in patients with HLH secondary to PID. We presented a single-center experience consisting of patients with HLH secondary to PID with a mortality rate of 32.1%. Hypoalbuminemia was the only risk factor to increase the overall mortality rate of HLH.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by immunodeficiency, neurological dysfunction, and oculocutaneous albinism. Recently, several clinical CHS phenotypes have been reported. Here, we report results of a nationwide survey performed to clarify clinical characteristics and outcomes of CHS patients in Japan. METHODS: Questionnaires were sent to 287 institutions to collect data regarding CHS patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2010, including results of lysosomal trafficking regulator (LYST) gene analysis. Cytotoxicity and degranulation activity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes were analyzed in available patient samples. RESULTS: A total of 15 patients diagnosed with CHS were eligible for enrollment in this study. Of these, 10 (67%) had recurrent bacterial infections, five (33%) developed life-threatening hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), and one patient had complicated malignant lymphoma. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was performed for six patients including three with HLH, and 10 of the enrolled patients have survived at the time of this writing. LYST analysis was performed for 10 patients; seven different mutations were detected in seven patients, whereas no mutation was identified in three patients. Cytotoxicity and degranulation activity were impaired in patients with and without LYST mutation. DISCUSSION: Results of this survey indicate that one or two patients with CHS were newly diagnosed each year in Japan. The incidence of HLH was not as high as expected. Mutations of genes other than LYST were suspected in some cases. We conclude that determining indication for HSCT for CHS patients should be based on genetic and cytotoxic analysis.",

This study analyzed the outcome of HSCT and the immune reconstruction in 10 children with primary immunodeficiencies in Taiwan. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the outcome of HSCT in 10 children with primary immunodeficiencies between 1986 and 2002. The primary immunodeficiencies in these children included severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) in 4, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) in 4, Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) in 1, and leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) in 1. The conditioning protocols included busulfan and cyclophosphamide in 2 patients with SCID, 3 patients with WAS, 1 patient with LAD and 1 patient with CHS. Anti-thymocyte globulin was given to only 1 patient with WAS and no conditioning therapy was given in 2 SCID patients. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis with cyclosporine (CsA) and methotrexate was prescribed in 6 children, CsA alone in 1, and CsA and T-cell depletion in 1. RESULTS: Six patients were cured and 1 improved during a follow-up period from 3.5 years to 13 years after transplantation. Three patients died of severe sepsis. Three patients developed acute GVHD, which was grade 2 in 2 patients, and grade 3 in 1. Veno-occlusive disease developed in 1 patient and chronic GVHD with contracture of joints in 1. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the benefits of allo-HSCT in children with primary immunodeficiencies. However, HSCT should be performed as soon as possible before severe infection develops.",

APs occur in 85% of patients and are usually the main cause of mortality, and HSCT from HLA-matched related and unrelated donors is the only effective treatment for CHS and prevents recurrences of APs. We reviewed the records of three patients with CHS who underwent UCBT at KHCC. Records were examined for clinical features at the time of UCBT, conditioning regimens, morbidities, and outcomes. Conditioning comprised BU, cyclophosphamide, horse ATG, and etoposide. All patients tolerated the conditioning well. Two patients are alive, one with mixed and the other with full donor chimerism; hematologic and immunologic defects of CHS have been corrected in both patients. They show no evidence of recurrences of APs and have normal growth and development. In patients with CHS who lack HLA-matched related and unrelated donors, UCBT is a suitable alternative source of stem cells to restore immunologic and hematologic functions and prevent AP relapses, even in mixed chimeric states. Long follow-up and close monitoring are essential to evaluate the long-term benefits of using UCBT in patients with CHS.",

Approximately 85% of patients with CHS undergo an AP within the first decade, which is similar to FHLH. Chemotherapy could induce transient remission, but only allogeneic HCT could correct the underlying genetic defect and prevent relapse. We reported a case of CHS diagnosed at 19 months, who had an elder brother who had previously succumbed to the same disease. The little girl presented with severe AP manifestations including recurrent high fever, enlarged superficial lymph nodes, and extraordinary hepatosplenomegaly occupying the whole abdominal and pelvic cavity. Comprehensive therapies including HLH 2004 protocol, supportive care, and antibiotics, especially antituberculous agents, were given to her to induce remission. After remission, the patient received fully HLA-matched UCBT. The transplantation course was uneventful, except for fluctuation of donor chimerism. The patient has been alive for 36 months without infection and neurologic manifestations and is under further follow-up. Our result provides another case that UCBT can be effective for treating patients with CHS and remission before HCT is important for good prognosis.",

The resulting hypercytokinemia and cell infiltration of organs lead to the clinical and laboratory features of HLH. Viral infections and other triggers can induce both, inherited and acquired forms of HLH. Disease-causing mutations in the genes encoding perforin (PRF1, FHL2), munc13-4 (UNC13D, FHL3), syntaxin 11 (STX11, FHL4), and munc18-2 (UNC18-2/STXBP2, FHL5) have been previously identified in Familial Hemophagocyic Lymphohistiocytosis (FHL), whereas mutation in RAB27A and LYST account for Griscelli syndome type 2 and Chediak-Higashi syndrome, respectively. These genes all encode proteins which are involved in the cytotoxic activity of lymphocytes. The inability of activated cytotoxic cells to clear antigen-presenting targets results in sustained immune stimulation, likely accounting for the unremitting polyclonal CD8 T-cell activation and hyperimmune reaction which characterizes FHL. Treatment of HLH consists of elimination of the trigger and immunosuppressive treatment in order to induce remission from the uncontrolled inflammation. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can be indicated in the inherited forms of HLH.",

The most rapid procedure was the whole mount technique to determine the presence or absence of dense bodies, which are inherently electron-opaque, serotonin-containing storage organelles in platelets. Dense bodies were present in normal numbers in platelets from two patients with successful transplantation and absent in thrombocytes from another patient in whom the transplant had failed.",

The patients were aged between 1 and 38 years (median, 4 years). Thirty-five patients underwent transplantation for metabolic disease (MD), ie, mucopolysaccharidosis (n = 25), adrenoleukodystrophy (n = 7), and others (n = 3). The remaining 46 patients had Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (n = 16), hemophagocytic syndrome including the inherited type (n = 9), severe combined immunodeficiency (n = 6), hyper-IgM syndrome (n = 4), Chediak-Higashi syndrome (n = 3), Kostmann syndrome (n = 3), and others (n = 5). Fifty-two donor-patient pairs were fully matched at HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DRB1 alleles. The remaining 24 patients received allele-mismatched grafts (20 matched at 5 of 6 loci and 4 matched at 4 of 6 loci). Engraftment occurred in 82.4% of the MD group and 90.7% of the other genetic disease (OGD) group; however, 14 patients (18.2%) experienced either early or late graft failure. The cumulative incidence of grade II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 35.5% - 9.8% in the MD group and 47.3% - 9.5% in the OGD group, and the rate of chronic GVHD was 20% in both groups. Forty-nine patients have survived for 3 to 96 months (median, 20 months). The probabilities of 5-year overall survival and event-free survival were 72.6% - 11.5% and 65.3% - 8.6%, respectively, for MD (n = 35) and 72.5% - 7.3% and 63.6% - 7.3% for OGD (n = 46). Although patient status before BMT and the occurrence of grade III to IV acute GVHD significantly affected outcome, unrelated BMT is a curative therapeutic option for children with congenital genetic diseases who have no HLA-matched family donors.",

The presence of a small percentage of donor neutrophils has resulted in normal development and no increased incidence of infections.
