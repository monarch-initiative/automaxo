input_text: Survey-Based Study on Food Insecurity During COVID-19 for Households With
  Children on a Prescribed Gluten-Free Diet. Gluten-free (GF) foods are generally
  costlier than their gluten-containing counterparts. We conducted an anonymous electronic
  survey to assess food insecurity in households with a child on a prescribed GF diet
  and how this relates to GF diet adherence during the COVID-19 pandemic. The proportion
  of households who screened positive using the Hunger Vital Sign was similar to national
  rates (19%-24%). Approximately 5% of families who screened food secure reported
  GF food insecurity. Parent-reported intentional gluten consumption due to limited
  GF food availability in the household increased during the pandemic (7.5%). Food
  insecurity should be considered in the management of celiac disease.
