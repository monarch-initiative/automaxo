input_text: New Software for Gluten-Free Diet Evaluation and Nutritional Education.
  Following a gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only treatment for celiac disease. This
  diet must ensure the absence of gluten but also needs to be nutritionally balanced.
  Dietitians working in this field cannot properly evaluate energy and nutrient intake
  of celiac people because dietary programs available on the market do not contain
  the nutritional composition of gluten-free products (GFP). Here we present a new
  GFD evaluation software that contains more than 700 gluten-free rendered foodstuffs
  and their macronutrient composition. Apart from diet evaluation and design, the
  software represents a tool for nutritional education as well, since it shows diet
  appropriacy and indicates how to promote balanced self-care. Moreover, anthropometric
  and biochemical data or symptoms presence and diet adherence can be recorded and
  evaluated. This open free software, can be downloaded in its app format for mobiles
  and tablets. Software evaluation indicated its correct functionality and the importance
  of assessing a GFD with GFP instead of with their gluten-containing analogues. Thus,
  this software represents an essential e-Health tool, not only for proper GFD evaluation,
  but also for improving life quality of celiac and gluten sensitive people.
