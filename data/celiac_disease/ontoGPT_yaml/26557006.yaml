input_text: 'Role of oats in celiac disease. A gluten-free diet is currently the only
  effective means of treating individuals with celiac disease. Such a diet enables
  celiac patients to control their symptoms and avoid various complications associated
  with this condition. However, while the quality of gluten-free foods has significantly
  improved during recent decades, maintenance of a gluten-free diet does not necessarily
  ensure adequate nutritional intake. Because oats are an important source of proteins,
  lipids, vitamins, minerals, and fibre, their inclusion in a gluten-free diet might
  improve the nutritional status of a celiac patient. Although oats are included in
  the list of gluten-free ingredients specified in European regulations, their safety
  when consumed by celiac patients remains debatable. Some studies claim that pure
  oats are safe for most celiac people, and contamination with other cereal sources
  is the main problem facing people with this disease. However, it is necessary to
  consider that oats include many varieties, containing various amino acid sequences
  and showing different immunoreactivities associated with toxic prolamins. As a result,
  several studies have shown that the immunogenicity of oats varies depending on the
  cultivar consumed. Thus, it is essential to thoroughly study the variety of oats
  used in a food ingredient before including it in a gluten-free diet. '
