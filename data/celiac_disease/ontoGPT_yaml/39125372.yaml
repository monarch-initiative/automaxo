input_text: "Compliance and Attitudes towards the Gluten-Free Diet in Celiac Patients
  in Italy: What Has Changed after a Decade? This study aims were (i) to describe
  Italian celiac patients who agreed to participate in the latest web survey and their
  attitudes toward the GF diet (compliance, perceived limitations, and worries) and
  (ii) to compare the answers given by the 2011 and 2022 responders. The self-administered
  questionnaire was distributed through the Italian Coeliac Association channels (link
  on social media, websites, and newsletters) to all of the celiac patients willing
  to participate in 2011 and 2022 (2427 and 3529 responders who answered the same
  questions, respectively). Descriptive analyses and the Pearson's chi-squared test
  were performed. The responders were 1 to 84 years old and mainly female. The prevalence
  of adherent patients in 2022 was 91%, with the highest value (94%) in children (<=10
  years old) and adolescents (15-17 years old). Overall, young adults were the most
  worried group. About a decade after the first survey, we observed a decreasing prevalence
  of transgression events (-5%) and (at least) occasional temptation (-17%), a decreasing
  prevalence of health-related and general worries, but an increasing prevalence of
  social life withdrawal. In conclusion, it is important to periodically monitor celiac
  patients' compliance and attitudes towards the gluten-free diet. As also highlighted
  in international guidelines, a reorganization of the diagnosis/follow-up visits,
  including an expert dietary consultation, is needed."
