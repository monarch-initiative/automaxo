input_text: Immune response to vaccines in children with celiac disease. Celiac disease
  (CD) is an immune-mediated systemic condition evoked by ingestion of gluten and
  related prolamines in genetically susceptible subjects. The disease is featured
  by a variable combination of clinical signs, specific antibodies, HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8
  haplotypes, and enteropathy. Vaccination is the most potent intervention for infectious
  disease prevention. Several factors including age, gender, ethnicity, quality and
  quantity of vaccine antigen, doses, and route of administration can influence immune
  response to vaccination, although the main cause of variation in the responsiveness
  among vaccine recipients is host genetic variability. The HLA system has a fundamental
  role in identifying the antigens introduced into the host with the vaccines and
  in the development of specific antibodies, and some HLA phenotypes have been associated
  with a less effective immunological response. The available literature indicates
  that the immunological response to vaccines in CD children does not differ markedly
  from that of general population and antibody titres are high enough to provide long-term
  protection, except for hepatitis B virus vaccine. In this article, we review and
  discuss the scarce literature in this field in order to provide clinical practice
  guidelines to achieve the most efficient monitoring of the response to vaccines
  in pediatric CD patients.
