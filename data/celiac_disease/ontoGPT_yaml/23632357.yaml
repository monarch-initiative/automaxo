input_text: 'Human leukocyte antigen genetics and clinical features of self-treated
  patients on a gluten-free diet. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Increasingly, people start
  a gluten-free diet (GFD) without a clear celiac disease (CD) diagnosis. Human leukocyte
  antigen (HLA) genotyping is useful in ruling out CD in patients with equivocal results
  of serologic testing or small-bowel biopsy (SBB), but its utility and the clinical
  features of patients on self-treated GFD (ST-GFD) are largely unknown. METHODS:
  Retrospective study of single tertiary care center cohort compared 137 patients
  on ST-GFD and 443 patients with well-defined CD. We compared HLA genotype, symptoms,
  serologic and SBB results, and response to GFD between the 2 groups. Analysis used
  univariate logistic regression modeling, adjusted for age and sex. RESULTS: Patients
  with ST-GFD presented more often with diarrhea (P<0.001), abdominal distention (P<0.001),
  flatulence (P=0.002), cramping (P=0.02), itchy skin (P=0.02), oral inflammation
  (P=0.04), and constipation (P=0.01) and less often with anemia (P<0.001) or malaise
  (P=0.02) than CD patients. In addition, 41% did not carry DQ2.5 and DQ8 versus 6%
  of CD patients (P<0.001). Only 2% of ST-GFD patients had SBB clearly consistent
  with CD. Family history of CD showed no difference between groups (P=0.77). Although
  CD patients had a statistically higher rate of GFD benefit, both groups had a high
  responsiveness rate (98% vs. 94%; P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: HLA genotyping is useful
  in evaluating patients on an ST-GFD. Although confirmed CD is rare in self-treated
  patients, most still report benefit from GFD regardless of DQ2 and DQ8 status. Nonceliac
  gluten sensitivity may play a role.'
