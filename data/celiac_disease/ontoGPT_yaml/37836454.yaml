input_text: Gluten-Free Product Recalls and Their Impact on Consumer Trust. The range
  of gluten-free food products available to consumers is steadily expanding. In recent
  years, recalls of food products have highlighted the importance of accurate labeling
  of food products for the presence of wheat, other gluten-containing cereals, or
  gluten itself as refined ingredient. The purpose of this study was to gain more
  insights into recent food recalls related to undeclared gluten/wheat contamination
  and consumer experiences with these recalls. Recalls of products triggered by gluten
  contamination are relatively scarce and are not often triggered by a consumer complaint.
  The impact of these recalls on consumer trust was evaluated through an online survey
  that was distributed among supporters of Celiac Canada (CCA) and covered (i) strategies
  to adhere to a gluten-free diet, (ii) experiences with gluten-free recalls and their
  impact on consumer trust, and (iii) demographic information. Consumer concern regarding
  gluten-free product recalls is significant, but the concern regarding recalls is
  not heightened after experiencing a recall. Companies pursuing transparency in the
  process, identification of the source of contamination, and mitigation strategies
  going forward are likely to retain consumer trust in their product and brand. Based
  on the survey results, further efforts focusing on consumer education regarding
  interpreting nutrient labels, identifying sources of information on product recalls,
  and understanding procedures to follow upon suspected gluten contamination of a
  gluten-free product are recommended.
