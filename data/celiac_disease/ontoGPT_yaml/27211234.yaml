input_text: 'Gluten free diet and nutrient deficiencies: A review. BACKGROUND & AIMS:
  The only available treatment for celiac disease (CD) is lifelong adherence to gluten
  free (GF)-diet. However, GF-diet may lead to possible nutrient unbalance resulting
  in improper nutritional quality of diet. The aim of this study is to evaluate the
  nutritional quality of GF-diet. METHODS: MEDLINE /PubMed and Cochrane Library were
  electronically searched for articles published between 1990/01/01 and 2015/09/01.
  RESULTS: GF-diet was found to be poor in alimentary fiber due in particular to the
  necessary avoidance of several kinds of foods naturally rich in fiber (i.e. grain)
  and the low content of fiber of GF product that are usually made with starches and/or
  refined flours. Micronutrients are also found to be poor, in particular Vit. D,
  Vit. B12 and folate, in addition to some minerals such as iron, zinc, magnesium
  and calcium. Moreover, an inadequate macronutrient intake was reported related above
  all to the focus on the avoidance of gluten that often leaving back the importance
  of nutritional quality of the choice. In particular, it was found a higher content
  of both saturated and hydrogenated fatty acids and an increase in the glycemic index
  and glycemic load of the meal. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the GF-diet is necessary in
  celiac disease treatment and the attention is on gluten avoidance, the evaluation
  of nutritional quality of the diet must be considered. Moreover, educational strategies
  based on the relationship between nutrients and food and human health could be developed
  to optimize the therapeutic approach in celiac patients.'
