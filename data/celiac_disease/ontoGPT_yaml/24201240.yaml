input_text: 'Long-term consumption of oats in adult celiac disease patients. Many
  celiac disease patients tolerate oats, but limited data are available on its long-term
  consumption. This was evaluated in the present study, focusing on small-bowel mucosal
  histology and gastrointestinal symptoms in celiac adults maintaining a strict gluten-free
  diet with or without oats. Altogether 106 long-term treated celiac adults were enrolled
  for this cross-sectional follow-up study. Daily consumption of oats and fiber was
  assessed, and small-bowel mucosal morphology and densities of CD3+, alphabeta+ and
  gammasigma+ intraepithelial lymphocytes determined. Gastrointestinal symptoms were
  assessed by a validated Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale questionnaire. Seventy
  (66%) out of the 106 treated celiac disease patients had consumed a median of 20
  g of oats (range 1-100 g) per day for up to eight years; all consumed oat products
  bought from general stores. Daily intake and long-term consumption of oats did not
  result in small-bowel mucosal villous damage, inflammation, or gastrointestinal
  symptoms. Oat-consumers had a significantly higher daily intake of fiber than those
  who did not use oats. Two thirds of celiac disease patients preferred to use oats
  in their daily diet. Even long-term ingestion of oats had no harmful effects. '
