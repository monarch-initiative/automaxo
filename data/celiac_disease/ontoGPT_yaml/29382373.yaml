input_text: 'Refeeding syndrome in adults with celiac crisis: a case report. BACKGROUND:
  Refeeding syndrome is a rare and life-threatening pathology with polyvisceral manifestations
  occurring in severely malnourished patients. It is rarely described in adults with
  celiac disease. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 28-year-old Tunisian
  woman followed up for celiac disease, who did not adhere to the gluten-free diet.
  She presented to our hospital with celiac crisis manifested by severe diarrhea,
  and metabolic and electrolyte disturbances. The treatment of electrolyte abnormalities,
  hydration, and nutritional support was marked by the occurrence on the fifth day
  of refeeding syndrome with psychomotor agitation followed by respiratory distress
  and a state of cardiogenic shock. CONCLUSIONS: Refeeding syndrome is still under-recognized.
  It should be systematically prevented for high-risk patients. Nutritional support
  in patients with celiac crisis should be monitored carefully since the risk of refeeding
  syndrome is very high with a poor prognosis.'
