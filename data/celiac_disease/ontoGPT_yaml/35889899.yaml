input_text: 'Hepatic Steatosis in Patients with Celiac Disease: The Role of Packaged
  Gluten-Free Foods. Background: An increased risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
  (NAFLD) in patients with celiac disease (CD) adhering to a gluten-free diet (GFD)
  was recently reported. The nutritional composition of packaged gluten-free foods
  (PGFF) has been proposed as a possible cause. This hypothesis has not been investigated
  further, since a systematic structural nutritional interview for all patients would
  be problematic in clinical practice. Methods: We administered a simple questionnaire
  based on a Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value (RFM) analysis (a cornerstone
  of direct marketing segmentation) to consecutive CD patients on a GFD for >6 months
  and verified its association with NAFLD. Subgroup analyses were performed to understand
  whether specific patterns of PGFF consumption were significantly associated with
  NAFLD. Results: Amongst 147 patients (female 82%, median age 42 years), 45 (30.6%)
  had NAFLD. Total RFM score (adjusted odds ratio = 1.223, 95% CI: 1.059-1.413, p
  = 0.006), body mass index, and total cholesterol and triglycerides were independently
  related to NAFLD, and "Bread and bakery" (p = 0.002), "salty convenience" (p = 0.005),
  and "sweet convenience" (p = 0.049) products were significantly related with NAFLD.
  Also, questions about the number of purchased PGFF in the last month (monetary value)
  and different categories of PGFF consumed in the last week (recency) were particularly
  able to identify NAFLD patients. Conclusions: The specific GFD dietary habits of
  CD patients were correlated with the degree of risk of NAFLD. Information was obtained
  through a questionnaire which could be used in clinical practice to favor a patient-tailored
  approach and in future studies to verify the reproducibility of our results in different
  geographical areas.'
