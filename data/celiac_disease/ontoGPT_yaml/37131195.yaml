input_text: 'Clinical features, treatment, and outcomes of celiac-associated arthritis:
  a retrospective cohort study. BACKGROUND: Although arthritis is recognized as an
  extra-intestinal manifestation of celiac disease, little is known about the clinical
  course and outcomes of pediatric celiac-associated arthritis. This study describes
  clinical characteristics, treatments, and outcomes of children with celiac-associated
  arthritis. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of children with celiac
  disease seen in pediatric rheumatology clinic between 2004 and 2021 for joint complaints.
  Data was abstracted from electronic health records. Patient demographics and clinical
  manifestations were evaluated using standard descriptive statistics. Physician-
  and patient-reported outcomes were evaluated at the index visit, 6-month follow-up,
  and last recorded visit, and were compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. RESULTS:
  Twenty-nine patients with celiac disease were evaluated for joint complaints, and
  13 were diagnosed with arthritis. Their mean age was 8.9 years (SD 5.9), and 61.5%
  were female. Celiac disease diagnosis was made before arthritis diagnosis in only
  2 cases (15.4%). Initial testing that led to the celiac disease diagnosis was obtained
  by the rheumatologist in 6 cases (46.2%). Only 8 patients (61.5%) had concomitant
  GI symptoms, and of these, 3 patients had BMI z-scores <-1.64 and 1 had impaired
  linear growth. Arthritis presentation was most often oligoarticular (76.9%) and
  asymmetric (84.6%). Most cases required systemic therapy (n = 11, 84.6%) with DMARDs,
  biologics, or both. Of the 10 patients who required systemic therapy and reported
  compliance with the gluten-free diet, 3 (30%) were able to stop systemic medications.
  Two of 3 patients who cleared celiac serologies came off systemic medications. Statistically
  significant improvement was noted in the number of joints involved (p = 0.02) and
  physician global assessment of disease activity (p = 0.03) between the index and
  final visit. CONCLUSIONS: Rheumatologists play an important role in the identification
  of celiac disease, as arthritis was the presenting symptom in most cases and was
  not always associated with GI symptoms or poor growth. The arthritis was most often
  oligoarticular and asymmetric. Most children required systemic therapy. The gluten-free
  diet may not be sufficient to manage arthritis, but antibody clearance may be an
  indicator of higher likelihood of disease control off medications. Outcomes are
  promising with a combination of diet and medical therapy.'
