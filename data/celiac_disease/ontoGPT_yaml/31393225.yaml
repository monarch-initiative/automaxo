input_text: 'Insights in the Evaluation of Gluten Dietary Avoidance in Healthy Subjects.
  Background: The amount of healthy subjects adopting a gluten-free diet (GFD) for
  nonmedical reasons actually surpasses the numbers of those who are dealing with
  a permanent gluten-related disorder.Objective: The study aimed to better clarify
  the interactions between a GFD and physical and psychological well-being.Methods:
  Sixty healthy subjects with normal weight were enrolled. Thirty subjects (15 female)
  were submitted to a normocaloric GFD and considered as the experimental group (EG),
  and 30 subjects (15 female) were submitted to a normocaloric diet (CG) for 6 months.
  The hematochemical and psychological parameters before and after the diet were recorded.Results:
  Significant improvement was demonstrated in red blood count, hemoglobin, total cholesterol,
  and high-density lipoprotein parameters in the EG after the gluten-free diet. However,
  a significant increase of alpha-amylase pancreatic activity and reduction of vitamin
  B12 and magnesium levels in the EG were observed. Regarding the psychological parameters,
  the GFD significantly improved scores assessing body satisfaction, but increased
  social insecurity.Conclusions: The study is the first to consider significant modulation
  in hematochemical parameters as well as psychological ones by gluten avoidance in
  healthy individuals. Although these subjects were not characterized by intestinal
  mucosa damage, some of the effects were similar to those observed in celiac disease
  patients who began to adhere to a GFD.'
