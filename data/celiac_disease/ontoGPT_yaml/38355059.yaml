input_text: 'A look into the future: Are we ready for an approved therapy in celiac
  disease? As it appears that we are currently at the cusp of an era in which drugs
  that are new, re-purposed or as "supplements", will be introduced to the management
  of celiac disease, we need to reflect if the framework is set for celiac disease
  to be increasingly treated by pharmaceuticals as well as diet. This refers to reflecting
  on the rigor of current diagnostic practices, the limitations of the current standard
  of care that is gluten-free diet, and that we lack objective markers of disease
  severity. Interrogating these issues will help us to identify gaps in technology
  and practices that could be critical for selecting patients with a well-defined
  need for an improved or alternative treatment. Both aspects, circumscribed limitations
  of the gluten-free diet and diagnostics helping to define celiac disease target
  groups, together with the guiding requirements by the responsible regulatory authorities
  will contribute to defining the subgroups of patients with confirmed celiac disease
  eligible for distinct pharmacological strategies. Because many celiac disease patients
  are diagnosed in childhood, these aspects need to be differentially discussed for
  the pediatric setting. In this perspective, we aim to describe these contextual
  issues and then look ahead to the future. What might be the major challenges in
  celiac disease clinics in the coming years once drugs are an option alongside the
  diet? And what will be future objectives for researchers who further decipher the
  mucosal immunology of celiac disease? Speculating on the answers to these questions
  is as stimulating as it is fascinating to be part of this turning point.'
