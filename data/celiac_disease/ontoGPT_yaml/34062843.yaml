input_text: 'Intracortical and Intercortical Motor Disinhibition to Transcranial Magnetic
  Stimulation in Newly Diagnosed Celiac Disease Patients. BACKGROUND: Celiac disease
  (CD) may present or be complicated by neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations.
  Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) probes brain excitability non-invasively,
  also preclinically. We previously demonstrated an intracortical motor disinhibition
  and hyperfacilitation in de novo CD patients, which revert back after a long-term
  gluten-free diet (GFD). In this cross-sectional study, we explored the interhemispheric
  excitability by transcallosal inhibition, which has never been investigated in CD.
  METHODS: A total of 15 right-handed de novo, neurologically asymptomatic, CD patients
  and 15 age-matched healthy controls were screened for cognitive and depressive symptoms
  to the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the 17-item Hamilton Depression
  Rating Scale (HDRS), respectively. TMS consisted of resting motor threshold, amplitude,
  latency, and duration of the motor evoked potentials, duration and latency of the
  contralateral silent period (cSP). Transcallosal inhibition was evaluated as duration
  and latency of the ipsilateral silent period (iSP). RESULTS: MoCA and HDRS scored
  significantly worse in patients. The iSP and cSP were significantly shorter in duration
  in patients, with a positive correlation between the MoCA and iSP. CONCLUSIONS:
  An intracortical and interhemispheric motor disinhibition was observed in CD, suggesting
  the involvement of GABA-mediated cortical and callosal circuitries. Further studies
  correlating clinical, TMS, and neuroimaging data are needed.'
