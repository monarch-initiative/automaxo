input_text: 'Pharmacological approaches in celiac disease. Celiac disease is an autoimmune
  enteropathy triggered by the ingestion of gluten, characterized by immune responses
  toward gluten constituents and the autoantigen transglutaminase 2. The only current
  treatment available for celiac disease is a gluten-free diet, however there are
  a plethora of therapies in development for the treatment of celiac disease (e.g.
  vaccine), management of symptoms while consuming gluten (e.g. Necator americanus)
  or adjuvant therapies in conjunction with the gluten-free diet (e.g. larazotide
  acetate). Current approaches in development target barrier function, immune responses,
  detoxifying gluten or sequestering gluten. Developing therapies include those targeting
  environmental factors, such as the microbiota or proteases. '
