input_text: Evidence-Based and Emerging Diet Recommendations for Small Bowel Disorders.
  Diet plays a key role in the manifestation and severity of gastrointestinal symptoms,
  with increasing research interest on the role of diet in small bowel disorders.
  There are predominantly 3 small bowel conditions that have potential dietary interventions.
  Self-reported nonceliac gluten/wheat sensitivity is prevalent. Although gluten is
  believed to be a potential trigger for symptoms, other components of wheat may also
  be triggers, including fructans, alpha-amylase trypsin inhibitors, and wheat germ
  agglutinins. The diagnosis can be challenging, given the lack of validated biomarkers.
  A gluten-free diet that excludes the abovementioned triggers is the cornerstone
  of treatment; however, unlike celiac disease, there is uncertainty about the level
  of adherence or whether the gluten-free diet is a lifelong intervention. Several
  primary gastrointestinal disorders are associated with an increase in inflammatory
  cells including eosinophils. Diet seems to be an important driver of disease pathogenesis
  in eosinophilic gastroenteritis, with elimination and elemental diets showing promise
  in management, with further robust trials required. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth
  is an example of microbial dysbiosis, with renewed interest in diet being postulated
  to cause an adaptive change of the microbes colonizing the small intestine. However,
  the diagnosis of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is limited by a lack of sensitive
  and specific tests, with significant knowledge gaps in relation to therapeutic measures
  to manage and cure small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Currently, antimicrobials
  are the established management option. There have been significant clinical advances
  in dietary interventions related to the small bowel, but this area is currently
  a novel and advancing field for both patients and clinicians.
