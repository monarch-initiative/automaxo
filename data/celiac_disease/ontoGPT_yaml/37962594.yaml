input_text: '[What is established in the management of celiac disease?] Nowadays,
  celiac disease is well-established in internal medicine as an autoimmune disease
  induced by gluten as a trigger. Undoubtedly similarly well-established is the gluten-free
  diet. It is the only recognized therapy for celiac disease to date. However, this
  presents some pitfalls in its implementation, which will be discussed in the following
  review. In addition, current developments that have the potential to significantly
  change both diagnosis and treatment of celiac disease are discussed. On the one
  hand, such an outlook was chosen since colleagues want to be "ready" when such developments
  are integrated into daily clinical routine. On the other hand, the realization that
  the field of mucosal immunology is moving forward has the potential to lift the
  spirits of the reader.'
