input_text: Diagnosis and Treatment Patterns in Celiac Disease. Celiac disease (CD)
  is an immune-mediated gastrointestinal (GI) disorder driven by innate and adaptive
  immune responses to gluten. Presentation of CD has changed over time, with non-GI
  symptoms, such as anemia and osteoporosis, presenting more commonly. With improved
  screening and diagnostic methods, the reported prevalence of CD has increased globally,
  and there is considerable global variation in diagnostic and treatment practices.
  The objective of this study was to describe the current state of CD diagnosis and
  treatment patterns. A targeted review of literature from MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane
  Library, and screening of relevant conference abstracts was performed. The generally
  recommended diagnostic approach is GI endoscopy with small bowel biopsy; however,
  in selected patients, biopsy may be avoided and diagnosis based on positive serology
  and clinical symptoms. Diagnosis often is delayed; the average diagnostic delay
  after symptom onset is highly variable and can last up to 12 years. Barriers to
  accurate and timely diagnosis include atypical presentation, lack of physician awareness
  about current diagnostic criteria, misdiagnosis, and limited access to specialists.
  Currently, strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only recommended
  treatment, which is not successful in all patients. Only one-third of patients are
  monitored regularly following diagnosis. Unmet needs for CD include improvements
  in the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis, and the development of treatments for
  both refractory CD and GFD nonresponsive CD. Further research should investigate
  the impact of education about gluten-free eating and the availability of gluten-free
  foods support adherence and improve outcomes in patients with CD.
