input_text: 'The effect of gluten-free diet among celiac patients aged 3-12 years
  old on BMI during 2006 to 2014 at Nemazee Teaching hospital. INTRODUCTION: Celiac
  disease (CD) is increasingly diagnosed and weight changes are common after adoption
  of a glutenfree diet (GFD) and there is concern that patients might gain further
  weight on a GFD. OBJECTIVES: This study examined to evaluate the impact of a GFD
  on the body mass index (BMI), whether favorable or unfavorable. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
  In this retrospective study, we reviewed electronic records of 44 patients with
  serologic study and intestinal biopsy confirmed CD who was visited in Nemazee hospital,
  Shiraz. All patients were put on GFD for 2 years and followed closely by pediatric
  gastroenterologist. BMIs were categories to four group underweight, normal weight,
  overweight and obese. Initial BMI and follow-up BMI was comparing together and also
  compared with general population. RESULT: At diagnosis, 27.27% of subjects were
  underweight, 63.64% normal and 9.09% were obese. On a GFD, 66.66% of underweight
  patients gained weight and became normal weight and 25% of normal weight and 75%
  of obese patients had increase weight; and the rest of the patients, BMI remained
  stable. The follow-up BMIs were statistically higher than initial BMIs (mean 17.17
  vs. 15.62, p <0.0001). CONCLUSION: Individuals with celiac disease have lower BMI
  than the regional population at diagnosis. On the GFD, BMI is increased significantly
  in all categories.'
