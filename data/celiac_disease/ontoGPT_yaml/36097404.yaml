input_text: Anti-inflammatory effects of vagal nerve stimulation with a special attention
  to intestinal barrier dysfunction. The vagus nerve (VN), the longest nerve of the
  organism innervating the gastrointestinal tract, is a mixed nerve with anti-inflammatory
  properties through its afferents, activating the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal
  axis, and its efferents through the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway inhibiting
  the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNFalpha) by splenic and gut macrophages.
  In addition, the VN is also able to modulate the permeability of the intestinal
  barrier although the VN does not innervate directly the intestinal epithelium. Targeting
  the VN through VN stimulation (VNS) has been developed in experimental model of
  intestinal inflammation and in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and might be of
  interest to decrease intestinal permeability in gastrointestinal disorders with
  intestinal barrier defect such as IBD, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and celiac
  disease. In this issue of neurogastroenterology and motility, Mogilevski et al.
  report that a brief non-invasive transcutaneous auricular VNS in healthy volunteers
  consistently reduces the permeability of the small intestine induced by intravenous
  administration of the stress peptide corticotropin releasing hormone, known to increase
  intestinal permeability and to inhibit the VN. In this review, we outline the mechanistic
  underpinning the effect of stress, of the VN and VNS on intestinal permeability.
  In particular, the VN can act on intestinal permeability through enteric nerves,
  and/or cells such as enteric glial cells. We also review the existing evidence of
  the effects VNS on intestinal permeability in models such as burn intestinal injury
  and traumatic brain injury, which pave the way for future clinical trials in IBD,
  IBS, and celiac disease.
