input_text: "Phenotype and Clinical Course of Inflammatory Bowel Disease With Co-existent
  Celiac Disease. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammatory bowel diseases, principally Crohn's
  disease and ulcerative colitis, and celiac disease are among the most common immune-mediated
  gastrointestinal diseases. We aim to elucidate the clinical course and outcomes
  of patients with concomitant inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease, a unique
  population that remains scarcely studied to date. METHODS: A retrospective matched
  case-control study of adults with co-existent inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] and
  celiac disease was performed at a tertiary referral institution in North America.
  Logistic regression and Kaplan-Meier curves compared disease characteristics and
  clinical outcomes of the two groups. RESULTS: A total of 342 inflammatory bowel
  disease patients were included in this study, of whom 114 had co-existent celiac
  disease and 228 did not. Patients with co-existent inflammatory bowel disease and
  celiac disease had higher rates of primary sclerosing cholangitis [19.3% vs 5.7%;
  odds ratio, 4.4; 95% confidence interval, 2.1-9.4; p <0.001], extensive ulcerative
  colitis [78.1% vs 59.0%; odds ratio, 2.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-5.5; p =0.002],
  and family history of celiac disease [10.5% vs 3.5%; odds ratio 3.2; 95% confidence
  interval, 1.3-8.2; p =0.01], compared with patients without concomitant celiac disease.
  CONCLUSIONS: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease with concomitant celiac disease
  have unique phenotypic features compared with non-celiac inflammatory bowel disease,
  with higher risks for colitis-related hospitalisations, extensive colitis, and primary
  sclerosing cholangitis. Increased recognition of co-existent IBD and celiac disease
  can prompt clinicians to investigate for concomitant disease sooner, particularly
  in patients with seemingly refractory disease."
