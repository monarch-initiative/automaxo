input_text: 'Relationship between Persistent Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Duodenal
  Histological Findings after Adequate Gluten-Free Diet: A Gray Area of Celiac Disease
  Management in Adult Patients. A gluten-free diet (GFD) leads to a rapid improvement
  in gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, biochemical alterations and duodenal histological
  damage in the majority of celiac disease (CD) patients. This study aimed to assess
  the frequency and factors associated with the persistence of GI symptoms/malabsorption
  signs and their relationship with duodenal histological findings among CD patients
  on an adequate GFD (mean duration 16 months, range 12-28 months). This longitudinal
  cohort study included 102 adult CD patients (median age 38.5 years, range 18-76
  years, F = 71.6%) diagnosed between 2012 and 2018. A total of 36.3% of the included
  patients had persistent GI symptoms and/or malabsorption signs (Group 1), while
  the remaining patients had complete GI well-being without malabsorption signs (Group
  2) at the time of histological re-evaluation. The persistence of GI symptoms/signs
  was associated with a long duration of symptoms/signs before CD diagnosis (>=5 years)
  (OR 5.3; 95% CI 1.3-21.8) and the presence of constipation at the time of CD diagnosis
  (OR 7.5; 95% CI 1.3-42) while for other variables, including age at CD diagnosis,
  sex, duration of GFD, comorbidities, CD serology positivity and severity of duodenal
  damage at histological re-evaluation, no association was found. According to our
  results, the persistence of symptoms/signs is not associated with histological findings,
  and their relationship could be a gray area in CD management.'
