input_text: 'Rate and determinants of non-adherence to a gluten-free diet and nutritional
  status assessment in children and adolescents with celiac disease in a tertiary
  Brazilian referral center: a cross-sectional and retrospective study. BACKGROUND:
  Compliance with a gluten-free diet (GFD) is difficult at all ages but particularly
  for teenagers due to social, cultural, economic, and practical pressures. The multidisciplinary
  team responsible for the treatment of patients with celiac disease and give support
  to their parents plays a special role on strengthening GFD and assessing the nutritional
  and physical health. METHODS: A cross-sectional and retrospective study including
  patients under 20 years of age, with biopsy-confirmed CD, followed regularly at
  the Department of Pediatrics, Division of Gastroenterology, Hospital das Clinicas,
  University of Sao Paulo, School of Medicine, Sao Paulo, Brazil, were surveyed using
  a questionnaire and serologic test applied between November 2011 and February 2012.
  A retrospective chart review of these patients was performed to collect the anthropometric
  data along with the results of the serologic test performed at the time of diagnosis
  and after at least 1 year of treatment with a GFD. RESULTS: We evaluated 35 patients
  aged between 2.4 and 19.9 years. Of these 68.6% were female, 88.6% had the typical
  form of the disease and 51.4% had other comorbidities. The mean age at diagnosis
  was 5.4 years. Despite dietary guidance, 20% reported non-adherence to the diet.
  Most children recovered the weight and height deficit after 5 years of treatment,
  and in some children, excessive weight gain became a concern. CONCLUSION: The majority
  of transgressions occurred intentionally at home or at parties. There was a risk
  of excessive weight gain, especially in the first two years of treatment. More alternatives
  and easier access to low cost gluten-free foods, increasing the discussion about
  the benefits of adhering to a GFD among patients, families, and the general population,
  besides the acquisition of self-management skills, are crucial to fostering independent
  children and adolescents who have the knowledge and tools to manage life with CD.'
