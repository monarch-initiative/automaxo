input_text: "When your patient's parent asks: \"My child's alopecia areata is not
  getting better. Should he or she get tested for celiac disease?\" The relationship
  between alopecia areata and celiac disease has been suspected for more than 20 years.
  For a particular individual with alopecia areata, the risk of coexisting celiac
  disease and the potential benefit of a gluten-free diet on hair loss or regrowth
  is known. Despite this limited information, patients often aske dermatologists whether
  they should undergo celiac disease testing or begin a gluten-free diet. We reviewed
  all available studies of the relationship between alopecia areata and celiac disease
  to provide guidance to practicing clinicians."
