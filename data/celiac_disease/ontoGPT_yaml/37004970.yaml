input_text: "Effectiveness of Hepatitis B Vaccination for Patients With Inflammatory
  Bowel and Celiac Disease. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Guidelines recommend measuring antibody
  (Ab) titers to hepatitis B virus (HBV) after vaccination for patients with inflammatory
  bowel disease (IBD) or celiac disease (CD) (\"IBD/CD patients\") and revaccinating
  when titers are low. Few data, however, support this recommendation. We aimed to
  compare effectiveness of HBV vaccination (immunity and infection rates) for IBD/CD
  patients vs matched referents. METHODS: Using the Rochester Epidemiology Project,
  we performed a retrospective cohort study of patients first diagnosed with IBD/CD
  (index date) while residing in Olmsted County, Minnesota, from January 1, 2000,
  through December 31, 2019. HBV screening results were obtained from health records.
  RESULTS: In 1,264 incident cases of IBD/CD, only 6 HBV infections were diagnosed
  before the index date. A total of 351 IBD/CD cases had documented receipt of 2 or
  more HBV vaccines before their index date and had hepatitis B surface antigen Ab
  (anti-HBs) titers measured after their index date. The proportion of patients with
  HBV-protective titers (>=10 mIU/mL) decreased with time before plateauing, with
  protective-titer rates of 45% at 5 up to 10 years and 41% at 15 up to 20 years after
  the last HBV vaccination. The proportion of referents with protective titers also
  decreased with time and was consistently higher than IBD/CD patients' levels within
  15 years after the last HBV vaccination. However, no new HBV infection developed
  in any of 1,258 IBD/CD patients during a median follow-up of 9.4 (IQR, 5.0-14.1)
  years. CONCLUSIONS: Routine testing of anti-HBs titers may not be indicated for
  fully vaccinated IBD/CD patients. Additional studies are needed to confirm these
  findings in other settings and populations."
