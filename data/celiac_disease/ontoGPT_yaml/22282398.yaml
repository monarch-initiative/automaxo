input_text: 'In vitro models for gluten toxicity: relevance for celiac disease pathogenesis
  and development of novel treatment options. In genetically predisposed individuals,
  dietary gluten in wheat, rye and barley triggers celiac disease, a systemic autoimmune
  disorder hallmarked by an extensive small-bowel mucosal immune response. The current
  conception of celiac disease pathogenesis is that it involves components of both
  innate and adaptive immunity whose activation typically leads to small-bowel villous
  atrophy with crypt hyperplasia. Currently, the only effective treatment for celiac
  disease is a strict lifelong gluten-free diet excluding all wheat-, rye- and barley-containing
  food products. During the diet, the clinical symptoms improve and the small-bowel
  mucosal damage recovers, while re-introduction of gluten into the diet leads to
  re-appearance of the symptoms and deterioration of the small-bowel mucosal architecture.
  In view of the restricted nature of the diet, alternative treatment is warranted.
  Improved understanding of the molecular basis of celiac disease has enabled researchers
  to suggest other therapeutic approaches. Although there is no animal model reproducing
  all features of celiac disease, the use of in vitro approaches including a variety
  of cell lines and the celiac patient small-bowel mucosal biopsy organ culture has
  generated knowledge about pathogenesis of celiac disease. In these culture systems,
  gluten induces different effects that can be quantified, thus also enabling studies
  concerning the efficacy of candidate therapeutic compounds for celiac disease. This
  review describes the intestinal epithelial cell models, celiac patient T-cell lines
  and clones, as well as the small-bowel mucosal organ culture methods widely used
  in studies of celiac disease, and summarizes the major findings obtained with these
  systems.'
