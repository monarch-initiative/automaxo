input_text: 'The Long-Term Consumption of Oats in Celiac Disease Patients Is Safe:
  A Large Cross-Sectional Study. A strict gluten-free diet (GFD) can be diversified
  by non-contaminated oats, but there is a shortage of long-term studies concerning
  its safety. We compared long-term treatment outcomes and factors associated with
  the introduction of oats between celiac patients on a GFD with or without oats.
  Eight hundred sixty-nine previously diagnosed celiac patients were interviewed.
  The validated Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS), Psychological General
  Well-Being (PGWB), and Short-Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaires were used
  to assess symptoms and quality of life, serological tests were performed, and results
  of histology were confirmed from patient records. We found the median duration of
  GFD to be 10 years and 82% using oats. Factors predicting the consumption of oats
  were diagnosis after the year 2000, advice from a dietitian, detection by screening,
  and mild clinical presentation. Oat consumers and non-consumers did not differ in
  dietary adherence (96.5% vs. 97.4%, p = 0.746), the prevalence of symptoms (22.9%
  vs. 22.5%, p = 0.931), positivity for endomysial antibodies (8.8% vs. 6.0%, p =
  0.237), histological recovery after one year (63.1% vs. 60.0%, p = 0.773), malignancy
  (4.8% vs. 3.3%, p = 0.420), osteoporosis/osteopenia (9.2% vs. 11.0%, p = 0.489),
  or fractures (26.9% vs. 27.9%, p = 0.791). The oat consumers had better SF-36 physical
  role limitations and general health scores. Based on our results, the long-term
  consumption of oats in celiac disease patients is safe and may improve quality of
  life.'
