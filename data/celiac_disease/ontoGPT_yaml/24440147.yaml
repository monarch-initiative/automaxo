input_text: 'Diagnosis and classification of celiac disease and gluten sensitivity.
  Celiac disease is a complex disorder, the development of which is controlled by
  a combination of genetic (HLA alleles) and environmental (gluten ingestion) factors.
  New diagnostic guidelines developed by ESPGHAN emphasize the crucial role of serological
  tests in the diagnostic process of symptomatic subjects, and of the detection of
  HLA DQ2/DQ8 alleles in defining a diagnosis in asymptomatic subjects belonging to
  at-risk groups. The serological diagnosis of CD is based on the detection of class
  IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) and anti-endomysial antibodies. In patients
  with IgA deficiency, anti-tTG or anti-deamidated gliadin peptide antibody assays
  of the IgG class are used. When anti-tTG antibody levels are very high, antibody
  specificity is absolute and CD can be diagnosed without performing a duodenum biopsy.
  Non-celiac gluten sensitivity is a gluten reaction in which both allergic and autoimmune
  mechanisms have been ruled out. Diagnostic criteria include the presence of symptoms
  similar to those of celiac or allergic patients; negative allergological tests and
  absence of anti-tTG and EMA antibodies; normal duodenal histology; evidence of disappearance
  of the symptoms with a gluten-free diet; relapse of the symptoms when gluten is
  reintroduced. '
