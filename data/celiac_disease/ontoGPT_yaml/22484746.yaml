input_text: 'Lane-Hamilton syndrome: association or coincidence. The combination of
  idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis (IPH) and celiac disease (CD) is rare. The clinical
  importance of this association is that a significant improvement can be obtained
  with gluten free diet not only in intestinal but also in pulmonary symptoms. A four
  and half-years old girl was admitted with complaints of cough, difficulty in breathing
  and paleness. She had intermittent episodes of abdominal pain and diarrhea. She
  had dyspnea and tachycardia, and oxygen saturation 88%. The patient was diagnosed
  with CD and concomitant IPH. With gluten-free diet and corticosteroid treatment,
  both intestinal and pulmonary symptoms were controlled.'
