input_text: 'Heavy Metal and Rice in Gluten-Free Diets: Are They a Risk? A gluten-free
  diet (GFD) is the treatment of choice for gluten-related disorders. It has been
  associated with macro- and micronutrient deficiencies. Recently, consumption of
  arsenic-contaminated rice has raised concern because of the potential greater risk
  that it may represent for people on GFDs, whose rice consumption is high, since
  it is a fundamental cereal in GFDs. We reviewed the data published over the last
  20 years in Medline and Scielo, in English, French and Spanish, on four metals (As,
  Hg, Cd, and Pb), to assess whether the evidence suggests that celiac disease or
  consumption of a GFD is associated with increased levels of blood/urinary metal
  concentrations. The review revealed a few articles that were directly related to
  the four metals and their relationships with a GFD. The evidence supports that rice-based
  products are a relevant source of As and other metals. Clinical studies and evaluations
  based on NHANES have indicated that persons on GFDs have higher As and Hg blood/urinary
  levels, suggesting that the diet and not the disease is responsible for it. The
  levels described are statistically significant compared to those of persons on complete
  diets, but far from toxic levels. The question of whether higher exposure to heavy
  metals associated with a GFD is biologically relevant remains unanswered and deserves
  study.'
