input_text: "Inconsistent effects of gluten on obesity: is there a role for the haptoglobin
  isoforms? BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There is no clear evidence about the effects of gluten
  intake on obesity. It is known that gluten's effects on gut permeability are mediated
  by zonulin, a protein identified as pre-haptoglobin 2, a physiological regulator
  of the intestinal barrier. We investigated the obesogenic and inflammatory effects
  of gluten and its association with the haptoglobin genotype. METHODS: This was a
  single blinded, crossover study, including 40 overweight or obesity women free of
  celiac disease. Participants adopted a gluten-free diet (GFD) for 8 weeks and consumed
  a gluten-free muffin (GF-M) or a gluten-containing muffin (GLU-M, 24 g gluten) for
  4 weeks, switching muffin type during the subsequent 4 weeks. During a follow-up
  period of 4 weeks we evaluated the usual diet (UD). Food diaries were collected
  to estimate the macronutrient intake and dietary inflammatory index (DII ). Bodyweight
  and composition, resting energy expenditure (REE), and cytokines were assessed.
  Haptoglobin alleles (Hp1 and Hp2) were genotyped to characterize zonulin expression.
  RESULTS: Energy and macronutrient intakes were similar during both periods, except
  for protein intake, which was higher during GLU-M. DII scores indicated a more inflammatory
  profile during the GF-M and GLU-M periods compared to UD. No differences were observed
  in body composition or REE between interventions when the Hp genotype was not considered.
  Nonetheless, those carrying the Hp2-2 genotype (overexpressing zonulin) presented
  lower REE and higher levels of IL6 and IL1beta only during gluten intake (GLU-M
  and UD) compared to age- and body mass index-matched Hp1-1 carrier. These results
  suggest an obesogenic and inflammatory action of gluten only in those overexpressing
  zonulin (Hp2-2). CONCLUSION: These results highlight the importance of zonulin as
  the mediator of gluten obesogenic and inflammatory effects. Our data suggest that
  in the presence of gluten, zonulin release is associated with a reduction of REE
  and an increase of inflammatory markers that are not seen in zonulin low producers."
