input_text: 'Microvascular Complications in Childhood-Onset Type 1 Diabetes and Celiac
  Disease: A Multicenter Longitudinal Analysis of 56,514 Patients From the German-Austrian
  DPV Database. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether celiac disease (CD) associated with
  type 1 diabetes increases the risk of microvascular complications. RESEARCH DESIGN
  AND METHODS: Patients (n = 56,514) aged >10 years with diabetes duration <20 years
  from 392 centers in Germany and Austria were assigned to one of three categories
  (n): no CD (50,933), biopsy-confirmed CD (812), or suspected CD (4,769; clinical
  diagnosis or positive antibodies). The confirmed and suspected groups were combined
  and analyzed for retinopathy or nephropathy. Cox proportional hazards regression
  was used to adjust for potential confounders (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c], age at
  diabetes onset, sex, smoking, dyslipidemia, and hypertension). RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier
  analysis revealed that retinopathy and nephropathy occurred earlier in the presence
  versus absence of CD: retinopathy at age 26.7 years (95% CI 23.7-30.2) in 25% of
  patients with CD vs. age 33.7 years (33.2-34.4) in 25% without CD and microalbuminuria
  at age 32.8 years (29.7-42.5) vs. 42.4 years (41.4-43.3). The adjusted risk for
  both retinopathy (hazard ratio 1.263 [95% CI 1.078-1.481]) and nephropathy (1.359
  [1.228-1.504]) was higher in patients with diabetes and CD versus those without
  CD. Cox regression revealed CD as an independent risk factor for microvascular complications
  after adjustment for confounders. CONCLUSIONS: CD is an independent risk factor
  for retinopathy and nephropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes. Our study therefore
  supports the recommendation for regular serologic testing for CD, even in the absence
  of clinical CD. Further prospective studies are required to investigate whether
  a gluten-free diet might reduce the risk of microvascular disorders in patients
  with diabetes and CD.'
