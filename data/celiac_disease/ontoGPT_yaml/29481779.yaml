input_text: 'Dietary Patterns After the Weaning and Lactation Period Are Associated
  With Celiac Disease Autoimmunity in Children. BACKGROUND & AIMS: There have been
  many studies of associations between infant feeding practices and development of
  celiac disease during childhood, but few studies have focused on overall diets of
  young children after the weaning period. We aimed to examine the association between
  common dietary patterns in infants and the occurrence of celiac disease autoimmunity
  during childhood. METHODS: We performed a prospective analysis of data from the
  Generation R Study that comprised 1997 children born from April 2002 through January
  2006 in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Food consumption around 1 year of age was assessed
  with a validated food-frequency questionnaire. Dietary data were examined using
  a priori (based on existing guidelines) and a posteriori (principal component analysis
  and reduced rank regression) dietary pattern analyses. Five dietary patterns were
  compared. Celiac disease autoimmunity, determined on the basis of serum concentration
  of transglutaminase-2 autoantibody (ie, TG2A) below or above 7 U/mL, was evaluated
  at 6 years. Associations between dietary pattern adherence scores and celiac disease
  autoimmunity were examined using multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS:
  Higher adherence to the a posteriori-derived prudent dietary pattern (high intake
  of vegetables, vegetable oils, pasta, and grains and low consumption of refined
  cereals and sweet beverages) at 1 year was significantly associated with lower odds
  of celiac disease autoimmunity at 6 years (odds ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval,
  0.53-0.84). No significant associations were found for the 4 remaining dietary patterns.
  CONCLUSIONS: In a prospective study of dietary patterns of young children in the
  Netherlands, we associated a dietary pattern characterized by high consumption of
  vegetables and grains and low consumption of refined cereals and sweet beverages,
  with lower odds of celiac disease autoimmunity. Early-life dietary patterns might
  therefore be involved in the development of celiac disease during childhood.'
