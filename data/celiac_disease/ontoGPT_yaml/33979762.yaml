input_text: 'Predictors of adherence to a gluten-free diet in celiac disease: Do knowledge,
  attitudes, experiences, symptoms, and quality of life play a role? OBJECTIVES: This
  study aimed to identify the relationship between adherence to a gluten-free diet
  (GFD) and demographic characteristics, knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs regarding
  celiac disease (CD) and GFD, experiences of following a GFD, symptoms, and quality
  of life (QoL). METHODS: Patients with CD were recruited from outpatient clinics.
  Adherence to GFD was assessed using the CD adherence test (CDAT) and GFD score (GFD-S).
  Knowledge, attitudes, experiences, symptoms, and QoL were assessed using existing
  questionnaires. A multivariate logistic regression was performed. RESULTS: Overall,
  116 patients with CD were included (48 +- 16 y; 70% female). Based on the CDAT,
  58 patients (50%) were adequate adherers, but 86 patients (74%) were adequate adherers
  according to GFD-S. When adherence was measured using the CDAT, being female was
  associated with lower odds of adherence (odds ratio [OR]: 0.36; P = 0.028), and
  better emotional wellbeing was associated with higher odds of adherence (OR: 1.19;
  P < 0.001). When adherence was measured using GFD-S, membership in a support group
  (OR: 6.17; P = 0.002), stronger beliefs about the chronicity of CD (OR: 1.15; P
  = 0.059), and weaker beliefs on accident/chance causing CD (OR: 1.94; P = 0.05)
  were associated with greater odds of adherence. Difficulties when eating with family/friends
  (OR: 0.98; P = 0.005) and weaker beliefs on immunity causing CD (OR: 0.77; P = 0.031)
  were associated with lower odds of adherence. CONCLUSIONS: The association between
  gender, attending support groups, attitudes, experiences, and QoL with adherence
  to a GFD should be considered by health care professionals managing patients with
  CD.'
