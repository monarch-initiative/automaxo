input_text: 'Patient Perspectives on the Long-term Management of Celiac Disease. GOAL:
  The aim of this study was to survey adults with celiac disease (CD) on the utility
  of specific aspects of follow-up and on information needs. BACKGROUND: Currently,
  the treatment for CD is strict gluten avoidance. Although this places the onus on
  the patient for disease management, patient perspectives on CD care have not been
  formally assessed. STUDY: The Manitoba Celiac Disease Cohort prospectively enrolled
  adults newly diagnosed with CD using serology and histology. At the 24-month study
  visits, participants rated the utility of aspects of CD care on a 5-point scale
  anchored by "not at all useful" and "very useful" and the helpfulness of information
  on CD-related topics on a 6-point scale anchored by "not at all helpful" and "very
  helpful." RESULTS: The online survey was completed by 149 of 211 cohort members
  [median age 40 (interquartile range 30 to 56) y; 68% female]. Adherence to a gluten-free
  diet was good. Most participants (87%) responded that they should be seen regularly
  for medical follow-up of CD, preferably every 6 (26%) or 12 months (48%). Blood
  tests were the most highly rated care component (rated scored >=4/5 by 78% of respondents),
  followed by the opportunity to ask about vitamins and supplements (50%), symptom
  review (47%), and information on CD research (44%). Diet review was not considered
  helpful. CONCLUSIONS: Two years after diagnosis, most individuals with CD find regular
  specialist follow-up helpful, particularly for biochemical assessment of disease
  activity and its complications. Furthermore, information on research and long-term
  complications of CD is also valued.'
