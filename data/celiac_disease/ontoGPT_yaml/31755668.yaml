input_text: "Complementary feeding: new styles versus old myths. Early life feeding
  habits may potentially alter future metabolic programming and body composition.
  Complementary feeding is the period of time when infants introduce food different
  from milk in their diet, together with a gradual reduction of the intake of milk
  (either breast milk or formula), to finally acquire the diet model of their family.
  This period is important in the transition of the infant from milk feeding to family
  foods, and is necessary for both nutritional and developmental reasons. The timing
  for introducing complementary foods and the method of feeding have changed over
  time. Available literature data show increasing interest and concerns about the
  impact of complementary feeding timing and modality on the onset of later non-communicable
  disorders, such as overweight and obesity, allergic diseases, celiac disease, or
  diabetes. While international scientific guidelines on complementary feeding have
  been published, many baby food companies' websites, blogs, and books, in most European
  countries exist. The aim of this manuscript is to look over current recommendations,
  and to revise \"old myths.\" The adoption of an adequate weaning method is a cornerstone
  in the development of life-long health status. A correct strategy could reduce the
  risk of feeding disorders and other health problems later in life."
