input_text: 'The Effect of Gluten-free Diet on Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Newly
  Diagnosed Pediatric Celiac Disease Patients. OBJECTIVES: Although gluten-free diet
  (GFD) is the only proven therapy for celiac disease (CD), its effect on cardiovascular
  disease (CVD) risk factors is still unclear. Our aim was to determine whether adherence
  to GFD affects CVD risk factors among newly diagnosed pediatric CD subjects. METHODS:
  We prospectively enrolled pediatric subjects undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy
  for suspected CD. We collected anthropometric and laboratory parameters related
  to CVD risk factors at the time of CD diagnosis and 1 year after initiation of a
  GFD and evaluated changes in CVD risk factors. Paired t tests or Wilcoxon nonparametric
  tests were used, each when appropriate. RESULTS: One hundred ten newly diagnosed
  CD pediatric subjects were included in the analysis. There were 64 (58.2%) girls
  and the mean age at diagnosis was 6.8 +- 3.4 years. Median body mass index z scores
  (P = 0.84), rates of underweight or overweight (P = 0.32), and rates of elevated
  blood pressure (P = 0.78) remained unchanged. Although median fasting insulin levels
  increased (1.9 vs 5.4 muU/mL, P < 0.001), insulin resistance as measured by homeostatic
  model assessment did not increase after 1 year of GFD (P = 0.16). Although rates
  of dyslipidemia remained unchanged, median high-density lipoprotein levels increased
  on GFD (47 vs 51 mg/dL, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In this pediatric CD cohort, GFD
  for 1 year was not associated with increased CVD risk factors. The long-term significance
  of these mild changes is yet to be determined.'
