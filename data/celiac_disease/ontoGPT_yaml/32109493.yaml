input_text: Impact of gastrointestinal physiology on drug absorption in special populations--An
  UNGAP review. The release and absorption profile of an oral medication is influenced
  by the physicochemical properties of the drug and its formulation, as well as by
  the anatomy and physiology of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. During drug development
  the bioavailability of a new drug is typically assessed in early clinical studies
  in a healthy adult population. However, many disease conditions are associated with
  an alteration of the anatomy and/or physiology of the GI tract. The same holds true
  for some subpopulations, such as paediatric or elderly patients, or populations
  with different ethnicity. The variation in GI tract conditions compared to healthy
  adults can directly affect the kinetics of drug absorption, and thus, safety and
  efficacy of an oral medication. This review provides an overview of GI tract properties
  in special populations compared to healthy adults and discusses how drug absorption
  is affected by these conditions. Particular focus is directed towards non-disease
  dependent conditions (age, sex, ethnicity, genetic factors, obesity, pregnancy),
  GI diseases (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, celiac disease, cancer in the
  GI tract, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, lactose intolerance, Helicobacter pylori infection,
  and infectious diseases of the GI tract), as well as systemic diseases that change
  the GI tract conditions (cystic fibrosis, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, HIV enteropathy,
  and critical illness). The current knowledge about GI conditions in special populations
  and their impact on drug absorption is still limited. Further research is required
  to improve confidence in pharmacokinetic predictions and dosing recommendations
  in the targeted patient population, and thus to ensure safe and effective drug therapies.
