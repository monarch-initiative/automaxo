input_text: "Dental enamel defects and oral cavity manifestations in Asian patients
  with celiac disease. BACKGROUND: While the small intestine is the main site of disease,
  many other organs are affected by celiac disease (CeD). Dental enamel defects (DED)
  are common in patients with CeD, and these are one of the indicators of CeD, even
  when no other symptom of CeD is present. Data on dental and oral cavity manifestations
  in Asian patients with CeD are scanty. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate
  dental and oral manifestations in Asian patients with CeD. METHODS: We recruited
  118 patients with biopsy-confirmed CeD (36 treatment naive and 82 on follow-up for
  at least 1 year on gluten-free diet [GFD]) and 40 controls. Diagnosis was made as
  per the standard criteria. Oral and dental manifestations were evaluated by a dental
  surgeon. The DED were evaluated according to Aine's criteria. RESULTS: Overall higher
  number of patients with CeD (66.9%), both treatment naive (69.4%) and those on GFD
  (65.8%) had DED in comparison to controls (20%) (odds ratio, 8.1, 95% confidence
  interval [CI] 3.4-19.2; p<0.001). Specific/bilaterally symmetrical DED were significantly
  higher in patients with CeD than controls. Recurrent aphthous ulcers were also significantly
  higher in patients with CeD. Approximately 80.6% and 63.4% treatment-naive patients
  and those on GFD, respectively reported dry mouth sensation, which was significantly
  higher than the controls. CONCLUSION: Almost two-third of patients with CeD had
  DED. Physicians and dietitians caring for patients with CeD should be trained in
  identification of DED and other oral manifestations of CeD."
