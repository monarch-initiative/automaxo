input_text: The Impact of Low-FODMAPs, Gluten-Free, and Ketogenic Diets on Gut Microbiota
  Modulation in Pathological Conditions. The gut microbiota performs several essential
  protective, structural, and metabolic functions for host health. The maintenance
  of a beneficial microbiota requires a homeostatic equilibrium within microbial communities,
  and between the microorganisms and the host. The gut microbiota composition may
  be affected by external factors, among them diet habits may be considered most important.
  In some pathological conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), celiac disease
  (CD), or neurological disorders (ND), specific dietary regimens as low-fermentable,
  oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyols (FODMAPs), ketogenic (KD), and gluten-free
  (GFD) diets are considered therapeutic. These kinds of diets are characterized by
  a reduction or exclusion of a specific nutrient from the entire dietary pattern.
  Despite these alimentary regimens showing beneficial effects on disease symptoms,
  they can affect microbiota composition, especially if they are protracted for a
  long time. To date, only a few studies have reported the effects of these diets
  on gut microbiota. In this review, we discuss the effects of low-FODMAPs, KD, and
  GFD on gut microbiota modulation in pathological conditions, advancing the possibility
  of depicting a balanced diet and developing personalized dietary intervention protocols.
