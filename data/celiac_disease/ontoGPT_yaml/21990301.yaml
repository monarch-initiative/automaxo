input_text: 'Celiac disease diagnosis and management: a 46-year-old woman with anemia.
  Celiac disease is one of the most prevalent autoimmune gastrointestinal disorders,
  but as the case of Ms J illustrates, diagnosis is often delayed or missed. Based
  on serologic studies, the prevalence of celiac disease in many populations is estimated
  to be approximately 1% and has been increasing steadily over the last 50 years.
  Evaluation for celiac disease is generally straightforward and uses commonly available
  serologic tests; however, the signs and symptoms of celiac disease are nonspecific
  and highly heterogeneous, making diagnosis difficult. Although celiac disease is
  often considered a mild disorder treatable with simple dietary changes, in reality
  celiac disease imparts considerable risks, including reduced bone mineral density,
  impaired quality of life, and increased overall mortality. In addition, a gluten-free
  diet is highly burdensome and can profoundly affect patients and their families.
  For these reasons, care of individuals with celiac disease requires prompt diagnosis
  and ongoing multidisciplinary management.'
