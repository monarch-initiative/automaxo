input_text: 'Current trends and investigative developments in celiac disease. Celiac
  disease has become extensively studied. What could be the cause? Increasing the
  accuracy of diagnostic tests for celiac disease has led to more discovered cases.
  Serological diagnosis of celiac disease has undergone important changes in recent
  years. Application of serological tests has reflected the diagnostic performance
  of tissue transglutaminase antibody and endomysial antibody as screening tests for
  celiac disease but also the progress of new serological tests as the antibodies
  against synthetic deamidated gliadin peptides. Serological tests are largely responsible
  for the recognition that celiac disease is not a rare disease. The Consensus in
  celiac disease from 2008 conducted under the aegis of the European Society of Pediatric
  Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition jointly with North American Society of
  Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition which agreed that "Celiac disease
  is an immune-mediated enteropathy that can affect any system or organ and that can
  present itself with a wide range of clinical manifestations of variable severity"
  was confirmed. But increasing prevalence of this disease has led to the need for
  new methods of treatment among patients with celiac disease. Studies on quality
  of life of patients with celiac disease have questioned the gluten-free diet. As
  such new therapies, like TG2 inhibitors, the copolymer P (HEMA-co-SS) and other
  new experimental therapies, have emerged in celiac disease. The new therapies in
  celiac disease are based on new investigations in gluten toxicity screening, like
  K562(S)-cell agglutination, A1 and G12 monoclonal antibodies and proteomics. In
  this paper we want to present the investigative developments in celiac disease.
  We also want to find whether a new treatment in celiac disease is necessary. '
