input_text: 'Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency Is Common in Celiac Disease: A Systematic
  Review and Meta-Analysis. The prevalence of celiac disease (CD) is approximately
  1% in the US. Studies have shown possible association between exocrine pancreatic
  insufficiency (EPI) and CD, with numerous hypothesized biological mechanisms including
  small bowel mucosal damage causing disruption of enteric-mediated hormonal secretion
  such as cholecystokinin and loss of enterokinase. The overall prevalence of EPI
  in CD remains unknown. We performed systematic review and metanalysis and examined
  the prevalence of EPI in patients who were first diagnosed with CD versus those
  who had been on treatment with gluten-free diet (GFD). Results  Six studies were
  included in the analysis totaling 446 CD patients (Avg age 44.1 years; 34% Males).
  One hundred and forty-four patients had newly diagnosed CD, and 302 patients had
  known CD with at least 9 months treatment with GFD. Four studies examined newly
  diagnosed CD patients. The individual rates of EPI in new CD patients ranged from
  10.5 to 46.5%. The pooled prevalence of EPI in newly diagnosed CD patients was 26.2%
  (95% CI 8.43-43.92%, Q = 2.24, I2 = 0%). Five studies examined CD patients on GFD.
  The rate of EPI ranged from 1.9% to 18.2%. The prevalence of EPI in patients treated
  with GFD is 8% (95% CI 1.52-14.8%, Q = 4.42, I2 = 9.59%). Patients with newly diagnosed
  CD are significantly more likely to have EPI compared to those patients treated
  with GFD (p = 0.031). CD patients on GFD with persistent symptoms have a significantly
  higher rate of EPI (28.4%) compared to CD patients on GFD who are asymptomatic (3%)
  (p < 0.001).'
