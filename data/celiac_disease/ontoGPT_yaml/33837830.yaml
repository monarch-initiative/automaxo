input_text: 'Gluten-degrading bacteria: availability and applications. Gluten is a
  mixture of storage proteins in wheat and occurs in smaller amounts in other cereal
  grains. It provides favorable structure to bakery products but unfortunately causes
  disease conditions with increasing prevalence. In the human gastrointestinal tract,
  gluten is cleaved into proline and gluten rich peptides that are not degraded further.
  These peptides trigger immune responses that might lead to celiac disease, wheat
  allergy, and non-celiac gluten sensitivity. The main treatment option is a gluten-free
  diet. Alternatively, using enzymes or microorganisms with gluten-degrading properties
  might alleviate the disease. These components can be used during food production
  or could be introduced into the digestive tract as food supplements. In addition,
  natural food from the environment is known to enrich the microbial communities in
  gut and natural environmental microbial communities have high potential to degrade
  gluten. It remains to be investigated if food and environment-induced changes in
  the gut microbiome could contribute to the triggering of gluten-related diseases.
  KEY POINTS:   Wheat proteins, gluten, are incompletely digested in human digestive
  tract leading to gluten intolerance.   The only efficient treatment of gluten intolerance
  is life-long gluten-free diet.   Environmental bacteria acquired together with food
  could be source of gluten-degrading bacteria detoxifying undigested gluten peptides.'
