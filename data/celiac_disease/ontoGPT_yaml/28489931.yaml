input_text: 'Cortical involvement in celiac disease before and after long-term gluten-free
  diet: A Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation study. OBJECTIVE: Transcranial Magnetic
  Stimulation in de novo patients with Celiac Disease previously revealed an imbalance
  in the excitability of cortical facilitatory and inhibitory circuits. After a median
  period of 16 months of gluten-free diet, a global increase of cortical excitability
  was reported, suggesting a glutamate-mediated compensation for disease progression.
  We have now evaluated cross-sectionally the changes of cortical excitability to
  TMS after a much longer gluten-free diet. METHODS: Twenty patients on adequate gluten-free
  diet for a mean period of 8.35 years were enrolled and compared with 20 de novo
  patients and 20 healthy controls. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation measures, recorded
  from the first dorsal interosseous muscle of the dominant hand, consisted of: resting
  motor threshold, cortical silent period, motor evoked potentials, central motor
  conduction time, mean short-latency intracortical inhibition and intracortical facilitation.
  RESULTS: The cortical silent period was shorter in de novo patients, whereas in
  gluten-free diet participants it was similar to controls. The amplitude of motor
  responses was significantly smaller in all patients than in controls, regardless
  of the dietary regimen. Notwithstanding the diet, all patients exhibited a statistically
  significant decrease of mean short-latency intracortical inhibition and enhancement
  of intracortical facilitation with respect to controls; more intracortical facilitation
  in gluten-restricted compared to non-restricted patients was also observed. Neurological
  examination and celiac disease-related antibodies were negative. CONCLUSIONS: In
  this new investigation, the length of dietary regimen was able to modulate the electrocortical
  changes in celiac disease. Nevertheless, an intracortical synaptic dysfunction,
  mostly involving excitatory and inhibitory interneurons within the motor cortex,
  may persist. The clinical significance of subtle neurophysiological changes in celiac
  disease needs to be further investigated.'
