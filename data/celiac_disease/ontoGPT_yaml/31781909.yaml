input_text: 'A miRNA-Based Blood and Mucosal Approach for Detecting and Monitoring
  Celiac Disease. BACKGROUND: The role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in celiac disease (CD)
  is unclear. AIMS: We evaluated inflammation-related miRNA-146a, miRNA-155, miRNA-21,
  and miRNA-125b expression in peripheral blood and intestinal mucosa of CD adults.
  METHODS: Thirty patients with CD were included: patients with active CD on a gluten-containing
  diet (CD-active, n = 10), patients on a gluten-free diet (for at least 1 year),
  and patients with negative blood antibodies (CD-inactivePE, n = 10). In addition,
  ten healthy volunteers formed the comparison/control group. MiRNA expression was
  measured in duodenal biopsies from patients (CD-inactiveMU, n = 10) after in vitro
  exposure to PT gliadin and 33-mer peptide. MiRNAs expression was measured in plasma
  and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and monocytes, before and after
  in vitro exposure to native gliadin (gliadinN). RESULTS: Expression levels of miRNA-146a,
  miRNA-155, and miRNA-21 in PBMCs, miRNA-155 in monocytes and miRNA-155, miRNA-21,
  and miRNA-125b in plasma were elevated in both groups of celiac patients. After
  in vitro exposure with gliadinN, miRNA-146a and miRNA-155 expression markedly increased
  in PBMCs and monocytes, while miRNA-155 and miRNA-21 increased in the CD-active
  group. MiRNAs expression in intestinal mucosa did not change. MiRNA-146a and miRNA-155
  expression showed high sensitivity and specificity for the presence of CD, irrespective
  of the current dietary treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Selected inflammation-related miRNAs
  expression is elevated in the peripheral blood of celiac. This suggests their participation
  in the immune processes underlying the pathology. Their similar response in active
  and inactive CD suggests that they should be further evaluated, as potential diagnostic
  biomarkers for CD.'
