input_text: Sensitive detection and quantification of gliadin contamination in gluten-free
  food with immunomagnetic beads based liposomal fluorescence immunoassay. Gliadin
  from wheat is a common food allergen that can induce baker's asthma, wheat-dependent
  exercise-induced anaphylaxis, atopic dermatitis, and celiac disease. This gliadin
  assay focuses on rapidly screen and check for gluten contamination in raw materials
  and in the gluten-free food production process, not only for wheat-sensitive patients
  but also for the industries producing gluten-free foodstuffs. The developed assay
  incorporates the use of anti-gliadin antibody-conjugated immunomagnetic beads (IMBs)
  to capture the gliadin in samples and fluorescent dyes-loaded immunoliposomal nanovesicles
  (IMLNs) to produce and enhance the detection signal. Hence, a sandwich complex is
  formed as "IMBs-gliadin-IMLNs". Experimental results indicate that this detection
  platform exhibits good sensitivity for gliadin with a detection limit as low as
  0.6 mug mL(-1) of gliadin; as the polyclonal antibody showed slight cross-reactions
  with barley and rye. Excellent recovery rates were found ranging from 83.5 to 102.6%
  as testing the spiked samples. Moreover, the CV (%) of intra- and inter-assay of
  this developed assay are 4.8-10.6% and 3.5-9.9%, respectively. Based on a parallel
  analysis of twenty food samples, the results of this developed assay provide a good
  consistency with those of an AOAC-approved ELISA kit without any false-negative
  results. The proposed assay method is thus a highly promising alternative method
  for detecting the contamination of gliadin in the food industry.
