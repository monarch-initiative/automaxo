input_text: 'Probiotics for Celiac Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
  of Randomized Controlled Trials. INTRODUCTION: Many patients with celiac disease
  (CD) experience persistent symptoms despite adhering to the gluten-free diet. Different
  studies have assessed the use of probiotics as an adjuvant treatment for CD. We
  performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics
  in improving gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and quality of life (QOL) in patients
  with CD. METHODS: We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, CENTRAL,
  and DARE databases up to February 2019 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating
  probiotics compared with placebo for treating CD. We collected data on GI symptoms,
  QOL, adverse events, serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha, intestinal permeability,
  and microbiota composition. RESULTS: We screened 2,831 records and found that 7
  articles describing 6 RCTs (n = 279 participants) were eligible for quantitative
  analysis. Probiotics improved GI symptoms when assessed by the GI Symptoms Rating
  Scale (mean difference symptom reduction: -28.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -43.96
  to -13.52; P = 0.0002). There was no difference in GI symptoms after probiotics
  when different questionnaires were pooled. The levels of Bifidobacteria increased
  after probiotics (mean difference: 0.85 log colony-forming units (CFU) per gram;
  95% CI 0.38-1.32 log CFU per gram; P = 0.0003). There were insufficient data on
  tumor necrosis factor-a levels or QOL for probiotics compared with placebo. No difference
  in adverse events was observed between probiotics and placebo. The overall certainty
  of the evidence ranged from very low to low. DISCUSSION: Probiotics may improve
  GI symptoms in patients with CD. High-quality clinical trials are needed to improve
  the certainty in the evidence (see Visual abstract, Supplementary Digital Content
