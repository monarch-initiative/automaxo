input_text: The Handbook of Minerals on a Gluten-Free Diet. The importance of a gluten-free
  diet (GFD) in the treatment of celiac disease and other gluten-related disorders
  is undisputable. However, strict GFD often lead to nutritional imbalances and, therefore,
  to deficiencies. One of the most common deficiencies from a GFD are an insufficient
  amount of Ca, Fe, Mg, and Zn. This is mainly because the most of popular gluten-free
  (GF) raw materials are poor in minerals. Although the popularity of GFD is constantly
  growing, the data on minerals in GF products are still limited. More importantly,
  an access to the data is even more restricted. Therefore, the paper reviews the
  Ca, Fe, Mg, and Zn contents in hundreds of grain GF products available worldwide.
  The data for 444 products from categories of flours, mixes for cooking, bakery products,
  cereals, groats, rice, and pasta are obtained from research papers and nutritional
  databases. The calculation of the realization of mineral requirements from a portion
  of each product with its graphical classification as rich/average/poor source of
  each mineral is given. The review is a handbook of minerals for people on a GFD,
  dietitians, and food producers.
