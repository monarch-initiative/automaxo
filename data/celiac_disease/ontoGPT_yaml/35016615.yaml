input_text: 'The effect of group-based education on gastrointestinal symptoms and
  quality of life in patients with celiac disease: randomized controlled clinical
  trial. BACKGROUND: In this trial, we investigated the effect of a group-based education
  program on gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and quality of life (QOL) in patients
  with celiac disease (CD). METHOD: In the present study, 130 patients with CD who
  were on a GFD for at least 3 months, randomly assigned to receive group-based education
  (n = 66) or routine education in the celiac clinic (n = 64) for 3 months. We assessed
  gastrointestinal symptoms and quality of life using the gastrointestinal symptom
  rating scale (GSRS) questionnaire and SF-36 questionnaire at baseline and 3 months
  after interventions. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 37.57 +- 9.59
  years. There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding the
  baseline values. Results showed that the mean score of total GSRS score in the intervention
  group was significantly lower compared with the control group 3 months post-intervention
  (p = 0.04). Also, there was a significant difference in the mean score of SF-36
  between the two groups 3 months post-intervention (p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Results
  showed that group-based education was an effective intervention in patients with
  celiac disease to improve gastrointestinal symptoms and quality of life. Trial registration
  IRCT code: IRCT20080904001197N21; registration date: 5/23/2019.'
