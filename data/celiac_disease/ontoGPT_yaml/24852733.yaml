input_text: "Histopathological findings in the oral mucosa of celiac patients. BACKGROUND:
  Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by the ingestion
  of gluten in genetically susceptible subjects. Although the small intestinal mucosa
  is the main site of the gut's involvement in CD, other mucosal surfaces belonging
  to the gastrointestinal tract and the gut-associated lymphoid tissue are known to
  be affected. AIM: Assuming that the oral mucosa could reflect the histopathological
  inflammatory alterations of the intestine in CD patients, this study wishes to assess
  the pattern of T-cell subsets in the oral mucosa of young adults with CD. METHODS:
  A group of 37 patients (age range 20-38 years; female: male ratio 28:9) with CD
  were enrolled. Out of 37 patients, 19 patients (group A) followed a gluten free
  diet (GFD) -2 patients from less than one year; 6 patients between 1 and 5 years;
  11 patients more than 5 years- while 18 patients (group B) were still untreated.
  Fifteen healthy volunteers (age range 18-35 years, female: Male ratio 11:4) served
  as controls for the CD patients. Ethical approval for the research was granted by
  the Ethics Committee. Biopsy specimens were taken from normal looking oral mucosa.
  The immunohistochemical investigation was performed with monoclonal antibodies to
  CD3, CD4, CD8, and gamma/delta-chains T cell receptor (TCR). RESULTS: The T-lymphocytic
  inflammatory infiltrate was significantly (p < 0.0001) increased in group B (both
  compared with group A and with the control group). CONCLUSION: This study confirms
  the oral cavity to be a site of involvement of CD and its possible diagnostic potentiality
  in this disease."
