input_text: 'Impact of adherence to gluten-free diet in paediatric celiac patients
  on optical coherence tomography findings: Ocular imaging based study. OBJECTIVE:
  This study aims to measure choroidal thickness, retinal nerve fiber layer thickness,
  GCC thickness, and foveal thickness by optical coherence tomography and to investigate
  whether there is a difference between celiac patients who adhere to the gluten-free
  diet and who do not. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 68 eyes of 34 pediatric patients
  diagnosed with celiac disease were included in the study. Celiac patients were divided
  into two groups those who adhere to the gluten-free diet and those who do not. Fourteen
  patients who adhere to the gluten-free diet and 20 patients who do not adhere to
  the gluten-free diet were included in the study. Choroidal thickness, GCC, RNFL,
  and foveal thickness of all subjects were measured and recorded using an optical
  coherence tomography device. RESULTS: The mean choroidal thickness of the dieting
  and non-diet groups was 249.05 +- 25.60 and 244.18 +- 33.50 microm, respectively.
  The mean GCC thickness of the dieting and non-diet groups was 96.56 +- 6.26 and
  93.83 +- 5.62 microm, respectively. The mean RNFL thickness of the dieting and non-diet
  groups was 108.83 +- 9.97 and 103.20 +- 9.74 microm, respectively. The mean foveal
  thickness of the dieting and non-diet groups was 259.25 +- 33.60 and 261.92 +- 32.94
  microm, respectively. There was not a statistically significant difference between
  the dieting group and the non-diet group in terms of choroidal, GCC, RNFL and foveal
  thicknesses (p = 0.635, p = 0.207, p = 0.117, p = 0.820, respectively). CONCLUSION:
  In conclusion, the present study states that adhering to a gluten-free diet does
  not make any difference in choroidal, GCC, RNFL, and foveal thicknesses in pediatric
  celiac patients.'
