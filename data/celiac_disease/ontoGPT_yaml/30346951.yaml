input_text: 'Pancreatic autoimmunity: An unknown etiology on patients with assisted
  reproductive techniques (ART)-recurrent reproductive failure. Pancreatic Autoimmunity
  is defined as the presence of autoantibodies and more frequent need for insulin
  treatment. Affected women presenting recurrent implantation failure (RIF) or recurrent
  miscarriage (RM) are often misdiagnosed. The objective of thestudy was to describe
  clinical and metabolic profiles suggestive of Pancreatic Autoimmunity and therapeutic
  strategy in patients with RIF/RM. We analyzed retrospectively 735 patients, and
  have identified a subset (N = 20) with similar metabolic characteristics. At the
  same time, we included a control group (n = 39), with similar demographic characteristics
  and negative for pancreatic, thyroid or celiac disease autoimmunity. The patients
  identified with autoimmune metabolic problem (N = 20) had relatives with diabetes
  mellitus. At 120 minutes after Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) low level of insulin
  secretion (<2 IU/ml) was found in 70% of patients. Glutamic acid decarboxylase 65
  (GAD 65) antibodies, with or without other autoantibodies, were positive in80% of
  patients and anti-IA2 alone were positive I the rest. Since pregestational period,
  insulin administration was recommended for 10 patients, metformin for 4 patients
  and exclusively diet control in 5 of them. Significantly increased live bith rates
  (LBR) per cycle were observed after metabolic control (52%) compared with live birth
  rate (LBR) after cycles without control (7.5%) (p<0.0001). We noticed 2 cases of
  pre-eclampsia and 6 low-birth weights. Insulin administration was needed during
  the pregnancy in 68% of patients and after childbirth in 31.57% of them. In our
  control group, all of patients (n = 39) underwent ART (53.8% SET and 46.1% DET)
  with a 50% (SET) and 61.9% (DET) live birth rate (LBR) per cycle. Patients with
  RIF/RM, normal BMI, low insulin levels after OGTT could benefit from additional
  metabolic immune testing. A correct diagnosis and treatment could have a positive
  impact on their reproductive results and live birth rate.'
