input_text: 'The use of urine peptidomics to define dietary gluten peptides from patients
  with celiac disease and the clinical relevance. INTRODUCTION: Determination of urinary
  gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) has emerged as one of the most attractive test
  to monitor the adherence to the gluten-free diet (GFD) of patients with celiac disease
  (CD), being a simple, noninvasive and direct method to detect gluten contamination
  of the GFD. AREAS COVERED: We conducted a scoping review in Medline (PubMed) of
  articles published up to April 2023 that analyzed any aspect of the clinical relevance
  of the use of urinary GIP measurement in patients with CD. A total of 17 articles
  reporting the clinical use of urinary peptidomics for the follow-up of CD patients
  were finally included. EXPERT OPINION: Available data suggest that a negative urinary
  GIP result is a reliable noninvasive predictor of intestinal mucosa healing in CD
  patients treated with the GFD, especially if testing three urine samples on different
  days including the weekend. Due to conflicting results about the sensitivity and
  the specificity of the urinary GIP determination, additional in-depth information
  is needed, particularly related to (1) the relationship between the amount of ingested
  gluten and the quantity of urinary GIP excreted in treated CD patients, (2) the
  GIP kinetics and best timing for sample collection.'
