input_text: 'Is mass screening for coeliac disease a wise use of resources? A health
  economic evaluation. BACKGROUND: Living with undiagnosed symptomatic coeliac disease
  is connected with deteriorated health, and persons with coeliac disease often wait
  a long time for their diagnosis. A mass screening would lower the delay, but its
  cost-effectiveness is still unclear. Our aim was to determine the cost-effectiveness
  of a coeliac disease mass screening at 12 years of age, taking a life course perspective
  on future benefits and drawbacks. METHODS: The cost-effectiveness was derived as
  cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) using a Markov model. As a basis for
  our assumptions, we mainly used information from the Exploring the Iceberg of Celiacs
  in Sweden (ETICS) study, a school-based screening conducted in 2005/2006 and 2009/2010,
  where 13,279 12-year-old children participated and 240 were diagnosed with coeliac
  disease, and a study involving members of the Swedish Coeliac Association with 1031
  adult participants. RESULTS: The cost for coeliac disease screening was 40,105 Euro
  per gained QALY. Sensitivity analyses support screening based on high compliance
  to a gluten-free diet, rapid progression from symptom-free coeliac disease to coeliac
  disease with symptoms, long delay from celiac disease with symptoms to diagnosis,
  and a low QALY score for undiagnosed coeliac disease cases. CONCLUSIONS: A coeliac
  disease mass screening is cost-effective based on the commonly used threshold of
  50,000 Euro per gained QALY. However, this is based on many assumptions, especially
  regarding the natural history of coeliac disease and the effects on long-term health
  for individuals with coeliac disease still eating gluten.'
