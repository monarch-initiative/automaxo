input_text: 'Ultra-short Celiac Disease Is a Distinct and Milder Phenotype of the
  Disease in Children. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Approximately 10% of children with celiac
  disease (CD) have ultra-short celiac disease (USCD), where histological abnormalities
  are limited to the duodenal bulb. The aim of our retrospective study was to identify
  clinical and serological characteristics at baseline and at follow-up of children
  with USCD. METHODS: All children that were diagnosed with CD in our unit during
  7/2010-12/2017, in whom biopsies were taken from duodenal bulb and second part,
  were included. We compared disease characteristics and course between children with
  USCD and children with involvement in the second part of the duodenum. RESULTS:
  Out of 3740 children who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopies, 648 were
  diagnosed with CD. Seventy-one (11%) of those children had limited involvement in
  the duodenal bulb. The USCD group included more females (P = 0.021), were older
  (P = 0.005), had a lower prevalence of diarrhea (P = 0.003), anemia (P = 0.007),
  anti-tissue transglutaminase (TTG) antibodies count (P < 0.001) at presentation,
  lower frequency of endoscopic abnormality, lower Marsh score, and a trend toward
  shorter time to the normalization of anti-TTG antibodies under a gluten-free diet
  compared to the extensive CD. There were no differences in body mass index or duration
  of symptoms before diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Children with USCD presented with a distinct
  phenotype of milder symptoms, lower celiac serology, and milder endoscopic and histological
  findings, with a trend toward faster normalization under a gluten-free diet compared
  to those with extensive CD. Further studies are needed to determine the long-term
  course and prognosis of USCD.'
