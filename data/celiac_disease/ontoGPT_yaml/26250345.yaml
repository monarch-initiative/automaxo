input_text: 'Severe intestinal malabsorption associated with olmesartan: a French
  nationwide observational cohort study. OBJECTIVES: Severe sprue-like enteropathy
  associated with olmesartan has been reported, but there has been no demonstration
  of an increased risk by epidemiological studies. AIM: To assess, in a nationwide
  patient cohort, the risk of hospitalisation for intestinal malabsorption associated
  with olmesartan compared with other angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and ACE
  inhibitors (ACEIs). DESIGN: From the French National Health Insurance claim database,
  all adult patients initiating ARB or ACEI between 1 January 2007 and 31 December
  2012 with no prior hospitalisation for intestinal malabsorption, no serology testing
  for coeliac disease and no prescription for a gluten-free diet product were included.
  Incidence of hospitalisation with a discharge diagnosis of intestinal malabsorption
  was the primary endpoint. RESULTS: 4 546 680 patients (9 010 303 person-years) were
  included, and 218 events observed. Compared with ACEI, the adjusted rate ratio of
  hospitalisation with a discharge diagnosis of intestinal malabsorption was 2.49
  (95% CI 1.73 to 3.57, p<0.0001) in olmesartan users. This adjusted rate ratio was
  0.76 (95% CI 0.39 to 1.49, p=0.43) for treatment duration shorter than 1 year, 3.66
  (95% CI 1.84 to 7.29, p<0.001) between 1 and 2 years and 10.65 (95% CI 5.05 to 22.46,
  p<0.0001) beyond 2 years of exposure. Median length of hospital stay for intestinal
  malabsorption was longer in the olmesartan group than in the other groups (p=0.02).
  Compared with ACEI, the adjusted rate ratio of hospitalisation for coeliac disease
  was 4.39 (95% CI 2.77 to 6.96, p<0.0001) in olmesartan users and increased with
  treatment duration. CONCLUSIONS: Olmesartan is associated with an increased risk
  of hospitalisation for intestinal malabsorption and coeliac disease.'
