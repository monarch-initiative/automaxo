input_text: Influence of HLA-DQ2.5 Dose on Clinical Picture of Unrelated Celiac Disease
  Patients. The clinical phenotype of celiac disease varies considerably among patients
  and the dosage of HLA-DQ2.5 alleles has been suggested to be a contributing factor.
  We investigated whether HLA-DQ2.5 allele dosage is associated with distinct clinical
  parameters at the time of diagnosis and with patients' response to a gluten-free
  diet. The final cohort included 605 carefully phenotyped non-related Finnish celiac
  disease patients grouped as having 0, 1 or 2 copies of HLA-DQ2.5. Clinical data
  at the time of diagnosis and during gluten-free diet were collected systematically
  from medical records and supplementary interviews. An increasing HLA-DQ2.5 dose
  effect was detected for celiac disease antibody positivity at diagnosis (p = 0.021)
  and for the presence of any first-degree relatives with celiac disease (p = 0.011
  and p = 0.031, respectively). Instead, DQ2.5-negative patients were suffering most
  often from classical symptoms at diagnosis (p = 0.007 between HLA groups). In addition,
  during follow-up they were most often symptomatic despite a gluten-free diet (p
  = 0.002 between groups). Our results thus suggest that increasing HLA-DQ2.5 dose
  only has a minor effect on the clinical picture of celiac disease. However, HLA-DQ2.5-negative
  patients should not be overlooked in clinical practice and particular attention
  should be paid to this patient group during gluten-free diet.
