input_text: 'Cyclosporine-associated thrombotic microangiopathy and thrombocytopenia-associated
  multiple organ failure: a case successfully treated with therapeutic plasma exchange.
  INTRODUCTION: Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is characterized by microvascular
  thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Previous studies
  have shown that cyclosporine (CsA) is associated with TMA but the number of reported
  cases is very limited. We describe a 13-year-old girl with CsA-associated TMA and
  thrombocytopenia-associated multiple organ failure (TAMOF). CASE REPORT: The patient
  was diagnosed with polyglandular deficiency syndrome and had a history of celiac
  disease, autoimmune thyroiditis, and diabetes mellitus type I. CsA was started 7
  months before her admission to our pediatric intensive care unit for persistent
  diarrhea associated with celiac disease. At the time of her admission to our pediatric
  intensive care unit, she was thrombocytopenic and anemic with multiple organ failure.
  Laboratory and clinical findings were consistent with TMA and TAMOF. CsA was discontinued
  and therapeutic plasma exchange was performed daily for 5 days. The patient improved
  clinically, laboratory findings normalized, and TMA and multiple organ failure dissolved.
  CONCLUSION: This case report indicates that therapeutic plasma exchange may be effective
  in the treatment of CsA-associated TMA and TAMOF, especially in the presence of
  systemic findings.'
