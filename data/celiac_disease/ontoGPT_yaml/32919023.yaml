input_text: 'Determinants of gluten-free diet adoption among individuals without celiac
  disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity. OBJECTIVES: Gluten-free (GF) foods are
  typically less nutritious and more expensive than their gluten-containing variants,
  yet people without a diagnosed gluten sensitivity continue to adopt this diet. There
  is a lack of research about what factors drive people without Celiac disease or
  non-Celiac gluten sensitivity to follow the GF diet. METHODS: A nationally representative
  sample of 2982 US residents without a diagnosed gluten sensitivity were surveyed
  about their attitudes, perceptions, and experiences with the GF diet. Logistic regression
  was used to compare respondents who were currently avoiding or had avoided gluten
  previously (GF consumer) to respondents who had never tried a GF diet (non-GF consumer).
  RESULTS: Over one-fifth of respondents were GF consumers. Beliefs that a gluten-reduced
  diet is healthier (OR 1.69; 95% CI [1.30,2.18]), that GF products are more nutritious
  (OR 1.46, 95% CI [1.11,1.90), and that a GF diet can help clear acne (OR 1.46; 95%
  CI [1.13,1.88]) were all positively associated with trying a GF diet. Personal research
  was the most influential source of information associated with trying a GF diet
  (OR 2.92; 95% CI [1.91,4.52]). This was followed by "healthcare center or health
  professional" (OR 2.57; 95% CI [1.71,3.90]. Respondents who were never encouraged
  to try the GF diet were less likely to try the diet (OR 0.33, 95% CI [0.23,0.46]).
  CONCLUSIONS: Positive, but scientifically unsubstantiated, beliefs about the benefits
  of the GF diet were strongly associated with trying a GF diet, and the source of
  recommendation to try a GF diet was important.'
