input_text: "Daily oligofructose-enriched inulin intake impacts bone turnover markers
  but not the cytokine profile in pediatric patients with celiac disease on a gluten-free
  diet: Results of a randomised, placebo-controlled pilot study. BACKGROUND: Bone
  metabolism disturbances are commonly observed in patients with newly diagnosed celiac
  disease (CD). The only available treatment for CD-the intake of a gluten-free diet
  (GFD)-has been found to be insufficient in effectively improving bone health in
  some patients. Therefore, there is an urgent need to modify the GFD so as to allow
  for the provision of all the necessary nutrients and improved absorption. Prebiotics
  intake reportedly improves the absorption of bone-related vitamin D and calcium
  as well as bone metabolism. The effect of prebiotic intake on bone health in CD
  patients has not been studied yet. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of oligofructose-enriched
  inulin intake on bone metabolism and immune response in children with CD on a GFD.
  METHODS: A total of 34 children with CD were randomised into two groups receiving
  10 g of oligofructose-enriched inulin (Synergy 1) or a placebo (maltodextrin) for
  three months, together with a strict GFD. The children's bone metabolism marker
  levels and cytokine profiles were analysed before and after the intervention. RESULTS:
  After supplementation, the concentration of osteocalcin increased significantly
  in children receiving Synergy 1, while the concentration of bone alkaline phosphatase
  increased in both groups, independent of supplementation. After the intervention,
  the level of pyridinoline increased significantly in the placebo group, resulting
  in a concentration that was two times higher than that in the Synergy 1 group, in
  which it remained stable. Moreover, the plasma concentrations of N-terminal telopeptides
  of type I collagen decreased in both the groups, whereas the tartrate-resistant
  acid phosphatase 5b level increased particularly in the Synergy 1 group. The intervention
  did not lead to immunological response changes. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed supplementation
  beneficially altered bone metabolism, through increased bone formation rates and
  decreased bone resorption process rates. Supplementation of GFD with prebiotic oligofructose-enriched
  inulin may be a promising auxiliary therapy for bone metabolism improvements in
  children with CD."
