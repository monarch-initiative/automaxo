input_text: 'Diagnostic Delay of Celiac Disease in Childhood. Importance: The extent
  and factors associated with risk of diagnostic delay in pediatric celiac disease
  (CD) are poorly understood. Objectives: To investigate the diagnostic delay of CD
  in childhood, and to assess factors associated with this delay. Design, Setting,
  and Participants: Multicenter, retrospective, cross-sectional study (2010-2019)
  of pediatric (aged 0-18 years) patients with CD from 13 pediatric tertiary referral
  centers in Italy. Data were analyzed from January to June 2023. Main Outcomes and
  Measures: The overall diagnostic delay (ie, the time lapse occurring from the first
  symptoms or clinical data indicative of CD and the definitive diagnosis), further
  split into preconsultation and postconsultation diagnostic delay, were described.
  Univariable and multivariable linear regression models for factors associated with
  diagnostic delay were fitted. Factors associated with extreme diagnostic delay (ie,
  1.5 x 75th percentile) and misdiagnosis were assessed. Results: A total of 3171
  patients with CD were included. The mean (SD) age was 6.2 (3.9) years; 2010 patients
  (63.4%) were female; and 10 patients (0.3%) were Asian, 41 (1.3%) were Northern
  African, and 3115 (98.3%) were White. The median (IQR) overall diagnostic delay
  was 5 (2-11) months, and preconsultation and postconsultation diagnostic delay were
  2 (0-6) months and 1 (0-3) month, respectively. The median (IQR) extreme overall
  diagnostic delay (586 cases [18.5%]) was 11 (5-131) months, and the preconsultation
  and postconsultation delays were 6 (2-120) and 3 (1-131) months, respectively. Patients
  who had a first diagnosis when aged less than 3 years (650 patients [20.5%]) showed
  a shorter diagnostic delay, both overall (median [IQR], 4 [1-7] months for patients
  aged less than 3 years vs 5 [2-12] months for others) and postconsultation (median
  [IQR], 1 [0-2] month for patients aged less than 3 years vs 2 [0-4] months for others).
  A shorter delay was registered in male patients, both overall (median [IQR], 4 [1-10]
  months for male patients vs 5 [2-12] months for female patients) and preconsultation
  (median [IQR], 1 [0-6] month for male patients vs 2 [0-6] months for female patients).
  Family history of CD was associated with lower preconsultation delay (odds ratio
  [OR], 0.59; 95% CI, 0.47-0.74) and lower overall extreme diagnostic delay (OR, 0.75;
  95% CI, 0.56-0.99). Neurological symptoms (78 patients [21.5%]; OR, 1.35; 95% CI,
  1.03-1.78), gastroesophageal reflux (9 patients [28.1%]; OR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.02-3.42),
  and failure to thrive (215 patients [22.6%]; OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.31-2.00) showed
  a more frequent extreme diagnostic delay. A previous misdiagnosis (124 patients
  [4.0%]) was more frequently associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease, diarrhea,
  bloating, abdominal pain, constipation, fatigue, osteopenia, and villous atrophy
  (Marsh 3 classification). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study
  of pediatric CD, the diagnostic delay was rather short. Some factors associated
  with risk for longer diagnostic delay and misdiagnosis emerged, and these should
  be addressed in future studies.'
