input_text: 'Gluten-free diet affects fecal small non-coding RNA profiles and microbiome
  composition in celiac disease supporting a host-gut microbiota crosstalk. Current
  treatment for celiac disease (CD) is adhering to a gluten-free diet (GFD), although
  its long-term molecular effects are still undescribed. New molecular features detectable
  in stool may improve and facilitate noninvasive clinical management of CD. For this
  purpose, fecal small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) and gut microbiome profiles were
  concomitantly explored in CD subjects in relation to strict (or not) GFD adherence
  over time. In this observational study, we performed small RNA and shotgun metagenomic
  sequencing in stool from 63 treated CD (tCD) and 3 untreated subjects as well as
  66 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. tCD included 51 individuals on strict
  GFD and with negative transglutaminase (TG) serology (tCD-TG-) and 12 symptomatic
  with not strict/short-time of GFD adherence and positive TG serology (tCD-TG+).
  Samples from additional 40 healthy adult individuals and a cohort of 19 untreated
  pediatric CD subjects and 19 sex/age matched controls were analyzed to further test
  the outcomes. Several miRNA and microbial profiles were altered in tCD subjects
  (adj. p < .05). Findings were validated in the external group of adult controls.
  In tCD-TG-, GFD duration correlated with five miRNA levels (p < .05): for miR-4533-3p
  and miR-2681-3p, the longer the diet adherence, the less the expression differed
  from controls. tCD-TG+ and untreated pediatric CD patients showed a similar miRNA
  dysregulation. Immune-response, trans-membrane transport and cell death pathways
  were enriched in targets of identified miRNAs. Bifidobacterium longum, Ruminococcus
  bicirculans, and Haemophilus parainfluenzae abundances shifted (adj. p < .05) with
  a progressive reduction of denitrification pathways with GFD length. Integrative
  analysis highlighted 121 miRNA-bacterial relationships (adj. p < .05). Specific
  molecular patterns in stool characterize CD subjects, reflecting either the long-term
  GFD effects or the gut inflammatory status, in case of a not strict/short-time adherence.
  Our findings suggest novel host-microbial interplays and could help the discovery
  of biomarkers for GFD monitoring over time.'
