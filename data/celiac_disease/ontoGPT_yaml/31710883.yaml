input_text: Paroxismal non-kinesigenic dyskinesia and hemidystonia associated with
  silent celiac disease. Paroxismal non-kinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD) is a rare movement
  disorder manifesting as choreatic/dystonic movements, usually lasting from minutes
  to up to 4 h, with perserved consciousness during attacks. Primary PNKD are idiopathic
  or genetic disorders while secondary PNKD are associated with various neurologic
  and medical conditions. We present a case with PNKD and right sided hemidystonia
  in association with celiac disease, responsive to gluten-free diet, not previously
  reported in available literature. In conclusion, diagnostic tests for celiac disease
  should be a part of etiological investigations in patients with otherwise unexplained
  movement disorders including PKND. Gluten free diet could produce a favorable clinical
  response in those patients.
