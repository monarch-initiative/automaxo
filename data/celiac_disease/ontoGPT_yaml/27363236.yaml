input_text: 'Contemporary Dietary Practices: FODMAPs and Beyond. There is no diet
  that is recommended for all individuals. Some special diets (eg, gluten-free for
  celiac disease) are necessary for health and quality of life. Other diets may be
  recommended for a short period of time to aid in symptom relief but may not be recommended
  for the long- term (eg, LFD). Popular diets continue to come and go with varying
  levels of success. When considering adolescents, continued growth and development
  are most important, and restrictive diets can lead to nutrient inadequacies and
  poor growth. Before making any recommendation, it is important to consider the goal
  of the diet and the cost versus benefits associated with following the diet. Adherence
  is always a challenge, regardless of the type of diet implemented. If a special
  diet is not warranted for the health, safety, and desired quality of life of the
  individual, it should not be implemented.'
