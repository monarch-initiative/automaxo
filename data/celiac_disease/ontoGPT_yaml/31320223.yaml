input_text: Celiac Disease and Its Role in the Development of Metabolic Bone Disease.
  Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy that occurs in genetically
  susceptible hosts with the ingestion of gluten-containing products. Ongoing gluten
  consumption leads to intestinal damage, characterized by villous blunting and increased
  intraepithelial lymphocytes, resulting in malabsorption. Pertinent to the development
  of bone disease, malabsorption of calcium and vitamin D leads to secondary hyperparathyroidism
  and metabolic bone disease among individuals with CD. In this article, we review
  the pathogenesis of CD and the effects of malabsorption on bone health. Imbalances
  in bone resorption and formation particularly in individuals with CD and persistent
  disease activity ultimately lead to a state of bone loss and impaired mineralization.
  Initiation of a gluten-free diet is critical in the management of CD-related metabolic
  bone disease, demonstrating improvements in bone mineral density within the first
  year of dietary adherence.
