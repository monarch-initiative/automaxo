input_text: The Gluten-Free Diet for Celiac Disease and Beyond. The gluten-free diet
  (GFD) has gained popularity beyond its main medical indication as the treatment
  for gluten-induced immune-mediated disorders such as celiac disease (CD), dermatitis
  herpetiformis, gluten ataxia, wheat allergy, and non-celiac gluten sensitivity.
  However, the diet carries some disadvantages such as elevated costs, nutritional
  deficiencies, and social and psychological barriers. The present work aims to review
  indications, proven benefits, and adverse events of a gluten-free diet. Close follow-up
  with patients following the diet is recommended. More data is needed to assess the
  effectiveness of the diet in managing mental and cognitive disorders and to establish
  a connection between the brain and gluten.
