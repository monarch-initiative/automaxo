input_text: 'Titers of anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody correlate well with severity
  of villous abnormalities in celiac disease. GOALS: We reviewed our celiac disease
  (CeD) database to study if anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibody (ab) titers
  correlate with severity of villous abnormalities in Indian patients and to find
  out a cutoff value of anti-tTG ab fold-rise, which could best predict CeD. BACKGROUND:
  Guidelines for diagnosing CeD suggest that biopsy could be avoided in some patients
  with high anti-tTG ab titer. STUDY: We reviewed a cohort of 366 anti-tTG ab-positive
  individuals in whom duodenal biopsies were performed. Anti-tTG ab was obtained before
  initiation of gluten-free diet. Anti-tTG ab results were expressed in terms of fold-rise
  by calculating ratio of observed values with cutoff value. CeD was diagnosed if
  in addition to positive serology, patients had villous atrophy (>Marsh grade 2)
  and unequivocal response to gluten-free diet. RESULTS: The mean anti-tTG fold-rise
  in groups with Marsh grade <=2 was 2.6 (+-2.5), grade 3a was 4.0 (+-3.9), 3b was
  5.7 (+-5.1), and 3c was 11.8 (+-8.0). The positive likelihood ratio for diagnosing
  CeD was 15.4 and 27.4 at 12- and 14-fold-rise of anti-tTG ab titer, respectively.
  The positive predictive value of diagnosis of CeD was 100% when anti-tTG ab titer
  was 14-fold higher over the cutoff value. Fifty-seven (43.9%) individuals with anti-tTG
  titer rise <2-fold high also had CeD. CONCLUSIONS: As severity of villous abnormality
  increases, titer of anti-tTG also rises. Presence of villous atrophy can be predicted
  at very high anti-tTG ab titer. In contrast to emerging belief, mucosal biopsies
  should be performed even if anti-tTG ab titer is <2 times, because many patients
  with CeD have low titers.'
