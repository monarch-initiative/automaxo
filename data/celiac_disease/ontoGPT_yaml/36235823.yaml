input_text: The Update of the Italian Food Composition Database of Gluten-Free Products
  and Its Application in Food-Based Dietary Guidelines Menus. Complete food composition
  databases (FCDBs) on gluten-free (GF) foods are needed to assess the nutrient intakes
  of celiac disease patients. The aim of the present work was to update the previously
  developed version of the Italian GF-FCDB and to apply it to a theoretical GF diet.
  The updated GF-FCDB includes the composition of 108 GF cereal-based foods, as sold,
  in terms of energy and macro- and micro-nutrients, imputed using food label information
  combined with the standard recipe approach. Three scenarios (i.e., refined, mixed,
  and wholegrain cereals) of the weekly guideline menu for the general Italian population
  were analyzed for energy and nutrient content in a theoretical dietary assessment
  using traditional gluten-containing (GC) foods and the corresponding GF substitutes.
  All GF menus were higher than the corresponding GC menus in polyunsaturated fatty
  acids, linoleic acid, and vitamin E. Zinc was lower in GF than in GC menus only
  in the wholegrain-cereal scenario. Thanks to the application of the updated GF-FCDB
  including a comprehensive list of micronutrients, we observed that it is possible
  for celiac disease patients to meet nutrient requirements by simply substituting
  GC with GF cereal-based products following recommendations for the general population.
