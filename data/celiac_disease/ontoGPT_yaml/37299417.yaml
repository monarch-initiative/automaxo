input_text: "Determinants of Adherence to a Gluten-Free Diet in Children with Celiac
  Disease and the Influence of the Methods Used to Assess It. Lifelong adherence to
  a gluten-free diet (GFD) is the cornerstone of management of celiac disease (CD),
  but adhering to a GFD can be hard. Although several factors are positively associated
  with adherence of pediatric CD patients to a GFD, it is unknown whether these are
  influenced by variability caused by the specific tool used to assess adherence to
  a GFD. Here, we aimed to evaluate how individual patient characteristics and dietary
  counselling by a trained dietitian influence adherence to a GFD in children with
  CD, as assessed by two validated questionnaires: the Biagi questionnaire and the
  Leffler short questionnaire adapted for pediatric patients. Some 139 children and
  adolescents were recruited in a cross-sectional, multicenter study. Concordance
  between the two questionnaires in defining adherence was fair (weighted Cohen's
  kappa coefficient 0.39, 95%CI 0.19-0.60). Upon regression analysis, having a cohabiting
  family member with CD, being of Italian origin, and receiving specialized dietary
  counselling during follow-up were found to positively influence stricter adherence
  to a GFD for children with CD. Neither questionnaire detected a significant relationship
  between adherence to a GFD and the presence of symptoms after gluten ingestion.
  This study provides important new data on the factors influencing GFD adherence
  in the pediatric population, and highlights the importance of dietician input and
  overcoming language and cultural barriers when educating patients."
