input_text: " An autoimmune polyglandular syndrome complicated with celiac disease
  and autoimmune hepatitis.  Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome (APS) is a combination
  of different autoimmune diseases. The close relationship between immune-mediated
  disorders makes it mandatory to perform serological screening periodically in order
  to avoid delayed diagnosis of additional autoimmune diseases. We studied a patient
  with type 1 diabetes (T1D) who later developed an autoimmune thyroid disease (ATD)
  and was referred to our hospital with a serious condition of his clinical status.
  The patient was suffering from an advance stage of celiac disease (CD), the delay
  in its diagnosis and in the establishment of a gluten-free dietled the patient to
  a severe proteincalorie malnutrition. Later, the patient developed an autoimmune
  hepatitis (AIH). We consider that clinical deterioration in patients with APS should
  alert physicians about the possible presence of other immune-mediated diseases.
  Periodic screening for autoantibodies would help to prevent delayed diagnosis and
  would improve patient's quality of life. "
