input_text: 'The role of probiotics in the immune response and intestinal microbiota
  of children with celiac disease: a systematic review. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate changes
  in peripheral immunological response (decrease in blood proinflammatory cytokines)
  and fecal microbiota (especially Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes) after administration
  of probiotics in children with celiac disease on a gluten-free diet. DATA SOURCE:
  The databases MEDLINE, LILACS, Springer and SciELO were used for this review, with
  the descriptors "celiac disease AND probiotics". At the end of the search, 168 articles
  were retrieved, four of which were included in the final qualitative synthesis,
  having as inclusion criteria randomized clinical trials and pediatric population
  (1-19 years) and, as exclusion criteria, interventions other than probiotics, studies
  with patients with other diseases associated with celiac disease, or patients who
  did not meet the diagnostic criteria. All elected studies were published until September
  2020, without language restriction, with patients receiving strains of Bifidobacterium
  breve or B. longum and on a gluten-free diet. DATA SYNTHESIS: The studies show that
  the administration of probiotics along with a gluten-free diet, can approximate
  the fecal microbiota of celiac patients to typical conditions of healthy individuals,
  by restoring the abundance of some microbial communities that characterize the typical
  physiological condition. In addition, the administration of probiotics can reduce
  serum proinflammatory cytokines (mainly TNF-alpha). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the positive
  correlation between probiotics and fecal microbiota/serological markers in pediatric
  patients with celiac disease, we emphasize the need for future multicentric studies
  that should include a larger number of patients and a longer follow up period.'
