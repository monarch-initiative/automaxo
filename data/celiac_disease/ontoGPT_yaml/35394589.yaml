input_text: 'Consumption of Yeast-Fermented Wheat and Rye Breads Increases Colitis
  and Mortality in a Mouse Model of Colitis. BACKGROUND: Cereals are known to trigger
  for wheat allergy, celiac disease and non-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCWS). Inflammatory
  processes and intestinal barrier impairment are suspected to be involved in NCWS,
  although the molecular triggers are unclear. AIMS: We were interested if different
  bread types influence inflammatory processes and intestinal barrier function in
  a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: Epithelial caspase-8 gene
  knockout (Casp8DeltaIEC) and control (Casp8fl) mice were randomized to eight groups,
  respectively. The groups received different diets for 28 days (gluten-free diet,
  gluten-rich diet 5 g%, or different types of bread at 50 g%). Breads varied regarding
  grain, milling and fermentation. All diets were isocaloric. RESULTS: Regardless
  of the diet, Casp8DeltaIEC mice showed pronounced inflammation in colon compared
  to ileum, whereas Casp8fl mice were hardly inflamed. Casp8fl mice could tolerate
  all bread types. Especially yeast fermented rye and wheat bread from superfine flour
  but not pure gluten challenge increased colitis and mortality in Casp8DeltaIEC mice.
  Hepatic expression of lipopolysaccharide-binding protein and colonic expression
  of tumor necrosis factor-alpha genes were inversely related to survival. The bread
  diets, but not the gluten-rich diet, also decreased colonic tight junction expression
  to variable degrees, without clear association to survival and inflammation. CONCLUSIONS:
  Bread components, especially those from yeast-fermented breads from wheat and rye,
  increase colitis and mortality in Casp8DeltaIEC mice highly susceptible to intestinal
  inflammation, whereas control mice can tolerate all types of bread without inflammation.
  Yet unidentified bread components other than gluten seem to play the major role.'
