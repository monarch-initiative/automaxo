input_text: 'Celiac disease: What the Indian pediatricians know about the disease.
  To ascertain the knowledge, awareness, and practices pertaining to celiac disease
  (CD) among the Indian pediatricians. A survey link containing a questionnaire was
  shared through electronic mail using a pediatric database. The survey was kept active
  for 6 months; all responses received at the end of the survey were analyzed. Two
  hundred and seventy one pediatricians out of more than 10,000 chose to respond to
  the survey. Most pediatricians agreed that more patients with CD are being diagnosed
  than earlier. The reasons for higher detection of CD were perceived to be higher
  index of clinical suspicion by pediatricians (86.7%) followed by increased awareness
  among parents (45.8%). Most pediatricians opined that clinical manifestations which
  prompted to a diagnosis of CD were failure to thrive (96.2%) and chronic diarrhea
  (81.4%). Knowledge about atypical manifestations of celiac disease was low.  Though
  knowledge about the common association of CD with type 1 diabetes (62.1%) and autoimmune
  hepatitis (55.8%) was there, awareness about its association with other uncommon
  conditions was lacking. Though 68% of the pediatricians were of the opinion that
  the confirmation of diagnosis by a mucosal biopsy is necessary, 26.5% of respondents
  believed that only a positive serology was sufficient for a diagnosis. A trial of
  gluten-free diet (GFD) was thought to be a logical step if serology was positive
  by 31.3% of respondents. While 87.7% of pediatricians advocated lifelong adherence
  to GFD, 12.3% felt that GFD could be discontinued in the future. This web-based
  survey revealed that though pediatricians are seeing increasing number of celiac
  disease patients, there is a need to increase awareness regarding the disease, its
  associated conditions, the need for mucosal biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and
  the necessity of lifelong adherence to GFD.'
