input_text: 'Celiac autoimmunity in children with type 1 diabetes: a two-year follow-up.
  OBJECTIVE: To determine the benefits of screening for celiac autoimmunity via immunoglobulin
  A transglutaminase autoantibodies (TG) in children with type 1 diabetes (T1D). STUDY
  DESIGN: We followed up 79 screening-identified TG+ and 56 matched TG- children with
  T1D for 2 years to evaluate growth, bone mineral density, nutritional status, and
  diabetes control. TG+ subjects self-selected to gluten-free or gluten-containing
  diet. RESULTS: Of the initial cohort, 80% were available for reexamination after
  2 years. TG+ subjects had consistently lower weight z-scores and higher urine N-telopeptides
  than TG- subjects, but similar measures of bone density and diabetes outcomes. TG+
  children who remained on a gluten-containing diet had lower insulin-like growth
  factor binding protein 3 z-scores compared with TG+ subjects who reported following
  a gluten-free diet. Children who continued with high TG index throughout the study
  had lower bone mineral density z-scores, ferritin, and vitamin D 25OH levels, compared
  with the TG- group. CONCLUSIONS: No significant adverse outcomes were identified
  in children with T1D with screening-identified TG+ who delay therapy with a gluten-free
  diet for 2 years. Children with persistently high levels of TG may be at greater
  risk. The optimal timing of screening and treatment for celiac disease in children
  with T1D requires further investigation.'
