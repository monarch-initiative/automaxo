input_text: 'The changing clinical profile of celiac disease: a 15-year experience
  (1998-2012) in an Italian referral center. BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is a multiform,
  challenging condition characterized by extremely variable features. Our goal was
  to define clinical, serological and histopathological findings in a large cohort
  of celiacs diagnosed in a single referral center. METHODS: From January 1998 to
  December 2012, 770 patients (599 females, median age 36 years, range 18-78 years)
  were diagnosed as celiacs at St. Orsola-Malpighi Hospital (Bologna, Italy). The
  clinical phenotypes were classified as: 1) classical (malabsorption syndrome); 2)
  non-classical (extraintestinal and/or gastrointestinal symptoms other than diarrhea);
  3) subclinical. Serology, duodenal histology, comorbidities, response to gluten-free
  diet and complications were evaluated. RESULTS: Disease onset was symptomatic in
  610 patients (79%), while 160 celiacs showed a subclinical phenotype. In the symptomatic
  group the non-classical prevailed over the classical phenotype (66% vs 34%). Diarrhea
  was found in 27%, while other gastrointestinal manifestations were bloating (20%),
  aphthous stomatitis (18%), alternating bowel habit (15%), constipation (13%) and
  gastroesophageal reflux disease (12%). Extraintestinal manifestations included osteopenia/osteoporosis
  (52%), anemia (34%), cryptogenic hypertransaminasemia (29%) and recurrent miscarriages
  (12%). Positivity for IgA tissue transglutaminase antibodies was detected in 97%.
  Villous atrophy was found in 87%, while 13% had minor lesions consistent with potential
  celiac disease. A large proportion of patients showed autoimmune disorders, i.e.
  autoimmune thyroiditis (26.3%), dermatitis herpetiformis (4%) and diabetes mellitus
  type 1 (3%). Complicated celiac disease was very rare. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates
  that the clinical profile of celiac disease changed over time with an increasing
  rate of non-classical and subclinical phenotypes.'
