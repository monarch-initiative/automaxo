input_text: 'Mucosal Healing in Celiac Disease: Villous Architecture and Immunohistochemical
  Features in Children on a Long-Term Gluten Free Diet. Considerable heterogeneity
  exists across studies assessing intestinal mucosal recovery in celiac (CD) patients
  on a gluten-free diet (GFD). We aimed at investigating histological and immunohistochemical
  features in CD patients on a long-term GFD and to correlate them to the GFD duration.
  Morphometrical and immunohistochemical analysis were retrospectively performed on
  duodenal biopsies in three groups of children: 33 on a long-term (>2 years) GFD
  (GFD-group), four of which remained seropositive despite dietary adherence, 31 with
  villous atrophy (ACD-group) and 76 heathy, non-celiac (CTR-group). Moreover, in
  the GFD-group, we correlated immunohistochemical alterations to the GFD duration.
  The villous to crypt (V/C) ratio significantly improved after the GFD and completely
  normalized in all patients, becoming even higher than in the CTR-group (median value
  3.2 vs. 3, p = 0.007). In parallel, the number of CD3+ and TCRgammadelta+ cells
  in the epithelium were significantly reduced in the GFD compared to ACD patients,
  even if they remained higher than in the CTR-group (p < 0.05). In contrast, CD25+
  cells in the lamina propria significantly decreased after the GFD (p < 0.05) and
  become comparable to the CTR-group (p = 0.9). In the GFD-group there was no difference
  in the immunohistochemical parameters between seropositive and seronegative patients
  and alterations did not correlate to GFD length. In conclusion, a GFD is able to
  both restore a normal V/C ratio and reduce inflammation, but the epithelium maintains
  some stigmata of the disorder, such as an increased number of CD3+ and TCRgammadelta+
  cells. These alterations persist regardless of the duration of the GFD.'
