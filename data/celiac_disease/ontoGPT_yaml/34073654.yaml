input_text: 'Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity: An Update. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity
  (NCGS) is a clinical entity characterized by the absence of celiac disease and wheat
  allergy in patients that trigger reproducible symptomatic responses to gluten-containing
  foods consumption. Due to the lack of sensitive and reproducible biomarkers for
  NCGS diagnosis, placebo-controlled gluten challenges must be carried out for its
  diagnosis. The gluten challenges can be either double- or single-blind, for research
  or clinical practice purposes, respectively. For improving our understanding about
  the magnitude and relevance of NCGS in different populations, epidemiological studies
  based on self-report have been carried out. However, the gluten challenge-based
  prevalence of NCGS remains to be estimated. Since NCGS was recently recognized as
  a clinical entity, more studies are needed to delve into NCGS pathogenesis, for
  instance, the molecular interactions between the suspected cereal grain components
  that trigger NCGS, such as fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides, and polyols
  (FODMAPs) and amylase and trypsin inhibitors, and the immune system remains to be
  elucidated. Although still under debate, NCGS patients can be susceptible to only
  one or more than one of the NCGS triggers. The treatment of NCGS involves the dietary
  restriction of the suspected triggers of the disease, but there is controversial
  data about the effectiveness of different dietary interventions such as the gluten-free
  diet and low-FODMAP diet. Certainly, our understanding of NCGS is improving quickly
  due to the constant availability of new scientific information on this topic. Thus,
  the aim of the present narrative review is to present an up-to-date overview on
  NCGS from epidemiology to current therapy.'
