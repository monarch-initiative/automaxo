input_text: "Everyday life for women with celiac disease. The aim of this research
  was to explore how women with celiac disease experience everyday life. It is important
  that healthcare professionals understand what it is like to live with a chronic
  illness, and also the factors that affect the lives of women who have celiac disease.
  The study has a qualitative approach and the data were collected using interviews
  with 16 women. A conventional content analysis was used for the subjective interpretation
  of the qualitative interviews. Three main themes emerged in the analysis: illness
  trajectory and treatment, socializing with others, and feelings of loneliness and
  worry. The findings indicate that living with celiac disease affects the person's
  entire life from the past, in the present, and into the future, especially when
  daily routines must be altered. The women expressed a sense of loneliness and invisibility,
  especially when socializing with others. The diet could be a friend, enemy, obstacle,
  or opportunity in terms of enjoying a good life. Supporting women diagnosed with
  celiac disease appears to be a major task for healthcare professionals. Such professionals
  need to pay attention to women's symptoms, worries, and their feeling of being invisible. "
