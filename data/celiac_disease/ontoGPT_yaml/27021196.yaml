input_text: Current Status of Celiac Disease Drug Development. Celiac disease (CeD)
  is one of the most common immune-mediated diseases. Symptoms and disease activity
  are incompletely controlled by the gluten-free diet, which is currently the only
  available therapy. Although no therapies are yet approved, there is a growing field
  of candidates and an improving understanding of the regulatory pathway. In this
  review, we briefly discuss the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and current treatment
  paradigm for CeD. We also review the major classes of therapies being considered
  for CeD and discuss extensively what is known and can be surmised regarding the
  regulatory pathway for approval of a CeD therapeutic. The coming years will see
  an increasing number and diversity of potential therapies entering clinical trials
  and hopefully the first approved agents targeting this significant unmet medical
  need. Although biomarkers including histology and serology will always be important
  in therapeutic clinical trials, they currently lack the necessary evidence linking
  them to improved patient outcomes required for use as primary outcomes for drug
  approval. For this reason, patient-reported outcomes will likely be primary end
  points in Phase III CeD trials for the foreseeable future.
