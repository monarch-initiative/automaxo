input_text: 'Sieving out non-celiac gluten sensitivity amongst patients with irritable
  bowel syndrome. OBJECTIVES: It is challenging to make diagnosis of non-celiac gluten
  sensitivity/non-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCGS/NCWS) in clinical practice, since
  there is no biomarker and diagnosis is based on response to gluten-free-diet (GFD).
  We used anti-gliadin antibody (AGA) for screening patients with IBS for gluten-sensitivity.
  METHODS: 492 Adult-patients with IBS underwent screening for celiac disease and
  gluten-sensitivity using IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody and IgA-AGA and
  IgG-AGA, respectively. Patients with positive AGA (IgA and/or IgG) were invited
  to follow GFD, those willing were put on GFD for 6-weeks. Responsive patients were
  given gluten re-challenge. Diagnosis of NCGS was confirmed if they had recurrence
  of symptoms. RESULTS: Of 492 patients with IBS, AGA was positive in 61(12.4 %),
  hence suspected to have gluten-sensitivity. Of 31 who agreed to participate and
  followed GFD for 6-weeks, 17 (54.8 %) had complete (>30 % improvement) and 10(32.2
  %) had partial (>20 % improvement) response. All 17 complete-responders were given
  gluten re-challenge for 6-weeks, symptoms recurred in all and hence were confirmed
  to have NCGS/NCWS. Significant decrease in AGA levels occurred almost in all GFD-responders.
  CONCLUSIONS: 12.4 % IBS patients have biological evidence of gluten/wheat-sensitivity.
  Almost 87 % patients with IBS having AGA responded to GFD. The value of AGA may
  further be explored as a biomarker for screening for the presence of NCGS, before
  recommending this test for the clinical practice.'
