input_text: 'Small Amounts of Gluten in Subjects With Suspected Nonceliac Gluten Sensitivity:
  A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Cross-Over Trial. BACKGROUND & AIMS:
  There is debate over the existence of nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) intestinal
  and extraintestinal symptoms in response to ingestion of gluten-containing foods
  by people without celiac disease or wheat allergy. We performed a randomized, double-blind,
  placebo-controlled, cross-over trial to determine the effects of administration
  of low doses of gluten to subjects with suspected NCGS. METHODS: We enrolled 61
  adults without celiac disease or a wheat allergy who believed ingestion of gluten-containing
  food to be the cause of their intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms. Participants
  were assigned randomly to groups given either 4.375 g/day gluten or rice starch
  (placebo) for 1 week, each via gastrosoluble capsules. After a 1-week gluten-free
  diet, participants crossed over to the other group. The primary outcome was the
  change in overall (intestinal and extraintestinal) symptoms, determined by established
  scoring systems, between gluten and placebo intake. A secondary outcome was the
  change in individual symptom scores between gluten vs placebo. RESULTS: According
  to the per-protocol analysis of data from the 59 patients who completed the trial,
  intake of gluten significantly increased overall symptoms compared with placebo
  (P = .034). Abdominal bloating (P = .040) and pain (P = .047), among the intestinal
  symptoms, and foggy mind (P = .019), depression (P = .020), and aphthous stomatitis
  (P = .025), among the extraintestinal symptoms, were significantly more severe when
  subjects received gluten than placebo. CONCLUSIONS: In a cross-over trial of subjects
  with suspected NCGS, the severity of overall symptoms increased significantly during
  1 week of intake of small amounts of gluten, compared with placebo. Clinical trial
  no: ISRCTN72857280.'
