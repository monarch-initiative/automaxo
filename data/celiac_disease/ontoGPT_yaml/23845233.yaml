input_text: 'Risk of colorectal neoplasia in patients with celiac disease: a multicenter
  study. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The association of celiac disease with colorectal neoplasia
  is controversial. The aim of this study was to determine the risk of colorectal
  neoplasia among patients with celiac disease. METHODS: We carried out a multicenter,
  retrospective case-control study, within four community hospitals. Celiac disease
  patients with a complete colonoscopy were regarded as cases and those without celiac
  disease as controls. For each case, two controls matched for age, sex, indication
  for colonoscopy and colorectal cancer family history, were randomly selected. The
  main outcome evaluated was risk of colorectal polyps, adenomas, advanced neoplastic
  lesions and cancer. RESULTS: We identified 118 patients with celiac disease and
  236 controls. The risk of polyps, adenomas and advanced neoplastic lesions was similar
  in both groups (OR 1.25, CI 0.71-2.18, p=0.40; OR 1.39, CI 0.73-2.63, p=0.31; and
  OR 1.00, CI 0.26-3.72, p=1.00, respectively). On multivariate analysis, age >75
  years old, and first-grade CRC family history were associated with adenomas (OR
  2.68 CI 1.03-6.98, OR 6.68 CI 1.03-47.98 respectively) and advanced neoplastic lesions
  (OR 15.03, CI 2.88-78.3; OR 6.46 CI 1.23-33.79, respectively). With respect to celiac
  disease characteristic, a low adherence to a gluten free diet was independently
  associated with the presence of adenomas (OR 6.78 CI 1.39-33.20 p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS:
  Celiac disease was not associated with an increased risk of colorectal neoplasia.
  Nonadherence to a strict gluten free diet was associated with the presence of adenomas.
  Further studies addressing celiac disease characteristics are needed to confirm
  this observation.'
