input_text: 'Plasma Alkylresorcinols Reflect Gluten Intake and Distinguish between
  Gluten-Rich and Gluten-Poor Diets in a Population at Risk of Metabolic Syndrome.
  BACKGROUND: Many patients with celiac disease experience difficulties in adherence
  to a gluten-free diet. Methods for testing compliance to a gluten-free diet are
  costly and cumbersome. Thus, a simple biomarker of gluten intake is needed in a
  clinical setting and will be useful for epidemiologic studies investigating wider
  effects of gluten intake. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate plasma total alkylresorcinol
  concentrations as a measure of gluten intake. METHODS: In this randomized, controlled,
  crossover intervention study in 52 Danish adults with features of the metabolic
  syndrome, we compared 8 wk of a gluten-rich and gluten-poor diet separated by a
  washout period of >=6 wk. We measured fasting plasma concentrations of alkylresorcinols
  to determine if they reflected differences in gluten intake as a secondary outcome
  of the original study. In addition, we investigated in 118 Danish adults the cross-sectional
  association between self-reported gluten intake and plasma alkylresorcinols in the
  same and a similar study at baseline. We used mixed-model ANCOVA for examining treatment
  effects, a classification tree to determine compliance to the gluten-poor diet,
  and linear regression models for examining baseline correlation between plasma alkylresorcinol
  concentrations and gluten intake. RESULTS: Plasma total alkylresorcinols decreased
  more during the gluten-poor period (geometric mean: -124.8 nmol/L; 95% CI: -156.5,
  -93.0 nmol/L) than in the gluten-rich period (geometric mean: -31.8 nmol/L; 95%
  CI: -63.1, -0.4 nmol/L) (P < 0.001). On the basis of the plasma alkylresorcinol
  profile, we built a classification tree to objectively determine compliance and
  found an overall participant misclassification error of 3.9%. In the cross-sectional
  study we found a 5.6% (95% CI: 2.4%, 8.9%) increase in plasma total alkylresorcinols
  per 1-g increase in reported gluten intake (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: We propose the
  use of plasma alkylresorcinols to monitor compliance to a gluten-free diet as well
  as to help investigations into the possible effects of gluten in the wider population.
  This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT017119913 and NCT01731366.'
