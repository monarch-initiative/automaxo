input_text: "Celiac patients' attitudes regarding novel therapies. BACKGROUND: The
  only current treatment for celiac disease (CD) is a gluten-free diet (GFD). Novel
  therapies are in development to supplement or replace a GFD. Knowledge of patients'
  attitudes toward these therapies is limited. The aim of this study was to determine
  attitudes about novel therapies in securely diagnosed patients with CD on a GFD
  and to correlate factors associated with these attitudes. METHODS: A survey was
  created with two scenarios: a novel therapy that protects against cross contamination
  while on a GFD and one that allows intentional gluten consumption. The survey also
  included the Celiac Dietary Adherence Test and the CD Quality of Life (QOL) surveys.
  RESULTS: A total of 182/284 (64%) CD patients completed the survey. Significantly
  more respondents would take a novel therapy to protect against cross contamination
  compared with one that allows intentional gluten consumption (87% vs. 65%; P<0.001).
  This difference was significant among women but not men. In both scenarios, protection
  against bowel inflammation was significantly more important than symptom control,
  and side effects were more important than cost. For a novel therapy that would allow
  intentional gluten consumption, a one-time injection was preferred over a daily
  pill, and patients willing to take this therapy had significantly lower QOL scores.
  CONCLUSIONS: CD patients on a GFD are interested in novel therapies. There were
  notable differences in attitudes by gender and QOL. Considering patient preferences,
  drugs with daily or less frequent dosing that protect against bowel inflammation
  from gluten cross contamination would be best accepted."
