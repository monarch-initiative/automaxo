input_text: "REVIEW OF CELIAC DISEASE PRESENTATION IN A PEDIATRIC TERTIARY CENTRE.
  BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is an immune-mediated disorder with a multiform presentation
  and therefore a challenging diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: Our purpose is to identify the
  epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and histologic characteristics of children
  with celiac disease at diagnosis and on follow-up. METHODS: Children with previously
  established or newly diagnosed celiac disease, admitted in a tertiary centre in
  a two-year period (2014-2016) were recruited. Data was collected retrospectively
  from electronic medical records and clinical notes, and subsequently analysed with
  SPSS version 20.0. RESULTS: A total of 159 patients, out of 312, were included.
  Age ranged from 1 to 17 years (mean +- SD: 8.5+-4.5 years, 69% girls). Disease presentation
  was classical in 60%, non-classical in 25%, subclinical in 10% and 5% classified
  as potential celiac disease. Non-classical and subclinical profiles had a higher
  mean age at presentation but not statistically significant (P-value 0.24). The most
  frequent gastrointestinal features at presentation were abdominal pain (58%), diarrhea
  (43%) and bloating (27%). A positive family history for celiac disease was present
  in 24% (n=35). We found anaemia in 23%, low ferritin in 63% and a moderate to severe
  deficiency of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in 62%. celiac disease -specific serologic testing
  and esophagogastroduodenoscopy were performed in 99%. Histology revealed modified
  Marsh 2 or 3 enteropathy in 94%, the remaining had normal histology but positive
  human leukocyte antigen typing. Clinical improvement at 12 months of gluten-free
  diet was complete in 51% and partial in 49%. IgA tTG normalized after 12-30 months
  of gluten-free diet in 45%. On growth assessment at diagnosis and after 12-28 months
  of gluten-free diet, 100% had height increase (mean +-SD: 7.11+-4.43 cm) and 96%
  weight gain (mean +-SD: 5.60+-4.91 kg). CONCLUSION: Our findings outline the diverse
  clinical presentations of pediatric celiac disease that should be considered irrespective
  of age. Increased clinician's awareness will enable an early diagnosis and treatment,
  with subsequent symptom and nutritional status improvement."
