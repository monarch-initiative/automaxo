input_text: Late diagnosis of celiac disease in an asymptomatic infant with growth
  failure. The clinical spectrum for celiac disease (CD) is broad and includes cases
  with either typical (intestinal) or atypical (extraintestinal) features, often making
  the diagnosis of CD very difficult.We describe the case of a girl presenting with
  stunted growth and malnourishment. She was evaluated at 14 months for decreased
  growth rate without any signs of gastrointestinal, renal or endocrine disorders.
  She was evaluated for CD, but resulted negative for anti-tTG antibodies.At the age
  of 4.1 years, she exhibited basal dental enamel hypoplasia, iron deficiency anaemia
  despite repeated iron supplementation, with persistent reduced height (-2.79 SDS),
  BMI (-0.76 SDS), growth velocity (-1.79 SDS) and delayed bone age (1.5 year). The
  CD screening was repeated and very high anti-tTG-IgA (128 IU/ml, normal values <
  7 IU/ml) and anti-tTG-IgG (77 IU/ml, normal values < 7 IU/ml) values were found.
  HLA genotyping revealed an HLA DQ2 haplotype. A duodenal biopsy revealed severe
  villous atrophy with crypt hyperplasia and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes
  (> 40 IELs/100 epithelial cells) confirming the diagnosis of CD. A gluten-free diet
  was started and after only four months, her growth velocity increased from 4.83
  cm/year (-1.79 SDS) to 6.53 cm/year (-0.15 SDS).In conclusion, we report the development
  of a positive serology for CD in an asymptomatic child with growth retardation,
  who previously was investigated for CD and resulted negative. Therefore, when faced
  with retarded growth in young patients, after excluding other malabsorption conditions
  and even when CD serological markers are negative, the paediatric endocrinologist
  should request HLA genotyping, before the intestinal biopsy, in order to check for
  the presence of risk alleles.
