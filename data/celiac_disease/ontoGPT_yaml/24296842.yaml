input_text: 'Drug absorption in celiac disease. PURPOSE: Published evidence on established
  and theorized effects of celiac disease on drug absorption and pharmacokinetics
  is reviewed. SUMMARY: Patients with celiac disease develop a variety of gastric
  disorders requiring oral medications, but the impact of damage to intestinal villi
  and other celiac disease sequelae on drug absorption remains poorly understood.
  A review of the pertinent literature (English-language articles on research in adults
  published during the period 1970-August 2012) identified several reports of altered
  drug absorption mechanisms in patients with celiac disease, including accelerated
  or delayed gastric emptying, increased permeability of jejunal mucosa, changes in
  intraluminal pH, decreased intestinal surface area, and reduced intestinal cytochrome
  P-450 enzymes. A small number of published studies suggest that celiac disease may
  be associated with altered drug absorption, resulting in higher serum concentrations
  of propranolol, lower peak concentrations of acetaminophen and practolol, higher
  dosing requirements with levothyroxine, impaired or delayed absorption of certain
  antibiotics, and other pharmacokinetic effects with a potential impact on medication
  efficacy and toxicity. However, these studies involved very small patient samples
  and were poorly controlled, with some yielding contradictory results. More and larger
  pharmacokinetic studies in patients with celiac disease-especially studies of drugs
  that are dosed empirically or are not amenable to dosage adjustment according to
  vital signs or laboratory values-are needed. CONCLUSION: Given the sometimes conflicting
  data on drug absorption in the context of celiac disease, cautious medication selection,
  dosage adjustment, and monitoring for efficacy and potential adverse effects are
  advised.'
