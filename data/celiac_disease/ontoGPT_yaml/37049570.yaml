input_text: Evaluation of the Usefulness of an Automatable Immunoassay for Monitoring
  Celiac Disease by Quantification of Immunogenic Gluten Peptides in Urine. A gluten-free
  diet (GFD) is currently the only treatment available for patients with celiac disease
  (CD). However, adherence to a GFD can be challenging because gluten is present in
  many foods. A lifelong follow-up of patients with CD must be performed to promote
  adherence to a GFD and to identify the appearance of symptoms and the associated
  diseases. Therefore, the development of tools to analyze gluten exposure in these
  patients is important. This study proposes the development of the first automatable
  ELISA to monitor adherence to a GFD through the quantification of urine gluten immunogenic
  peptides (u-GIP). Seven healthy volunteers without suspicion of CD and 23 patients
  with CD were monitored as part of this study to optimize, validate, and apply this
  assay. Non-interference was found in the urine matrix, and the recovery percentage
  for spiked samples was 81-101%. The u-GIP was stable for up to 16 days when the
  samples were stored at different temperatures. Overall, 100% of the patients had
  detectable u-GIP at diagnosis (range of 0.39-2.14 ng GIP/mL), which reduced to 27%
  after 12 months on a GFD. Therefore, this highly sensitive immunoassay would allow
  the analysis of u-GIP from a large battery of samples in clinical laboratories of
  specialized healthcare centers.
