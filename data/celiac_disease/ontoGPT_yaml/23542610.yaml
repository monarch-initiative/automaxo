input_text: 'Chemiluminescence and ELISA-based serum assays for diagnosing and monitoring
  celiac disease in children: a comparative study. BACKGROUND: Anti-transglutaminase
  (tTG) or anti-deamidated gliadin peptides (DGP) serum determination is the first
  step in diagnosing celiac disease (CD). Our aims were to: compare the performance
  of novel chemiluminescent tool in the detection of tTG and DGP (Q-Flash , Inova)
  with that of the established ELISA (Q-Lite , Inova) methods; identify the more reliable
  index for making a sound diagnosis and monitoring therapy. METHODS: Using Q-Flash  and
  Q-Lite , IgA and IgG class tTG and DGP were measured in the sera of 155 CD pediatric
  patients and 166 healthy age-matched controls. Forty-two of the patients had a follow-up
  one year after starting gluten free diet (GFD). RESULTS: Q-Flash  IgA tTG, the more
  accurate (intra-assay CV for low, intermediate and high values: 2.2%, 1.6%, and
  1.1%; inter-assay CV: 2.8%, 4%, and 3%), sensitive (96.1%) and specific (97%) test
  for diagnosing CD, was the only variable to be significantly correlated with CD
  at binary logistic regression analysis (r=0.263, p<0.0001, Exp(B)=1.0506, 95% CI=1.0286-1.0731).
  Q-Flash  IgA tTG or DGP screen were more accurate than Q-Lite  IgA tTG in monitoring
  CD patients on GFD (p=0.003). CONCLUSION: Q- Flash  IgA tTG measurement is an extremely
  precise, sensitive and specific index for not only diagnosing CD, but also monitoring
  therapy.'
