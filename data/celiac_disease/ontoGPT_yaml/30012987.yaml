input_text: Effects of a Gluten-Containing Meal on Gastric Emptying and Gallbladder
  Contraction. The ingestion of gluten has been associated with gastrointestinal symptoms
  even in the absence of detectable immune responses. Little is known about the pathophysiological
  effects of gluten on the upper gastrointestinal tract. We aimed to assess whether
  the ingestion of gluten leads to an impairment of the physiological mechanisms of
  gastric emptying, gallbladder contraction and relaxation. A total of 17 healthy
  subjects underwent ultrasound evaluation of gastric emptying dynamics and gallbladder
  contractions at baseline and every 30 min after a standard gluten-containing and
  gluten-free meal (250 kcal, 70% carbohydrates). The pattern of gastric emptying
  was similar after a standard meal with or without gluten, but differed in terms
  of the peak of the antral filling curve, which was wider (mean area 5.69, median
  4.70, range 3.71-9.27 cm2 vs. mean 4.89, median 4.57, 2.27-10.22 cm2, p = 0.023)
  after the gluten-containing meal. The pattern of gallbladder contractions was different
  after the gluten-free meal (p < 0.05), with higher gallbladder volumes in the late
  refilling phases. The results of this study show that gluten ingestion exerts objective
  effects on gastric and gallbladder motility. Although the underlying pathophysiological
  mechanism remains unknown, these results could account for some of the gluten-related
  symptoms reported by patients with celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity.
