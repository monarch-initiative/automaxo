input_text: 'Gluten-related disorders: certainties, questions and doubts. In the last
  decade, the ingestion of gluten, a heterogeneous complex of proteins present in
  wheat, rice, barley and probably in oats, has been associated with clinical disorders,
  such as celiac disease, wheat allergy and recently to non-celiac gluten sensitivity
  or wheat intolerance syndrome. Gluten-related disorders, which are becoming epidemiologically
  relevant with an estimated global prevalence of about 5%, require the exclusion
  of gluten from the diet. For the past 5 years, an important shift in the availability
  of gluten-free products, together with increased consumption in the general population,
  has been recorded and is estimated to be about 12-25%. Many people follow a self-prescribed
  gluten-free diet, despite the fact that the majority have not first been previously
  excluded, or confirmed, as having gluten disorders. They rely on claims that a gluten-free
  diet improves general health. In this review, we provide an overview of the clinical
  disorders related to gluten or wheat ingestion, pointing out the current certainties,
  open questions, possible answers and several doubts in the management of these conditions.
  KEY MESSAGE Incidence of gluten-related disorders is increased in the last decade
  and self-diagnosis is frequent with inappropriate starting of a gluten-free diet.
  Gluten and wheat are considered as the most important triggers to coeliac disease,
  wheat allergy and non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Pediatricians, allergologist and
  gastroenterologist are involved in the management of these conditions and appropriate
  diagnostic protocols are required.'
