input_text: 'Evaluation of the ESPGHAN Celiac Guidelines in a North American Pediatric
  Population. OBJECTIVES: We retrospectively examined the performance of the tissue
  transglutaminase (TTG), endomysial antibody (EMA) tests, and the ESPGHAN (European
  Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition) nonbiopsy criteria
  in a pediatric population. METHODS: Consecutive celiac serologies and corresponding
  intestinal biopsy results were obtained on children <18 years old over 3.5 years.
  Patients were classified into three categories: positive TTG, negative TTG, and
  IgA deficiency. RESULTS: Of the 17,505 patients with celiac serology performed,
  775 had a positive TTG, 574 with a negative TTG were biopsied, and 25 were IgA deficient.
  Of the patients with a TTG >=10 x upper limit of normal (ULN), positive EMA, and
  symptoms, 98.2% had biopsies consistent with celiac disease (CD). Four human leukocyte
  antigen (HLA) DQ2/DQ8-positive patients who met the ESPGHAN nonbiopsy criteria did
  not have CD. In the group with a TTG 3-10 x ULN, 75.7% EMA-positive patients and
  only 40% EMA-negative patients had CD (P<0.001). Of those with a TTG 1-3 x ULN,
  52.2% EMA-positive patients vs. only 13.3% EMA-negative patients had CD (P<0.01).
  Of the patients with bulbar and duodenal biopsies, 9.8% had CD confined only in
  the bulb, especially those with a low titer TTG (P<0.01). CD prevalence in our cohort
  was 34.6%. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of the TTG were
  98.7%, 86.4%, and 79.4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The TTG is a very sensitive
  screen for CD, but positive predictive value improves with a positive EMA titer.
  To apply the new ESPGHAN guidelines, clinicians must understand the performance
  of their celiac serology tests.'
