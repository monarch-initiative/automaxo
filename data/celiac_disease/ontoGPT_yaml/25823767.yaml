input_text: 'Evaluation of the ESPGHAN Celiac Guidelines in a North American Pediatric
  Population. OBJECTIVES: We retrospectively examined the performance of the tissue
  transglutaminase (TTG), endomysial antibody (EMA) tests, and the ESPGHAN (European
  Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition) nonbiopsy criteria
  in a pediatric population. METHODS: Consecutive celiac serologies and corresponding
  intestinal biopsy results were obtained on children <18 years old over 3.5 years.
  Patients were classified into three categories: positive TTG, negative TTG, and
  IgA deficiency. RESULTS: Of the 17,505 patients with celiac serology performed,
  775 had a positive TTG, 574 with a negative TTG were biopsied, and 25 were IgA deficient.
  Of the patients with a TTG >=10 x upper limit of normal (ULN), positive EMA, and
  symptoms, 98.2% had biopsies consistent with celiac disease (CD). Four human leukocyte
  antigen (HLA) DQ2/DQ8-positive patients who met the ESPGHAN nonbiopsy criteria did
  not have CD. In the group with a TTG 3-10 x ULN, 75.7% EMA-positive patients and
  only 40% EMA-negative patients had CD (P<0.001). Of those with a TTG 1-3 x ULN,
  52.2% EMA-positive patients vs. only 13.3% EMA-negative patients had CD (P<0.01).
  Of the patients with bulbar and duodenal biopsies, 9.8% had CD confined only in
  the bulb, especially those with a low titer TTG (P<0.01). CD prevalence in our cohort
  was 34.6%. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of the TTG were
  98.7%, 86.4%, and 79.4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The TTG is a very sensitive
  screen for CD, but positive predictive value improves with a positive EMA titer.
  To apply the new ESPGHAN guidelines, clinicians must understand the performance
  of their celiac serology tests.'

  Note: The text primarily focuses on the evaluation of diagnostic criteria and methods for Celiac Disease, rather than detailing specific treatments or symptoms. It discusses the sensitivity and predictive value of TTG and EMA tests in diagnosing Celiac Disease and evaluates the ESPGHAN guidelines' applicability in a pediatric population.
