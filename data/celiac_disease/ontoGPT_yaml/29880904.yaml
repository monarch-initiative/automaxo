input_text: 'Oxidative stress as a biomarker for monitoring treated celiac disease.
  INTRODUCTION: High levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and impaired antioxidant
  defense systems lead to oxidative stress (OxS) and tissue injury in different intestinal
  and extra intestinal conditions, including celiac disease (CD). The aim of the present
  study was to investigate the role and potential use of ROS and other biomarkers
  of OxS in the clinical management of CD. METHODS: We collected duodenal specimens
  and blood samples from naive patients (N-CD), patients on a gluten free diet (GFD)
  including responders (CD-GFD) and non-responders (NRCD). We measured plasmatic ROS
  production (electron paramagnetic resonance, EPR), lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric
  acid-reactive substances, TBARS), protein oxidation (protein carbonyl, PC), total
  antioxidant capacity (TAC), nitric oxides and glutathione (GSH) in erythrocytes.
  RESULTS: Fifty-four patients affected by CD were enrolled (17 N-CD, 18 CD-GFD and
  19 NRCD; 44 F; age 44 +- 13 years). A significant increase of plasmatic OxS biomarkers
  (ROS, peroxidated lipids, oxidized proteins, and nitrate concentrations) and decrease
  of antioxidant species (TAC and GSH levels) were found in NRCD and N-CD compared
  to CD-GFD. Comparably, a significant direct relationship between the severity of
  duodenal atrophy, ROS production rates and TBARS was found; conversely, TAC and
  GSH presented an inverse correlation. DISCUSSION: OxS is involved in CD tissue damage
  and correlates with the degree of duodenal atrophy. These findings suggest the possible
  role of OxS biomarkers as indicators of CD activity during the clinical follow-up.'
