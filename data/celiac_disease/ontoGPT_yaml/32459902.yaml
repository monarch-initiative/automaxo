input_text: '[Gluten-free diet in the treatment of extra-intestinal forms of gluten
  intolerance]. Following a gluten-free diet is recommended by clinical guidelines
  in the presence of gluten intolerance. However, due to the variety of clinical picture
  of various forms of intolerance, the elimination of gluten occurs not always timely.
  There are also diseases that classic treatment regimen does not include diet therapy,
  however, studies have confirmed the effectiveness of its use. The aim of the research
  - to study current data on the effectiveness of a gluten-free diet for extra-intestinal
  manifestations of gluten intolerance. Material and methods. Literature data concerning
  the effectiveness of including a gluten-free diet in the treatment of various diseases
  according to the PubMed and eLIBRARY portal were studied. Results. Modern data on
  the forms of gluten intolerance and their clinical manifestations are presented.
  The results of both randomized studies and individual clinical cases of gluten intolerance
  that occurred under the guise of other diseases are presented. A clinical case of
  an acute onset of the disease - celiac crisis, accompanied by acute diarrheal syndrome
  with subsequent malabsorption and progressive loss of body weight, anasarca and
  electrolyte disorders is considered. Neurological and psycho-neurological manifestations
  of celiac disease are described, including current data on the results of including
  a glutenfree diet in the treatment of autism spectrum disorders. The question of
  using dietary therapy for autism remains controversial to nowadays. The article
  outlines the arguments of supporters and opponents of excluding gluten in this pathology.
  Particular attention is paid to the diagnosis of gluten intolerance in patients
  with hematological disorders. The significance of a complete survey to identify
  celiac disease and timely diet therapy of the disease under stunted growth in children,
  after excluding other causes of malabsorption and even in the presence of negative
  serological markers of celiac disease is shown. The article also contains information
  on the pathology of kidneys and reproductive system, which were leveled only after
  the exclusion of gluten from the diet. Conclusion. The presented cases demonstrate
  a wide variety of clinical forms of gluten intolerance, examples of diagnostic search
  and dynamics of the clinical picture with the timely appointment of a gluten-free
  diet are given.'
