input_text: 'Gynecological Disorders in Patients with Non-celiac Wheat Sensitivity.
  BACKGROUND: Non-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCWS) most frequently presents clinically
  with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like symptoms, although many extra-intestinal
  manifestations have also been attributed to it. No studies to date have evaluated
  the presence and frequency of gynecological symptoms in NCWS. AIM: To evaluate the
  frequency of gynecological disorders in patients with NCWS. PATIENTS AND METHODS:
  Sixty-eight women with NCWS were included in the study. A questionnaire investigating
  gynecological symptoms and recurrent cystitis was administered, and patients reporting
  symptoms were then examined by specialists. Three control groups were selected:
  52 patients with IBS not related to NCWS, 56 patients with celiac disease (CD),
  and 71 healthy controls. RESULTS: 59% of the patients with NCWS showed gynecological
  symptoms, a higher frequency than in healthy controls (P = 0.04), IBS controls (P
  = 0.01) and CD controls (P = 0.02). Menstrual cycle alterations were more frequent
  in patients with NCWS than in healthy controls (26.5% vs 11.3%; P = 0.03); the patients
  with NCWS suffered from recurrent vaginitis (16%) and dyspareunia (6%) significantly
  more frequently than healthy controls. Twenty-nine percent of patients with NCWS
  reported recurrent cystitis, a finding higher than in the control groups (vs healthy
  P = 0.0001, vs IBS P = 0.001, vs CD controls P = 0.04). Microbiological examinations
  were negative in most of the patients with NCWS and recurrent vaginitis or cystitis.
  During the 1-year follow-up, 46% of patients with menstrual disorders and 36% with
  recurrent vaginitis reported resolution of symptoms on a wheat-free diet. CONCLUSIONS:
  Patients with NCWS showed a significantly higher frequency of gynecological symptoms
  and recurrent cystitis than patients with IBS.'
