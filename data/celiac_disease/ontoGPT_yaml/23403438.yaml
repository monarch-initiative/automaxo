input_text: 'Celiac disease-associated autoimmune hepatitis in childhood: long-term
  response to treatment. OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease (CD) is common in patients with
  autoimmune liver disease (AILD); however, the long-term response to treatment of
  patients with AILDs coexistent with CD has not been explored in detail. The aim
  of the present study was to analyze the features and the long-term response to immunosuppressive
  treatment in children with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) associated with CD. METHODS:
  Retrospective and prospective evaluation of patients followed at a single center.
  RESULTS: Among 79 patients with AIH, 15 (19%) had CD (9 type 1, 3 type 2, 3 seronegative).
  In the group of patients with AIH and CD, female sex was significantly more represented
  than in the group of patients with AIH alone; also, in the former group, diagnosis
  was made significantly earlier (P < 0.05). All of the 15 patients on a gluten-free
  diet achieved sustained remission when treated with prednisone and azathioprine
  or cyclosporine. The mean period of follow-up was 73 months; discontinuation of
  therapy was attempted in 9 patients while in remission: 4 patients relapsed, 5 (33%)
  could definitively stop immunosuppressive treatment with a mean period of treatment-free
  sustained remission of 89 months (range 26-174). In the same period, treatment discontinuation,
  attempted in 24 of 64 patients with AIH without CD, was successful in 5 patients
  (8%; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AIH coexisting with CD achieve treatment-free
  sustained remission in a significantly higher proportion, when compared with patients
  with AIH without CD, suggesting a possible long-term adjuvant effect of a gluten-free
  diet.'
