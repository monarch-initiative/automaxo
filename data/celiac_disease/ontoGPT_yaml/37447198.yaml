input_text: "Metabolomic Profiling in Children with Celiac Disease: Beyond the Gluten-Free
  Diet. Celiac disease (CD) is included in the group of complex or multifactorial
  diseases, i.e., those caused by the interaction of genetic and environmental factors.
  Despite a growing understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease,
  diagnosis is still often delayed and there are no effective biomarkers for early
  diagnosis. The only current treatment, a gluten-free diet (GFD), can alleviate symptoms
  and restore intestinal villi, but its cellular effects remain poorly understood.
  To gain a comprehensive understanding of CD's progression, it is crucial to advance
  knowledge across various scientific disciplines and explore what transpires after
  disease onset. Metabolomics studies hold particular significance in unravelling
  the complexities of multifactorial and multisystemic disorders, where environmental
  factors play a significant role in disease manifestation and progression. By analyzing
  metabolites, we can gain insights into the reasons behind CD's occurrence, as well
  as better comprehend the impact of treatment initiation on patients. In this review,
  we present a collection of articles that showcase the latest breakthroughs in the
  field of metabolomics in pediatric CD, with the aim of trying to identify CD biomarkers
  for both early diagnosis and treatment monitoring. These advancements shed light
  on the potential of metabolomic analysis in enhancing our understanding of the disease
  and improving diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. More studies need to be designed
  to cover metabolic profiles in subjects at risk of developing the disease, as well
  as those analyzing biomarkers for follow-up treatment with a GFD."
