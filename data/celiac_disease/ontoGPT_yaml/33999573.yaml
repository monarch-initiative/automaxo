input_text: 'The effect of gluten on skin and hair: a systematic review. Non-celiac
  gluten sensitivity is often clinically indistinguishable from celiac disease, and
  patients show improvement or resolution of their symptoms with a gluten-free diet.
  In contrast to celiac disease, the effects of gluten on the skin and hair in the
  context of non-celiac gluten sensitivity are not as clear. This review aims to describe
  the impact of gluten on the skin and hair in patients with non-celiac gluten sensitivity
  and those without a definitive celiac disease diagnosis. A literature search was
  performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
  Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) reporting guidelines for systematic reviews. Forty-two publications
  met inclusion criteria with five studies describing the skin manifestations of non-celiac
  gluten sensitivity. Trials identifying the impact of a gluten-free diet on skin
  disease, as well as dermatologic conditions and their associations with antigliadin
  antibodies were also identified. Dermatologic manifestations in patients with non-celiac
  gluten sensitivity vary and may be non-specific. It may be appropriate for some
  of these patients with skin manifestations to trial a gluten-free diet. Dermatologic
  conditions that may respond positively to a gluten-free diet include psoriasis,
  atopic dermatitis, vitiligo, and palmoplantar pustulosis, while linear IgA disease
  does not appear to improve with this dietary change.'
