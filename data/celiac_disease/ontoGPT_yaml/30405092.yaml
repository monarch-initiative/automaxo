input_text: 'Motility Disorders in Celiac Disease and Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity:
  The Impact of a Gluten-Free Diet. Background: There is evidence that digestive motor
  disorders are frequently present in untreated celiac disease (CD) patients. Similarly,
  non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) can be associated with gut motor disorders.
  In both cases, gut dysmotility can improve or be completely reversed with a gluten-free
  diet (GFD). Methods: A literature search for motility disorders in CD and NCGS patients
  was carried out using the online databases PubMed, Medline and Cochrane. Results:
  Esophageal, gastric, small bowel and gallbladder motor disorders are common in both
  children and adults with CD. Although the clinical consequences of these disorders
  are not clearly defined, gastric dysfunction could affect drug absorption and metabolism
  in the thyroid and neurological conditions associated with CD. The impact of a GFD
  on motility disorders is, however, controversial. No systematic studies are available
  on NCGS. NCGS frequently overlaps with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and similar
  pathophysiological mechanisms may be hypothesized. Conclusions: Mucosal damage may
  affect gut motility in untreated CD through perturbation of hormonal and neuro-immunomodulatory
  regulation. A persistent low-grade mucosal inflammation could explain the cases
  of persistent motor disorders despite a GFD. Further studies are needed to definitely
  assess the role of gut motor disorders in NCGS.'
