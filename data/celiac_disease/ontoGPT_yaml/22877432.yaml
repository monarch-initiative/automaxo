input_text: Unrecognized and unappreciated secondary causes of osteoporosis. There
  are a substantial number of secondary causes of osteoporosis that can be identified
  through appropriate evaluation. Unrecognized celiac disease, Monoclonal gamopathy
  of undetermined significance (MGUS), impaired renal function, diabetes mellitus,
  and renal tubular acidosis are just a few of the more common secondary causes of
  osteoporosis. Through targeted laboratory tests, many secondary causes of osteoporosis
  can be identified.
