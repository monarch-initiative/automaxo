input_text: Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity and Protective Role of Dietary Polyphenols.
  Pathogenetically characterized by the absence of celiac disease and wheat allergy,
  non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a clinical entity triggered by the consumption
  of gluten-containing foods that relieved by a gluten-free diet. Since it is very
  difficult to maintain a complete gluten-free diet, there is a high interest in discovering
  alternative strategies aimed at reducing gluten concentration or mitigating its
  toxic effects. Plant-based dietary models are usually rich in bioactive compounds,
  such as polyphenols, recognized to prevent, delay, or even reverse chronic diseases,
  including intestinal disorders. However, research on the role of polyphenols in
  mitigating the toxicity of gluten-containing foods is currently limited. We address
  the metabolic fate of dietary polyphenols, both as free and bound macromolecule-linked
  forms, with particular reference to the gastrointestinal compartment, where the
  concentration of polyphenols can reach high levels. We analyze the potential targets
  of polyphenols including the gluten peptide bioavailability, the dysfunction of
  the intestinal epithelial barrier, intestinal immune response, oxidative stress
  and inflammation, and dysbiosis. Overall, this review provides an updated overview
  of the effects of polyphenols as possible dietary strategies to counteract the toxic
  effects of gluten, potentially resulting in the improved quality of life of patients
  with gluten-related disorders.
