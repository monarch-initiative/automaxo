input_text: 'The Evolving Landscape of Biomarkers in Celiac Disease: Leading the Way
  to Clinical Development. Celiac disease is a common immune-mediated disease characterized
  by abnormal T-cell responses to gluten. For many patients, symptoms and intestinal
  damage can be controlled by a gluten-free diet, but, for some, this approach is
  not enough, and celiac disease progresses, with serious medical consequences. Multiple
  therapies are now under development, increasing the need for biomarkers that allow
  identification of specific patient populations and monitoring of therapeutic activity
  and durability. The advantage of identifying biomarkers in celiac disease is that
  the underlying pathways driving disease are well characterized and the histological,
  cellular, and serological changes with gluten response have been defined in gluten
  challenge studies. However, there is room for improvement. Biomarkers that measure
  histological changes require duodenal biopsies and are invasive. Less invasive peripheral
  blood cell and cytokine biomarkers are transient and dependent upon gluten challenge.
  Here, we discuss established biomarkers and new approaches for biomarkers that may
  overcome current limitations.'
