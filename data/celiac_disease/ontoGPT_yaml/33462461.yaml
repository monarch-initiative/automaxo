input_text: 'Gluten content in labeled and unlabeled gluten-free food products used
  by patients with celiac disease. OBJECTIVE: Gluten-free (GF) diet is the only reliable
  treatment for patients with celiac disease (CeD), but data on the extent of gluten
  contamination in GF food available in India is scanty. We evaluated gluten content
  in labeled, imported, and non-labeled GF food products currently available in the
  Indian market. METHODS: Overall, 794 processed and commercially available packaged
  GF products (labeled GF (n = 360), imported GF (n = 80), and non-labeled/naturally
  GF (n = 354)) were collected from supermarkets of National Capital Region of India.
  Those unavailable in stores were purchased from e-commerce sites or directly from
  the manufacturers. Gluten level in them was determined by Ridascreen Gliadin sandwich
  R5 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R-Biopharm AG, Germany). As per Codex Alimentarius
  and Food Safety and Standard Authority of India, "gluten free" labeled products
  must not contain > 20 mg/kg of gluten. RESULTS: Overall, 10.1% of 794 GF products
  including 38 (10.8%) of 360 labeled and 42 (11.8%) of 354 non-labeled/naturally
  GF food products had gluten content > 20 mg/kg (range: 24.43-355 and 23.2-463.8
  mg/kg, respectively). None of the imported GF products had gluten more than the
  recommended limits. Contaminated products most commonly belonged to cereal and their
  products (flours, coarse grains, pasta/macaroni, snack foods) pulse flours, spices,
  and bakery items. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion (10.1%) of GF food products
  (both labeled and non-labeled) available in India have gluten content greater than
  the prescribed limits of <20 mg/kg. Physicians, dietitians, support group, and patients
  with CeD should be made aware of this fact and regulatory bodies should ensure quality
  assurance.'
