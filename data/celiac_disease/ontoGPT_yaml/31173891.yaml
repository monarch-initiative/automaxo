input_text: 'Rate, Risk Factors, and Outcomes of Nonadherence in Pediatric Patients
  With Celiac Disease: A Systematic Review. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The only treatment
  for celiac disease is strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). We performed
  a systematic review to investigate the rate of adherence to a GFD in children with
  celiac disease, risk factors that affect adherence, and outcomes of non-adherence.
  METHODS: We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, EBSCO, and Scopus for studies through
  January 2019. We included observational studies of >=50 children diagnosed with
  celiac disease and recommended for placement on a GFD. We collected data on adherence
  assessment (self-report, serology tests, structured dietary interview, biopsies,
  or assays for gluten immunogenic peptides), risk factors, and outcomes related to
  adherence. Findings were presented with medians, range, and a narrative synthesis.
  RESULTS: We identified 703 studies; of these, 167 were eligible for full-text assessment
  and 49 were included in the final analysis, comprising 7850 children. Rates of adherence
  to a GFD ranged from 23% to 98%. Comparable rates (median rates of adherence, 75%-87%)
  were found irrespective of how assessments were performed. Adolescents were at risk
  of non-adherence and children whose parents had good knowledge about celiac disease
  adhered more strictly. Non-adherence associated with patient growth, symptoms, and
  quality of life. CONCLUSION: In a systematic review of 49 studies of children with
  celiac disease, we found substantial variation in adherence to a GFD among patients.
  Rate of adherence was not associated with method of adherence measurement, so all
  methods appear to be useful, with lack of consensus on the ideal metric. Studies
  are needed to determine the best method to ensure adherence and effects on long-term
  health.'
