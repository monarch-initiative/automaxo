input_text: 'Clinical features and symptom recovery on a gluten-free diet in Canadian
  adults with celiac disease. BACKGROUND: Celiac disease can present with mild or
  nongastrointestinal symptoms, and may escape timely recognition. The treatment of
  celiac disease involves a gluten-free diet, which is complex and challenging. OBJECTIVE:
  To evaluate clinical features and symptom recovery on a gluten-free diet in a Canadian
  adult celiac population. METHODS: All adult members (n=10,693) of the two national
  celiac support organizations, the Canadian Celiac Association and Fondation quebecoise
  de la maladie coeliaque, were surveyed using a questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of
  5912 individuals (>=18 years of age) with biopsy-confirmed celiac disease and/or
  dermatitis herpetiformis completed the survey. The female to male ratio was 3:1,
  and mean (+- SD) age at diagnosis was 45.2 +- 16.4 years. Mean time to diagnosis
  after onset of symptoms was 12.0 +- 14.4 years. Abdominal pain and bloating (84.9%),
  extreme weakness/tiredness (74.2%), diarrhea (71.7%) and anemia (67.8%) were the
  most commonly reported symptoms at the time of diagnosis. Many respondents continued
  to experience symptoms after being on a gluten-free diet for >5 years. Sex differences
  were reported in clinical features before diagnosis, recovery after being on gluten-free
  diet and perceived quality of life, with women experiencing more difficulties than
  men. CONCLUSIONS: Delays in diagnosis of celiac disease in Canada remain unacceptably
  long despite wider availability of serological screening tests. Many patients report
  continuing symptoms despite adhering to a gluten-free diet for >5 years, with women
  experiencing more symptoms and a lower recovery rate than men. Awareness of celiac
  disease needs improvement, and follow-up with a physician and a dietitian is essential
  for all patients with celiac disease.'
