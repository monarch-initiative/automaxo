input_text: "Celiac Male's Gluten-Free Diet Profile: Comparison to that of the Control
  Population and Celiac Women. The aim of the present work was to analyze the body
  composition and dietary profile of Spanish celiac men and to compare them to control
  men and celiac women from our previous studies. Forty-two celiac men (31.5 +- 11.9
  years) were recruited and anthropometric measurements were taken. Analysis of energy
  consumption, macro- and micronutrient intake and food frequency consumption was
  carried out. Celiac men were more overweight and obese than celiac women, but less
  than the control population, reporting the same energy intake and macronutrient
  distribution. Most micronutrient deficiencies in celiac men were not directly related
  to a gluten free diet; these were also observed for the entire population. The least
  adherence to Dietary Reference Intakes in women was reported for iron, iodine, potassium
  and selenium, whereas magnesium intake was higher than in men. Among celiac participants
  (both genders), cereal, vegetable and legume consumption was poor and meat intake
  was contrastingly excessive. In conclusion, the dietary profile of celiac men is
  as unbalanced as that of control men but slightly more than that of celiac women.
  General nutritional education should be given to both general and celiac populations,
  and specific advices to celiac men, in order to decrease the risk of celiac disease-related
  pathologies."
