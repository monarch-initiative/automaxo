input_text: 'Spontaneous normalization of anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody levels
  is common in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus. BACKGROUND: The prevalence
  of celiac disease among type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) patients is 5-10 times higher
  than in the general population. Thus, evaluation of celiac serology is indicated
  at diagnosis of T1DM and on follow up. AIM: This study was prompted by the observation
  that elevated anti-TTG antibody levels in diabetic children may spontaneously normalize
  despite continued consumption of gluten. The objective of the study was to investigate
  the prevalence of this phenomenon and associated factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
  The files of all children diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus from 2003-2009
  at a tertiary pediatric medical center were reviewed for those with elevated serum
  levels of anti-TTG antibody. Clinical, medical, laboratory, and treatment data were
  collected. Findings were compared between patients diagnosed with celiac disease
  and patients with initially elevated anti-TTG antibody levels that spontaneously
  normalized. RESULTS: Forty-eight of the 738 patients with type 1 diabetes attending
  our center (6.5%) had elevated anti-TTG antibody blood levels. Celiac disease was
  diagnosed in 23, and anti-TTG antibody levels normalized in 17 (35.4%), all of whom
  consumed gluten. At one-year follow-up, there was no significant difference between
  the groups in HbA1c level or change in anthropometric measurements. CONCLUSION:
  Physicians treating children with type 1 diabetes and mildly elevated anti-TTG antibody
  levels might consider 12-month serologic follow-up on a gluten-containing diet rather
  than immediate duodenal biopsy.'
