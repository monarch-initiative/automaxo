input_text: 'Gastrointestinal Symptoms in Celiac Disease Patients on a Long-Term Gluten-Free
  Diet. Experience suggests that many celiac patients suffer from persistent symptoms
  despite a long-term gluten-free diet (GFD). We investigated the prevalence and severity
  of these symptoms in patients with variable duration of GFD. Altogether, 856 patients
  were classified into untreated (n = 128), short-term GFD (1-2 years, n = 93) and
  long-term GFD (>=3 years, n = 635) groups. Analyses were made of clinical and histological
  data and dietary adherence. Symptoms were evaluated by the validated GSRS questionnaire.
  One-hundred-sixty healthy subjects comprised the control group. Further, the severity
  of symptoms was compared with that in peptic ulcer, reflux disease, inflammatory
  bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Altogether, 93% of the short-term
  and 94% of the long-term treated patients had a strict GFD and recovered mucosa.
  Untreated patients had more diarrhea, indigestion and abdominal pain than those
  on GFD and controls. There were no differences in symptoms between the short- and
  long-term GFD groups, but both yielded poorer GSRS total score than controls (p
  = 0.03 and p = 0.05, respectively). Furthermore, patients treated 1-2 years had
  more diarrhea (p = 0.03) and those treated >10 years more reflux (p = 0.04) than
  controls. Long-term treated celiac patients showed relatively mild symptoms compared
  with other gastrointestinal diseases. Based on our results, good response to GFD
  sustained in long-term follow-up, but not all patients reach the level of healthy
  individuals. '
