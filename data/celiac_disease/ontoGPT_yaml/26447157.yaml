input_text: "Gluten consumption during late pregnancy and risk of celiac disease in
  the offspring: the TEDDY birth cohort. BACKGROUND: Maternal diet during pregnancy
  has been proposed to increase the risk of autoimmune diseases. OBJECTIVE: The objective
  was to investigate the association between maternal consumption of gluten-containing
  foods during late pregnancy and subsequent risk of celiac disease in the offspring.
  DESIGN: Genetically susceptible children prospectively followed from birth were
  screened annually for tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies (tTGAs). Children testing
  persistently positive for tTGAs were further evaluated for celiac disease. Diagnosis
  of celiac disease was confirmed by intestinal biopsy or was considered likely if
  the mean tTGA concentration was >100 units in 2 consecutive samples. A questionnaire
  on the mother's diet in late pregnancy was completed by 3-4.5 mo postpartum. Mothers
  were divided into 3 groups based on the tertiles of their consumption of gluten-containing
  foods (servings/d). The association between maternal gluten-containing food consumption
  and the risk of celiac disease was studied by using a time-to-event analysis. RESULTS:
  At the time of analysis, 359 (5%) of the 6546 children developed celiac disease.
  Compared with the middle category of maternal gluten-containing food consumption
  (servings/d), low (HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.67, 1.13; P = 0.296) and high (HR: 0.84;
  95% CI: 0.65, 1.09; P = 0.202) consumption was not associated with risk of celiac
  disease in the child after adjustment for country, human leukocyte antigen genotype,
  family history of celiac disease, maternal education, and sex of the child. Median
  maternal daily consumption frequency of gluten-containing foods was higher (P <
  0.0001) in Finland (5.3; IQR: 3.9-6.9), Germany (4.3; IQR: 3.1-5.5), and Sweden
  (3.7; IQR: 2.8-4.9) than in the United States (3.4; IQR: 2.3-4.9). No significant
  interaction was found between country of residence and the mothers' consumption
  of gluten-containing foods in relation to risk of celiac disease. CONCLUSION: The
  frequency of gluten-containing food consumption during late pregnancy is not associated
  with risk of celiac disease in the offspring."
