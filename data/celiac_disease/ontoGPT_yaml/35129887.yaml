input_text: "[Cereal related complaints in children]. There's a lot of attention for
  gluten-free diets on social media. Doctors get many questions about gluten sensitivity
  or possible wheat allergy. With some basic knowledge, it's easier to give answers
  to these questions and to prevent unnecessary and sometimes harmful diets. This
  article gives basic information about cereals, gluten, grasses and their crossreactivity.
  We give an overview about the differences between celiac disease, gluten sensitivity
  and IgE-mediated wheat allergy. We also describe diagnostics, treatment and natural
  history of coeliakie, gluten sensitivity and wheat or cereal allergy."
