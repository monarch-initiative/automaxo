input_text: Preparation and Immunochemical Characterization of a Water-Soluble Gluten
  Peptide Fraction for Improving the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease. The diagnosis of
  celiac disease (CD) is complex and requires a multi-step procedure (symptoms, serology,
  duodenal biopsy, effect of a gluten-free diet, and optional genetic). The aim of
  the study was to contribute to the improvement of CD diagnosis by preparing a water-soluble
  gluten peptide fraction (called Solgluten) and by selecting gluten-specific enzyme-linked
  immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for the detection of gluten immunogenic gluten peptides
  (GIPs) in urine and blood serum spiked with Solgluten. Food-grade Solgluten was
  prepared by the extraction of a peptic digest of vital gluten with water, centrifugation,
  and freeze-drying. The process was relatively easy, repeatable, and cheap. The content
  of gliadin-derived GIPs was 491 mg/g. Solgluten was used as antigenic material to
  compare two competitive ELISA kits (R7021 and K3012) and two sandwich ELISA kits
  (M2114 and R7041) in their quality regarding the quantitation of GIPs in urine and
  blood serum. The quality parameters were the reactivity, sensitivity, coefficients
  of variation and determination, and curve shape. The evaluation of the kits showed
  a number of discrepancies in individual quality parameters measured in urine and
  serum. Due to the lowest limit of quantitation and the highest coefficient of determination,
  M2114 may be the first choice, while R7021 appeared to be less suitable because
  of the high coefficients of variation and unfavorable curve progression. The results
  set the stage for improving CD diagnosis by supplementing conventional blood tests
  with oral provocation with Solgluten and subsequent ELISA measurement of GIPs that
  could support the no-biopsy approach and by better assessing the effect of a gluten-free
  diet by monitoring adherence to the diet by measuring GIPs in urine and blood.
