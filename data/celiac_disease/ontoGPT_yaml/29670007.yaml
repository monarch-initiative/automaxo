input_text: 'Prevalence of Self-Reported Gluten-Related Disorders and Adherence to
  a Gluten-Free Diet in Salvadoran Adult Population. Gluten-related disorders are
  not considered of relevance at public health level in Central America. The prevalence
  of gluten-related disorders, and adherence to a gluten-free diet, remain unknown
  in the Central American region. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of the Central
  American population from San Salvador, El Salvador, to estimate the prevalence rates
  of self-reported gluten-related disorders and adherence to a gluten-free diet. 1326
  individuals were surveyed. Self-reported prevalence rates were (95% Confidence Interval):
  gluten sensitivity 3.1% (2.3&ndash;4.2); physician-diagnosed celiac disease 0.15%
  (0.04&ndash;0.5); wheat allergy 0.75% (0.4&ndash;1.3); non-celiac gluten sensitivity
  0.98% (0.5&ndash;1.6). The prevalence rate of adherence to a gluten-free diet was
  7.0% (5.7&ndash;8.5). Seven self-reported physician diagnosed gluten-sensitive cases
  informed the co-existence of non-celiac gluten sensitivity with celiac disease and/or
  wheat allergy. Among the non-self-reported gluten sensitivity individuals following
  a gluten-free diet, 50% reported that they were seeing a health professional for
  gluten-free dietary advice. Gluten sensitivity is commonly reported in Salvadoran
  population, but some health professionals acknowledge the coexistence of wheat allergy,
  celiac disease, and non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Among studies at population level,
  the prevalence of adherence to a gluten-free diet in Salvadoran population is the
  highest reported until now. However, just a few of the gluten-free diet followers
  were doing it for health-related benefits; the others reported weight control and
  the perception that the diet is healthier as the main motivation for adopting such
  a diet.'
