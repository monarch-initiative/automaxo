input_text: Nutritional Considerations of the Gluten-Free Diet. Celiac disease (CD)
  is an autoimmune-related disease causing inflammation in the small intestine triggered
  by the ingestion of gluten in the diet. The gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only treatment.
  Nutritional deficiencies of macronutrients and micronutrients are frequently found
  in untreated or newly diagnosed CD. A registered dietitian nutritionist is uniquely
  qualified to educate on the GFD and assess and support nutritional status at diagnosis
  and long term as well as helping patients with nonresponsive CD. Quality of life
  is important to address in individuals with CD because the GFD affects all aspects
  of life.
