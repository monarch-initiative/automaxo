  Disease: Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Effects on Intestinal Histology and Plasma
  Cytokines with Escalating Dose Regimens of Nexvax2 in a Randomized, Double-Blind,
  Placebo-Controlled Phase 1 Study. BACKGROUND: Nexvax2  is a novel, peptide-based,
  epitope-specific immunotherapy intended to be administered by regular injections
  at dose levels that increase the threshold for clinical reactivity to natural exposure
  to gluten and ultimately restore tolerance to gluten in patients with celiac disease.
  Celiac disease patients administered fixed intradermal doses of Nexvax2 become unresponsive
  to the HLA-DQ2 5-restricted gluten epitopes in Nexvax2, but gastrointestinal symptoms
  and cytokine release mimicking gluten exposure, that accompany the first dose, limit
  the maximum tolerated dose to 150mug. Our aim was to test whether stepwise dose
  escalation attenuated the first dose effect of Nexvax2 in celiac disease patients.
  METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at four
  community sites in Australia (3) and New Zealand (1) in HLA-DQ2 5 genotype positive
  adults with celiac disease who were on a gluten-free diet. Participants were assigned
  to cohort 1 if they were HLA-DQ2 5 homozygotes; other participants were assigned
  to cohort 2, or to cohort 3 subsequent to completion of cohort 2. Manual central
  randomization without blocking was used to assign treatment for each cohort. Initially,
  Nexvax2-treated participants in cohorts 1 and 2 received an intradermal dose of
  30mug (consisting of 10mug of each constituent peptide), followed by 60mug, 90mug,
  150mug, and then eight doses of 300mug over six weeks, but this was amended to include
  doses of 3mug and 9mug and extended over a total of seven weeks. Nexvax2-treated
  participants in cohort 3 received doses of 3mug, 9mug, 30mug, 60mug, 90mug, 150mug,
  300mug, 450mug, 600mug, 750mug, and then eight of 900mug over nine weeks. The dose
  interval was 3 or 4days. Participants, care providers, data managers, sponsor personnel,
  and study site personnel were blinded to treatment assignment. The primary outcome
  was the number of adverse events and percentage of participants with adverse events
  during the treatment period. This completed trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,
  number NCT02528799. FINDINGS: From the 73 participants who we screened from 19 August
  2015 to 31 October 2016, 24 did not meet eligibility criteria, and 36 were ultimately
  randomized and received study drug. For cohort 1, seven participants received Nexvax2
  (two with the starting dose of 30mug and then five at 3mug) and three received placebo.
  For cohort 2, 10 participants received Nexvax2 (four with starting dose of 30mug
  and then six at 3mug) and four received placebo. For cohort 3, 10 participants received
  Nexvax2 and two received placebo. All 36 participants were included in safety and
  immune analyses, and 33 participants completed treatment and follow-up; in cohort
  3, 11 participants were assessed and included in pharmacokinetics and duodenal histology
  analyses. Whereas the maximum dose of Nexvax2 had previously been limited by adverse
  events and cytokine release, no such effect was observed when dosing escalated from
  3mug up to 300mug in HLA-DQ2 5 homozygotes or to 900mug in HLA-DQ2.5 non-homozygotes.
  Adverse events with Nexvax2 treatment were less common in cohorts 1 and 2 with the
  starting dose of 3mug (72 for 11 participants) than with the starting dose of 30mug
  (91 for six participants). Adverse events during the treatment period in placebo-treated
  participants (46 for nine participants) were similar to those in Nexvax2-treated
  participants when the starting dose was 3mug in cohort 1 (16 for five participants),
  cohort 2 (56 for six participants), and cohort 3 (44 for 10 participants). Two participants
  in cohort 2 and one in cohort 3 who received Nexvax2 starting at 3mug did not report
  any adverse event, while the other 33 participants experienced at least one adverse
  event. One participant, who was in cohort 1, withdrew from the study due to adverse
  events, which included abdominal pain graded moderate or severe and associated with
  nausea after receiving the starting dose of 30mug and one 60mug dose. The most common
  treatment-emergent adverse events in the Nexvax2 participants were headache (52%),
  diarrhoea (48%), nausea (37%), abdominal pain (26%), and abdominal discomfort (19%).
  Administration of Nexvax2 at dose levels from 150mug to 900mug preceded by dose
  escalation was not associated with elevations in plasma cytokines at 4h. Nexvax2
  treatment was associated with trends towards improved duodenal histology. Plasma
  concentrations of Nexvax2 peptides were dose-dependent. INTERPRETATION: We show
  that antigenic peptides recognized by CD4-positive T cells in an autoimmune disease
  can be safely administered to patients at high maintenance dose levels without immune
  activation if preceded by gradual dose escalation. These findings facilitate efficacy
  studies that test high-dose epitope-specific immunotherapy in celiac disease.'
