input_text: "Gluten-free-rendered products contribute to imbalanced diets in children
  and adolescents with celiac disease. PURPOSE: As well as adhering to the safe limit
  for gluten intake, a suitable gluten-free (GF) diet must also be nutritionally balanced.
  However, malnutrition has been observed in the population with celiac disease (CD).
  This is even more important in the case of children and adolescents, whose GF diet
  must also ensure their proper growth. The aim of the present study was to assess
  the diet quality of children and adolescents with CD to attain optimal nutritional
  status, determining the most relevant factors that affect a balanced diet. METHODS:
  Eighty-three children and adolescents with CD (9.2 +- 3.8 years) took part in the
  study. Height, weight and body composition were measured. An analysis of energy
  consumption and of the macronutrient distribution of their diet was carried out.
  Adherence to Mediterranean diet by KIDMED index was analyzed, and energy and nutrients
  intake. RESULTS: The diet of participants was not balanced, containing more fat
  and less carbohydrate than recommended. Most children and adolescents revealed adequate
  body mass index and suitable body fat percentage. Two-thirds of them showed moderate
  or poor KIDMED index, the case of girls being remarkable. When the GF diet, containing
  GF-rendered foodstuffs, was compared to a similar type of diet but substituting
  GF products with their analogs containing gluten, important nutritional differences
  were revealed. CONCLUSIONS: Even though celiac children and adolescents' diet is
  unhealthy due to its inappropriate dietary pattern, following a diet based on GF
  products raises extra difficulty in complying with the nutritional recommendations."
