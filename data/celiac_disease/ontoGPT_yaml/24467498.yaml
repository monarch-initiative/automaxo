input_text: 'Celiac disease and alcohol use disorders: increased length of hospital
  stay, overexpenditures and attributable mortality. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: alcohol
  use disorders are associated with a greater incidence of certain comorbidities in
  patients with celiac disease. Currently there is no available information about
  the impact that these disorders may have on length of hospital stays, overexpenditures
  during hospital stays, and excess mortality in these patients. METHODS: a case-control
  study was conducted with a selection of patients 18 years and older hospitalized
  during 2008-2010 in 87 hospitals in Spain. Estimations of excess length of stays,
  costs, and attributable mortality were calculated using a multivariate analysis
  of covariance, which included age, gender, hospital group, alcohol use disorders,
  tobacco related disease and 30 other comorbidities. RESULTS: patients who had both
  celiac disease and alcohol use disorders had an increased length of hospital stay,
  an average of 3.1 days longer in women, and 1.7 days longer in men. Excess costs
  per stay ranged from 838.7 euros in female patients, to 389.1 euros in male patients.
  Excess attributable mortality was 15.1 % in women, 12.2 % in men. CONCLUSIONS: apart
  from a gluten-free diet and other medical measures, the prevention of alcohol abuse
  is indicated in these patients. Patients hospitalized who present these disorders
  should receive specialized attention after leaving the hospital. Early detection
  and treatment should be used to prevent the appearance of organic lesions and should
  not be solely focused on male patients.'
