input_text: Self-compassion directly and indirectly predicts dietary adherence and
  quality of life among adults with celiac disease. Strict adherence to a gluten-free
  diet (GFD) is the only treatment for preventing both short- and long-term consequences
  of celiac disease. Given that following a strict GFD can be difficult, evidence-based
  strategies are needed to improve the psychological experience of living with celiac
  disease and following the GFD. Self-compassion appears to be an important component
  of effectively self-regulating one's behavior to cope with a chronic disease. The
  main goal of this study was to examine the relationships between self-compassion
  and management of celiac disease as assessed by (a) adherence to a strict GFD and
  (b) celiac-specific quality of life (CQoL). The secondary goal of this study was
  to explore self-regulatory efficacy (i.e., confidence in one's ability to self-manage
  behavior to follow a strict GFD) and concurrent self-regulatory efficacy (i.e.,
  one's confidence to self-manage other valued life goals while following a strict
  GFD) as mediators of the relationship between self-compassion and the primary outcomes
  (adherence and CQoL). In this prospective study, 200 North American adults diagnosed
  with celiac disease completed online questionnaires at two time points (baseline
  and 1 month later). Self-compassion at baseline directly predicted stricter adherence
  (at Time 2; b = -0.63, p = 0.006) and enhanced CQoL (at Time 2; b = -0.50, p = 0.001).
  Further, self-compassion (at Time 1) also indirectly predicted stricter Time 2 adherence
  through self-regulatory efficacy (at Time 1; b = -0.26, 95% CI [-0.58, -0.04], R2
  = 0.29) and enhanced Time 2 CQoL through concurrent self-regulatory efficacy (at
  Time 1; b = -0.07, 95% CI [-0.14, -0.03], R2 = 0.33). This was the first study to
  assess the effects of self-compassion in relation to the psychological experience
  of coping with celiac disease and following a GFD. The findings indicate that self-compassion,
  self-regulatory efficacy and concurrent self-regulatory efficacy are important cognitions
  in understanding adherence to a GFD and CQoL among adults with celiac disease.
