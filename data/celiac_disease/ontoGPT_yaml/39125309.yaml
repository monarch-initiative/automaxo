input_text: "Gluten-Free Diet Adherence Tools for Individuals with Celiac Disease:
  A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Tools Compared to Laboratory Tests. This
  systematic review aimed to find the tool that best predicts celiac individuals'
  adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). The Transparent Reporting of Multivariable
  Prediction Models for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD-SRMA) guideline
  was used for the construction and collection of data from eight scientific databases
  (PubMed, EMBASE, LILACS, Web of Science, LIVIVO, SCOPUS, Google Scholar, and Proquest)
  on 16 November 2023. The inclusion criteria were studies involving individuals with
  celiac disease (CD) who were over 18 years old and on a GFD for at least six months,
  using a questionnaire to predict adherence to a GFD, and comparing it with laboratory
  tests (serological tests, gluten immunogenic peptide-GIP, or biopsy). Review articles,
  book chapters, and studies without sufficient data were excluded. The Checklist
  for Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction
  Modeling Studies (CHARMS) was used for data collection from the selected primary
  studies, and their risk of bias and quality was assessed using the Prediction Risk
  of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST). The association between the GFD adherence determined
  by the tool and laboratory test was assessed using the phi contingency coefficient.
  The studies included in this review used four different tools to evaluate GFD adherence:
  BIAGI score, Coeliac Dietary Adherence Test (CDAT), self-report questions, and interviews.
  The comparison method most often used was biopsy (n = 19; 59.3%), followed by serology
  (n = 14; 43.7%) and gluten immunogenic peptides (GIPs) (n = 4; 12.5%). There were
  no significant differences between the interview, self-report, and BIAGI tools used
  to evaluate GFD adherence. These tools were better associated with GFD adherence
  than the CDAT. Considering their cost, application time, and prediction capacity,
  the self-report and BIAGI were the preferred tools for evaluating GFD adherence."
