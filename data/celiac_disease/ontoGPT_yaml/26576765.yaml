input_text: 'Adherence to gluten-free diet and barriers to adherence in patients with
  celiac disease. BACKGROUND: While adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD) is essential
  for effective control of celiac disease, the level of adherence to GFD may vary.
  We assessed the level of adherence to GFD and identified barriers to adherence in
  patients with celiac disease. METHODS: Both treatment-naive and follow up patients
  with celiac disease were recruited from a celiac disease clinic. All the patients
  were assessed for symptom improvement using celiac symptom index (CSI), weight,
  and hemoglobin; adherence to GFD using detailed dietary history and food-labeled
  quiz questionnaire; identification of barriers to GFD using a self-administered
  36-point questionnaire; and quality of life using a standard 36-item short form
  (SF36) questionnaire. RESULTS: Among the patients who were already on GFD, only
  53.3% maintained an excellent or good level of adherence, which increased to 92.4%
  at 6 months with repeated counseling. Among the treatment-naive patients, 64.8%
  maintained either excellent or good compliance at 1 month after first counseling,
  which increased to 96.3% at 6 months with repeated counseling. The most common barrier
  to adherence was non-availability of GFD. Certain barriers could be modified with
  repeated counseling and education. Response to GFD, as measured by CSI, gain in
  weight, and improvement in hemoglobin, was better in those having either excellent
  or good compliance to GFD compared to those who remained poorly adherent. CONCLUSIONS:
  Repeated counseling increased the level of adherence to GFD.'
