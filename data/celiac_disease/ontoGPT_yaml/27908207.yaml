input_text: "Anti-sulfatide reactivity in patients with celiac disease. OBJECTIVE:
  To explore a possible significance of the presence of anti-ganglioside and anti-sulfatide
  antibodies in sera of adult patients with celiac disease (CD) in different clinical
  scenario. METHODS: We selected 22 adult patients with newly diagnosed CD and 20
  age-sex matched non-CD controls. Patients' serum was tested - before and after at
  least 6 months on a gluten-free diet (GFD) - for anti-GM1, GM2, GM3, GD1a, GD1b,
  GD3, GT1a, GT1b, GQ1b and sulfatide IgM, IgG and IgA auto-antibodies, by means of
  a dot blot technique and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: We
  found the presence of auto-antibodies in untreated patients. In particular, anti-sulfatide
  IgG antibodies were present in 8 (36%) patients independently of the presence of
  neurological symptoms. Anti-sulfatide IgA antibodies were present in 3 (19%) patients.
  During GFD, anti-sulfatide IgG disappeared in all the patients, whereas IgA were
  observed in 2 patients. Anti-sulfatide, anti-GM1 and anti-GM2 IgM antibodies were
  also observed in 2 patients on a GFD. All the other auto-antibodies were absent
  and no demographic or clinical parameters were associated. Non-CD controls did not
  present any auto-antibody. CONCLUSIONS: We found anti-sulfatide IgG antibodies in
  CD patients on a gluten-containing diet. Anti-sulfatide IgA antibodies persisted
  during GFD together with the occurrence of other IgM auto-antibodies. These data
  suggest a possible link between gluten and IgG auto-antibodies."
