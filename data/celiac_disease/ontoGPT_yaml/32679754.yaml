input_text: Gluten Degrading Enzymes for Treatment of Celiac Disease. Celiac disease
  (CeD) affects about 1% of most world populations. It presents a wide spectrum of
  clinical manifestations, ranging from minor symptoms to mild or severe malabsorption,
  and it may be associated with a wide variety of autoimmune diseases. CeD is triggered
  and maintained by the ingestion of gluten proteins from wheat and related grains.
  Gluten peptides that resist gastrointestinal digestion are antigenically presented
  to gluten specific T cells in the intestinal mucosa via HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8, the
  necessary genetic predisposition for CeD. To date, there is no effective or approved
  treatment for CeD other than a strict adherence to a gluten-free diet, which is
  difficult to maintain in professional or social environments. Moreover, many patients
  with CeD have active disease despite diet adherence due to a high sensitivity to
  traces of gluten. Therefore, safe pharmacological treatments that complement the
  gluten-free diet are urgently needed. Oral enzyme therapy, employing gluten-degrading
  enzymes, is a promising therapeutic approach. A prerequisite is that such enzymes
  are active under gastro-duodenal conditions, quickly neutralize the T cell activating
  gluten peptides and are safe for human consumption. Several enzymes including prolyl
  endopeptidases, cysteine proteases and subtilisins can cleave the human digestion-resistant
  gluten peptides in vitro and in vivo. Examples are several prolyl endopeptidases
  from bacterial sources, subtilisins from Rothia bacteria that are natural oral colonizers
  and synthetic enzymes with optimized gluten-degrading activities. Without exception,
  these enzymes must cleave the otherwise unusual glutamine and proline-rich domains
  characteristic of antigenic gluten peptides. Moreover, they should be stable and
  active in both the acidic environment of the stomach and under near neutral pH in
  the duodenum. This review focuses on those enzymes that have been characterized
  and evaluated for the treatment of CeD, discussing their origin and activities,
  their clinical evaluation and challenges for therapeutic application. Novel developments
  include strategies like enteric coating and genetic modification to increase enzyme
  stability in the digestive tract.
