input_text: "Food Safety and Cross-Contamination of Gluten-Free Products: A Narrative
  Review. A gluten-free diet (GFD) is currently the only effective treatment for celiac
  disease (CD); an individual's daily intake of gluten should not exceed 10 mg. However,
  it is difficult to maintain a strict oral diet for life and at least one-third of
  patients with CD are exposed to gluten, despite their best efforts at dietary modifications.
  It has been demonstrated that both natural and certified gluten-free foods can be
  heavily contaminated with gluten well above the commonly accepted threshold of 20
  mg/kg. Moreover, meals from food services such as restaurants, workplaces, and schools
  remain a significant risk for inadvertent gluten exposure. Other possible sources
  of gluten are non-certified oat products, numerous composite foods, medications,
  and cosmetics that unexpectedly contain \"hidden\" vital gluten, a proteinaceous
  by-product of wheat starch production. A number of immunochemical assays are commercially
  available worldwide to detect gluten. Each method has specific features, such as
  format, sample extraction buffers, extraction time and temperature, characteristics
  of the antibodies, recognition epitope, and the reference material used for calibration.
  Due to these differences and a lack of official reference material, the results
  of gluten quantitation may deviate systematically. In conclusion, incorrect gluten
  quantitation, improper product labeling, and poor consumer awareness, which results
  in the inadvertent intake of relatively high amounts of gluten, can be factors that
  compromise the health of patients with CD."
