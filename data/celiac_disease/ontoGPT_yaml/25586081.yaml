input_text: 'Idiopathic pulmonary haemosiderosis with celiac disease (Lane-Hamilton
  syndrome) in an adult - a case report. Idiopathic pulmonary haemosiderosis (IPH)
  is a rare disorder of unknown cause characterised by haemoptysis, diffuse alveolar
  infiltrates and iron-deficiency anaemia. IPH predominantly affects children; it
  is rare in adults, in whom it usually manifests before 30 years. In adults, course
  is protracted with a better prognosis, in contrast to children. Even rarer is the
  Lane-Hamilton syndrome, a condition in which IPH is associated with celiac disease.
  Only 15 cases of Lane-Hamilton syndrome affecting adults are reported in literature.
  Treatment of IPH is based on anecdotal case reports and case series because of its
  rare occurrence. High-dose steroids reportedly reduce morbidity and mortality and
  delays or stops disease progression; more effectively in adults than children. In
  Lane-Hamilton syndrome, a gluten-free diet for the celiac disease in addition to
  steroids for IPH, is the mainstay of therapy. The optimal treatment duration of
  steroid therapy is not known but anecdotally a more prolonged course results in
  improved outcome. We report a case of a young woman who presented with exertional
  dyspnoea, intermittent haemoptysis, severe anaemia and lung infiltrates but no gastrointestinal
  complaints. After extensive work-up, she was diagnosed with Lane-Hamilton syndrome
  based on a diagnosis of IPH made from lung biopsy and concomitant celiac disease
  because of positive anti-gliadin antibody and endomyosial antibody and jejunal biopsy.
  She was treated with sustained low-dose steroid therapy for a year and a gluten-free
  diet with resolution of her symptoms, anaemia and lung infiltrates. At 4 years of
  follow-up, she remains stable, without recurrence. '
