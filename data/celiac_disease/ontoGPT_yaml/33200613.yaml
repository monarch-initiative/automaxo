input_text: Villous atrophy persistence in celiac disease despite following a gluten-free
  diet must be clarified. We read with great interest the article recently published
  in REED by Shadegi et al. Villous atrophy (VA) persists in 35 % and 23.7 % of celiac
  disease (CD) patients for six and 24 months, respectively, after following a gluten-free
  diet (GFD). The authors think that the time following a GFD must be longer than
  two years in some patients to achieve mucosal healing and we agree with this. Our
  experience comes from a short series of ten females and three males with CD, diagnosed
  at an average age of 36 years (15-72) based on serology (anti-TG2 > 10 IU/ml or
  anti-Em positive) and a duodenal biopsy showing VA. All cases followed a GFD, according
  to the anamnesis and underwent a second duodenal biopsy and anti-TG2 determination
  after 42 (10-202) months. Immunogenic peptides of gluten (IPG) in feces were determined
  in four patients.
