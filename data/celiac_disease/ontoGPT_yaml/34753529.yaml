input_text: "Gluten contamination in labelled gluten-free, naturally gluten-free and
  meals in food services in low-, middle- and high-income countries: a systematic
  review and meta-analysis. The gluten-free diet is based on the consumption of foods
  without gluten, which aims to manage celiac disease. The concern of celiac patients
  is that these foods should be safe. However, gluten contamination can affect these
  foods. The objectives of this review and meta-analysis were first, to identify articles
  that detected gluten contamination in gluten-free foods using validated methods.
  Second, to quantify the overall prevalence of gluten contamination of naturally
  gluten-free foods, labelled gluten-free products, and meals prepared in food services.
  Third, to highlight the influence of the country's income and the period of study
  on this prevalence. The studies were identified in Scopus, Science Direct, Web of
  Science, PubMed, and Google Scholar. Forty articles were included according to PRISMA
  guidelines. The statistical meta-analysis was performed using MedCalc 19 software.
  The results show that in the gluten-free foods analysed, the overall prevalence
  of gluten contamination was estimated at 15.12% (95% CI: 9.56%-21.70%), with more
  than 20 mg/kg of gluten. Naturally gluten-free foods were significantly more contaminated
  than labelled gluten-free products and than meals in food services (28.32%; 9.52%;
  4.66% respectively; p < 0.001). Moreover, it was noticed that oats were the most
  contaminated food. In addition, the prevalence of gluten contamination has significantly
  decreased over time. The majority of the studies were carried out in upper-middle-income
  and high-income countries, while only one study was conducted in lower-middle income
  countries. Therefore, it is necessary to implement preventive actions to reduce
  gluten contamination, ensuring safe gluten-free foods for celiac patients, including
  low-income countries."
