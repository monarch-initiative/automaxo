input_text: 'Unrecognized Celiac Disease in Children Presenting for Rheumatology Evaluation.
  BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Current clinical guidelines do not consider patients
  with rheumatic conditions to be at high risk for celiac disease (CD) despite numerous
  reported associations between the two in adults and children. The objective of this
  study was to evaluate the prevalence of CD among patients presenting for pediatric
  rheumatology evaluation. METHODS: A total of 2125 patients presenting for initial
  evaluation by the Division of Pediatric Rheumatology at the Hospital for Special
  Surgery between June 2006 and December 2013 were screened for CD as a part of the
  standard initial serologic evaluation. The charts of these patients were evaluated
  retrospectively at the end of this period. RESULTS: 36 patients (30 girls, 6 boys,
  mean age 9.4 +- 4.3 years, range 2-16 years) received a diagnosis of CD after serologic
  testing and evaluation by pediatric gastroenterology. Eight additional patients
  with known diagnoses of CD presented during this time period. The total prevalence
  of CD over this 6.5-year period was 2.0%. The most common presenting complaints
  among patients diagnosed with CD were myalgias, arthralgias, and rash. Less frequently,
  patients reported gastrointestinal complaints including abdominal pain, nausea,
  and diarrhea. All patients reported improvement or complete resolution of their
  musculoskeletal symptoms after initiation of a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: This
  study identified 36 new cases of CD among children presenting for rheumatology evaluation,
  for an overall prevalence rate of 2.0%. The majority of patients who ultimately
  received a diagnosis of CD presented with extraintestinal manifestations. These
  results underscore the importance of screening children presenting for rheumatology
  evaluation for CD.'
