input_text: 'Advances in diagnosis and management of celiac disease. Celiac disease
  is an autoimmune disorder that is induced by dietary gluten in genetically predisposed
  individuals. It has a prevalence of approximately 1% in many populations worldwide.
  New diagnoses have increased substantially, owing to increased awareness, better
  diagnostic tools, and probable real increases in incidence. The breadth of recognized
  clinical presentations continues to expand, making the disorder highly relevant
  to all physicians. Newer diagnostic tools, including serologic tests for antibodies
  against tissue transglutaminase and deamidated gliadin peptide, greatly facilitate
  diagnosis. Tests for celiac-permissive HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 molecules are useful
  in defined clinical situations. Celiac disease is diagnosed by histopathologic examination
  of duodenal biopsy specimens. However, according to recent controversial guidelines,
  a diagnosis can be made without a biopsy in certain circumstances, especially in
  children. Symptoms, mortality, and risk for malignancy each can be reduced by adherence
  to a gluten-free diet. This treatment is a challenge, however, because the diet
  is expensive, socially isolating, and not always effective in controlling symptoms
  or intestinal damage. Hence, there is increasing interest in developing nondietary
  therapies. '
