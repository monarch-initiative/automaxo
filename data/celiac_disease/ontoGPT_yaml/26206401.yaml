input_text: 'Factors governing long-term adherence to a gluten-free diet in adult
  patients with coeliac disease. BACKGROUND: A strict gluten-free diet is the cornerstone
  of treatment for coeliac disease. Studies of gluten-free diet adherence have rarely
  used validated instruments. There is a paucity of data on long-term adherence to
  the gluten-free diet in the adult population. AIMS: To determine the long-term adherence
  to the gluten-free diet and potential associated factors in a large coeliac disease
  referral centre population. METHODS: We performed a mailed survey of adults with
  clinically, serologically and histologically confirmed coeliac disease diagnosed
  >=5 years prior to survey. The previously validated Celiac Disease Adherence Test
  was used to determine adherence. Demographic, socio-economic and potentially associated
  factors were analysed with adherence as the outcome. RESULTS: The response rate
  was 50.1% of 709 surveyed, the mean time on a gluten-free diet 9.9 +- 6.4 years.
  Adequate adherence (celiac disease adherence test score <13) was found in 75.5%
  of respondents. A higher level of education was associated with adequate adherence
  (P = 0.002) even after controlling for household income (P = 0.0220). Perceptions
  of cost, effectiveness of the gluten-free diet, knowledge of the gluten-free diet
  and self-effectiveness at following the gluten-free diet correlated with adherence
  scores (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Long-term adherence to a gluten-free diet was adequate
  in >75% of respondents. Perceived cost remains a barrier to adherence. Perceptions
  of effectiveness of gluten-free diet as well as its knowledge, are potential areas
  for intervention.'
