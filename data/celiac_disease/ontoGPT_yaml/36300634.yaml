input_text: 'Liver abnormalities in celiac disease and response to gluten free diet:
  A systematic review and meta-analysis. BACKGROUND AND AIM: Liver involvement in
  celiac disease (CeD) is known but its various etiologies and the effect of gluten
  free diet (GFD) on it is understudied. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Medline and
  Embase databases from date of inception to March 7, 2022, to look for studies reporting
  on CeD and liver abnormalities. Pooled proportion of CeD patients with deranged
  transaminases, etiologies of various other liver diseases with CeD and the response
  to GFD were estimated. Subgroup analyses based on the age group, geographic distribution
  and duration of GFD were also carried out. RESULTS: Total 42 studies (8976 patients)
  reported hyper-transaminasemia in patients with celiac disease. The pooled proportion
  of patients with elevated transaminases was 21.42% (95% CI: 17.02-26.59, I2  = 94%)
  overall, with similar prevalence among adults (21.20%) and children (21.51%). The
  commonest etiology was celiac hepatitis at 49.23% (95% CI: 30.09-68.59, I2  = 87%).
  Compliance with GFD was noted in 90.27%. The proportion of CeD patients with liver
  abnormalities who showed response to GFD was 86.39% (95% CI: 80.04-90.95, I2  =
  74%) overall. CONCLUSION: Liver involvement was noted in 21.42% of CeD patients.
  Celiac hepatitis was reported in nearly half of them. Good compliance and response
  were noted with GFD.'
