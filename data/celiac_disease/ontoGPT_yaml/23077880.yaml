input_text: '[Variability of nutritional status and of the parameters of lipid metabolism
  in gluten-free diet]. UNLABELLED: Celiac disease is one of the most common forms
  of food intolerance in children, being an autoimmune enteropathy occurring in genetically
  susceptible individuals. The only treatment of celiac disease consists in a lifelong
  strict gluten-free diet. After gluten free diet patients with normal weight or growth
  failure risk become obese on the one hand because of recovery intestinal absorption
  and, on the other hand, nutritionally unbalanced diet, high in fat and protein.
  AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the nutritional status and the presence
  and prevalence of various changes dyslipidemia in gluten free diet. MATERIAL AND
  METHODS: The trial was formed by 92 patients (mean age at diagnosis 88,5 months)
  diagnosed with CD between January 2008 - December 2010 in 2nd and 3rd Pediatric
  Clinics of "Sf. Maria" Hospital Iasi. Patients were divided into two groups: group
  I included 36 patients younger than 2 years and group II included 52 patients aged
  over 2 years at time of diagnosis of celiac disease. All patients received gluten
  free diet. Were evaluated periodically anthropometric indices (weight, height, body
  mass index and Z scores in children over 2 years and weight and nutritional index
  in children under 2 years) and lipid profile (total lipids, total cholesterol, HDL
  cholesterol, triglycerides). Assessing food intake was achieved by interviewing
  parents and children on dietary habits and daily food ration. RESULTS: Assessment
  of nutritional status: group I:--after 24 months of gluten free diet 5 cases presented
  overweight; group II: after 24 months of gluten free diet obesity (BMI > 30) was
  found in 16.07% of cases (9 patients) and overweight (BMI > 25) was found in 28.57%
  of cases (16 patients). Food intake: in all cases was observed increased calorie
  intake by an excess of lipids and carbohydrates in the diet. Investigation of lipid
  metabolism: in group II high values of cholesterol were found in 12 cases (21,42
  of cases). In conclusions, in celiac disease gluten free diet should be balanced
  caloric, fat and protein to ensure an optimal nutritional status and prevent long-term
  complications.'
