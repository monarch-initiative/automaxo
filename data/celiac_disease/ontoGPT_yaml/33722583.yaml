input_text: 'TAK-101 Nanoparticles Induce Gluten-Specific Tolerance in Celiac Disease:
  A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study. BACKGROUND & AIMS: In celiac
  disease (CeD), gluten induces immune activation, leading to enteropathy. TAK-101,
  gluten protein (gliadin) encapsulated in negatively charged poly(dl-lactide-co-glycolic
  acid) nanoparticles, is designed to induce gluten-specific tolerance. METHODS: TAK-101
  was evaluated in phase 1 dose escalation safety and phase 2a double-blind, randomized,
  placebo-controlled studies. Primary endpoints included pharmacokinetics, safety,
  and tolerability of TAK-101 (phase 1) and change from baseline in circulating gliadin-specific
  interferon-gamma-producing cells at day 6 of gluten challenge, in patients with
  CeD (phase 2a). Secondary endpoints in the phase 2a study included changes from
  baseline in enteropathy (villus height to crypt depth ratio [Vh:Cd]), and frequency
  of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes and peripheral gut-homing T cells. RESULTS:
  In phase 2a, 33 randomized patients completed the 14-day gluten challenge. TAK-101
  induced an 88% reduction in change from baseline in interferon-gamma spot-forming
  units vs placebo (2.01 vs 17.58, P = .006). Vh:Cd deteriorated in the placebo group
  (-0.63, P = .002), but not in the TAK-101 group (-0.18, P = .110), although the
  intergroup change from baseline was not significant (P = .08). Intraepithelial lymphocyte
  numbers remained equal. TAK-101 reduced changes in circulating alpha4beta7+CD4+
  (0.26 vs 1.05, P = .032), alphaEbeta7+CD8+ (0.69 vs 3.64, P = .003), and gammadelta
  (0.15 vs 1.59, P = .010) effector memory T cells. TAK-101 (up to 8 mg/kg) induced
  no clinically meaningful changes in vital signs or routine clinical laboratory evaluations.
  No serious adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: TAK-101 was well tolerated and
  prevented gluten-induced immune activation in CeD. The findings from the present
  clinical trial suggest that antigen-specific tolerance was induced and represent
  a novel approach translatable to other immune-mediated diseases. ClinicalTrials.gov
