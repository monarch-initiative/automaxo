input_text: 'Gluten ataxia is better classified as non-celiac gluten sensitivity than
  as celiac disease: a comparative clinical study. Gluten ataxia (GA) has customarily
  been considered to be the main neurological manifestation of celiac disease (CD).
  In recent years, the condition of non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) has been
  defined, which includes some patients who are not considered "true celiacs." We
  performed a comparative clinicopathological study of these three entities. We studied
  31 GA, 48 CD and 37 NCGS patients, prospectively in the same center for a period
  of 7 years. The protocol study included two serological determinations for gluten
  sensitivity [anti-gliadin IgA and IgG (AGA) and anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA
  (TG) antibodies], HLA-DQ2 typing, and duodenal histological assessment. Demographics
  and investigative findings were compared. Females were 55 % in GA, 75 % in CD (p
  < 0.001), and 47 % in NCGS (N.S.). GA patients were older (59 +- 14 years) than
  CD (43 +- 13 years) and NCGS (41 +- 8 years) groups (p < 0.001). AGA positivity
  was higher in GA (100 %) than in CD (48 %) groups (p < 0.001), but similar to NCGS
  patients (89 %; N.S.); TG positivity was lower in GA (3.2 %) than in CD (33.3 %;
  p < 0.001), but similar to NCGS (2.7 %; N.S.). DQ2 (+) was lower in GA (32.2 %)
  than in CD (89.6 %; p < 0.001), but similar to NCGS (29.7 %; N.S.). Lymphocytic
  enteritis (Marsh type 1) was lower in GA (9.6 %) than in CD (66.7 %; p < 0.001),
  but similar to NCGS (10.8 %; N.S.). The other gluten sensitivity-related characteristics
  measured were different to CD patients, but very close to NCGS. We conclude that
  GA patients are better classified within the NCGS group, than within CD.'
