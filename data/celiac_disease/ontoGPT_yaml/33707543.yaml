input_text: 'Precision medicine and machine learning towards the prediction of the
  outcome of potential celiac disease. Potential Celiac Patients (PCD) bear the Celiac
  Disease (CD) genetic predisposition, a significant production of antihuman transglutaminase
  antibodies, but no morphological changes in the small bowel mucosa. A minority of
  patients (17%) showed clinical symptoms and need a gluten free diet at time of diagnosis,
  while the majority progress over several years (up to a decade) without any clinical
  problem neither a progression of the small intestine mucosal damage even when they
  continued to assume gluten in their diet. Recently we developed a traditional multivariate
  approach to predict the natural history, on the base of the information at enrolment
  (time 0) by a discriminant analysis model. Still, the traditional multivariate model
  requires stringent assumptions that may not be answered in the clinical setting.
  Starting from a follow-up dataset available for PCD, we propose the application
  of Machine Learning (ML) methodologies to extend the analysis on available clinical
  data and to detect most influent features predicting the outcome. These features,
  collected at time of diagnosis, should be capable to classify patients who will
  develop duodenal atrophy from those who will remain potential. Four ML methods were
  adopted to select features predictive of the outcome; the feature selection procedure
  was indeed capable to reduce the number of overall features from 85 to 19. ML methodologies
  (Random Forests, Extremely Randomized Trees, and Boosted Trees, Logistic Regression)
  were adopted, obtaining high values of accuracy: all report an accuracy above 75%.
  The specificity score was always more than 75% also, with two of the considered
  methods over 98%, while the best performance of sensitivity was 60%. The best model,
  optimized Boosted Trees, was able to classify PCD starting from the selected 19
  features with an accuracy of 0.80, sensitivity of 0.58 and specificity of 0.84.
  Finally, with this work, we are able to categorize PCD patients that can more likely
  develop overt CD using ML. ML techniques appear to be an innovative approach to
  predict the outcome of PCD, since they provide a step forward in the direction of
  precision medicine aimed to customize healthcare, medical therapies, decisions,
  and practices tailoring the clinical management of PCD children.'
