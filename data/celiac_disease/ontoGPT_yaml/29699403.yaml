input_text: 'Ten years of follow-up of the Spanish cohort of the European PreventCD
  study: the lessons learned. AIM: to evaluate the influence of gluten consumption
  on celiac disease development and to describe its natural history in the Spanish
  cohort of the European PreventCD study. METHODS: prospective multi-center double
  blind study of 225 children that were followed up from birth. All cases were HLA-DQ2/HLA-DQ8
  positive with a 1st degree relative with celiac disease and were followed up in
  three centers from Madrid, Reus and Valencia. Gluten intake was determined between
  four and ten months according to the protocol. Gluten intake was ad libitum between
  eleven and 36 months and was prospectively quantified by means of dietary records.
  Clinical visits and specific antibody analysis for celiac disease were performed
  periodically. RESULTS: twenty-six cases were diagnosed, all had a positive biopsy
  and serology; 21 had gastrointestinal symptoms and five were asymptomatic. In addition,
  2,565 food records were analyzed and statistically significant differences (p <
  0.001) were found with regard to gluten consumption among the three centers, although
  not between celiac and non-celiac children (p = 0.025). The HLA-DQ2.5/DQ2.5 and
  DQ2.5/DQ2.2 genotypes had a relative risk of 4.7 (95% CI: 0.80-27.55; p = 0.08),
  which was higher than for the rest of genotypes. Female gender also had a relative
  risk that was five times higher than that for males. CONCLUSIONS: the amount of
  gluten intake between 11 and 36 months or the duration of breast feeding were not
  risk factors for the development of CD in the Spanish population. The HLA genotype
  and gender were the most relevant associated factors. In this at-risk group, the
  disease presented before two years of age in the majority of the cases with a weak
  clinical expression.'
