input_text: 'Immunotherapy trial as diagnostic test in evaluating patients with presumed
  autoimmune gastrointestinal dysmotility. BACKGROUND: Chronic gastrointestinal dysmotility
  greatly impacts the quality of life. Treatment options are limited and generally
  symptomatic. Neural autoimmunity is an under-recognized etiology. We evaluated immunotherapy
  as an aid to diagnosing autoimmune gastrointestinal dysmotility (AGID). METHODS:
  Twenty-three subjects evaluated at the Mayo Clinic for suspected AGID (August 2006-February
  2014) fulfilled the following criteria: (1) prominent symptoms of gastrointestinal
  dysmotility with abnormalities on scintigraphy-manometry; (2) serological evidence
  or personal/family history of autoimmune disease; (3) treated by immunotherapy on
  a trial basis, 6-12 weeks (intravenous immune globulin, 16; or methylprednisolone,
  5; or both, 2). Response was defined subjectively (symptomatic improvement) and
  objectively (gastrointestinal scintigraphy/manometry studies). KEY RESULTS: Symptoms
  at presentation: constipation, 18/23; nausea or vomiting, 18/23; weight loss, 17/23;
  bloating, 13/23; and early satiety, 4/23. Thirteen patients had personal/family
  history of autoimmunity. Sixteen had neural autoantibodies and 19 had extra-intestinal
  autonomic testing abnormalities. Cancer was detected in three patients. Preimmunotherapy
  scintigraphy revealed slowed transit (19/21 evaluated; gastric, 11; small bowel,
  12; colonic, 11); manometry studies were abnormal in 7/8. Postimmunotherapy, 17
  (74%) had improvement (both symptomatic and scintigraphic, five; symptomatic alone,
  eight; scintigraphic alone, four). Nine responders re-evaluated had scintigraphic
  evidence of improvement. The majority of responders who were re-evaluated had improvement
  in autonomic testing (six of seven) or manometry (two of two). CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES:
  This proof of principle study illustrates the importance of considering an autoimmune
  basis for idiopathic gastrointestinal dysmotility and supports the utility of a
  diagnostic trial of immunotherapy.'
