input_text: 'Barriers at various levels of human ecosystem for maintaining adherence
  to gluten free diet in adult patients with celiac disease. INTRODUCTION: While lifelong
  and strict adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD) is essential for the successful treatment
  of celiac disease (CeD), only 30-50% of patients are able to maintain a good adherence
  to GFD. We determined factors influencing the adherence to GFD at various ecological
  levels including intra-personal, inter-personal, organizational, community and system-based
  levels in adult patients with CeD. METHODS: A questionnaire to assess the adherence
  was developed and it was administered in the CeD clinic to patients with CeD on
  GFD for >1 year. Adherence to GFD was assessed in a subset of patients (n = 320)
  using Celiac Disease Adherence Test (CDAT). RESULTS: Overall, 978 patients [median
  age: 29 years; females: 592] with CeD on GFD were recruited. They reported many
  barriers to adherence to GFD including intra-personal barriers such as lack of knowledge
  about GFD (19%), inadequate financial resources (27.2%) and lack of self-motivation/confidence
  (55.3%); inter-personal barriers such as intake of gluten-containing food upon forceful
  insistence of friends/family (23.4%); organizational barriers such as high cost
  (70.8%) and non-availability of GF-food products (48.6%); community-based barriers
  like consumption of gluten-containing food at religious occasions/festivals (11.1%)
  and social occasions (27.2%); and system-based barriers such as non-referral to
  dietitian for counseling (21.9%). As per CDAT, 204 (63.7%), 73(22.8%) and 43(13.4%)
  patients had good, average, and poor adherence to GFD, respectively. On multivariable
  analysis, occasional consumption of gluten, non-availability of GF-food while dining
  out and coercing by family and friends for consumption of GC-food were found to
  have highest odds for poor adherence to GFD. CONCLUSIONS: Non-referral to a dietitian
  for counseling, irregular follow-up visits, unavailability of flour mill, non-supportive
  family/friends, high cost and limited availability of GF-food are the most common
  barriers to adherence to GFD. There is a need to create infrastructure and develop
  strategies to overcome these diverse barriers at various levels of ecosystem and
  thereby facilitate better adherence to GFD.'
