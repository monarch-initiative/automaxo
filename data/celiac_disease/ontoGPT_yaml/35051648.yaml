input_text: 'A Low FODMAP Diet Reduces Symptoms in Treated Celiac Patients With Ongoing
  Symptoms-A Randomized Controlled Trial. BACKGROUND & AIMS: A gluten-free diet usually
  leads to mucosal remission in celiac disease, but persistent symptoms are common.
  A low fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) diet is an established
  treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We have assessed the efficacy of a
  moderately low FODMAP diet on persistent symptoms in treated celiac patients. METHODS:
  A randomized controlled trial was performed from 2018 to 2019 in 70 adults with
  biopsy-proven celiac disease. Inclusion criteria were as follows: persistent gastrointestinal
  symptoms defined by a Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS)-IBS version score
  of 30 or higher, gluten-free diet adherence for 12 months or longer, and serologic
  and mucosal remission. Participants were randomized to a low FODMAP-gluten-free
  diet (intervention) or usual gluten-free diet (control). The GSRS-IBS score was
  recorded at baseline and at weeks 1 to 4, and the Celiac Symptom Index at baseline
  and at week 4. Statistics included marginal models for repeated data and analyses
  of covariance. RESULTS: We included 34 participants in the intervention group and
  36 in the control group. Time development of GSRS-IBS total scores differed significantly
  between the groups (Pinteraction < .001), evident after 1 week (mean difference
  in intervention vs control, -8.2; 95% CI, -11.5 to -5.0) and persisting through
  week 4 (mean difference in intervention vs control, -10.8; 95% CI, -14.8 to -6.8).
  Moreover, significantly lower scores were found for the dimensions of pain, bloating,
  diarrhea, and satiety (Pinteraction <= .04), but not constipation (Pinteraction
  = .43). FODMAP intake during the intervention was moderately low (mean, 8.1 g/d;
  95% CI, 6.7-9.3 g/d). The Celiac Symptom Index was significantly lower in the intervention
  group at week 4 (mean difference, -5.8; 95% CI, -9.6 to -2.0). CONCLUSIONS: A short-term
  moderately low FODMAP diet significantly reduced gastrointestinal symptoms and increased
  celiac disease-specific health, and should be considered for the management of persistent
  symptoms in celiac disease. CLINICALTRIALS: gov: NCT03678935.'
