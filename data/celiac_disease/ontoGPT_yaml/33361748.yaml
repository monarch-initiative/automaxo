input_text: "Celiac Disease in an Adult Presenting as Behavioral Disturbances. BACKGROUND
  Celiac disease is very common, with some estimates placing the prevalence at approximately
  1: 300 worldwide. Typified by autoimmune degradation of the duodenal brush border
  due to reactivity with dietary gluten, causing malabsorption, it classically presents
  with both gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms. Gastrointestinal symptoms
  commonly include diarrhea, constipation, foul steatorrhea, flatulence, and bloating.
  With increased awareness and availability of testing, it is rare that a patient
  would present with celiac crisis, which is a syndrome of profuse diarrhea and severe
  metabolic/nutritional disturbances. In children, interestingly, celiac disease can
  present primarily as behavioral disturbance, such as increased aggression or anxiety,
  with milder or absent gastrointestinal symptoms. CASE REPORT A 25-year-old man with
  a history of schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder presented for behavioral
  disturbance after breaking into a neighbor's house to eat food. He also reported
  several months of diarrhea and fecal incontinence and was noted to have severe malnutrition
  on exam, despite dramatic food intake. Tissue transglutaminase IgA antibody (TTG)
  and gliadin IgA were highly suggestive of celiac disease, which was confirmed by
  biopsy. He was started on a lactose-free and gluten-free diet, and required a short
  course of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for nutritional resuscitation. He improved
  rapidly with this intervention, and returned to nutritional and behavioral baseline.
  CONCLUSIONS We report a unique case in which an adult with psychiatric comorbidities
  presented with predominantly behavioral disturbances, a more common presentation
  in children with the disorder. These patients may present in an atypical fashion,
  and the clinician should have a high index of suspicion."
