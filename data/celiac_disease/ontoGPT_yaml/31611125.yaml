input_text: 'Familial Celiac Disease Remission as a Result of a Full Donor Immunologic
  Recovery After Sibling Cord Blood Transplantation for Chronic Granulomatous Disease:
  A Case Report. We present a case report of a boy diagnosed with both chronic granulomatous
  disease (CGD) and familial celiac disease (CD) who underwent cord blood transplantation
  from a partially matched sibling donor. The presentation of CD resembled Crohn-like
  enteropathy, which is a canonical manifestation of CGD. Nearly 1 year post-hematopoietic
  stem cell transplantation (HSCT), a gluten-containing diet was reintroduced, and
  no reappearance of clinical, serologic, or histologic markers of CD was observed.
  The relatively high incidence of rare genetic diseases in pediatric patients suggests
  the need for additional caution in the interpretation of symptoms mimicking already
  known hallmarks of more common conditions. In addition, the presented data confirm
  the previous rare observations that allogeneic HSCT leads to durable induction of
  gluten tolerance in patients with CD, which can warrant its use in patients with
  refractory subtypes of CD.'
