input_text: Psychological Needs and Services in a Pediatric Multidisciplinary Celiac
  Disease Clinic. This study aims to describe the psychological needs in children
  with celiac disease (CD) and to examine the feasibility of psychological consultation
  in a multidisciplinary clinic. Participants (N = 69) included children with CD and
  their parents who completed a pre-clinic mental health survey and a 30-min psychological
  consultation as part of a multidisciplinary clinic (including gastroenterology,
  nutrition, education, neurology, and neuropsychology). Quantitative and qualitative
  analyses examined psychological needs, experiences, and satisfaction. The psychologist
  identified clinically significant symptoms and provided referrals in 49% of children.
  There were no significant differences by time since CD diagnosis. During the psychology
  consultation, families discussed emotional adjustment, impact on life and physical
  well-being, and management of the gluten-free diet. Parents reported high levels
  of satisfaction from the clinic visit. We identified frequent psychological needs
  in pediatric CD. The multidisciplinary approach may be a feasible model for specialized,
  optimal treatment in this population.
