input_text: 'Extraintestinal Manifestations of Celiac Disease: Effectiveness of the
  Gluten-Free Diet. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness
  of the gluten-free diet (GFD) on extraintestinal symptoms in pediatric and adult
  celiac populations at the University of Chicago. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective
  chart review of the University of Chicago Celiac Center clinic charts from January
  2002 to October 2014. Demographics, serologic testing, intestinal biopsies, and
  extraintestinal symptoms at presentation, 12, 24, and >24 months were recorded.
  Extraintestinal symptoms included abnormal liver enzymes, arthralgia/arthritis,
  dermatitis herpetiformis, alopecia, fatigue, headache, anemia, stomatitis, myalgias,
  psychiatric disorders, rashes, seizures, neuropathy, short stature, delayed puberty,
  osteoporosis, and infertility. RESULTS: A total of 737 patients with biopsy-confirmed
  celiac disease or skin biopsy-confirmed dermatitis herpetiformis were included.
  Patients lost to follow-up, or with insufficient data were excluded leaving 328
  patients (157 pediatrics younger than 18 years). For pediatrics, the female to male
  ratio was 2:1 and the mean age at diagnosis was 8.9 years. For adults, 4:1 and 40.6
  years old. Extraintestinal symptom rates were similar in children (60%) and adults
  (62%). Short stature (33%), fatigue (28%), and headache (20%) were most common in
  children. Iron deficiency anemia (48%), fatigue (37%), and headache/psychiatric
  disorders (24%) were common in adults. Children had faster/higher rates of symptom
  resolution compared with adults. Twenty-eight percent of children with unresolved
  short stature on a GFD were found to have other comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: Children
  and adults with celiac disease have similar rates of extraintestinal manifestations.
  In children short stature, fatigue, and headache were most common, whereas anemia,
  fatigue, and headache/psychiatric disorders were most common in adults. Children
  on a strict GFD showed faster and higher rates of symptom resolution as compared
  to adults. Unresponsive children with short stature must be assessed for comorbidities.'
