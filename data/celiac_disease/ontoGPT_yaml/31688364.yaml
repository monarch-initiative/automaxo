input_text: 'Effect of a Gluten-free Diet on Quality of Life in Patients With Nonclassical
  Versus Classical Presentations of Celiac Disease. BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD)
  often presents with symptoms of diarrhea and malabsorption, termed classical CD.
  However, it can also present as nonclassical CD, which is commonly associated with
  nongastrointestinal symptoms. Studies suggest that nonclassical CD tends to have
  less severe symptoms than classical CD, which may affect both adherence to a gluten-free
  diet (GFD) and psychological stress. Therefore, we compared adherence to a GFD and
  psychological measures, including quality of life (QOL) and somatization, between
  patients with nonclassical and classical presentations of CD. METHODS: Patients
  at a tertiary care center with biopsy-proven CD, who completed a Talley Bowel Disease
  Questionnaire and the Short Form-36 at diagnosis and who had been on a GFD for at
  least 1 year, were included in this study. Patients were further surveyed to assess
  gastrointestinal symptoms, QOL, Somatization Symptom Checklist (SSC), and adherence
  to a GFD. Results were compared between patients with classical versus nonclassical
  CD presentation. RESULTS: Among 122 patients included in this study, 62 had classical
  CD and 60 had nonclassical CD. At diagnosis, health-related QOL was lower in the
  classical CD group than in the nonclassical CD group. After following a GFD, both
  groups had improved QOL after following a GFD, and body mass index significantly
  increased in both groups. Most subscales of QOL, SSC scores, and adherence to the
  GFD were similar between the groups, except the Short Form-36 Mental Component summary
  scores that were still lower in the classical CD (48.4 vs. 52.6 nonclassical CD
  group; P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Despite QOL at diagnosis being higher in those with
  nonclassical CD versus lower in those with classical CD, both groups had improved
  QOL and achieved a similar QOL after following a GFD.'
