input_text: 'Improving the stability and activity of oral therapeutic enzymes-recent
  advances and perspectives. Exogenous, orally-administered enzymes are currently
  in clinical use or under development for the treatment of pathologies, such as celiac
  disease and phenylketonuria. However, the administration of therapeutic enzymes
  via the oral route remains challenging due to potential inactivation of these fragile
  macromolecular entities in the harsh environment of the gastrointestinal tract.
  Enzymes are particularly sensitive because both proteolysis and unfolding can lead
  to their inactivation. Current efforts to overcome these shortcomings involve the
  application of gastro-resistant delivery systems and the modification of enzyme
  structures by polymer conjugation or protein engineering. This perspective manuscript
  reviews and critically discusses recent progress in the oral delivery of therapeutic
  enzymes, whose substrate is localized in the gastrointestinal tract. '
