input_text: 'Analysis of gluten immunogenic peptides in feces to assess adherence
  to the gluten-free diet in pediatric celiac patients. PURPOSE: In celiac disease
  (CD) there is a need for precise and non-invasive tools to assess dietary compliance
  to the gluten-free diet (GFD). Our aim is to evaluate the efficacy of the detection
  of gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) in feces, to monitor in real life, the adherence
  to GFD in pediatric patients with CD. METHODS: A cross-sectional, prospective study
  was conducted. Fecal samples from CD children were analyzed by a rapid immunochromatographic
  (IC) test and by an ELISA method, both based on the antigliadin 33-mer monoclonal
  antibody. RESULTS: Group 1 comprises 43 children on a GFD. According to the food
  records (FR), 39/43 patients were compliant with the GFD and gluten consumption
  was recorded in 4. GIP were detected in 15/43 individuals by the ELISA method and
  also in 7 by IC strips. Group 2: comprise 18 children at CD diagnosis; GIP levels
  decreased over time (p < 0.001) in a non-linear way (p = 0.028) after starting a
  GFD and were below the detection limit on the third day in most individuals. CONCLUSION:
  GIP were detected, both by ELISA and by IC strips, in CD patients on a GFD, in which
  no consumption of gluten had been registered on the FR, confirming GIP detection
  to be superior to FR discovering involuntary transgressions. Despite a positive
  correlation between the amount of gluten intake and the concentration of GIP in
  feces, the interindividual variations observed suggest gastrointestinal factors
  influencing GIP recovery need to be further investigated.'
