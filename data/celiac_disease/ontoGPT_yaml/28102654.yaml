input_text: 'Tuberculosis and tuberculin skin test reactivity in pediatric patients
  with celiac disease. BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to determine tuberculin
  skin test reactivity and associated factors in pediatric patients with celiac disease
  (CD). METHODS: Tuberculin skin test (TST) was performed on 28 patients with CD aged
  from 1 year to 15 years (mean, 6.64+-4.8) and 28 healthy age and sex-matched children.
  The association between TST reactivity and parameters such as age, gender, malnutrition,
  clinical presentation, compliance to gluten free diet and response to hepatitis
  A and B vaccinations were determined. RESULTS: No difference was observed in TST
  reactivity (induration size) between the patients with CD and healthy controls.
  Thirty-two percent (9/28) of the patients were anergic, and one-third of these nine
  patients had malnutrition. No significant difference was observed between TST-positive
  and TST-negative patients in terms of age, gender, malnutrition, compliance to gluten-free
  diet and response to hepatitis A and B vaccinations (P>0.05). One of 11 patients
  with positive TST had tuberculosis disease and 10 had latent tuberculosis infection
  (LTBI), whereas none of the controls had LTBI or tuberculosis disease (P=0.0007).
  CONCLUSIONS: Although based on a small number of cases, it seems that children with
  CD are more susceptible to tuberculosis than healthy children. TST can be used to
  identify BCG-vaccinated children with CD who are probably infected with M. tuberculosis,
  similarly to healthy children.'
