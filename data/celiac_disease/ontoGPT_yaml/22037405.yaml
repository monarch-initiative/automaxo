input_text: '[Treatment perspectives]. Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory
  enteropathy caused by the ingestion of gluten. A safe and efficient but unpleasant
  treatment exists for CD in form of a strict gluten-free diet. Thus, there is a need
  for new treatment strategies, which are based on the improved and advanced understanding
  of the pathophysiology of CD. The first strategy consists in reducing or even eliminating
  major antigenic motifs in gluten, responsible for the inflammatory reaction. The
  use of less immunogenic wheat was suggested but this seems rather difficult to realize.
  However, a complete digestion of the immunogenic parts of gluten looks very promising.
  This can be obtained by the use of polymers, capable to sequester gluten proteins
  or even better via the exogenous administration of propyl-endopeptidases, with two
  different enzymes under development. Another approach could be the use of inhibitors
  of tissue transglutaminase, a strategy which is under clinical investigation. Alternatively,
  inhibition of the site of liaison of immunostimulatory peptides with HLA molecules
  was suggested and is also under investigation in vivo. For patients suffering from
  refractory sprue, the inhibition of IL15 might be of therapeutic interest with the
  hope to improve the fatal outcome of many of these patients. However, the ultimate
  treatment approach is in form of prevention and the role of infectious agents, such
  as Rotavirus, in disease onset has to be considered.'
