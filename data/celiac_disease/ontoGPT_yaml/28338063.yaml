input_text: Greater postprandial glucose excursions and inadequate nutrient intake
  in youth with type 1 diabetes and celiac disease. The gluten free diet (GFD) has
  a high glycemic index and low-fiber content, which potentially influences glycemic
  excursions in type 1 diabetes (T1D) and celiac disease (CD). Participants in this
  case-control study of youth with T1D+CD (n = 10) and T1D only (n = 7) wore blinded
  continuous glucose monitoring systems for six days. Blood glucose levels (BGLs)
  were compared between groups for each meal, including pre-meal, peak, 2-hour postprandial
  and time-to-peak. Participants consumed a test-breakfast of GF cereal and milk for
  three days and kept weighed food diaries; nutrient intake was analyzed and compared
  to national recommendations. Youth with T1D+CD had shorter time-to-peak BGL (77
  vs 89 mins, P = 0.03), higher peak (9.3 vs 7.3 mmol/L, P = 0.001) and higher postprandial
  BGLs than T1D (8.4 vs 7.0 mmol/L, P = 0.01), despite similar pre-meal BGLs (9.2
  vs 8.6 mmol/L, P = 0.28). Regarding test breakfast, greater pre and post-meal BGL
  difference correlated with longer CD duration (R = 0.53, P = 0.01). Total energy
  and macronutrient intake didn't differ between groups; however the majority of participants
  collectively had inadequate intake of calcium (76%), folate (71%) and fiber (53%),
  with excessive saturated fat (12%) and sodium (>2,000 mg/day). The GFD is associated
  with greater glycemic excursions and inadequate nutritional intake in youth with
  T1D+CD. Clinical management should address both glycemic variability and dietary
  quality.
