input_text: 'The relation between celiac disease, nonceliac gluten sensitivity and
  irritable bowel syndrome. Wheat products make a substantial contribution to the
  dietary intake of many people worldwide. Despite the many beneficial aspects of
  consuming wheat products, it is also responsible for several diseases such as celiac
  disease (CD), wheat allergy, and nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). CD and irritable
  bowel syndrome (IBS) patients have similar gastrointestinal symptoms, which can
  result in CD patients being misdiagnosed as having IBS. Therefore, CD should be
  excluded in IBS patients. A considerable proportion of CD patients suffer from IBS
  symptoms despite adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). The inflammation caused
  by gluten intake may not completely subside in some CD patients. It is not clear
  that gluten triggers the symptoms in NCGS, but there is compelling evidence that
  carbohydrates (fructans and galactans) in wheat does. It is likely that NCGS patients
  are a group of self-diagnosed IBS patients who self-treat by adhering to a GFD. '
