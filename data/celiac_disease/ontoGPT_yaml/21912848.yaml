input_text: 'Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma: epidemiology, clinical features,
  and current treatment strategies. Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL)
  is a rare non-Hodgkin lymphoma of T-cell origin. The recent 2008 World Health Organization
  classification of hematologic malignancies distinguishes between two types of EATL.
  The disease is associated with celiac disease, particularly with its late, adult
  onset. Currently, there are no standardized diagnostic or treatment protocols for
  EATL, mostly because of its rarity. Historically, the patients have been treated
  with anthracycline-based chemotherapy with or without surgery. The outcome of patients
  with EATL treated with these approaches is poor. The reported death rates in the
  biggest studies are approximately 80-84%, with median progression-free survival
  (PFS) of 3.4-6.0 months and overall survival of 7.1-10.0 months. The 5-year PFS
  ranged from 3.2% to 18% and OS from 19.7% to 20%. The results of a novel induction
  regimen with ifosfamide, etoposide, and epirubicin alternating with intermediate-dose
  methotrexate followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) are more promising,
  with a 5-year PFS of 52% and OS of 60%. The alternative approach, with a more common
  induction with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, etoposide, and prednisone
  followed by ASCT has also delivered promising results, with a 3-year PFS of 52%
  and OS of 47%. This review summarizes recently published data on epidemiology and
  clinical features, as well as standard and novel treatments including high-dose
  chemotherapy with ASCT and their outcome in EATL.'
