input_text: 'Gluten Immunogenic Peptides are not correlated with reported adherence
  to gluten-free diet in children with celiac disease. OBJECTIVE: There is no gold
  standard to assess adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD) among patients with celiac
  disease (CeD). Gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) in urine and stool were suggested
  as novel markers for evaluating adherence to GFD. Our aim was to assess the presence
  of GIP in pediatric patients with CeD, and to compare the results with alternative
  methods for evaluating GFD adherence. METHODS: Pediatric patients diagnosed with
  CeD, who were on GFD for at least one year, were enrolled and followed prospectively
  between November 2018 and January 2021. Study visits included clinical assessment,
  a dietitian interview, Biagi score, food questionnaires, anthropometric and laboratory
  measurements; and urine and stool samples obtained for laboratory GIP analysis.
  RESULTS: The study included 74 patients (63.5% females), with median (IQR) age of
  9.9 (7.8-11.7) years, and median (IQR) duration on GFD of 2.5 (2-5.5) years. Good
  GFD adherence, assessed by Biagi score, was reported in 93.1% of cases. GIP was
  evaluated during 134 visits, with GIP detected in 27/134 (20.1%) of the visits (16.3%
  of stool samples and 5.3% of urine samples). Positive GIP results were significantly
  more common in males compared to females (30.6% vs. 14.1%, respectively, p<0.05).
  Detection of positive GIP was not associated with dietary assessment of GFD adherence,
  celiac serology results, or reported symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Stool and urine GIP
  can be detected in children with CeD, even when dietary assessment indicate good
  adherence to GFD. The role of GIP testing in clinical practice should be further
  explored.'
