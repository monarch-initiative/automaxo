input_text: Nutritional Status of Saudi Children with Celiac Disease Following the
  Ministry of Health's Gluten-Free Diet Program. This study aimed to evaluate the
  nutritional status of Saudi children with celiac disease (CD) who followed the Ministry
  of Health's gluten-free diet (GFD) program. This study involved 66 children with
  CD (29 boys and 37 girls) from 5 hospitals belonging to the Ministry of Health.
  Socioeconomic characteristics were obtained using a structured questionnaire. Anthropometric
  indices were measured using a body composition analyzer. Dietary intake was assessed
  using three 24 h dietary records. The biochemical parameters were determined in
  the hospitals' laboratories. According to the findings, the majority of respondents
  had ages ranging from 10 to 13 years, a father and mother with a university education,
  a high family income, and 5 to 7 family members. Carbohydrates and protein intake
  for both genders were significantly higher than the DRI's recommended dietary intake.
  However, the majority of nutrients consumed were at levels significantly lower than
  the DRI. Both genders had normal anthropometric indices, with girls having at significantly
  higher indices than boys. The biochemical parameters of both genders were comparable
  and within the normal range, except for vitamin D, which was below the normal range.
  The most important factors influencing nutritional status were age for both genders,
  and family income and number of family members for boys. In conclusion, data obtained
  for nutrient intake, anthropometric indicators, body composition, and biochemical
  analysis indicated that CD children following the Ministry of Health GFD program
  have a generally good nutritional status.
