input_text: 'Did diet compliance and remission reduce oxidative stress in celiac patients?
  OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the effect of remission status on thiol-disulfide
  homeostasis in celiac patients and thus to indirectly determine the effect of oxidative
  stress and inflammation caused by non-compliance with the diet. METHODS: Between
  February 2019 and December 2021, 117 patients diagnosed with celiac disease were
  included in this prospective randomized and controlled study. In addition to routine
  tests of celiac patients, thiol and disulfide measurements were made from the blood
  both at the beginning of the study and at the end of the first year. RESULTS: While
  52 of the patients (44.4%) were in remission, 65 patients (55.6%) were not. There
  was an evident increase in native thiol levels of the patients who were initially
  not in remission but went into at the end of the first year (347.4+-46.7 mumol/L
  vs. 365.3+-44.0 mumol/L; p=0.001). Mean plasma disulfide levels of patients with
  celiac going into remission became reduced in the first year from the level of 14.5+-5.1
  mumol/L down to 8.9+-4.2 mumol/L (p<0.001). In celiac patients who entered remission,
  disulfide and anti-tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin A levels decreased in
  a correlation (r=0.526; p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Not being in remission in celiac disease
  leads to increased oxidative stress, and thiol-disulfide homeostasis is an indirect
  indicator of this. Additionally, providing remission in celiac patients reduces
  oxidative stress.'
