input_text: 'Assessing mucosal recovery in celiac disease - Time to diagnosis and
  histological severity as determining factors. Study background and objectives: There
  is great disparity in mucosal recovery among celiac patients on a gluten-free diet.
  We report a study to identify associated factors. METHODS: Celiac patient cases
  were collected that had positive celiac serology and villous atrophy at diagnosis,
  and had undergone a control biopsy after at least 12 months of follow-up. RESULTS:
  We included 70 celiac patients. They had experienced symptoms for 9.05 +- 9.48 years
  before being diagnosed. After follow-up for 2.93 +- 1.94 years, 34.3 % had complete
  mucosal recovery and 57.1 % had partial mucosal recovery. In the comparative analysis
  we found no relationship between mucosal recovery and sex, age, clinical manifestations
  or follow-up time from diagnosis to second biopsy. Time with clinical manifestations
  before diagnosis was associated with a worse outcome: 2.64 years in patients with
  full recovery, 4.61 years in patients with partial recovery, and 14.26 years in
  patients with persistent villous atrophy. Higher transglutaminase antibody titers
  both at diagnosis and during follow-up were associated with poorer histologic outcomes.
  We observed higher mucosal recovey rates in patients with mild atrophy versus severe
  atrophy at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of gluten-free diet a significant proportion
  of patients have persistent histologic changes. Time with clinical manifestations
  before diagnosis is key for histological severity and recovery.'
