input_text: Celiac Dietary Adherence Test and Standardized Dietician Evaluation in
  Assessment of Adherence to a Gluten-Free Diet in Patients with Celiac Disease. Adherence
  to a gluten-free diet (GFD) is currently the mainstay of treatment strategy for
  celiac disease (CD). The aim of our study was measuring a GFD adherence in CD patients
  using two newly validated methods of dietary assessment-Standardized Dietician Evaluation
  (SDE) and the Celiac Dietary Adherence Test (CDAT). Ninety-two adults with CD were
  evaluated by a registered dietitian with extensive experience with the use of SDE
  and CDAT. Duodenal biopsy was performed and blood was drawn for serum anti-endomysial,
  anti-deamidated gliadin peptide and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies in forty
  four of those patients. The results of CDAT and SDE were very convergent, but SDE
  scores better correlated with serologic and histologic findings. As many as 24-52%
  of study participants did not adhere well enough to a GFD. Insufficient adherence
  to a GFD in CD patients is still a significant problem. The knowledge about gluten
  content in food ingredients and additives is very low among adults with CD. SDE
  is the most accurate method in assessing compliance with a GFD and is especially
  helpful in determining hidden sources of gluten. The CDAT may be a fast tool for
  screening for a GFD adherence in CD patients.
