input_text: Primary gastrointestinal lymphoma. Gastrointestinal tract is the most
  common extranodal site involved by lymphoma with the majority being non-Hodgkin
  type. Although lymphoma can involve any part of the gastrointestinal tract, the
  most frequent sites in order of its occurrence are the stomach followed by small
  intestine and ileocecal region. Gastrointestinal tract lymphoma is usually secondary
  to the widespread nodal diseases and primary gastrointestinal tract lymphoma is
  relatively rare. Gastrointestinal lymphomas are usually not clinically specific
  and indistinguishable from other benign and malignant conditions. Diffuse large
  B-cell lymphoma is the most common pathological type of gastrointestinal lymphoma
  in essentially all sites of the gastrointestinal tract, although recently the frequency
  of other forms has also increased in certain regions of the world. Although some
  radiological features such as bulky lymph nodes and maintenance of fat plane are
  more suggestive of lymphoma, they are not specific, thus mandating histopathological
  analysis for its definitive diagnosis. There has been a tremendous leap in the diagnosis,
  staging and management of gastrointestinal lymphoma in the last two decades attributed
  to a better insight into its etiology and molecular aspect as well as the knowledge
  about its critical signaling pathways.
