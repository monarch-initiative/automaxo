input_text: 'Celiac disease and obesity: need for nutritional follow-up after diagnosis.
  More than 20 years of serological approach to diagnosis of celiac disease (CD) has
  deeply changed the classical clinical presentation of the disease, and some reports
  indicate that CD and obesity can coexist in both childhood and adolescence. We reviewed
  clinical records of 149 children with CD followed in our institution between 1991
  and 2007, considering weight, height and body mass index (BMI), both at diagnosis
  and after at least 12 months of gluten-free diet (GFD). In all, 11% of patients
  had BMI z-score >+1 and 3% were obese (z-score >+2) at presentation. In our population,
  there was a significant (P=0.008) increase in BMI z-score after GFD and the percentage
  of overweight (z-score >+1) subjects almost doubled (11 vs 21%, P=0.03). Our data
  suggest the need for a careful follow-up of nutritional status after diagnosis of
  CD, especially addressing those who are already overweight at presentation.'
