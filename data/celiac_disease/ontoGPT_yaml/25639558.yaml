input_text: 'Celiac disease evolving into dermatitis herpetiformis in patients adhering
  to normal or gluten-free diet. OBJECTIVE: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a cutaneous
  form of celiac disease affecting ~ 17% of celiac disease patients. The aim was to
  determine how often celiac disease precedes the development of DH, and what is the
  impact of gluten-free diet (GFD) in this phenotype change. MATERIAL AND METHODS:
  Our prospectively collected DH series from 1970 comprised 514 patients. We analyzed
  all DH patients who at least 2 years earlier had been diagnosed with celiac disease.
  DH diagnosis was confirmed by showing immunoglobulin A deposits in dermis. Serological
  and small bowel mucosal findings were analyzed, and the strictness of GFD treatment
  before and after the diagnosis of DH was evaluated. RESULTS: Twenty (4%) DH patients
  had a prior diagnosis of celiac disease. The median time interval between celiac
  disease and DH detection was 9.5 years. Before DH appeared 4 patients had been on
  a normal gluten-containing diet, 10 had dietary lapses on a GFD, and 6 were on a
  strict GFD. Celiac autoantibodies were positive in 7 out of 19 patients, and 5 out
  of 7 undergoing small bowel biopsy had partial villous atrophy. Following DH diagnosis
  the rash was controlled after a median of 6 months on a strict GFD. CONCLUSIONS:
  Patients with celiac disease may develop DH by time. This is most often an indicator
  of poor adherence to GFD, and a rigorous dietary intervention is necessary. In the
  majority of cases, DH will be detected without prior celiac disease diagnosis, but
  the physicians should recognize this phenotype alteration.'
