input_text: PNPLA3 rs738409 Polymorphism Predicts Development and Severity of Hepatic
  Steatosis but Not Metabolic Syndrome in Celiac Disease. Metabolic syndrome (MS)
  and hepatic steatosis (HS) have been described in patients with celiac disease (CD)
  after starting a gluten-free diet (GFD), but data on predictive factors for these
  conditions are scarce. Recently, the patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing
  protein 3 (PNPLA3) rs738409 has been identified as a key factor for HS development
  in the general population. The aim of the study was to evaluate the role of PNPLA3
  rs738409 in the development of MS and HS in CD patients after starting GFD. Between
  June 2014 and September 2016, we consecutively enrolled CD patients with HS, while
  those without steatosis served as a control group. All patients underwent anthropometric
  and serologic investigations, ultrasonography (US) to assess the degree and severity
  of HS, and genotyping of the PNPLA3 rs738409 polymorphism. Finally, 370 subjects
  were enrolled (136 with and 234 without HS). At genotyping assays, the CC genotype
  was found in 194 subjects (52.4%), the CG genotype in 138 subjects (37.3%), and
  the GG genotype in 38 subjects (10.2%). At binary logistic regression, only CG and
  GG alleles were predictive for the development of HS (odds ratio (OR) 1.97; p <
  0.01 for CG and OR 6.9; p < 0.001 for GG). Body mass index (BMI) (OR 3.8; p < 0.001)
  and waist circumference (OR 2.8; p = 0.03) at CD diagnosis were the only independent
  factors for the development of MS. Intergroup comparisons showed that the severe
  grade of HS was more frequently observed in GG than in CC carriers (74% vs. 11.3%,
  p < 0.001, OR 21.8). PNPLA3 CG and GG carriers with CD have a higher susceptibility
  to hepatic steatosis, but not to metabolic syndrome. Moreover, patients with GG
  alleles display more severe forms of HS based on ultrasound.
