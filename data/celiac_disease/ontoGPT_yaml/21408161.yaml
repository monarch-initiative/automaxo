input_text: 'Effect of hookworm infection on wheat challenge in celiac disease--a
  randomised double-blinded placebo controlled trial. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The association
  between hygiene and prevalence of autoimmune disease has been attributed in part
  to enteric helminth infection. A pilot study of experimental infection with the
  hookworm Necator americanus was undertaken among a group of otherwise healthy people
  with celiac disease to test the potential of the helminth to suppress the immunopathology
  induced by gluten. METHODS: In a 21-week, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study,
  we explored the effects of N. americanus infection in 20 healthy, helminth-naive
  adults with celiac disease well controlled by diet. Staged cutaneous inoculations
  with 10 and 5 infective 3(rd) stage hookworm larvae or placebo were performed at
  week-0 and -12 respectively. At week-20, a five day oral wheat challenge equivalent
  to 16 grams of gluten per day was undertaken. Primary outcomes included duodenal
  Marsh score and quantification of the immunodominant alpha-gliadin peptide (QE65)-specific
  systemic interferon-gamma-producing cells by ELISpot pre- and post-wheat challenge.
  RESULTS: Enteric colonisation with hookworm established in all 10 cases, resulting
  in transiently painful enteritis in 5. Chronic infection was asymptomatic, with
  no effect on hemoglobin levels. Although some duodenal eosinophilia was apparent,
  hookworm-infected mucosa retained a healthy appearance. In both groups, wheat challenge
  caused deterioration in both primary and several secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS:
  Experimental N. americanus infection proved to be safe and enabled testing its effect
  on a range of measures of the human autoimmune response. Infection imposed no obvious
  benefit on pathology. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00671138.'
