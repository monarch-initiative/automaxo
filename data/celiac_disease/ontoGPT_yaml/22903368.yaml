input_text: "Celiac disease presentation in a tertiary referral centre in India: current
  scenario. BACKGROUND: Nondiarrheal celiac disease (NDCD) is being increasingly reported
  but data from India is limited. AIM: We undertook this study to compare the clinical
  spectrum of NDCD with that of diarrheal/classical celiac disease (CCD). METHOD:
  This facility-based retrospective observational study included consecutive patients
  diagnosed with celiac disease (CD) (as per modified ESPGHAN criteria) from October
  2009 to August 2011. RESULTS: A total of 381 patients were diagnosed with CD during
  the study period. NDCD was present in 192 (51.8 %). NDCD had higher mean age at
  presentation (5.8 +- 2.8 vs. 6.9 +- 2.9 years respectively; p = 0.003) and longer
  duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis (2.9 +- 1.7 years vs. 3.6 +- 2.2 years;
  p = 0.02) as compared to CCD. In the NDCD group, the most frequent gastrointestinal
  (GI) symptoms were recurrent abdominal pain [122 (63.5 %)] and abdominal distension
  [102 (53.1 %)] followed by constipation [48 (25 %)], vomiting [76 (39.6 %)] and
  recurrent oral ulcers [89 (46.4 %)]. Vomiting and constipation were more frequently
  seen in NDCD as compared to CCD (p < 0.001 in both). Commonly enumerated extraintestinal
  manifestations in NDCD included failure to thrive [109 (56.8 %)], isolated short
  stature [36 (18.8 %)], persistent anemia [83 (43.2 %)] and hepatomegaly/splenomegaly
  or both [56 (29.2 %)]. Associated comorbidities included autoimmune thyroiditis
  [11 (5.7 %)], type 1 diabetes mellitus [8 (4.2 %)], bronchial asthma [23 (11.9 %)],
  idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis [4 (2.1 %)], Down's syndrome [3 (1.6 %)], alopecia
  areata [6 (3.1 %)], polyarthritis [2 (1.0 %)], dermatitis herpetiformis [6 (3.1
  %)] and chronic liver disease [6 (3.1 %)]. The number of patients with a Marsh score
  IIIb and above of duodenal biopsy was significantly more in the CCD group (p < 0.001).
  CONCLUSIONS: NDCD is not uncommon in India. Long-term follow up is needed to evaluate
  the impact of the disease and of treatment in these children."
