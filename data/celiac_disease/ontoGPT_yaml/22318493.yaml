input_text: Oral tolerance to food protein. Oral tolerance is the state of local and
  systemic immune unresponsiveness that is induced by oral administration of innocuous
  antigen such as food proteins. An analogous but more local process also regulates
  responses to commensal bacteria in the large intestine and, together, mucosally
  induced tolerance appears to prevent intestinal disorders such as food allergy,
  celiac disease, and inflammatory bowel diseases. Here we discuss the anatomical
  basis of antigen uptake and recognition in oral tolerance and highlight possible
  mechanisms underlying the immunosuppression. We propose a model of stepwise induction
  of oral tolerance in which specialized populations of mucosal dendritic cells and
  the unique microenvironment of draining mesenteric lymph nodes combine to generate
  regulatory T cells that undergo subsequent expansion in the small intestinal lamina
  propria. The local and systemic effects of these regulatory T cells prevent potentially
  dangerous hypersensitivity reactions to harmless antigens derived from the intestine
  and hence are crucial players in immune homeostasis.
