input_text: Intestinal Spirocheteosis in a Patient with Celiac Disease. A young girl
  presented to us with recurrent diarrhea along with a history of 5 kg weight loss
  in one year. On examination, she appeared pale, while her laboratory reports showed
  a low hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and serum albumin. Her erythrocyte
  sedimentation rate (ESR) was slightly raised with her iron profile suggestive of
  iron deficiency anemia. Viral markers, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serology
  along with thyroid profile were all unremarkable. There was no history of tuberculosis,
  and purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test was also negative. Computed tomography
  (CT) abdomen showed thickening of the terminal ileum with multiple enlarged lymph
  nodes. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) along with colonoscopy was done. Multiple
  biopsies were taken, which were suggestive of sprue along with intestinal spirochetosis.
  Her tissue transglutaminase (TTG) was negative while deamidated gliadin peptide
  (DGP) was positive. She was kept on gluten-free diet and started on tablet metronidazole.
  This case shows that intestinal spirochetosis should be kept in mind in patients
  belonging to lower socio-economic status, who present with chronic diarrhea symptoms.
