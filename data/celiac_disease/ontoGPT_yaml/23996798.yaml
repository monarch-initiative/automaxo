input_text: 'Prevalence of celiac disease in nutritional anemia at a tertiary care
  center. BACKGROUND: While anemia occurs in 80 % to 90 % of patients with celiac
  disease (CD), it may be the sole manifestation of CD. The prevalence of CD in Indian
  patients with nutritional anemia is not known. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adolescent
  and adult patients presenting with nutritional anemia were prospectively screened
  for CD using IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody (anti-tTG Ab) followed, if
  positive, by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and duodenal biopsy. RESULTS: Ninety-six
  patients [mean +- SD age 32.1 +- 13.1 years and median duration of anemia 11 months
  (range 1 to 144 months)] were screened. Of these patients, 80 had iron deficiency
  anemia, 11 had megaloblastic anemia, and 5 had dimorphic anemia. Seventy-three patients
  were on hematinics and 36.4 % had received blood transfusions. Nineteen had a history
  of chronic diarrhea and the mean +- SD duration of diarrhea in them was 9.7 +- 35.8
  months. IgA anti-tTG Ab was positive in 13 patients, of whom 12 agreed to undergo
  duodenal biopsy. Ten patients had villous atrophy (Marsh grade 3a in three, 3b in
  one, and 3c in six) and two did not. Thus, 10 patients with nutritional anemia (iron
  deficiency 9, vitamin B12 deficiency 1) were diagnosed to have CD. On multivariate
  logistic regression, age, duration of symptoms, and presence of diarrhea were found
  to be the predictors of CD. All the patients with CD were put on gluten-free diet
  and with iron and vitamin supplementations and showed a significant improvement
  in hemoglobin concentration. CONCLUSIONS: CD screening should be included in the
  work up of otherwise unexplained nutritional anemia.'
