input_text: 'COVID-19 pandemic perception in adults with celiac disease: an impulse
  to implement the use of telemedicine. Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
  causes severe complications and deaths all over the world. COVID-19 also has indirect
  effects from the lockdown and the possible lack of food. We aimed to evaluate the
  perception of this in Celiac Disease (CeD) patients who require a lifelong gluten-free
  diet as a therapy. Methods: We invited by e-mail CeD adult patients from the University
  of Salerno (Campania, South Italy) and the University of Padua (Veneto, North Italy)
  to answer an ad hoc COVID-19 survey. Results: We sent the web survey to 651 email
  addresses and we received 276 answers (42,4%). CeD patients did not feel more vulnerable
  because they had CeD (not at all 56.6%) and they did not worry much about the possible
  shortness of gluten-free food during the epidemic (not at all 48.5%). The most worried
  were the elderly patients, patients with other comorbidities and females. Finally,
  CeD patients were happy with remote consultations and explicitly asked to have them.
  Discussion: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted a proportion of patients with CeD;
  in particular, women, elderly patients, patients with other comorbidities. COVID-19,
  although a challenging experience from the medical and the psychological point of
  view, has offered an opportunity to practice, on a large-scale, a remote consultation
  approach for CeD healthcare.'
