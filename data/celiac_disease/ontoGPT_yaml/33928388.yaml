input_text: 'The Underlying Effects of Celiac Disease and Subsequent Implications
  on Deployment in the United States Army. INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this review
  is to provide an overview of the etiology, pathology, and treatments for celiac
  disease (CD), as well as to provide context as to how CD impacts the U.S. military.
  MATERIALS AND METHODS: To conduct this review, the authors surveyed recent epidemiology
  and immunology literature in order to provide a detailed summary of the current
  understanding of CD, its diagnosis, and the real-world impacts within the Department
  of Defense (DoD). RESULTS: We described the gluten proteins and both the immune
  response in CD. We further describe the underlying genetic risk factors and diagnosis
  and pathogenesis of the disease and conclude the review with a discussion of how
  current DoD regulations impact U.S. military readiness. CONCLUSION: Celiac disease
  (CD) is an autoimmune disorder that results in damage to the small intestine. Ingestion
  of gluten in a CD patient is usually followed by villous atrophy in the small intestine,
  often along with other gastrointestinal symptoms. Around 1% of patients diagnosed
  with CD can experience complications if gluten-free diet is not followed, including
  intestinal lymphoma and hyposplenism. Therefore, a patient showing possible symptoms
  should discuss the diagnostic process with their healthcare providers to ensure
  adequate understanding of serological and genetic tests along with the histological
  examination of intestinal biopsy. Patients should seek consults with registered
  dietitians to structure their diets appropriately. Considering the prevalence and
  incidence of CD and gluten intolerances are increasing, the military should consider
  providing gluten-free Meals Ready-to-Eat as an option for all service members. Given
  the retention of service members with CD, subsequent admission of personnel with
  mild CD that does not affect the duties will allow the DoD access to a growing population
  of fully capable service members with critical technical skills who are eager to
  serve the USA.'
