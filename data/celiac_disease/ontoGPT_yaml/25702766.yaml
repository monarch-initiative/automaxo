input_text: "Review and practice guidelines for celiac disease in 2014. Celiac disease,
  or gluten-sensitive enteropathy, is defined as a state of heightened immunologic
  responsiveness to ingested gluten (from wheat, barley, or rye) in genetically susceptible
  individuals. Ingestion of the offending proteins leads to inflammation and intestinal
  mucosal damage, which may result in a spectrum of gastrointestinal symptoms, nutritional
  abnormalities, and systemic complications ranging from anemia and osteoporosis to
  secondary autoimmunity and malignancy. The genetic influence in the pathogenesis
  of celiac disease is indicated by its familial occurrence. Celiac disease does not
  develop unless a person has alleles that encode for human leukocyte antigen DQ2
  or DQ8 proteins. The clinical picture of celiac disease has changed considerably
  during the past 30 years. Diarrhea, which was the presenting symptom in > 90% of
  celiac disease patients before 1981, is now the chief complaint in < 40%. In contrast,
  the increased frequency of atypical celiac disease presentations, including anemia
  and bone disease, is revealed by the widespread availability of serologic testing.
  An association between celiac disease and autoimmune disorders, such as type 1 diabetes,
  autoimmune thyroid disease, and Sjogren's syndrome, has been well documented. The
  tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin antibody and the endomysial immunoglobulin
  antibody are the most sensitive and specific serologic tests, respectively, for
  identifying individuals who need to undergo an intestinal biopsy. If the suspicion
  of celiac disease is high, intestinal biopsy should be pursued even if serologic
  tests are negative. The gold standard for the diagnosis of celiac disease is a small
  bowel biopsy showing villous atrophy. The treatment for celiac disease is lifelong
  adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). Despite the proven benefits of the GFD, it
  can be exceedingly difficult to completely avoid gluten-containing foods, and adherence
  to a GFD is estimated to be only 45% to 80%. "
