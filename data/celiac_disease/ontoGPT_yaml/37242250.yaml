input_text: Nutritional Composition of Breakfast in Children and Adolescents with
  and without Celiac Disease in Spain-Role of Gluten-Free Commercial Products. Eating
  a nutritionally balanced breakfast can be a challenge when following a gluten-free
  diet (GFD). We assessed the ingredients and nutrient composition of 364 gluten-free
  breakfast products (GFPs) and 348 gluten-containing counterparts (GCCs), and we
  analysed the nutritional quality of breakfast in a group of Spanish children and
  adolescents with celiac disease (CD) (n = 70), as compared to controls (n = 67).
  Food intakes were estimated using three 24 h dietary records. The composition of
  GFPs and GCCs was retrieved from the package labels of commercially available products.
  Most participants (98.5%) ate breakfast daily, and only one person in each group
  skipped breakfast once. The breakfast contribution of the total daily energy was
  19% in participants with CD and 20% in controls. CD patients managed a balanced
  breakfast in terms of energy (54% from carbohydrates; 12% from proteins; 34% from
  lipids) and key food groups (cereals, dairy, fruits), but their intake of fruits
  needs improvement. Compared to controls, breakfast in the CD group provided less
  protein and saturated fat, a similar amount of carbohydrates and fibre, and more
  salt. Fibre is frequently added to GFPs, but these contain less protein because
  of the flours used in formulation. Gluten-free bread contains more fat and is more
  saturated than is GCC. Sugars, sweets, and confectionery contribute more to energy
  and nutrient intakes in participants with CD, while grain products do so in controls.
  Overall, breakfast on a GFD can be adequate, but can be improved by GFPs reformulation
  and a lower consumption of processed foods.
