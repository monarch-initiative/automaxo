input_text: 'The role of gluten-free diet in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease development.
  OBJECTIVE: Celiac Disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease involving the small bowel,
  generated by the ingestion of gluten-containing foods in genetically predisposed
  subjects. Currently, the unique therapy for CD is the absolute adherence to gluten-free
  diet, but this treatment has been related to the onset of non-alcoholic fatty liver
  disease (NAFLD). In this systematic review, we provide an update from the most recent
  studies on the risk of developing NAFLD patients adhering to GFD. MATERIALS AND
  METHODS: According to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
  Statement (PRISMA) criteria, we performed a systematic literature search on PubMed
  and Google Scholar from 2012 to 2021. RESULTS: In the present systematic review,
  eight studies investigated how GFD in CD patients may be a risk factor for the onset
  of NAFLD from a minimum of six months to the maximum follow-up period represented
  by a median of 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: Present systematic review evaluates how GFD
  plays a key role in NAFLD for consumption of products rich in saturated fats and
  carbohydrates that promotes accumulation of lipids and lead to hepatic steatosis
  and inflammation.'
