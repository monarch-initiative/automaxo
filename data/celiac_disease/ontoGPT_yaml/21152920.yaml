input_text: Celiac disease of the joint. A 42-year-old woman presented with a 3-week
  history of left knee pain and swelling. She had suffered dermatitis herpetiformis
  for 12 years, proved by skin biopsy. She had never been on gluten-free diet. Knee
  pain increased with motion and her gait was antalgic. On admission, she was mainly
  dependent on wheelchair due to pain and limitation. Treatment plan consisted of
  gluten-free diet, stretching and strengthening exercises, analgesic or nonsteroidal
  anti-inflammatory drugs when needed. She responded well to gluten-free diet. Association
  of joint involvement and dermatitis herpetiformis is more than just coincidental.
  Possible immunopathogenesis and role of gluten-free diet on arthritis treatment
  are discussed.
