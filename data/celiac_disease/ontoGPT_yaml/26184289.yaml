input_text: 'Analysis of Body Composition and Food Habits of Spanish Celiac Women.
  The purpose of the present work was both to analyze composition of Spanish celiac
  women and to study the food habits and gluten-free diet of these celiac patients,
  in order to determine whether they achieve a balanced and healthy diet as well as
  to highlight nutritional qualitative and/or quantitative differences. 54 adult celiac
  women (34 +- 13 years) took part in the six-month study. Height, weight and body
  composition were measured. An analysis of energy consumption and of the macronutrient
  distribution of their diet was carried out. Their fulfillment of micronutrient intake
  recommendations was verified. Participants showed a Body Mass Index of 21.6 +- 2.4
  kg/m2. Energy Intake was slightly lower than the Dietary Reference Intakes. Excessive
  protein apart from over-consumption of fat was observed. More than three quarters
  of participants consumed meat in excess. Carbohydrate consumption along with that
  of fiber was below recommended levels. Vitamin D, iron, and iodine had a low percentage
  of recommendation compliance. In general, participants followed the recommendations
  of dairy products and fruit intake whereas vegetable consumption was not enough
  for the vast majority. We conclude that although the diet of celiac women does not
  differ much from the diet of general population, some considerations, such as reducing
  fat and protein consumption and increasing fiber intake, must be taken into account. '
