input_text: 'Iron Deficiency in Celiac Disease: Prevalence, Health Impact, and Clinical
  Management. Iron is an essential nutrient to life and is required for erythropoiesis,
  oxidative, metabolism, and enzymatic activities. It is a cofactor for mitochondrial
  respiratory chain enzymes, the citric acid cycle, and DNA synthesis, and it promotes
  the growth of immune system cells. Thus, iron deficiency (ID) leads to deleterious
  effects on the overall health of individuals, causing significant morbidity. Iron
  deficiency anemia (IDA) is the most recognized type of anemia in patients with celiac
  disease (CD) and may be present in over half of patients at the time of diagnosis.
  Folate and vitamin B12 malabsorption, nutritional deficiencies, inflammation, blood
  loss, development of refractory CD, and concomitant Heliobacter pylori infection
  are other causes of anemia in such patients. The decision to replenish iron stores
  and the route of administration (oral or intravenous) are controversial due, in
  part, to questions surrounding the optimal formulation and route of administration.
  This paper provides an algorithm based on the severity of symptoms; its impact on
  the health-related quality of life (HRQL); the tolerance and efficiency of oral
  iron; and other factors that predict a poor response to oral iron, such as the severity
  of histological damage, poor adherence to GFD, and blood loss due to mucosal lesions.'
