input_text: 'Transglutaminase 6 antibodies in the diagnosis of gluten ataxia. OBJECTIVES:
  The previous finding of an immunologic response primarily directed against transglutaminase
  (TG)6 in patients with gluten ataxia (GA) led us to investigate the role of TG6
  antibodies in diagnosing GA. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study. We recruited
  patients from the ataxia, gluten/neurology, celiac disease (CD), and movement disorder
  clinics based at Royal Hallamshire Hospital (Sheffield, UK) and the CD clinic, Tampere
  University Hospital (Tampere, Finland). The groups included patients with idiopathic
  sporadic ataxia, GA, and CD, and neurology and healthy controls. All were tested
  for TG6 antibodies. Duodenal biopsies were performed in patients with positive serology.
  In addition, biopsies from 15 consecutive patients with idiopathic sporadic ataxia
  and negative serology for gluten-related disorders were analyzed for immunoglobulin
  A deposits against TG. RESULTS: The prevalence of TG6 antibodies was 21 of 65 (32%)
  in idiopathic sporadic ataxia, 35 of 48 (73%) in GA, 16 of 50 (32%) in CD, 4 of
  82 (5%) in neurology controls, and 2 of 57 (4%) in healthy controls. Forty-two percent
  of patients with GA had enteropathy as did 51% of patients with ataxia and TG6 antibodies.
  Five of 15 consecutive patients with idiopathic sporadic ataxia had immunoglobulin
  A deposits against TG2, 4 of which subsequently tested positive for TG6 antibodies.
  After 1 year of gluten-free diet, TG6 antibody titers were significantly reduced
  or undetectable. CONCLUSIONS: Antibodies against TG6 are gluten-dependent and appear
  to be a sensitive and specific marker of GA.'
