input_text: 'Cesarean delivery and risk of hospitalization for autoimmune disorders
  before 14 years of age. It is supposed that cesarean birth is implicated in the
  development of autoimmunity. We evaluated the association between cesarean delivery
  and the risk of hospitalization for autoimmune disease in children up to 14 years
  of age. We performed a longitudinal cohort study of 934,873 children born between
  2006 and 2019 in Quebec, Canada. The main exposure measure was cesarean delivery
  versus vaginal delivery (spontaneous or induced). Outcomes included hospitalization
  for type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, or other autoimmune disorders before 14 years
  of age. We used Cox regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence
  intervals (CI) for the association between cesarean delivery and hospitalization
  for autoimmune disorders, adjusted for patient characteristics. A total of 248,963
  children (27%) were delivered by cesarean. Median length of follow-up was 7.4 years.
  The hospitalization rate for autoimmune disorders was 69.1 per 100,000 person-years
  for cesarean and 65.9 per 100,000 person-years for vaginal delivery. Cesarean delivery
  was not associated with autoimmune disorders overall (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.96-1.10).
  There was no association with type 1 diabetes (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.85-1.17), celiac
  disease (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.71-1.04), inflammatory bowel disease (HR 1.15, 95% CI
  0.88-1.49), or idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.82-1.25).
  Cesarean delivery was not associated with autoimmune disorders at different ages.Conclusion:
  This study suggests that cesarean delivery is not associated with the risk of hospitalization
  for autoimmune disorders before 14 years of age. Delivery mode does not seem to
  mediate the risk of autoimmunity in childhood. What is Known:   Children born by
  cesarean may be at risk of abnormal immune development.   The association between
  cesarean delivery and risk of pediatric autoimmune disorders is unclear. What is
  New:   In this cohort study of over 900,000 children, cesarean delivery was not
  associated with the risk of hospitalization for a range of autoimmune disorders
  before 14 years of age.   Cesarean delivery may not be related to the development
  of autoimmunity.'
