input_text: 'Clinical characteristics and long-term health in celiac disease patients
  diagnosed in early childhood: Large cohort study. BACKGROUND: Early detection of
  celiac disease could theoretically prevent most of the disease-associated complications,
  but long-term effects of this approach are unclear. AIMS: To investigate features
  at diagnosis and adulthood health in celiac disease patients diagnosed in early
  childhood in 1965-2014. METHODS: Medical data on 978 pediatric patients were collected
  and study questionnaires sent to 559 adult patients who were diagnosed in childhood.
  Results were compared between patients diagnosed in early (<=3.0 years) and later
  (3.1-17.9 years) childhood. RESULTS: Early diagnosed patients (n=131) had more often
  total villous atrophy (37% vs 25%, p=0.001), gastrointestinal presentation (61%
  vs 47%, p<0.001), growth disturbances (70% vs 32%, p=0.001) and severe symptoms
  (30% vs 9%, p<0.001) and were less often screen-detected (10% vs 27%, p<0.001) at
  diagnosis than those diagnosed later (n=847). Among 239 adult responders, early
  diagnosed patients (n=36) had fewer comorbidities (33% vs 53%, p=0.034) but considered
  their health less often good/excellent (69% vs 84%, p=0.029). The groups were comparable
  in current age, dietary adherence, symptoms and health-related quality of life.
  CONCLUSION: Despite more severe initial presentation, the long-term health in early
  diagnosed patients was mostly comparable or even better to those diagnosed later
  in childhood. Poorer self-perceived health suggests a need for support during the
  transition to adulthood care.'
