input_text: 'Urinary nitric oxide metabolites in children with celiac disease after
  long-term consumption of oats-containing gluten-free diet. OBJECTIVE: Oats are accepted
  in the gluten-free diet (GFD) for children with celiac disease (CD). Some reports
  have indicated, however, that not all celiac patients tolerate oats. We have previously
  shown that some children still have high levels of urinary nitric oxide (NO) metabolites
  as markers of intestinal inflammation after 1 year on GFD with oats. In this study,
  we measured urinary NO metabolites in CD children who had been consuming oats-containing
  GFD for an extended, 2-6-year period, also taking into consideration ordinary consumption
  of nitrite/nitrate-rich foods close to the urine sampling. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
  Morning urinary nitrite/nitrate concentrations were measured in 188 pediatric CD
  patients. A questionnaire was used to elucidate factors possibly affecting the urinary
  levels, for example, dietary factors, asthma, or urinary tract infection. RESULTS:
  Oats were consumed by 89.4% of the patients for a median time of 3 years. The median
  nitrite/nitrate level was 980 muM. The majority (70.2%) who consumed oats had low
  levels of urinary nitrite/nitrate, that is, <1400 muM, while 29.8% demonstrated
  high levels, that is, >1400 muM. Nitrite/nitrate-rich foods did not significantly
  influence the urinary concentrations. CONCLUSION: The urinary levels of NO metabolites
  revealed two subpopulations, one with high and one with low levels. The high levels
  could be possibly due to poor adherence to the GFD, sensitivity to oats, or some
  unknown factor(s). Nitrate-rich foods, asthma, or urinary tract infection did not
  affect the result. The elevated levels of NO metabolites could indicate mucosal
  inflammation and pinpoint the need of careful follow-up of children on oats-containing
  GFD.'
