input_text: 'Association Between Celiac Disease and Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Systematic
  Review. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to perform a systematic review assessing
  the research investigating the association between celiac disease (CD) and autism
  spectrum disorder (ASD). METHODS: A literature search of MEDLINE and EMBASE was
  performed without limits placed on year or language. Observational studies reporting
  on the occurrence of CD among patients with ASD and/or the occurrence of ASD among
  patients with CD were included. Study design, characteristics, diagnostic criteria
  for ASD and CD, and the frequency of positive cases in the studied sample were recorded.
  Study quality was assessed using an adapted Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment
  Scale. Due to substantial heterogeneity between studies, a meta-analysis was not
  performed. RESULTS: Of the 298 unique citations identified within our search strategy,
  17 articles evaluating the association between CD and ASD were included. Of those
  articles, 13 observed samples of patients with ASD, and 6 observed samples of patients
  with CD. Overall, most studies had small sample sizes and reported no evidence for
  an association between the 2 conditions. However, a limited number of population-based
  studies of higher quality suggested a potential association between CD and ASD.
  CONCLUSIONS: Most studies assessing an association between CD and ASD are at risk
  for systematic and/or random error. A potential link has, however, been shown in
  a handful of high-quality studies, and, therefore, this comorbidity cannot be ruled
  out. Future studies should recruit larger sample sizes, include precise definitions
  of CD and ASD, and exclude patients with ASD on a gluten-free diet.'
