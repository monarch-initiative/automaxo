input_text: 'Female Patients with Dermatitis Herpetiformis Show a Reduced Diagnostic
  Delay and Have Higher Sensitivity Rates at Autoantibody Testing for Celiac Disease.
  OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to characterize the demographic information, clinical
  features, and laboratory data of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). METHODS:
  In this multicentre cross-sectional study, consecutive patients with a new diagnosis
  of DH that referred to nine different Italian centers between 2011 and 2016 were
  characterized assessing demographic, clinical and laboratory findings, and evaluating
  gender and age differences across selected variables. RESULTS: A total of 151 patients
  were included. Among them, 81 (53.6%) were males and 70 (46.4%) were females, with
  a male to female ratio of 1.2 : 1. The median age at the time of diagnosis was 41
  years (range 0-85). Males had a significant longer diagnostic delay if compared
  to females (9 vs. 3 months, respectively; p = 0.01). Direct immunofluorescence was
  positive in 94.7% of the patients, while duodenal biopsy showed partial to total
  villous atrophy in 70.1% of patients. All the females resulted positive to at least
  one of the antibodies tested, while a total of 12 male patients (10.5%) tested negative
  to celiac-specific antibodies. Female patients had a high rate (14.1%) of autoimmune
  thyroiditis. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed some of the most relevant data regarding
  DH that have been previously reported in the literature. In addition, we found a
  reduced diagnostic delay in females with respect to males, possibly related to the
  higher sensitivity of serologic testing in females with DH compared to males. Finally,
  we demonstrated that intestinal involvement could be severe in patients with DH
  and that females should be tested for thyroiditis.'
