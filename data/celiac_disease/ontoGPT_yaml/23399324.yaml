input_text: '2D ultrasonography and contrast enhanced ultrasound for the evaluation
  of cavitating mesenteric lymph node syndrome in a patient with refractory celiac
  disease and enteropathy T cell lymphoma. BACKGROUND: The cavitating mesenteric lymph
  node syndrome (CMLNS) is a rare manifestation of celiac disease, with an estimated
  mortality rate of 50%. Specific infections and malignant lymphoma may complicate
  its clinical course and contribute to its poor prognosis. Diagnosing the underlying
  cause of CMLNS can be challenging. This is the first report on contrast enhanced
  ultrasound (CEUS) findings in enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL) complicating
  CMLNS in a gluten-free compliant patient with persistent symptoms and poor outcome.
  CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 51-year old Caucasian male patient,
  diagnosed with celiac disease and CMLNS. Despite his compliance to the gluten-free
  diet the symptoms persisted and we eventually considered the possible development
  of malignancy. No mucosal changes suggestive of lymphoma were identified with capsule
  endoscopy. Low attenuation mesenteric lymphadenopathy, without enlarged small bowel
  segments were seen on computed tomography. CEUS revealed arterial rim enhancement
  around the necrotic mesenteric lymph nodes, without venous wash-out. No malignant
  cells were identified on laparoscopic mesenteric lymph nodes biopsies. The patient
  died due to fulminant liver failure 14 months later; the histopathological examination
  revealed CD3/CD30-positive atypical T-cell lymphocytes in the liver, mesenteric
  tissue, spleen, gastric wall, kidney, lung and bone marrow samples; no malignant
  cells were present in the small bowel samples. CONCLUSIONS: CEUS findings in EATL
  complicating CMLNS include arterial rim enhancement of the mesenteric tissue around
  the cavitating lymph nodes, without venous wash-out. This vascular pattern is not
  suggestive for neoangiogenesis, as arteriovenous shunts from malignant tissues are
  responsible for rapid venous wash-out of the contrast agent. CEUS failed to provide
  a diagnosis in this case.'
