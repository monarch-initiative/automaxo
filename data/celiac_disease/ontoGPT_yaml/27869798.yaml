input_text: Gluten-induced symptoms in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome
  are associated with increased myosin light chain kinase activity and claudin-15
  expression. The mechanisms underlying diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome
  (IBS-D) are poorly understood, but increased intestinal permeability is thought
  to contribute to symptoms. A recent clinical trial of gluten-free diet (GFD) demonstrated
  symptomatic improvement, relative to gluten-containing diet (GCD), which was associated
  with reduced intestinal permeability in non-celiac disease IBS-D patients. The aim
  of this study was to characterize intestinal epithelial tight junction composition
  in IBS-D before and after dietary gluten challenge. Biopsies from 27 IBS-D patients
  (13 GFD and 14 GCD) were examined by H&E staining and semiquantitative immunohistochemistry
  for phosphorylated myosin II regulatory light chain (MLC), MLC kinase, claudin-2,
  claudin-8 and claudin-15. Diet-induced changes were assessed and correlated with
  urinary mannitol excretion (after oral administration). In the small intestine,
  epithelial MLC phosphorylation was increased or decreased by GCD or GFD, respectively,
  and this correlated with increased intestinal permeability (P<0.03). Colonocyte
  expression of the paracellular Na+ channel claudin-15 was also markedly augmented
  following GCD challenge (P<0.05). Conversely, colonic claudin-2 expression correlated
  with reduced intestinal permeability (P<0.03). Claudin-8 expression was not affected
  by dietary challenge. These data show that alterations in MLC phosphorylation and
  claudin-15 and claudin-2 expression are associated with gluten-induced symptomatology
  and intestinal permeability changes in IBS-D. The results provide new insight into
  IBS-D mechanisms and can explain permeability responses to gluten challenge in these
  patients.
