input_text: 'Diagnostic dilemmas in celiac disease. Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated
  systemic condition triggered by dietary gluten occurring in genetically susceptible
  individuals. Our understanding of its numerous and varied clinical presentations
  has evolved over time, which has contributed to the incidence of CD increasing.
  In most cases, the diagnosis is readily established and patients promptly improve
  after commencing a gluten-free diet (GFD). However, in some, the diagnosis is not
  straightforward and presents a challenge to clinicians. Potential dilemmas include
  those with positive serology but normal histology, negative serology but abnormal
  duodenal mucosal histology, failure to respond to a GFD or response to a GFD without
  evidence of CD. In recent years, development of new assays and modifications to
  existing diagnostic algorithms for CD has also challenged the traditional role of
  small-bowel histology as critical in CD diagnosis. '
