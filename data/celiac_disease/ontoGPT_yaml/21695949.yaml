input_text: '[Bone mineral density in patients with celiac disease and medical treatment
  of the disorder]. The article presents the results of a bone mineral density study
  in patients with glutensensitive celiac disease. Was discussed problem of malabsorption
  syndrome with clinical and pathogenetic point of view, which can lead to bone loss
  due to malabsorption of calcium and vitamin D for celiac disease. Also was take
  into account the effect of inflammatory cytokines and hormones on calcium regulating
  processes of bone remodeling. The role of adherence to a gluten-free diet in the
  formation of bone loss. The article is illustrated with three tables, one figure
  and two schedules.'
