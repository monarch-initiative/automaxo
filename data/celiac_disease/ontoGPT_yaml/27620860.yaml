input_text: 'Comparison of clinical features, treatment, and outcomes of collagenous
  sprue, celiac disease, and collagenous colitis. BACKGROUND: Collagenous sprue (CS)
  is a rare form of enteropathy that had been reported to be associated with celiac
  disease (CD) and collagenous colitis (CC). The aim of our study was to compare the
  clinical features, treatments, and outcomes of CS, CD, and CC. METHODS: All patients
  with histologic diagnosis of CS, CD, or CC with complete clinical data were extracted
  from our pathology database between 1990 and 2015. Demographic and clinical features
  were recorded along with treatments and outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 21 patients
  with CS were included. Overall CS patients were more symptomatic with 17 (81.0%)
  patients with diarrhea and 15 (71.4%) with unintentional weight loss. Positive celiac
  serology was noted in 5 (23.8%) CS patients. CS patients had higher rates for disease-related
  temporary total parenteral nutrition (TPN) use (38.1% vs. 1.1% vs. 1.0%, P < 0.0001)
  and disease-related hospitalization (52.4% vs. 3.3% vs. 8.2%, P < 0.0001) than that
  in CD and CC patients. Twenty CS patients received treatments, including the combination
  of gluten-free diet (GFD) and corticosteroids (n = 12), GFD only (n = 2), and corticosteroids
  only (n = 6). All CS patients showed symptomatic reliefs with treatment. Although
  CS patients had a higher rate for hospitalization and TPN use, disease-related death
  was not observed in all three groups. CONCLUSIONS: Collagenous sprue patients had
  more severe clinical presentation than patients with CD and CC and therefore had
  higher demand for temporary TPN and hospitalization. Nevertheless, a prompt use
  of steroids and/or GFD upon histologic diagnosis of CS may have contributed to an
  overall excellent prognosis.'
