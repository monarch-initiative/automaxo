input_text: 'The Impact of Autoantibodies on IVF Treatment and Outcome: A Systematic
  Review. The role of autoantibodies in in vitro fertilization (IVF) has been discussed
  for almost three decades. Nonetheless, studies are still scarce and widely controversial.
  The aim of this study is to provide a comprehensive systematic review on the possible
  complications associated to autoantibodies (AA) impeding the chances of a successful
  IVF cycle. An Embase, PubMed/Medline and Cochrane Central Database search was performed
  on 1 December 2018, from 2006 until that date. From the 598 articles yielded in
  the search only 44 relevant articles ultimately fulfilled the inclusion criteria
  and were qualitatively analyzed. Five subsets of results were identified, namely,
  thyroid related AA, anti-phospholipid antibodies, anti-nuclear antibodies, AA affecting
  the reproductive system and AA related to celiac disease. It may be implied that
  the majority of auto-antibodies exert a statistically significant effect on miscarriage
  rates, whereas the effects on clinical pregnancy and live birth rates differ according
  to the type of auto-antibodies. While significant research is performed in the field,
  the quality of evidence provided is still low. The conduction of well-designed prospective
  cohort studies is an absolute necessity in order to define the impact of the different
  types of autoantibodies on IVF outcome.'
