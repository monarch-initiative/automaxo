input_text: 'Negative predictive value of the repeated absence of gluten immunogenic
  peptides in the urine of treated celiac patients in predicting mucosal healing:
  new proposals for follow-up in celiac disease. BACKGROUND: The treatment of celiac
  disease (CD) is a lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD). The current methods for monitoring
  GFD conformance, such as a dietary questionnaire or serology tests, may be inaccurate
  in detecting dietary transgressions, and duodenal biopsies are invasive, expensive,
  and not a routine monitoring technique. OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to determine the
  clinical usefulness of urine gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) as a biomarker monitoring
  GFD adherence in celiac patients and to evaluate the concordance of the results
  with the degree of mucosal damage. METHODS: A prospective observational study was
  conducted involving 22 de novo CD patients, 77 celiac patients consuming a GFD,
  and 13 nonceliac subjects. On 3 d of the week, urine samples were collected and
  the GIP concentrations were tested. Simultaneously, anti-tissue transglutaminase
  antibodies, questionnaire results, clinical manifestations, and histological findings
  were analyzed. RESULTS: Approximately 24% (18 of 76) of the celiac patients consuming
  a GFD exhibited Marsh II-III mucosal damage. Among this population, 94% (17 of 18)
  had detectable urine GIP; however, between 60% and 80% were asymptomatic and exhibited
  negative serology and appropriate GFD adherence based on the questionnaire. In contrast,
  97% (31 of 32) of the celiac patients without duodenal damage had no detectable
  GIP. These results demonstrated the high sensitivity (94%) and negative predictive
  value (97%) of GIP measurements in relation to duodenal biopsy findings. In the
  de novo CD-diagnosed cohort, 82% (18 of 22) of patients had measurable amounts of
  GIP in the urine. CONCLUSIONS: Determining GIP concentrations in several urine samples
  may be an especially convenient approach to assess recent gluten exposure in celiac
  patients and appears to accurately predict the absence of histological lesions.
  The introduction of GIP testing as an assessment technique for GFD adherence may
  help in ascertaining dietary compliance and to target the most suitable intervention
  during follow-up.'
