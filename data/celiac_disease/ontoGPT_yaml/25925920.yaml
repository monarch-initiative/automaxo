input_text: 'Celiac disease and the gluten-free diet: consequences and recommendations
  for improvement. BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic small intestinal immune-mediated
  enteropathy precipitated by exposure to dietary gluten in genetically susceptible
  individuals. CD-related enteropathy leads to multiple nutritional deficiencies involving
  macro- and micronutrients. Currently, medical nutrition therapy consisting of the
  gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only accepted treatment for CD. KEY MESSAGES: The
  GFD is the cornerstone of treatment for CD. Prior published studies have concluded
  that maintenance of the GFD results in improvement of the majority of nutritional
  deficiencies. In the past, counseling for CD focused mainly on the elimination of
  gluten in the diet. However, the GFD is not without its inadequacies; compliance
  to the GFD may result in certain deficiencies such as fiber, B vitamins, iron, and
  trace minerals. Paucity of fortified gluten-free foods may be responsible for certain
  deficiencies which develop on the GFD. Weight gain and obesity have been added to
  the list of nutritional consequences while on the GFD and have been partially attributed
  to hypercaloric content of commercially available gluten-free foods. Follow-up of
  patients diagnosed with CD after starting the GFD has been reported to be irregular
  and, hence, less than ideal. CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring of the nutritional status using
  blood tests and use of appropriate gluten-free supplementation are integral components
  in the management of CD. The ideal GFD should be nutrient-dense with naturally gluten-free
  foods, balanced with macro- and micronutrients, reasonably priced, and easily accessible.
  Rotation of the pseudo-cereals provides a good source of complex carbohydrates,
  protein, fiber, fatty acids, vitamins and minerals. Fortification/enrichment of
  commonly consumed gluten-free commercial grain products should be encouraged. Dietitians
  specializing in CD play a critical role in the education and maintenance of the
  GFD for patients with CD.'
