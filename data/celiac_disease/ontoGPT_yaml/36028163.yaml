input_text: 'The Exploration of the Eating Experience in Adults with Celiac Disease:
  A Phenomenological Qualitative Study. BACKGROUND: The adjustment to a strict gluten-free
  diet for adults diagnosed with celiac disease (CD) may lead to changes in the eating
  experience affecting the physical, social, and emotional states. OBJECTIVE: Through
  the application of the Social Cognitive Transition Model of Adjustment, the aim
  of the study was to explore the adjustment in the eating experience in adults recently
  diagnosed with CD and transitioning to a gluten-free diet. DESIGN: This was a qualitative
  phenomenological study conducted using semistructured interviews. PARTICIPANTS AND
  SETTING: Seventeen adults from the midwestern United States who were diagnosed with
  CD between 6 months and 5 years before the study were recruited using social media
  CD sites and snowball sampling. Participants completed a semistructured interview
  on Zoom and the Celiac Disease Adherence Test and CeliacQ-7 questionnaires from
  May to November 2020. STATISTICA ANALYSES PERFORMED: Two trained qualitative researchers
  engaged in four steps to reduce and contextualize the data: horizontilization, reduction
  and elimination, clustering and thematizing, and composition of textural description.
  During analysis, the Social Cognitive Transition Model of Adjustment was incorporated
  for organization of themes and text description. RESULTS: There was moderate to
  high dietary adherence in 14 of 17 participants and quality of life scores ranged
  from 19 to 43 (median = 33). Five themes emerged aligning with Social Cognitive
  Transition Model of Adjustment, describing the adjustment in pre- and postdiagnosis
  eating experience and the coping and behaviors enacted during adjustment to a gluten-free
  diet. CONCLUSIONS: In individuals with CD, moving beyond problem solving and identifying
  psychosocial and emotional attributes in the adoption of a gluten-free diet need
  to be considered to promote maintenance of quality of life and dietary adherence.'
