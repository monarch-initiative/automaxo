input_text: How I treat enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma. Enteropathy-associated
  T-cell lymphoma (EATL) is a complication of celiac disease (CD). This tumor derives
  from the neoplastic transformation of aberrant intraepithelial T lymphocytes emerging
  in celiac patients unresponsive to a gluten-free diet. Poor adherence to a gluten-free
  diet, HLA-DQ2 homozygosity, and late diagnosis of CD are recognized as risk factors
  for malignant evolution of CD. Recurrence of diarrhea, unexplained weight loss,
  abdominal pain, fever, and night sweating should alert physicians to this complication.
  The suspicion of EATL should lead to an extensive diagnostic workup in which magnetic
  resonance enteroclysis, positron emission tomography scan, and histologic identification
  of lesions represent the best options. Treatment includes high-dose chemotherapy
  preceded by surgical resection and followed by autologous stem cell transplantation,
  although biologic therapies seem to be promising. Strict adherence to a gluten-free
  diet remains the only way to prevent EATL.
