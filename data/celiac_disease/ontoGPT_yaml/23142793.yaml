input_text: 'Neo-epitope tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies as a biomarker of
  the gluten sensitive skin disease--dermatitis herpetiformis. BACKGROUND: The deamidated
  gliadin peptides (DGP) cross linked to human tissue transglutaminase (tTg) comprises
  a novel neo-epitope structure (Neo-tTg) for serological screening of celiac disease
  (CD). Our aim is to verify anti-Neo-tTg IgA and IgG in adults with dermatitis herpetiformis
  (DH). METHODS: Multi-centric retrospective evaluation of the IgA/G autoantibodies
  in sera of DH patients on a regular diet (n=40) and a gluten restricted diet (GRD,
  n=53) and control adults with autoimmune skin diseases (n=107) by ELISA. RESULTS:
  The sensitivities of Celicheck Neo IgA/G (76%, 95% CI 67-84%) and the Neo tTg-A
  (85%, 95% CI 70-97%) ELISA were significantly greater than that of tTg-A (56%, 95%
  CI 46-67%), eTg-A (62%, 95% CI 52-72%), DGP-A (55%, 95% CI 55-65%), DGP-G (61%,
  95% CI 51-71%), Glia-A (55%, 95% CI 45-65%) and Glia-G (56%, 95% CI 46-66%) ELISA.
  The specificities of all 8 ELISA were in the range of 90-100%. The area under the
  curve (AUC) of receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) for the two Neo-tTg
  ELISA (0.863 and 0.949) were higher than the AUCs for ROCs of tTg, DGP and eTG ELISA
  (range between 0.657 and 0.783). The autoantibody levels of DH patients on a normal
  diet were significantly higher than those on GRD in the Celicheck Neo IgA/IgG, NeotTg-A;
  tTg-A and the eTg-A; ELISA (p<0.01) and of no significance in the DGP and Gliadin
  ELISA. CONCLUSION: Neo-epitope IgA autoantibodies represent a new and sensitive
  serological marker of DH.'
