input_text: 'Cross-sectional imaging: current status and future potential in adult
  celiac disease. Celiac disease (CD), triggered by exposure to gluten in genetically
  susceptible individuals, is an immune-mediated small bowel disease affecting about
  1% of the population worldwide. But the prevalence of CD varies with age, sex, and
  location. A strict gluten-free diet remains the primary treatment for CD, currently.
  Most of patients with CD respond well to gluten-free diet with good prognosis, while
  some patients fail to get symptomatic relief or histological remission (e.g., nonresponsive
  or refractory CD). Because of heterogeneous clinical appearance, the diagnosis of
  CD is difficult. Moreover, malignant complications and poor outcomes accompanied
  with refractory CD present great challenges in disease management. Over the past
  three decades, cross-sectional imaging techniques (computed tomography [CT] and
  magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) play an important role in small bowel inflammatory
  and neoplastic diseases. Compared with endoscopic techniques, cross-sectional imaging
  permits clearly presentation of both intraluminal and extraluminal abnormalities.
  It provides vascular and functional information, thus improving the possibility
  as diagnostic and follow-up tool. The value of cross-sectional imaging for patients
  with suspected or confirmed CD has been gradually demonstrated. Studies revealed
  that certain features suggested by cross-sectional imaging could help to establish
  the early diagnosis of CD. Besides, the potential contributions of cross-sectional
  imaging may lie in the evaluation of disease activity and severity, which helps
  guiding management strategies. The purpose of this review is to provide current
  overviews and future directions of cross-sectional imaging in adult CD, thus facilitating
  the understanding and application in clinical practice. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT:
  In this review, we systematically summarized the existing knowledge of cross-sectional
  imaging in adult CD and analyzed their possible roles in clinical practice, including
  disease diagnosis, complication identification, treatment evaluation, and prognostic
  prediction. KEY POINTS:   Regarding a condition described as "celiac iceberg", celiac
  disease remains underdiagnosed and undertreated.   Cross-sectional imaging is helpful
  in clinical management of celiac disease, including disease diagnosis, complication
  identification, treatment evaluation, and prognostic prediction.   Cross-sectional
  imaging should be considered as the valuable examination in patients suspected from
  celiac disease.'
