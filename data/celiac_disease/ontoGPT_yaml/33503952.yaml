input_text: 'Rationale for Timing of Follow-Up Visits to Assess Gluten-Free Diet in
  Celiac Disease Patients Based on Data Mining. The assessment of compliance of gluten-free
  diet (GFD) is a keystone in the supervision of celiac disease (CD) patients. Few
  data are available documenting evidence-based follow-up frequency for CD patients.
  In this work we aim at creating a criterion for timing of clinical follow-up for
  CD patients using data mining. We have applied data mining to a dataset with 188
  CD patients on GFD (75% of them are children below 14 years old), evaluating the
  presence of gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) in stools as an adherence to diet
  marker. The variables considered are gender, age, years following GFD and adherence
  to the GFD by fecal GIP. The results identify patients on GFD for more than two
  years (41.5% of the patients) as more prone to poor compliance and so needing more
  frequent follow-up than patients with less than 2 years on GFD. This is against
  the usual clinical practice of following less patients on long term GFD, as they
  are supposed to perform better. Our results support different timing follow-up frequency
  taking into consideration the number of years on GFD, age and gender. Patients on
  long term GFD should have a more frequent monitoring as they show a higher level
  of gluten exposure. A gender perspective should also be considered as non-compliance
  is partially linked to gender in our results: Males tend to get more gluten exposure,
  at least in the cultural context where our study was carried out. Children tend
  to perform better than teenagers or adults.'
