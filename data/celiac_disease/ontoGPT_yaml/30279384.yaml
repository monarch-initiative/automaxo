input_text: 'A Review on the Gluten-Free Diet: Technological and Nutritional Challenges.
  Consumers, food manufacturers and health professionals are uniquely influenced by
  the growing popularity of the gluten-free diet. Consumer expectations have urged
  the food industry to continuously adjust and improve the formulations and processing
  techniques used in gluten-free product manufacturing. Health experts have been interested
  in the nutritional adequacy of the diet, as well as its effectiveness in managing
  gluten-related disorders and other conditions. In this review, we aim to provide
  a clear picture of the current motivations behind the use of gluten-free diets,
  as well as the technological and nutritional challenges of the diet as a whole.
  Alternative starches and flours, hydrocolloids, and fiber sources were found to
  play a complex role in mimicking the functional and sensory effects of gluten in
  gluten-free products. However, the quality of gluten-free alternatives is often
  still inferior to the gluten-containing products. Furthermore, the gluten-free diet
  has demonstrated benefits in managing some gluten-related disorders, though nutritional
  imbalances have been reported. As there is limited evidence supporting the use of
  the gluten-free diet beyond its role in managing gluten-related disorders, consumers
  are urged to be mindful of the sensorial limitations and nutritional inadequacies
  of the diet despite ongoing strategies to improve them.'
