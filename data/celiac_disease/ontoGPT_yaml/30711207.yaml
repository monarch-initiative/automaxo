input_text: Nondietary Therapies for Celiac Disease. Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune
  enteropathy triggered by gluten. Gluten-free diets can be challenging because of
  their restrictive nature, inadvertent cross-contaminations, and the high cost of
  gluten-free food. Novel nondietary therapies are at the preclinical stage, clinical
  trial phase, or have already been developed for other indications and are now being
  applied to CD. These therapies include enzymatic gluten degradation, binding and
  sequestration of gluten, restoration of epithelial tight junction barrier function,
  inhibition of tissue transglutaminase-mediated potentiation of gliadin oligopeptide
  immunogenicity or of human leukocyte antigen-mediated gliadin presentation, induction
  of tolerance to gluten, and antiinflammatory interventions.
