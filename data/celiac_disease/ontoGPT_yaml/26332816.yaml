input_text: '[Is it time for mass screening for celiac disease?]. Celiac disease is
  a common condition with a variable presentation, and is frequently not recognized
  by the physician. Although a gluten-free diet has a positive effect on the health
  of the celiac patient, prevention would be even more beneficial. In this article
  we outline the different possibilities for primary and secondary prevention of celiac
  disease. Results of recent prospective studies show that at this moment primary
  prevention is not possible, but secondary preventive strategies can be applied to
  decrease the morbidity associated with this disease; mass screening is one option.
  Results of recent studies concerning this topic will be discussed. '
