input_text: Evaluation of Daily Lives of Children and Adolescents with Celiac Disease
  and Nursing Approaches. The incidence of celiac disease has been increasing in recent
  years. Celiac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy that emerges mostly in the childhood
  period. This disorder is a chronic condition of the small intestine due to gluten
  intake in individuals with genetic predisposition. In the treatment of celiac disease,
  gluten-free diet therapy is applied. However, the adaptation process to the diet
  may create difficulties for patients. Compliance with diet is much more difficult
  among patients with celiac disease in childhood and adolescence than in adult patients.
  Children and adolescents face distinct difficulties in their homes, at school, and
  in their social lives. Besides following dietary treatment, children and adolescents
  living with celiac disease need peer support to manage their daily routines. In
  this article, we aimed to discuss the problems experienced by children and adolescents
  living with celiac disease and nursing approaches to these problems.
