input_text: 'Lower Prevalence of Celiac Disease and Gluten-Related Disorders in Persons
  Living in Southern vs Northern Latitudes of the United States. BACKGROUND & AIMS:
  The association between prevalence of celiac disease and geographic region is incompletely
  understood, but the occurrence of several autoimmune disorders has been found to
  vary along a North-South gradient. We examined geographic, demographic, and clinical
  factors associated with prevalence of celiac disease and gluten-free diet in the
  United States. METHODS: In a population-based study, we analyzed data on gluten-related
  conditions from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, from 2009
  through 2014, on 22,277 participants 6 years and older. We identified persons with
  celiac disease based on results of serum tests for IgA against tissue transglutaminase
  and endomysium or on both a health care provider diagnosis and adherence to a gluten-free
  diet. Gluten avoidance without celiac disease was defined as adherence to a gluten-free
  diet without a diagnosis of celiac disease. We compared mean serum levels of biochemical
  and nutritional markers based on status of gluten-related conditions. RESULTS: We
  found 0.7% of participants to have celiac disease and 1.1% of participants to avoid
  gluten without celiac disease. Celiac disease was more common among individuals
  who lived at latitudes of 35 -39  North (odds ratio, 3.2; 95% confidence interval,
  1.4-7.1) or at latitudes of 40  North or more (odds ratio, 5.4; 95% CI, 2.6-11.3)
  than individuals who lived at latitudes below 35  North, independent of race or
  ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and body mass index. Gluten avoidance without celiac
  disease was more common among individuals who lived at latitudes of 40  North or
  more, independent of demographic factors and body mass index. Participants with
  undiagnosed celiac disease (identified by positive results from serologic tests)
  had lower mean levels of vitamin B-12 and folate (data collected from 2009 through
  2012) than persons without celiac disease. Participants with a health care provider
  diagnosis of celiac disease had a lower mean level of hemoglobin than persons without
  celiac disease. Mean levels of albumin, calcium, iron, ferritin, cholesterol, vitamin
  B-6, and vitamin D (data collected from 2009 through 2010) did not differ between
  participants with gluten-related conditions and those without. CONCLUSIONS: In the
  US population, a higher proportion of persons living at latitudes of 35  North or
  greater have celiac disease or avoid gluten than persons living south of this latitude,
  independent of race or ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or body mass index. Mean
  levels of vitamin B-12 and folate are lower in individuals with undiagnosed celiac
  disease, and levels of hemoglobin are lower in participants with a diagnosis of
  celiac disease, compared with individuals without celiac disease.'
