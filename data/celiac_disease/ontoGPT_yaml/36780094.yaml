input_text: 'Patterns of practice in the diagnosis, dietary counselling and follow-up
  of patients with celiac disease- A patient-based survey. BACKGROUND: The pattern
  of practice regarding the diagnosis, dietary counselling and follow-up of patients
  with celiac disease (CeD) varies between practice to practice. METHODS: A web-based
  questionnaire based on review of literature, group discussions and expert group
  meetings was developed to understand the practice of CeD in India. The questionnaire
  was administered through social media (WhatsApp) to 18 Indian celiac support groups
  comprising 2980 patients with CeD. RESULTS: Overall, 970 (32.5%) patients responded
  to the questionnaire (median age: 21 years; females 63.9%). While 679 (71.1%) patients
  were diagnosed based on a combination of serology and biopsy, 214 (22.4%) were diagnosed
  based on serology alone. After diagnosis, 875 (91%) patients were counselled initially
  by physician and only 585 (61%) were referred to a dietician for dietary counselling.
  In a majority of cases, the time spent by doctors and dietitians during first counselling
  was between 10 and 20 minutes only. After first counselling, 191 (20%) and 355 (37.3%)
  patients did not re-visit the physician and the dietitian, respectively. Among those
  who followed up, structured follow-up was conducted in only 515 (53.8%) patients.
  Overall, 232 (24.3%) patients were self-monitoring their serological parameters,
  while 495 (51.8%) patients did not receive a formal assessment of dietary adherence
  during follow-up. CONCLUSION: The practice of diagnosis, dietary counselling and
  follow-up of patients with CeD in India is not as per standard guidelines. Most
  of the patients are not referred to a dietitian. There is a need for reinforcement
  of guidelines for proper care and management of patients with CeD.'
