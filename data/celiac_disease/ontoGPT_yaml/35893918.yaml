input_text: 'Dietary Acid Load in Gluten-Free Diets: Results from a Cross-Sectional
  Study. The gluten-free diet (GFD) ensures improvement of clinical symptoms in the
  vast majority of celiac disease (CD) patients. Despite stable CD rates in many countries,
  an increasing number of healthy individuals are adopting gluten-free diets, believing
  that this diet is an inherently healthier choice. The health effects of gluten-free
  diets are controversial, and a recent study added to the debate by reporting a lower
  acidogenic potential of this diet. The effects of the GFD on potential renal acid
  load (PRAL) and net endogenous acid production (NEAP)-two important markers of dietary
  acid load (DAL)-are poorly understood, and have never been examined in a Western
  population. Using cross-sectional data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
  Surveys, we estimated DAL in U.S. individuals reporting a GFD and contrasted the
  results to the general U.S. population consuming gluten and denying special diets.
  The GFD was associated with significantly lower crude DAL scores, and after adjustments
  for confounders in multivariate regression, the results remain significant. Yet,
  our study could not confirm the reported alkalizing properties of the GFD. Although
  overall DAL scores were significantly lower in the GFD group, they were comparable
  to Western diets producing 50-75 mEq of acid per day.'
