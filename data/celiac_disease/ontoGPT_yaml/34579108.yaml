input_text: 'Quality of Life and Psychological Disorders in Coeliac Disease: A Prospective
  Multicentre Study. Coeliac disease (CeD) has been associated with psychological
  disorders and reduced quality of life. Our prospective study evaluated the changes
  in the quality of life, anxiety and depression in CeD patients up to two years after
  diagnosis. We recruited adult patients residing in the Veneto region with a new
  diagnosis of CeD. Several validated questionnaires were administered to measure
  quality of life, psychological symptoms and adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD)
  at the time of diagnosis and after 1 and 2 years. Ninety-three patients reached
  the 1-year follow-up (81.7% were females with a median age at diagnosis of 35 years),
  and 55 patients reached the 2-year follow-up. We observed a significant improvement
  in quality of life, anxiety and depression scores at 1 year after diagnosis, particularly
  in patients who complied with a GFD. The improvements among classical CeD patients
  were similar to those observed in nonclassical patients except for anxiety, which
  improved only in patients with a classical presentation at diagnosis. Age, sex and
  other disease factors did not affect the change in quality of life (QoL) or other
  mood disorders. Most of the improvements measured 1 year after diagnosis and 2 years
  after diagnosis were not significant. In conclusion, QoL and mood disorders must
  be considered, and psychological counselling should be used when needed.'
