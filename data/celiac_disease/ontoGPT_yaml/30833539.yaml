input_text: Severe Coagulopathy as a Rare Feature of Celiac Crisis in a Patient Previously
  Diagnosed with Celiac Disease. BACKGROUND Celiac crisis is an uncommon but critical
  complication of celiac disease (CD) manifesting with copious diarrhea, dehydration,
  and severe metabolic imbalances. Celiac crisis occurring in individuals who have
  been formerly diagnosed with CD and displaying severe coagulopathy is tremendously
  rare. CASE REPORT We report a case of a 76-year-old male, previously diagnosed with
  CD and non-compliant with gluten free diet, who presented with severe coagulopathy
  manifesting as gastrointestinal bleeding in addition to other features of celiac
  crisis, including severe diarrhea, dehydration, metabolic acidosis, electrolyte
  disturbances, and renal dysfunction. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed flattened
  mucosa and mucosal nodularity in the duodenum. Duodenal biopsies exhibited active
  chronic inflammation with intraepithelial lymphocytosis and subtotal villous blunting.
  The patient was diagnosed with celiac crisis and treatment with vitamin K, parenteral
  nutrition, and steroids was commenced. After initial clinical improvement, a gluten-free
  diet was implemented with complete resolution of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Though celiac
  crisis typically presents in patients with undiagnosed CD, it should be considered
  in patients who have been previously diagnosed CD but who are non-compliant with
  gluten free diet. Severe coagulopathy, though extremely rare, can be a feature of
  celiac crisis and should be consider when encountered in a patient with history
  of steatorrhea and gastrointestinal bleeding.
