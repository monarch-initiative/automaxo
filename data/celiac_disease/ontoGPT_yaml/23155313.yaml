input_text: 'Intramuscular vs intradermal route for hepatitis B booster vaccine in
  celiac children. AIM: To compare intradermal (ID) and intramuscular (IM) booster
  doses, which have been used in healthy and high risk subjects, such as healthcare
  workers, haemodialysis patients, human immunodeficiency virus patients, and renal
  transplant recipients unresponsive to initial hepatitis B vaccination, in celiac
  individuals. METHODS: We conducted our study on 58 celiac patients, vaccinated in
  the first year of life, whose blood analysis had showed the absence of protective
  hepatitis B virus (HBV) antibodies. All patients had received the last vaccine injection
  at least one year before study enrolment and they had been on a gluten free diet
  for at least 1 year. In all patients we randomly performed an HBV vaccine booster
  dose by ID or IM route. Thirty celiac patients were revaccinated with recombinant
  hepatitis B vaccine (Engerix B) 2 mug by the ID route, while 28 celiac patients
  were revaccinated with Engerix B 10 mug by the IM route. Four weeks after every
  booster dose, the anti-hepatitis B surface (HBs) antibody titer was measured by
  an enzyme-linked immune-adsorbent assay. We performed a maximum of three booster
  doses in patients with no anti-HBs antibodies after the first or the second vaccine
  dose. The cut off value for a negative anti-HBs antibody titer was 10 IU/L. Patients
  with values between 10 and 100 IU/L were considered "low responders" while patients
  with an antibody titer higher than 1000 IU/L were considered "high responders".
  RESULTS: No significant difference in age, gender, duration of illness, and years
  of gluten intake was found between the two groups. We found a high percentage of
  "responders" after the first booster dose (ID = 76.7%, IM = 78.6%) and a greater
  increase after the third dose (ID = 90%, IM = 96.4%) of vaccine in both groups.
  Moreover we found a significantly higher number of high responders (with an anti-HBs
  antibody titer > 1000 IU/L) in the ID (40%) than in the IM (7.1%) group, and this
  difference was evident after the first booster dose of vaccination (P < 0.01). No
  side effects were recorded in performing delivery of the vaccine by either the ID
  or IM route. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that both ID and IM routes are effective
  and safe options to administer a booster dose of HBV vaccine in celiac patients.
  However the ID route seems to achieve a greater number of high responders and to
  have a better cost/benefit ratio.'
