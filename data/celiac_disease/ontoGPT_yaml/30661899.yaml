input_text: 'Liver Transplantation for Fulminant Hepatic Failure Due to Heat Stroke:
  A Case Report. Heat stroke is a condition caused by an excessive increase in body
  temperature in a relatively short period of time, and is clinically characterized
  by central nervous system dysfunction, including delirium, seizures, coma, and severe
  hyperthermia. In this context, the resulting fulminant hepatic failure makes liver
  transplant the best choice when there are no guarantees of better results with conservative
  treatment. We present our experience in this case, possible alternative choices,
  and the current role of liver transplantation in the resolution of fulminant liver
  failure due to heat stroke. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 32-year-old man
  with a history of malabsorption syndrome and unconfirmed celiac disease controlled
  with a gluten-free diet, who, while working on a typical summer midday in southern
  Spain (approximately 40 C), abruptly presented with loss of consciousness, coma,
  and a temperature of 42 C, as well as seizures at the initial medical assessment
  that subsided after the administration of diazepam. On the third day, the patient
  presented with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, requiring mechanical ventilation,
  hemodialysis, and inotropic support. He did not improve with the support of conservative
  treatment, therefore it was decided to perform an urgent liver transplant, after
  which he recovered completely. CONCLUSIONS: Liver transplantation should be a main
  choice of treatment for cases in which, despite intensive medical treatment, there
  is still clinical and analytical evidence of massive and/or irreversible hepatocellular
  damage.'
