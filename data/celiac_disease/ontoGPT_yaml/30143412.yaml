input_text: 'Are the dietary habits of treated individuals with celiac disease adherent
  to a Mediterranean diet? BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The only treatment for celiac disease
  (CD) is strict, lifelong adherence to a gluten-free (GF) diet. To date, there are
  contrasting data concerning the nutritional adequacy of GF products and diet. There
  have been no studies that have assessed the adherence of individuals with CD to
  a Mediterranean diet (MD), a protective dietary regimen against major non-communicable
  diseases (NCDs). Therefore, we examined the adherence to an MD of a group of Italian
  individuals with CD and compared it with that of a healthy control group. METHODS
  AND RESULTS: In a cross-sectional study, a sample of individuals with CD and a group
  of healthy subjects were included. The dietary habits of all participants were recorded
  using a validated food frequency questionnaire, and the adherence to an MD was determined
  using the Italian Mediterranean Index. Typical Mediterranean food consumption was
  not significantly different between individuals with CD and the healthy participants,
  except for fruits (P = 0.017). However, individuals with CD consumed significantly
  higher amounts of potatoes (P = 0.003) and red and processed meat (P = 0.005) than
  healthy participants. The resulting mean Italian Mediterranean Index was significantly
  higher in healthy participants than in individuals with CD (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION:
  The results raise questions concerning the food choices of individuals with CD,
  suggesting the need of encouraging them to make better food choices more in line
  with an MD, which would improve their nutritional status and better protect them
  from NCDs at long term. PROTOCOL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov (ID NCT01975155)
