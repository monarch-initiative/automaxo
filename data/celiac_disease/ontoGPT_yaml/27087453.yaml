input_text: "A Refractory Celiac Patient Successfully Treated With Mesenchymal Stem
  Cell Infusions. Type II refractory celiac disease (RCD), as defined according to
  the amount of aberrant intraepithelial lymphocytes, is a condition characterized
  by severe malabsorption syndrome and poor prognosis, with no effective treatment.
  Based on the regenerative and immunomodulatory properties of mesenchymal stem cells
  (MSCs), we investigated the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of serial infusions
  of autologous bone marrow-derived MSCs in a 51-year-old woman with type II RCD.
  Mesenchymal stem cells were isolated, expanded, and characterized following standard
  protocols. Monitoring of the patient's malabsorption indexes, mucosal architecture,
  and percentage of aberrant intraepithelial lymphocytes was scheduled for the time
  of enrollment, at each infusion, and after 6 months. Determination of mucosal expression
  of interleukin (IL)-15 and its receptor was also performed. Expansion of MSCs was
  feasible, and the patient underwent 4 systemic infusions of 2 x 10(6) MSCs/kg body
  weight 4 months apart, without adverse effects. During the treatment period, she
  experienced gradual and durable amelioration of her general condition, with normalization
  of stool frequency, body mass index, laboratory test results, and mucosal architecture.
  Remarkably, the expression of IL-15 and its receptor almost completely disappeared.
  Thus, treatment of RCD with serial MSC infusions seems promising, leading to recovery
  from the life-threatening condition while blocking the IL-15 pathogenic pathway. "
