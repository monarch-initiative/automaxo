input_text: "Concise Review: Cellular Therapies: The Potential to Regenerate and Restore
  Tolerance in Immune-Mediated Intestinal Diseases. Chronic inflammatory enteropathies,
  including celiac disease, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis, are lifelong
  disabling conditions whose cure is still an unmet need, despite the great strides
  made in understanding their complex pathogenesis. The advent of cellular therapies,
  mainly based on the use of stem cells, represents a great step forward thanks to
  their multitarget strategy. Both hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and mesenchymal
  stem/stromal cells (MSC) have been employed in the treatment of refractory cases
  with promising results. The lack of immunogenicity makes MSC more suitable for therapeutic
  purposes as their infusion may be performed across histocompatibility locus antigen
  barriers without risk of rejection. The best outcome has been obtained when treating
  fistulizing Crohn's disease with local injections of MSC. In addition, both HSC
  and MSC proved successful in promoting regeneration of intestinal mucosa, and favoring
  the expansion of a T-cell regulatory subset. By virtue of the ability to favor mucosal
  homeostasis, this last cell population has been exploited in clinical trials, with
  inconsistent results. Finally, the recent identification of the epithelial stem
  cell marker has opened up the possibility of tissue engineering, with an array of
  potential applications for intestinal diseases. However, the underlying mechanisms
  of action of these interconnected therapeutic strategies are still poorly understood.
  It is conceivable that over the next few years their role will become clearer as
  the biological interactions with injured tissues and the hierarchy by which they
  deliver their action are unraveled through a continuous moving from bench to bedside
  and vice versa. Stem Cells 2016;34:1474-1486."
