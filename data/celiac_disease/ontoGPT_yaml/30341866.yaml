input_text: "Prevalence of Chronic Liver Disease Among the Patients of Celiac Disease
  and Effect of Gluten-Free Diet on Outcome of Liver Disease: A Prospective Study.
  Objectives: Descriptive reports of liver involvement in celiac disease (CD) are
  sparse, and the effect of a strict gluten-free diet (GFD) on the course of liver
  injury is also poorly understood. We conducted a study on 94 adult patients with
  CD and found that 39 of them were having chronic liver disease as well. We further
  followed patients of 'CD with CLD' with strict Gluten-free diet (GFD) for six months.
  Methods: We screened 94 patients of CD for CLD and found 39 patients to have CLD
  as well. We further followed these 39 patients of 'CD with CLD' for six month with
  strict gluten-free diet. Follow up was done in terms of Child Pugh score. We recorded
  their clinical as well as laboratory findings after 1 month, 3 months and 6 months
  and compared them with those at the time of recruitment. Results: The liver involvement
  was found in 39(41.5%) out of 94 patients celiac disease. Mean Child-Pugh score
  on admission was 10.22+-1.09 and on first follow-up mean Child-Pugh score was 7.38+-1.47
  was found to be statistically highly significant (p <0.001) Mean Child-Pugh score
  on admission was 10.15+-1.09 and on second follow-up 7.33+-1.33 respectively and
  was statistically highly significant (p <0.001) Mean Child-Pugh score on admission
  was 10.12+-1.09 and on third follow-up mean Child-Pugh score was 6.31+-0.93 respectively
  was statistically highly significant (p <0.001)."
