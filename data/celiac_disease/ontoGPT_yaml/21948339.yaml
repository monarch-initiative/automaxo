input_text: 'Safety, tolerability, and activity of ALV003: results from two phase
  1 single, escalating-dose clinical trials. BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is the most
  common hereditary autoimmune disease in humans. The only treatment option for non-refractory
  celiac disease patients is adherence to a strict life-long gluten-free diet, which
  often fails to normalize small bowel histology. ALV003 is a mixture of two proteases
  that degrades gluten and is in clinical development as an oral therapy for patients
  with celiac disease. AIMS: The safety, tolerability, and activity of ALV003 were
  assessed in two phase 1 clinical trials. METHODS: In study 1 (N = 28) the study
  drug was administered in the fasted state; in study 2 (N = 53) the study drug was
  administered together with a gluten-containing meal. Both studies were single-dose,
  single-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trials. ALV003 was dosed at escalating
  dose levels by cohort (100, 300, 900, and 1,800 mg) and gastric samples were aspirated
  using a nasogastric tube. Adverse events, serum drug levels, and anti-drug antibody
  titers were measured. Gastric samples were assessed for ALV003 enzymatic activity
  over time (gastric pharmacokinetics) and gluten degradation (gastric pharmacodynamics).
  RESULTS: All doses were well tolerated, and no serious adverse events or allergic
  reactions were observed. Gastric aspirates collected 30 min following a meal showed
  that 100 and 300 mg ALV003 degraded 75 +- 10% (N = 8) and 88 +- 5% (N = 8), respectively,
  of one gram of wheat bread gluten. CONCLUSIONS: ALV003 is an orally active protease
  that appears to be stable in the fed stomach and degrades dietary gluten in this
  compartment. Single doses of oral ALV003 were not associated with serious adverse
  reactions.'
