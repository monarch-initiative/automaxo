input_text: "Device-assisted enteroscopy: An update on techniques, clinical indications
  and safety. After more than 15 years since its introduction into clinical practice,
  indications for device-assisted enteroscopy have greatly expanded. Alongside the
  consolidated indications such as the diagnosis and treatment of small bowel bleeding,
  Crohn's disease, hereditary polyposis, small-bowel tumors and complicated celiac
  disease, device-assisted enteroscopy is nowadays largely used to perform endoscopic
  retrograde cholangiopancreatography in patients with altered anatomy, stent placement,
  retrieval of foreign bodies, direct insertion of jejunal feeding tubes, and in selected
  cases of incomplete colonoscopy. This has been made possible by the technical improvements
  of the enteroscopes and accessories and by the widespread use of the method. Device-assisted
  enteroscopy endotherapy currently offers a safe and effective alternative to major
  surgery and often represents the preferred option for treatment of small-bowel pathology.
  Its safety profile is favourable even in the elderly patient, provided that it is
  performed in high-volume and experienced centers. The evolution of the enteroscopy
  technique is a challenge for the future and could be facilitated by the new enteroscopes
  models. These prototypes need a thorough clinical and safety assessment especially
  for the complex therapeutic procedures. Large prospective, multicenter studies should
  be performed to assess whether the use of device-assisted enteroscopy leads to improved
  patients' long-term outcomes."
