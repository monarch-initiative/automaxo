input_text: 'Fibre-enriched buckwheat pasta modifies blood glucose response compared
  to corn pasta in individuals with type 1 diabetes and celiac disease: Acute randomized
  controlled trial. AIM: People with type 1 diabetes and celiac disease (T1D&CD) have
  high blood glucose variability. Processed gluten-free foods have shown to induce
  a worse metabolic profile whereas naturally gluten-free foods may represent healthier
  options. On the other hand, dietary fibre has shown to reduce postprandial glycemic
  excursions in individuals with diabetes. Thus, we evaluated the acute effect of
  fibre-enriched buckwheat (FBP) and corn pasta (CP) on postprandial blood glucose
  response (PP-BGR). METHODS: Ten adult patients with T1D&CD consumed two meals with
  the same amount of carbohydrate while differing only for pasta type (FBP or CP)
  preceded by the same insulin bolus. Participants utilized continuous glucose monitoring
  (CGM) and data over 6 h after meal were analyzed. RESULTS: PP-BGR differed between
  the two meals, being significantly lower in the first period (0-3 h) after the CP
  than the FBP meal (iAUC: -38 +- 158 vs. 305 +- 209 mmol/L   180 min, p = 0.040),
  whereas significantly higher in the second period (3-6 h) after the CP than the
  FBP meal (iAUC: 432 +- 153 vs. 308 +- 252 mmol/L   180 min, p = 0.030). Overall,
  a less variable postprandial profile was observed after FBP than CP consumption.
  CONCLUSIONS: In individuals with T1D&CD, the acute consumption of FBP induces significant
  differences in PP-BGR compared with CP that may be clinically relevant.'
