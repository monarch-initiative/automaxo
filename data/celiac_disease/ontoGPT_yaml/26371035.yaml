input_text: "Seronegative Celiac Disease and Immunoglobulin Deficiency: Where to Look
  in the Submerged Iceberg? In the present narrative review, we analyzed the relationship
  between seronegative celiac disease (SNCD) and immunoglobulin deficiencies. For
  this purpose, we conducted a literature search on the main medical databases. SNCD
  poses a diagnostic dilemma. Villous blunting, intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs)
  count and gluten \"challenge\" are the most reliable markers. Immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence
  tissue transglutaminase (tTG)-targeted mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA) immune complexes
  in the intestinal mucosa of SNCD patients may be useful. In our experience, tTG-mRNA
  was similarly increased in seropositive celiac disease (CD) and suspected SNCD,
  and strongly correlated with the IELs count. This increase is found even in the
  IELs' range of 15-25/100 enterocytes, suggesting that there may be a \"grey zone\"\
  \ of gluten-related disorders. An immune deregulation (severely lacking B-cell differentiation)
  underlies the association of SNCD with immunoglobulin deficiencies. Therefore, CD
  may be linked to autoimmune disorders and immune deficits (common variable immunodeficiency
  (CVID)/IgA selective deficiency). CVID is a heterogeneous group of antibodies dysfunction,
  whose association with CD is demonstrated only by the response to a gluten-free
  diet (GFD). We hypothesized a familial inheritance between CD and CVID. Selective
  IgA deficiency, commonly associated with CD, accounts for IgA-tTG seronegativity.
  Selective IgM deficiency (sIgMD) is rare (<300 cases) and associated to CD in 5%
  of cases. We diagnosed SNCD in a patient affected by sIgMD using the tTG-mRNA assay.
  One-year GFD induced IgM restoration. This evidence, supporting a link between SNCD
  and immunoglobulin deficiencies, suggests that we should take a closer look at this
  association. "
