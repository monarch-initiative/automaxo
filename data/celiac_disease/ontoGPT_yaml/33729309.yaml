input_text: "[Weaknesses in healthcare for persons with gluten-related disorders].
  Gluten-related disorders affect 1% to 6% of the population, with complications and
  high risk of short and long-term morbidity and mortality. Since 2009, Brazil has
  a Clinical Protocol of Therapeutic Guidelines for Celiac Disease, but there are
  frequent complaints by persons with gluten-related disorders concerning the lack
  of healthcare professionals' knowledge of this topic and the difficulties related
  to healthcare, for both diagnosis and treatment. This study aimed to understand
  the weaknesses in healthcare perceived by persons with gluten-related disorders.
  An online qualitative survey was conducted in the Living Without Gluten group on
  Facebook, consulting the records saved by the group for 65 months, which totaled
  510 posts and the respective comments. The data were grouped in categories, and
  thematic content analysis was performed, adopting the theoretical references on
  healthcare. The analysis revealed that the searches for diagnosis and adequate treatment
  were often described as a forced pilgrimage, resulting from shortcomings in healthcare,
  including lack of up-to-date knowledge on gluten-related disorders among the healthcare
  professionals and problems in the physician-patient relationship. Weaknesses in
  patient care and late diagnoses contribute to increasing the risk of complications
  and deaths. In this context, the Living Without Gluten group plays a leading role
  as a support group and network of solidarity, favoring increased awareness and empowerment
  of numerous Brazilians with gluten-related disorders."
