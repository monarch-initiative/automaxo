input_text: 'High rate of spontaneous normalization of celiac serology in a cohort
  of 446 children with type 1 diabetes: a prospective study. OBJECTIVE: In children
  with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), elevated levels of antitissue transglutaminase
  (anti-tTG) antibody may spontaneously normalize, despite continued consumption of
  gluten. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of spontaneous normalization of anti-tTG
  levels and the existence of factors predictive for this outcome. RESEARCH DESIGN
  AND METHODS: All children referred from 2002 to 2012 were screened for celiac disease
  (CD) at diabetes onset and at specific intervals. In the presence of a high anti-tTG
  titer or clinical symptoms, children were offered endoscopy, and asymptomatic patients
  with a low anti-tTG titer were invited to a second serological test after 6 months
  of eating a gluten-containing diet. RESULTS: The study included 446 children. Of
  these, 65 (14.5%) became positive for celiac serology: 38 (58%) had a persistently
  elevated anti-tTG titer and 27 (41%) fluctuating anti-tTG titer; 18 (28%) became
  negative. The prevalence of positive CD autoimmunity and overt CD was 14.3% (95%
  CI 11-17) and 8.5% (95% CI 5-10), 15- and 8-times higher than the general pediatric
  population, respectively. Asymptomatic children older than 9.1 years at T1DM onset
  had the lowest risk to develop CD. CONCLUSIONS: Serum anti-tTG levels decreased
  spontaneously in 40% of children with T1DM and became negative in 20%, despite gluten
  consumption. This finding supports the hypothesis of a state of temporary positivity
  of celiac serology in children with diabetes. In absence of clinical symptoms or
  signs of CD, histological confirmation of the disease and the gluten-free diet should
  be postponed to avoid unnecessary procedures and reduce an additional psychological
  burden.'
