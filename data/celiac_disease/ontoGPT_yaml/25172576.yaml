input_text: What a practitioner needs to know about celiac disease? Celiac disease
  (CD) is an immune-mediated systemic disorder elicited by gluten and related prolamines
  in genetically susceptible individuals and is characterized by the presence of a
  variable combination of gluten-dependent clinical manifestations, CD-specific antibodies,
  HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 haplotypes and enteropathy. CD is triggered by wheat gluten and
  related prolamines in barley and rye. Worldwide, the disease affects approximately
  1 % of the general population. Clinical features of CD vary considerably. Intestinal
  symptoms are more common in young children. In older children extra intestinal manifestations
  affecting almost all organs are seen. IgA tTG antibody, upper GI endoscopy with
  histological analysis of multiple biopsies of the duodenum and in selected cases
  HLA DQ2 and DQ8 positivity and endomysial antibodies (EMA) are needed for diagnosis.
  Currently, the only treatment for CD is a life-long gluten-free diet (GFD). Strict
  avoidance of wheat, rye, barley and their derivatives will result in intestinal
  healing and relief of symptoms for the majority of individuals with CD. The GFD
  is simple in principle, however, completely eliminating all foods and ingredients
  containing wheat, rye, barley, and most commercial oats can be very challenging.
  Newly diagnosed CD children should undergo testing and treatment for micronutrient
  deficiencies specially iron, folic acid, vitamin D, and vitamin B12. Long-term monitoring
  and follow up of patients with CD is necessary.
