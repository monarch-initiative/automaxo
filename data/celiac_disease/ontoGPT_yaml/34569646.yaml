input_text: 'Bone Fractures in Children and Young Adults With Type 1 Diabetes: Age
  Distribution, Fracture Location, and the Role of Glycemic Control. Type 1 diabetes
  (T1D) is a known risk factor for fractures, but the underlying pathophysiology is
  still not fully understood. This study aims to define age peaks and frequent fracture
  sites of children and young adults with T1D. Additionally, associations of fractures
  with metabolic and lifestyle factors as well as with additional complications in
  individuals with T1D were analyzed. A total of 750 individuals with T1D aged <=25
  years with fractures were matched to 3750 patients with T1D without fractures by
  demographics and insulin regimen. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values were compared using
  linear regression, and logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (OR)
  for fractures in individuals with acute complications and diseases. Median (Q1-Q3)
  age was 12.7 (9.9 to 14.9) years in individuals with fractures and 16.3 (12.6 to
  17.8) years in the entire control group with 65% versus 53% males. Peak age for
  fractures was 7 to <15 years in males and 9 to <11 years in females, which is earlier
  than reported for the general population. HbA1c (%) was significantly higher in
  individuals with fractures than in controls (difference of estimated means: 0.26%;
  95% confidence interval [CI] 0.07-0.46), especially in postpubertal females (0.68;
  0.10-1.26). Significantly higher odds for fractures were observed in individuals
  with severe hypoglycemia (OR = 1.90; 95% CI 1.47-2.47), especially in prepubertal
  females (OR = 2.81; 1.21-6.52]) and postpubertal males (2.44; 1.11-5.38), celiac
  disease (2.02; 1.67-2.45), and with a history of smoking (1.38; 1.02-1.88). The
  age peak of fractures seems to be earlier in T1D than in the general population.
  Poor glycemic control is related to fractures, even before puberty. Associations
  of HbA1c and severe hypoglycemia with fractures highly depend on age and sex.   2021
