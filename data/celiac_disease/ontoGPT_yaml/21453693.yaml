input_text: 'IgA-class autoantibodies against neuronal transglutaminase, TG6 in celiac
  disease: no evidence for gluten dependency. BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that
  antibodies against transglutaminase (TG) 6 could serve as a biomarker to identify
  a subgroup of gluten-sensitive patients who may be at risk of developing neurological
  disease. We here investigated whether TG6-targeted autoantibodies are a characteristic
  feature of celiac patients, especially those with neurological symptoms, and further,
  whether such antibodies are gluten-dependent. METHODS: Serum IgA-class TG6 autoantibodies
  were measured in untreated and treated celiac patients with and without neurological
  manifestions and in non-celiac controls. The results were compared to TG2 autoantibody
  levels. RESULTS: During a gluten-containing diet the number of TG6 autoantibody-positive
  celiac patients with neurological problems (25%) did not significantly differ from
  that of TG6-seropositive patients without neurological impairment (16%) or from
  non-celiac controls (15%). This was in contrast to our finding in TG2 autoantibody-positive
  individuals, whose numbers differed significantly between all three study groups.
  On a gluten-free diet the levels of TG6 autoantibodies remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS:
  We conclude that the serum IgA-class TG6 autoantibody assay is not able to distinguish
  gluten-sensitive patients with neurological manifestations from celiac patients
  without neurological problems or from control subjects, and further, that TG6 autoantibodies
  are not gluten-dependent.'
