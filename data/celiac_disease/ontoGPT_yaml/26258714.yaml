input_text: 'Utilization of sorghum, rice, corn flours with potato starch for the
  preparation of gluten-free pasta. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use
  of mixture of sorghum-rice-corn flour and potato starch in the development of gluten-free
  pasta for celiac disease patients. The experiment was designed according to simplex-lattice
  method and different types of gluten-free flours were used, such as sorghum, rice,
  corn, and potato starch. The fifteen formulations were subjected to sensory analysis
  (Mixed Structured Scale - MSS) and seven formulations were selected in respect to
  taste and grittiness. These formulations were subjected to Quantitative Descriptive
  Analysis (QDA), which evaluated the attributes: appearance, color, odor, hardness,
  elasticity, stickiness, grittiness, taste, residual bitterness and overall quality.
  Results showed significant difference in appearance, color and hardness. The formulations
  that showed the best sensory results were submitted to chemical analysis and cooking
  quality of pasta. It was observed that the best results for mixing is sorghum flour,
  rice flour and potato starch. '
