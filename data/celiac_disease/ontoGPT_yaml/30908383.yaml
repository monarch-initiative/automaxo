input_text: 'Pediatric Nonceliac Gluten Sensitivity: A Gluten-related Disorder Treatment
  Center Experience. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to identify the prevalence
  and clinical characteristics of children with nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS)
  presenting to a tertiary care center specialized for evaluation of gluten-related
  disorders. METHODS: The medical records of all patients aged 0 to 18 years who presented
  to our center over a 4-year period (July 2013-June 2018) and consented to participate
  in our research registry were reviewed. Patients meeting the clinical criteria for
  NCGS were reviewed in detail. RESULTS: Among 500 pediatric patients who volunteered
  to participate in the registry during the study period, we identified 26 (5.2%)
  with NCGS. Both gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms associated with gluten
  ingestion were common with abdominal pain (57.7%), bloating (53.9%), rash (53.9%),
  diarrhea/loose stool (42.3%), and emotional/behavioral issues (42.3%) emerging as
  the predominant complaints. In addition, children with NCGS demonstrated a high
  personal history (61.5%) and family history (61.5%) of concomitant allergic/atopic
  disease. CONCLUSIONS: Even within our highly specialized population of patients
  with a suspected gluten-related disorder, pediatric NCGS is relatively uncommon.
  The estimated prevalence and clinical features mirror those previously reported
  in a similarly highly selective population of adults. In the absence of celiac disease,
  clinical suspicion for NCGS should arise in a child with gastrointestinal and/or
  extraintestinal complaints alleviated with gluten removal and considered in symptomatic
  patients with associated allergic/atopic disease. Proper and adequate exclusion
  of celiac disease and other potential causes of the clinical complaints is essential
  to justify adoption of the gluten-free diet according to an appropriate stringency
  and with dietitian supervision to avoid nutritional deficiencies.'
