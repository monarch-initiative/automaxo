input_text: 'Fecal gluten immunogenic peptides as indicators of dietary compliance
  in celiac patients. BACKGROUND: It is important to have methods for evaluating dietary
  compliance in patients with celiac disease (CD). Determination of fecal gluten immunogenic
  peptides (GIPs) was recently proposed as a method of detecting gluten intake. The
  aim of this study was to evaluate whether determination of GIPs can be used as an
  indicator of compliance with a gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: Twenty-five persons
  with CD on a gluten-free diet for at least one year were enrolled in the study.
  Compliance with the diet was assessed by the Biagi questionnaire, evaluation of
  symptoms and assay of IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (IgA anti-tTG).
  GIPs were determined by iVYLISA GIP-S test (Biomedal S.L., Seville, Spain) on an
  automated Chorus analyzer (DIESSE Diagnostica Senese, Siena, Italy), after extraction
  of fecal samples by the method developed by DIESSE. RESULTS: Four patients tested
  positive for GIPs (GIP+), two of whom complied strictly with the gluten-free diet
  according to the Biagi questionnaire. None of the four GIP-positive patients manifested
  symptoms. IgA anti-tTG was significantly higher in GIP+ than in GIP- subjects. CONCLUSIONS:
  Assay of fecal GIPs identified more patients who were not complying with the diet
  than the Biagi questionnaire or evaluation of symptoms. The anti-tTG and GIP results
  agreed perfectly; however, since anti-tTG antibodies remain high for longer and
  are not a completely reliable marker of GFD intake, detection of fecal GIPs offers
  a direct, objective, quantitative assessment of exposure, even occasional, to gluten
  and could be used to check dietary compliance.'
