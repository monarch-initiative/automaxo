input_text: Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity in the Context of Functional Gastrointestinal
  Disorders. Gluten-free diets are increasingly chosen in the Western world, even
  in the absence of a diagnosis of celiac disease. Around 10% of people worldwide
  self-report gluten-related complaints, including intestinal and extra-intestinal
  symptoms. In most cases, these subjects would be labeled as patients suffering from
  irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) who place themselves on a gluten-free diet even in
  the absence of celiac disease. In some instances, patients report a clear benefit
  by avoiding gluten from their diet and/or symptom worsening upon gluten reintroduction.
  This clinical entity has been termed non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). The symptoms
  referred by these patients are both intestinal and extra-intestinal, suggesting
  that similarly to functional gastrointestinal disorders, NCGS is a disorder of gut-brain
  interaction. It remains unclear if gluten is the only wheat component involved in
  NCGS. The mechanisms underlying symptom generation in NCGS remain to be fully clarified,
  although in the past few years, the research has significantly moved forward with
  new data linking NCGS to changes in gut motility, permeability and innate immunity.
  The diagnosis is largely based on the self-reported reaction to gluten by the patient,
  as there are no available biomarkers, and confirmatory double-blind challenge protocols
  are unfeasible in daily clinical practice. Some studies suggest that a small proportion
  of patients with IBS have an intolerance to gluten. However, the benefits of gluten-free
  or low-gluten diets in non-celiac disease-related conditions are limited, and the
  long-term consequences of this practice may include nutritional and gut microbiota
  unbalance. Here, we summarize the role of gluten in the clinical features, pathophysiology,
  and management of NCGS and disorders of gut-brain interaction.
