input_text: "Neighborhood Deprivation and Risks of Autoimmune Disorders: A National
  Cohort Study in Sweden. Background: No study to date, as far as we know, has analyzed
  the potential effect of neighborhood-level deprivation on autoimmune disorders (ADs),
  when adjusted for individual-level characteristics. Methods: A total of 5.4 million
  individuals from 8363 neighborhoods, comprising the whole Swedish population (ages
  25-74 years), were followed for the period 1 January 2000, until admission due to
  diagnosis of ADs during the period of the study, or the conclusion of the study
  (31 December 2010). We used a neighborhood deprivation index, constructed from variables
  such as low education, low income, unemployment, and social welfare assistance,
  to assess the level of neighborhood deprivation. Multilevel logistic regression
  was used in the analysis with individual level characteristics at the first level
  and level of neighborhood deprivation at the second level. Results: A significant
  association between level of neighborhood deprivation and ADs was found. The crude
  odds were 1.32 (95% confidence interval 1.27-1.36) for those residing in the high-deprived
  neighborhoods compared to those living in low-deprivation neighborhoods. In the
  full model, where individual level characteristics were taken into account, the
  odds of ADs were 1.18 (1.14-1.22) in the most deprived neighborhoods. Certain Ads-angiitis
  hypersensitive (5.14), ankylosing spondylitis (1.66), celiac disease (1.65), Crohn's
  disease (1.21), diabetes mellitus type 1 (1.45), Graves's disease (1.13), Hashimoto
  thyroiditis (1.51), psoriasis (1.15), rheumatoid arthritis (1.15), sarcoidosis (1.20),
  and systemic sclerosis (1.27)-remained significantly associated with high level
  of neighborhood deprivation after adjustment for the individual-level variables.
  Conclusion: This study is the largest to date analyzing the potential influence
  of neighborhood deprivation on ADs. Our results indicate that neighborhood deprivation
  may affect risk of ADs, independent of individual level sociodemographic characteristics.
  For health care policies, both individual and neighborhood level approaches seem
  to be of importance."
