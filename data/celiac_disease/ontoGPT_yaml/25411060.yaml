input_text: 'Lipoatrophy in children with type 1 diabetes: an increasing incidence?
  The objectives were to evaluate the current prevalence of lipoatrophy at insulin
  injection sites in young patients with type 1 diabetes. Standardized examination
  of insulin injection sites in all 678 patients with type 1 diabetes treated in 2013
  in our outpatient clinic were conducted. In case of lipoatrophy photo documentation
  and standardized interview with parents and patients were performed. We identified
  a total of 16 patients (43.8% male) with lipoatrophy (overall prevalence 2.4%).
  The current mean age (+-SD) of the affected patients was 14.4 +- 3.9 years, age
  and diabetes duration at onset of lipoatrophy were 11.5 +- 3.8 years and 5.4 +-
  3.6 years, respectively. All patients were using analogs at the onset of lipoatrophy.
  In all, 14 of 16 patients (87.5%) were on insulin pump compared with 52% without
  lipoatrophy (P = .0018). The use of steel needle and Teflon catheter was equal between
  the pump patients. Concomitant autoimmune diseases were present in 37.5% of the
  patients (thyroiditis: n = 3, thyroiditis and celiac disease: n = 2, celiac disease:
  n = 1) compared with 15.0% in those without lipoatrophy (P = .0128). Lipoatrophy
  was present in young patients treated with modern insulins and pumps; however, the
  prevalence was relatively low as expected with the use of modern insulins. Our data
  may support the hypothesis that a constant mechanical element such as a subcutaneous
  catheter may trigger the development of lipoatrophy, particularly in those patients
  with more than 1 autoimmune disease. '
