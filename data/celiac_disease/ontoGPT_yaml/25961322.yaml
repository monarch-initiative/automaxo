input_text: 'Bones of contention: bone mineral density recovery in celiac disease--a
  systematic review. Metabolic bone disease is a frequent co-morbidity in newly diagnosed
  adults with celiac disease (CD), an autoimmune disorder triggered by the ingestion
  of dietary gluten. This systematic review of studies looked at the efficacy of the
  gluten-free diet, physical activity, nutrient supplementation, and bisphosphonates
  for low bone density treatment. Case control and cohort designs were identified
  from PubMed and other academic databases (from 1996 to 2015) that observed newly
  diagnosed adults with CD for at least one year after diet treatment using the dual-energy
  x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan. Only 20 out of 207 studies met the inclusion criteria.
  Methodological quality was assessed using the Strengthening of the Reporting of
  Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement checklist. Gluten-free
  diet adherence resulted in partial recovery of bone density by one year in all studies,
  and full recovery by the fifth year. No treatment differences were observed between
  the gluten-free diet alone and diet plus bisphosphonates in one study. For malnourished
  patients, supplementation with vitamin D and calcium resulted in significant improvement.
  Evidence for the impact of physical activity on bone density was limited. Therapeutic
  strategies aimed at modifying lifestyle factors throughout the lifespan should be
  studied. '
