input_text: 'Case study: nutritional strategies of a cyclist with celiac disease during
  an ultraendurance race. Food intolerance is becoming increasingly prevalent, and
  increasing numbers of athletes have celiac disease. This poses challenges as dietary
  recommendations for exercise are largely based on gluten-containing carbohydrate-rich
  foods. The K4 cycle race covers 384 km around the Coromandel Peninsula, New Zealand.
  Lack of sleep, darkness, and temperature variations pose a number of nutritional
  challenges. Limited food choices present those with celiac disease with even greater
  challenges. This case study describes the intakes of one such athlete during training
  and competing in the K4. Nutritional intakes were obtained during training using
  weighed-food records and during the race via dietary recall and the weighing of
  foods pre- and post-race. As simple substitution of gluten-containing foods for
  gluten-free foods leads to increased energy intake, alternatives need to be considered.
  During the race, insufficient energy was consumed to meet the nutritional guidelines
  for endurance performance. This was probably due to the nature of the course, racing
  conditions, the consistency of gluten-free food, and, toward the end of the race,
  sensory-specific satiety.'
