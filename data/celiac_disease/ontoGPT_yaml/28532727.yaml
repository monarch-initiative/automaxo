input_text: 'Experiences and own management regarding residual symptoms among people
  with coeliac disease. CONTEXT: Between 7% and 30% of people with treated coeliac
  disease suffer from residual symptoms, and there is a knowledge gap about their
  own management of these symptoms. AIM: To explore experiences and management concerning
  residual symptoms despite a gluten-free diet in people with coeliac disease. METHODS:
  A qualitative explorative design with semi-structured interviews with 22 adults
  with coeliac disease in Sweden. Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis.
  RESULTS: The informants had, at diagnosis, thought that their symptoms would disappear
  if they followed a gluten-free diet, but the disease was continuing to have a substantial
  impact on their lives, despite several years of treatment. They experienced cognitive,
  somatic as well as mental symptoms, including impact on personality (e.g. having
  a "shorter fuse", being more miserable or tired). However, only a few informants
  had sought medical care for persistent symptoms. Instead they tried to manage these
  by themselves, e.g. abstaining from food during periods of more intense symptom,
  or using distraction. The management of persistent symptoms resembled thorough detective
  work. To prevent problems related to residual symptoms the informants used withdrawal
  of social contact as well as acceptance of their situation. CONCLUSION: People with
  treated coeliac disease may experience residual symptoms of both a physical and
  psychological nature, causing major negative impacts on their lives in different
  ways. In the light of this, healthcare staff should change their practices regarding
  the follow-up of these people, and in addition to medical care should provide guidance
  on management strategies to facilitate the daily life. Furthermore, information
  to newly diagnosed persons should make them aware of the possibility to experience
  continued symptoms, despite treatment.'
