input_text: "Tax-deductible provisions for gluten-free diet in Canada compared with
  systems for gluten-free diet coverage available in various countries. Celiac disease
  affects 1% of the North American population, with an estimated 350,000 Canadians
  diagnosed with this condition. The disease is triggered by the ingestion of gluten,
  and a lifelong, strict gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only currently available treatment.
  Compliance with a strict GFD is essential not only for intestinal mucosal recovery
  and alleviation of symptoms, but also for the prevention of complications such as
  anemia, osteoporotic fractures and small bowel lymphoma. However, a GFD is difficult
  to follow, socially inconvenient and expensive. Different approaches, such as tax
  reduction, cash transfer, food provision, prescription and subsidy, have been used
  to reduce the additional costs of the GFD to patients with celiac disease. The current
  review showed that the systems in place exhibit particular advantages and disadvantages
  in relation to promoting uptake and compliance with GFD. The tax offset system used
  in Canada for GFD coverage takes the form of a reimbursement of a cost previously
  incurred. Hence, the program does not help celiac patients meet the incremental
  cost of the GFD - it simply provides some future refund of that cost. An ideal balanced
  approach would involve subsidizing gluten-free products through controlled vouchers
  or direct food provision to those who most need it, independently of 'ability or
  willingness to pay'. Moreover, if the cost of such a program is inhibitive, the
  value of the benefits could be made taxable to ensure that any patient contribution,
  in terms of additional taxation, is directly related to ability to pay. The limited
  coverage of GFD in Canada is concerning. There is an unmet need for GFD among celiac
  patients in Canada. More efforts are required by the Canadian medical community
  and the Canadian Celiac Association to act as agents in identifying ways of improving
  resource allocation in celiac disease. "
