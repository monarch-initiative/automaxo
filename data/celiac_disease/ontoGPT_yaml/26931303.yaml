input_text: 'Celiac crisis in children in Serbia. BACKGROUND: To assess the prevalence
  and risk factors of celiac crisis (CC) in children with classical celiac disease
  (CD). METHODS: This retrospective study comprised 367 children with classical CD
  diagnosed from 1994 to 2015. The diagnosis of CD was based on the revised ESPGHAN
  criteria and CC on acute worsening and rapid progression of chronic diarrhea and
  vomiting followed by severe dehydration, multiple metabolic derangements and a marked
  decrease of body weight. RESULTS: Celiac crisis was confirmed in six (1.63 %) children,
  five in the first and one in the second year of life. In three patients CC was precipitated
  by rotavirus and in one by Salmonella enteritidis infection, while in the remaining
  two, except for a too long-standing disease and severe malnutrition, no additional
  causes of CC were found. CONCLUSION: Celiac crisis in Serbia is still-present in
  children exclusively below the second year of life as a spontaneous or intestinal
  infection precipitated complication of previously unrecognized CD.'
