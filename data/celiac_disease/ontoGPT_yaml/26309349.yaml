input_text: 'Iron deficiency anemia in celiac disease. Iron is an important micronutrient
  that may be depleted in celiac disease. Iron deficiency and anemia may complicate
  well-established celiac disease, but may also be the presenting clinical feature
  in the absence of diarrhea or weight loss. If iron deficiency anemia occurs, it
  should be thoroughly evaluated, even if celiac disease has been defined since other
  superimposed causes of iron deficiency anemia may be present. Most often, impaired
  duodenal mucosal uptake of iron is evident since surface absorptive area in the
  duodenum is reduced, in large part, because celiac disease is an immune-mediated
  disorder largely focused in the proximal small intestinal mucosa. Some studies have
  also suggested that blood loss may occur in celiac disease, sometimes from superimposed
  small intestinal disorders, including ulceration or neoplastic diseases, particularly
  lymphoma. In addition, other associated gastric or colonic disorders may be responsible
  for blood loss. Rarely, an immune-mediated hemolytic disorder with increased urine
  iron loss may occur that may respond to a gluten-free diet. Reduced expression of
  different regulatory proteins critical in iron uptake has also been defined in the
  presence and absence of anemia. Finally, other rare causes of microcytic anemia
  may occur in celiac disease, including a sideroblastic form of anemia reported to
  have responded to a gluten-free diet. '
