input_text: 'Prolactin may be increased in newly diagnosed celiac children and adolescents
  and decreases after 6 months of gluten-free diet. BACKGROUND/AIMS: Prolactin (PRL)
  is produced by the anterior pituitary gland. It exerts its role on the breast gland
  but also plays a modulatory role in autoimmune mechanisms. Celiac disease (CD) is
  a gluten-sensitive autoimmune enteropathy sometimes associated with autoimmune endocrinopathies.
  No data on PRL levels in CD patients are available at diagnosis, and no conclusive
  data are reported. METHODS: We aimed to evaluate PRL secretion in newly diagnosed
  CD pediatric patients and, in the case of hyperprolactinemia, any changes in its
  levels while the patients were on a gluten-free diet (GFD). We recruited 67 patients
  and 39 healthy controls. RESULTS: PRL was statistically higher in the CD patients
  (13.5+-9.2 ng/ml) than in the controls (8.5+-5.0 ng/ml). In the CD group, PRL was
  inversely correlated with the age at diagnosis (r=-0.326; p=0.007). In patients
  with hyperprolactinemia at diagnosis, PRL decreased after 6 months of GFD. CONCLUSION:
  This paper confirms that PRL may be increased at diagnosis of CD and shows, for
  the first time, that it decreases after a short course of GFD. Changes in the levels
  of inflammatory cytokines in CD may account for changes in PRL levels. Younger patients
  seem more prone to develop hyperprolactinemia than older ones.'
