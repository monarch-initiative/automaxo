input_text: "Pharmacotherapy and management strategies for coeliac disease. INTRODUCTION:
  Coeliac disease is a common disease that affects approximately 1% of Northern European
  and American populations. Evidence suggests it is caused by an inappropriate immune
  response in genetically susceptible patients to dietary gluten found in wheat, rye,
  barley and, in a small minority of patients, oats. Treatment involves a lifelong
  gluten-free diet. This diet limits nutritional variety and is costly and difficult
  to maintain. AREAS COVERED: This review covers the current treatment options available
  and discusses novel emerging therapies for coeliac disease. EXPERT OPINION: Novel
  therapies are still in early stages of development and therefore, at present, a
  gluten-free diet remains the treatment of choice in coeliac disease due to its low
  side-effect profile. A replacement for a gluten-free diet would be superior to an
  adjunct; in this case dietary modification of gluten may well have the least side
  effects, be tolerated by a wider group of coeliac patients and therefore be accepted.
  Search terms used: Pubmed, Medline and clinicaltrials.gov were searched with 'celiac
  disease' and 'therapy' as MESH terms. Patent database was searched using the term
  'celiac disease'. Conference attendance at DDW Chicago 2011 and Columbia 2010 was
  also used to gain further information from conference abstracts."
