input_text: 'Uncovering the Concerns and Needs of Individuals with Celiac Disease:
  A Cross-Sectional Study. The treatment for celiac disease (CD) involves a strict
  gluten-free diet, which can be challenging and lead to questions for patients. Pinpointing
  these uncertainties can enable the creation of efficient educational resources.
  In this study, a questionnaire was specifically designed to gain insights into the
  knowledge, concerns, and needs of individuals with CD and their supporters. The
  questionnaire was distributed through the Instagram social network and received
  adequate responses from 300 participants, 258 (86%) being female and 152 (50.7%)
  falling in the age range of 25-44 years. The concerns of individuals with celiac
  disease and celiac supporters were rated on a 1-4 scale, with a mean score of 3.5
  indicating significant concern. A total of 255 (85%) of all participants expressed
  that their principal concern was the social limitations they faced, such as difficulties
  in eating out and sharing food with others. Every participant evaluated their overall
  disease knowledge, averaging at 2.92 out of 4, indicating a reasonable level of
  awareness. When asked if they believed that improving general knowledge about CD
  in the general population would enhance their quality of life, the vast majority
  responded affirmatively. This finding underscores the importance of not only educating
  individuals with CD but also reaching out to the wider population, especially those
  who have a direct impact on the daily lives of individuals with CD, such as family
  members, friends, and food service providers.'
