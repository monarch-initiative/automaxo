input_text: 'Non-celiac gluten sensitivity: literature review. BACKGROUND: A significant
  percentage of the general population report problems caused by wheat and/or gluten
  ingestion, even though they do not have celiac disease (CD) or wheat allergy (WA),
  because they test negative both for CD-specific serology and histopathology and
  for immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated assays. Most patients report both gastrointestinal
  and nongastrointestinal symptoms, and all report improvement of symptoms on a gluten-free
  diet. This clinical condition has been named non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS).
  AIM: We attempt to define the current pathogenic, clinical, and diagnostic criteria
  of this "new" disease, to provide a practical view that might be useful to evaluate,
  diagnose, and manage NCGS patients. METHODS: We reviewed the international literature
  through PubMed and Medline, using the search terms "wheat (hyper)sensitivity," "wheat
  allergy," "wheat intolerance," "gluten (hyper)sensitivity," and "gluten intolerance,"
  and we discuss current knowledge about NCGS. RESULTS: It has been demonstrated that
  patients suffering from NCGS are a heterogeneous group, composed of several subgroups,
  each characterized by different pathogenesis, clinical history, and, probably, clinical
  course. NCGS diagnosis can be reached only by excluding CD and WA. Recent evidence
  shows that a personal history of food allergy in infancy, coexistent atopy, positive
  for immunoglobulin G (IgG) antigliadin antibodies and flow cytometric basophil activation
  test, with wheat and duodenal and/or ileum-colon intraepithelial and lamina propria
  eosinophil counts, could be useful to identify NCGS patients. CONCLUSIONS: Future
  research should aim to identify reliable biomarkers for NCGS diagnosis and to better
  define the different NCGS subgroups. Key teaching points:   Most patients report
  both gastrointestinal and nongastrointestinal symptoms, and all agree that there
  is an improvement of symptoms on a gluten-free diet.   NCGS diagnosis can be reached
  only by excluding celiac disease and wheat allergy.   Patients suffering from NCGS
  are a heterogeneous group, composed of several subgroups, each characterized by
  different pathogenesis, clinical history, and, probably, clinical course.   A personal
  history of food allergy in infancy, coexistent atopy, positive IgG antigliadin antibodies
  (AGA) and flow cytometric basophil activation test, with wheat and duodenal and/or
  ileum-colon intraepithelial and lamina propria eosinophil counts, could be useful
  to identify NCGS patients.   Future research should aim to identify reliable biomarkers
  for NCGS diagnosis and to better define the different NCGS subgroup.'
