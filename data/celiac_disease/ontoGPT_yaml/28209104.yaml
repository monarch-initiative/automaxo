input_text: 'Impact of gluten-free diet on quality of life in celiac patients. BACKGROUND
  AND AIM: Celiac disease (CD) is a common gluten-related disorder, whose only treatment
  is a gluten-free diet (GFD). Since a unique view on psychological consequences of
  a GFD still lacks, our aim was to assess the quality of life (QoL) and the depression
  state in symptomatic CD patients after GFD. Socio-demographic features were considered.
  PATIENTS AND METHODS: 210 adult CD patients were recruited and divided into 3 groups
  : 70 newly diagnosed patients (Group A),70 patients who have been on GFD for 6-12
  months (Group B), and 70 patients who have been on GFD for more than 12 months (Group
  C). We recruited 210 healthy controls (Group D). Psychological General Well-Being
  Index (PGWBI) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) questionnaires were administered.
  Each group was evaluated according to age, gender and school ranking. RESULTS: Groups
  A and B showed lower PGWBI scores compared with both Group C and D (p <0.001 for
  each comparison). Moreover, Groups A and B showed higher BDI scores compared with
  both Group C and D (p <0.001 for each comparison).Women, the elderly and the poorly
  educated seemed to suffer more psychological stress. CONCLUSION: GFD induces an
  improvement of well-being and a decrease of depression state after 12 months of
  strict GFD. Negative psychological implications were observed only in specific risk
  categories. (Acta gastroenterol. belg., 2016, 79, 447-453).'
