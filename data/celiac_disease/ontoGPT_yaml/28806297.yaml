input_text: 'Adherence to a Gluten-free Diet: Assessment by Dietician Interview and
  Serology. We aimed to determine whether tissue transglutaminase (tTG) autoantibody
  positivity was associated with dietitian-assessed adherence to a gluten-free diet
  in pediatric patients with celiac disease and identify areas where adherence falters.
  We reviewed the records of children with celiac disease who had a standardized evaluation
  of adherence by a registered dietitian. A negative tTG value was not associated
  with good adherence (P = NS). Adherent and nonadherent children differed with respect
  to purposeful and accidental gluten exposure (P < 0.0001), knowledge (P = 0.003),
  cross-contact (P = 0.003), potential exposure via medications and cosmetics (P =
  0.004), and potential exposure while at restaurants (P < 0.0001), but not with respect
  to potential exposure at school (P = NS). Based on our findings, we suggest that
  negative tTG levels are not necessarily indicative of good adherence to a gluten-free
  diet in pediatric patients with celiac disease. A separate assessment of adherence
  is needed focusing on knowledge, behavior while dining out, and intent to adhere.'
