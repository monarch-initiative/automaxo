input_text: The Liver and Celiac Disease. Celiac disease is a multisystem disorder.
  Celiac hepatitis characterized by gluten-responsive mild elevation of transaminases
  is the more common liver manifestation of celiac disease. Celiac disease may also
  be associated or coexist with other chronic liver disorders. Shared genetic risk
  and increased intestinal permeability have been suggested to be the most relevant
  events in the pathogenesis of liver injury in celiac disease. The aim of this article
  is to review the full spectrum of liver disorders in patients with celiac disease.
