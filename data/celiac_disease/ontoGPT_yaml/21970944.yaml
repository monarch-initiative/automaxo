input_text: 'Vitamin D and K status influences bone mineral density and bone accrual
  in children and adolescents with celiac disease. BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Children
  with celiac disease (CD) are at risk for decreased bone mineral density (BMD) because
  of fat-soluble vitamin malabsorption, inflammation and/or under-nutrition. The study
  objective was to determine the interrelationships between vitamin K/D status and
  lifestyle variables on BMD in children and adolescents with CD at diagnosis and
  after 1 year on the gluten-free diet (GFD). SUBJECTS/METHODS: Children and adolescents
  aged 3-17 years with biopsy proven CD at diagnosis and after 1 year on the GFD were
  studied. BMD was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Relevant variables
  included: anthropometrics, vitamin D/K status, diet, physical activity and sunlight
  exposure. RESULTS: Whole-body and lumbar-spine BMD-z scores were low (< or = -1)
  at diagnosis (10-20%) and after 1 year (30-32%) in the children, independent of
  symptoms. Whole-body BMD-z scores (-0.55+-0.7 versus 0.72+-1.5) and serum levels
  of 25(OH) vitamin D (90.3+-24.8 versus 70.5+-19.8 nmol/l) were significantly lower
  in older children (>10 years) when compared with younger children (< or =10 years)
  (P<0.001). Forty-three percent had suboptimal vitamin D status (25(OH)-vitamin D
  <75 nmol/l) at diagnosis; resolving in nearly half after 1 year on the GFD. Twenty-five
  percent had suboptimal vitamin K status at diagnosis; all resolved after 1 year.
  CONCLUSIONS: Children and adolescents with CD are at risk for suboptimal bone health
  at time of diagnosis and after 1 year on GFD; likely due in part to suboptimal vitamin
  D/K status. Therapeutic strategies aimed at optimizing vitamin K/D intake may contribute
  to improved BMD in children with CD.'
