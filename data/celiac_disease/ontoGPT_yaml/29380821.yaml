input_text: 'Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Crossover Trial for the Diagnosis
  of Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity in Children. OBJECTIVES: Non-celiac gluten sensitivity
  (NCGS) is characterized by intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms that are related
  to the ingestion of gluten in subjects who are not affected by either celiac disease
  (CD) or wheat allergy (WA). In this multicenter study, we aim for the first time
  to evaluate the prevalence of NCGS in pediatric subjects with chronic functional
  gastrointestinal symptoms associated with gluten ingestion using a double-blind
  placebo-controlled (DBPC) gluten challenge with crossover. METHODS: Among 1,114
  children with chronic gastrointestinal symptoms (negative CD and WA), those exhibiting
  a positive correlation between symptoms and gluten ingestion were eligible for a
  diagnostic challenge including the following phases: run-in, open gluten-free diet
  (GFD) and DBPC crossover gluten challenge. Patients were randomized to gluten (10
  g/daily) and placebo (rice starch) for 2 weeks each, separated by a washout week.
  The gluten challenge was considered positive in the presence of a minimum 30% decrease
  of global visual analogue scale between gluten and placebo. RESULTS: Out of 1,114
  children, 96.7% did not exhibit any correlation with gluten ingestion. Thirty-six
  children were eligible; after the run-in and open GFD, 28 patients entered the gluten
  challenge. Eleven children (39.2%; 95% CI: 23.6-53.6%) tested positive. CONCLUSIONS:
  This is the first demonstration of the existence of NCGS in children that reinforce
  the need for a DBPC for the diagnosis as the diagnosis is ruled out in >60% of cases.
  The registration identifier in ClinicalsTrials.gov is NCT02431585.'
