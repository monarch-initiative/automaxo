input_text: 'Follow-up of children with celiac disease - lost in translation? BACKGROUND:
  Celiac disease (CD) is a prevalent condition with a broad spectrum of presentations
  requiring a lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD). Our aims were to examine the presentation
  and adherence to a GFD as well as the adequacy of follow-up of children diagnosed
  with CD at a tertiary referral center. METHODS: A retrospective electronic chart
  review of pediatric patients suspected of CD (n = 581) who were seen at our institute
  between January 1999 and December 2008 was performed. RESULTS: 387 children were
  diagnosed with CD (F/M ratio of 1.54, median age: 6.25 years). Presenting symptoms
  were iron deficiency anemia (n = 82, 34%), short stature (n = 59, 24.5%) and abdominal
  pain (n = 59, 24.5%). In 63 patients (16.3%) an associated autoimmune disease was
  recorded. Only 42.7% of the patients (165/387) had regular out-patient gastroenterologist
  visits; 22% (86/387) were followed by their primary care physician. Over 35% (136/387)
  were completely lost to follow-up. Negative serology on follow-up was present in
  91% of the CD patients(150/165) followed at our center in comparison to 70% (60/86)
  in those followed up by their primary physician (p = 0.0002). CONCLUSIONS: At least
  in our referral center, follow-up of children diagnosed with CD is far from satisfactory.
  Initiatives aimed at improving adherence to regular follow-up are needed as this
  intervention is associated with a significant increase in patient compliance with
  a long-term GFD.'
