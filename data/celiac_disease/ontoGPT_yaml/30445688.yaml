input_text: 'A Retrospective Study on Dietary FODMAP Intake in Celiac Patients Following
  a Gluten-Free Diet. Our aim was to evaluate the intake of foods containing fermentable
  oligo/di/mono-saccharides and polyols (FODMAP) as a possible factor that induces
  gastrointestinal symptoms in treated celiac disease (CD) patients. We collected
  seven-day weighed food records for 104 CD patients and 91 healthy volunteers. All
  evaluated food items were from sources with high and low content of FODMAP, which
  were divided into cereals and sweets, sweeteners and soft drinks, fruits, dried
  fruits, and vegetables. Nutrient intake was calculated using the food database of
  the European Institute of Oncology. The symptoms reported were assessed by a Rome
  IV Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) diagnostic questionnaire and by specific questions
  for the evaluation of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). The 12% of
  CD patients met IBS symptoms criteria as opposed to 6% of controls (p = 0.09) and
  27% of patients reported FGIDs symptoms vs. 22% of healthy controls (p = 0.42).
  The intake by CD patients was significantly higher than healthy volunteers for:
  sweeteners and sugars with low content of FODMAP (p = 0.0007), fruits, dried fruits,
  and vegetables high in FODMAP (p = 0.003) and low in FODMAP (p = 0.04) when compared
  to controls. CD patients had a lower intake of cereals and sweets with a high content
  of FODMAP (p = 0.00001). Healthy volunteers consumed significantly higher alcoholic
  beverages and fats high in FODMAP (both p < 0.044). The mean daily intake of other
  food categories did not differ between both groups. Even though CD patients had
  a low intake of gluten-free cereals high in FODMAP, they still consumed a significant
  amount of fruits and vegetables high in FODMAP. The clinical effect of a concomitant
  gluten-free diet and low-FODMAP diet should be prospectively evaluated as a supportive
  therapy in CD patients.'
