input_text: 'Systematic Literature Review of the Economic Burden of Celiac Disease.
  BACKGROUND: The prevalence of celiac disease (CD) has rapidly increased over recent
  decades, but costs related to CD remain poorly quantified. OBJECTIVE: This systematic
  review assessed the economic burden of CD in North America and Europe. METHODS:
  MEDLINE, EMBASE, EconLit, and the Cochrane Library databases were systematically
  searched to identify English-language literature from 2007 to 2018 that assessed
  costs, cost effectiveness, and health resource utilization for CD. RESULTS: Forty-nine
  studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 28 (57.1%) addressed costs of testing
  and diagnosis; 33 (67.3%) were from Europe. The cost per positive CD diagnosis of
  testing patients already undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy for other indications
  ranged from 1300 Canadian dollars ($Can) in Canada (2016 value) to $44,712 in the
  Netherlands (2013 value). Adding the CD test was cost effective when it combined
  diagnostic modalities (e.g., serology and biopsy). Direct annual excess costs to
  a US payer per diagnosed CD patient totaled $US6000 (2013 value) more than for a
  person without CD, chiefly due to outpatient care. Hospitalizations, emergency visits,
  and medication use were more common with CD. After initiating a gluten-free diet
  (GFD), patients visited primary care providers less often, used more medications,
  and missed fewer days from school and work. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the few available
  economic studies of CD assess testing and diagnosis costs, especially in Europe.
  Methods of testing generally are considered cost effective when they combine diagnostic
  modalities in symptomatic patients. Most costs to a payer of managing CD derive
  from outpatient care. Following GFD initiation, patients lose fewer days from work
  and school than pretreatment.'
