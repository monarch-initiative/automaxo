input_text: 'Autoantibodies against MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A are
  associated with increased risk of concomitant autoimmune diseases in celiac patients.
  BACKGROUND: Overexpression of autologous proteins can lead to the formation of autoantibodies
  and autoimmune diseases. MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A (MICA) is highly
  expressed in the enterocytes of patients with celiac disease, which arises in response
  to gluten. The aim of this study was to investigate anti-MICA antibody formation
  in patients with celiac disease and its association with other autoimmune processes.
  METHODS: We tested serum samples from 383 patients with celiac disease, obtained
  before they took up a gluten-free diet, 428 patients with diverse autoimmune diseases,
  and 200 controls for anti-MICA antibodies. All samples were also tested for anti-endomysium
  and anti-transglutaminase antibodies. RESULTS: Antibodies against MICA were detected
  in samples from 41.7% of patients with celiac disease but in only 3.5% of those
  from controls (P <0.0001) and 8.2% from patients with autoimmune disease (P <0.0001).
  These antibodies disappeared after the instauration of a gluten-free diet. Anti-MICA
  antibodies were significantly prevalent in younger patients (P <0.01). Fifty-eight
  patients with celiac disease (15.1%) presented a concomitant autoimmune disease.
  Anti-MICA-positive patients had a higher risk of autoimmune disease than MICA antibody-negative
  patients (P <0.0001; odds ratio = 6.11). The risk was even higher when we also controlled
  for age (odds ratio = 11.69). Finally, we found that the associated risk of developing
  additional autoimmune diseases was 16 and 10 times as high in pediatric patients
  and adults with anti-MICA, respectively, as in those without. CONCLUSIONS: The development
  of anti-MICA antibodies could be related to a gluten-containing diet, and seems
  to be involved in the development of autoimmune diseases in patients with celiac
  disease, especially younger ones.'
