input_text: '[Non-celiac gluten sensitivity]. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity has recently
  been recognized by the scientific community as a part of gluten-related disorders,
  and is defined as a condition with gastrointestinal and/or extra-intestinal symptoms
  triggered by gluten ingestion in the absence of celiac disease and wheat allergy.
  Currently, there is no specific serological marker and non-celiac gluten sensitivity
  remains a diagnosis of exclusion: testing for celiac disease and wheat allergy must
  be negative, symptoms must improve with a gluten-free diet, and diagnosis must be
  confirmed by the gluten challenge. In this article, we discuss current knowledge
  of pathophysiology, clinical and epidemilogical spectrum, diagnosis, and treatment
  of NCGS. '
