input_text: Vitamin D and celiac disease. Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated
  condition affecting the small intestine. Its reported global prevalence falls within
  the range of 0.7% to 1.4%. Notably, historically, higher rates, reaching 1% in Western
  Ireland, have been documented. Recent research has even revealed prevalence rates
  as elevated as 2% in northern Europe. These findings underscore the urgency for
  swift and cost-effective diagnosis, especially in individuals identified through
  screening efforts. At present, the diagnosis of CD relies on a multifaceted approach
  involving positive serological markers such as IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase
  (anti-TTG) and anti-endomysial antibodies (anti-EMA). These serological findings
  are assessed in conjunction with classical histological alterations, as outlined
  in the Marsh classification. CD is an inflammatory condition triggered by the consumption
  of gluten, resulting from intricate interactions between genetic, immunological,
  and environmental factors. CD is linked to malabsorption, leading to nutritional
  deficiencies. Individuals with CD are required to adhere to a gluten-free diet,
  which itself can lead to nutrient deficiencies. One such deficiency includes vitamin
  D, and there is substantial experimental evidence supporting the notion of a bidirectional
  relationship between CD and vitamin D status. A low level of vitamin D has a detrimental
  impact on the clinical course of the disease. Here we summarize the key characteristics
  of CD and explore the prominent roles of vitamin D in individuals with CD.
