input_text: 'Reintroduction of gluten following flour transamidation in adult celiac
  patients: a randomized, controlled clinical study. A lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD)
  is mandatory for celiac disease (CD) but has poor compliance, justifying novel strategies.
  We found that wheat flour transamidation inhibited IFN-gamma secretion by intestinal
  T cells from CD patients. Herein, the primary endpoint was to evaluate the ability
  of transamidated gluten to maintain GFD CD patients in clinical remission. Secondary
  endpoints were efficacy in prevention of the inflammatory response and safety at
  the kidney level, where reaction products are metabolized. In a randomized single
  blinded, controlled 90-day trial, 47 GFD CD patients received 3.7 g/day of gluten
  from nontransamidated (12) or transamidated (35) flour. On day 15, 75% and 37% of
  patients in the control and experimental groups, respectively, showed clinical relapse
  (P = 0.04) whereas intestinal permeability was mainly altered in the control group
  (50% versus 20%, P = 0.06). On day 90, 0 controls and 14 patients in the experimental
  group completed the challenge with no variation of antitransglutaminase IgA (P =
  0.63), Marsh-Oberhuber grading (P = 0.08), or intestinal IFN-gamma mRNA (P > 0.05).
  Creatinine clearance did not vary after 90 days of treatment (P = 0.46). In conclusion,
  transamidated gluten reduced the number of clinical relapses in challenged patients
  with no changes of baseline values for serological/mucosal CD markers and an unaltered
  kidney function.'
