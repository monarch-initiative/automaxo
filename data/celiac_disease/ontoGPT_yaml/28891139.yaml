input_text: Helicobacter pylori infection in children. Helicobacter pylori infection
  in children differs from that in adults, from the point of view of epidemiology,
  host response, clinical features, related diseases, and diagnosis, as well as treatment
  strategies. The prevalence of H. pylori infection, in both children and adults,
  is decreasing in the Western World as well as in some developing countries, which
  contrasts with the increase in childhood asthma and allergic diseases. Recurrent
  abdominal pain is not specific during H. pylori infection in children. The role
  of H. pylori infection and failure to thrive, children's growth, type I diabetes
  mellitus (T1DM) and celiac disease remains controversial. The main initial diagnosis
  is based on upper digestive endoscopy with biopsy-based methods. Nodular gastritis
  may be a pathognomonic endoscopic finding of childhood H. pylori infection. The
  infection eradication control is based on validated noninvasive tests. The main
  cause of treatment failure of H. pylori infection is its clarithromycin resistance.
  We recommend standard antibiotic susceptibility testing of H. pylori in pediatric
  patients prior to the initiation of eradication therapy. H. pylori treatment in
  children should be based on an evaluation of the rate of eradication in the local
  population, a systematic use of a treatment adapted to the susceptibility profile
  and a treatment compliance greater than 90%. The last meta-analysis in children
  did not show an advantage for sequential therapy when compared to a 14-day triple
  therapy. Finally, the high rate of antibiotic resistance responsible for therapy
  failure in recent years justifies the necessity of a novel vaccine to prevent H.
  pylori infection in children.
