input_text: A child with atypical celiac disease and recurrent urolithiasis. A young
  boy with prior constipation developed recurrent severe calcium phosphate kidney
  calculi, sometimes sufficient to cause acute kidney failure and hydronephrosis.
  After several major surgeries, food allergies were determined by serum immunoglobulin
  E testing, and when he finally went on a gluten-free diet, he stopped forming calculi
  and has had no surgeries related to kidney calculi since. Hyperoxaluria was not
  identified in this child by 24-hour urine analysis, unlike most other reports of
  kidney calculus formation in individuals with gluten intolerance.
