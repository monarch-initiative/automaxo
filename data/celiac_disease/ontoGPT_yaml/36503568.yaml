input_text: 'Malignant complications of celiac disease: a case series and review of
  the literature. BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered
  by gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. Diagnosis is based on evaluating
  specific autoantibodies and histopathologic findings of duodenal biopsy specimens.
  The only therapy for celiac disease is a gluten-free diet. Celiac disease can be
  complicated by malnutrition, other autoimmune diseases, refractoriness to treatment,
  and gastrointestinal tumors. This article presents seven cases of malignancies in
  patients with celiac disease. Its objective is to raise awareness of the malignant
  complications of celiac disease, leading to earlier diagnosis and improved outcomes.
  CASE PRESENTATION: Seven cases of malignant complications of celiac disease occurred
  among 190 patients followed at the Department of Internal Medicine and Gastroenterology,
  University Hospital Brno from 2014 to 2021. We describe these cases and the presentation,
  diagnostic process, course, management, and outcomes for each, along with proposed
  potential risk factors of malignant complications. There was one Caucasian man who
  was 70 years old and six Caucasian women who were 36, 46, 48, 55, 73, and 82 years
  old in our cohort. Of the seven cases of malignancies in our cohort, four patients
  were diagnosed with small bowel adenocarcinoma, one with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,
  one with carcinoma of the tongue, and one with colorectal carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS:
  Malignancies occurred in 3.7% of patients followed up for celiac disease. Awareness
  of the malignant complications of celiac disease, risk factors, presentation, and
  disease course could lead to earlier diagnosis and improved outcomes.'
