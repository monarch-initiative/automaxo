input_text: Porto-pulmonary hypertension exacerbated by platelet transfusion in a
  patient with ADAMTS13 deficiency. We propose that porto-pulmonary hypertension (PPH)
  may arise as a consequence of deficiency of ADAMTS13 (a plasma metalloprotease that
  regulates von Willebrand factor size and reduces its platelet adhesive activity)
  and provide a clinical case history to support our hypothesis. A patient with non-cirrhotic
  intrahepatic portal hypertension (NCIPH), ulcerative colitis and celiac disease
  developed symptoms of PPH, which had advanced beyond levels which would have made
  her an eligible candidate for liver transplantation (mean pulmonary artery pressure
  (PAP) 49 mm Hg). She was known to have severe ADAMTS13 deficiency, which we considered
  to be causative of, or contributory to her NCIPH. We postulated that increasing
  porto-systemic shunting associated with advancing portal hypertension would make
  the next encountered vascular bed, the lung, susceptible to the pathogenic process
  that was previously confined to the portal system, with pulmonary hypertension as
  its consequence. Her pulmonary artery pressures fell significantly during the next
  year on weekly replacement of plasma ADAMTS13 by infusions of fresh frozen plasma
  and conventional drug treatment of her pulmonary hypertension. Her pulmonary artery
  pressures had fallen to acceptable levels when, in response to platelet infusion,
  it rose precipitously and dangerously. The sequence strongly supports our hypothesis
  that PPH is a consequence of ADAMTS13 deficiency and is caused by platelet deposition
  in afferent pulmonary vessels.
