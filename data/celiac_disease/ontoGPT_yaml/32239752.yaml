input_text: "Thiol-disulfide homeostasis in children with celiac disease. BACKGROUND:
  Toxic gliadin peptide damages enterocytes in celiac disease by causing oxidative
  stress. Thiols are organic compounds that defend against oxidative stress. This
  study aimed to investigate the changes in thiol-disulfide homeostasis in children
  with celiac disease. METHODS: The study included patients with celiac disease, children
  diagnosed with functional gastrointestinal disorders, and healthy children. Patients'
  serum native and total thiol-disulfide amounts, disulfide/total thiol percentage
  ratios, disulfide / native thiol percentage ratios, and native thiol/total thiol
  percentage ratios were measured. RESULTS: The study involved 172 children, of whom
  90 (52.3%) were girls. The mean participant age was 8.6 +- 4.2 years. A total of
  59 (34.3%) children had celiac disease, 56 (32.6%) had functional gastrointestinal
  disorders, and 57 (33.1%) were healthy. The total thiol and disulfide levels of
  patients with celiac disease (305 +- 87 mumol/L and 25 +- 15 mumol/L, respectively)
  were significantly lower than those of healthy children (349 +- 82 mumol/L and 40
  +- 15 mumol/L, respectively) (P = 0.006 and P < 0.001, respectively). Native and
  total thiol levels (226 +- 85 mumol/L and 279 +- 99 mumol/L, respectively) in patients
  with celiac disease who consumed a gluten-containing diet were significantly lower
  than those of patients who consumed a gluten-free diet (278 +- 64 mumol/L and 327
  +- 69 mumol/L, respectively) (P = 0.017 and P = 0.041, respectively). CONCLUSIONS:
  Thiol-disulfide homeostasis, an important antioxidant defense component of the gastrointestinal
  system, is disrupted in children with celiac disease. A gluten-free diet helped
  partially ameliorate this decline."
