input_text: The emerging paradigm of Unconventional T cells as a novel therapeutic
  target for celiac disease. Celiac disease (CD) is an organ-specific autoimmune disorder
  that occurs in genetically predisposed individuals when exposed to exogenous dietary
  gluten. This exposure to wheat gluten and related proteins from rye and barley triggers
  an immune response which leads to the development of enteropathy associated with
  symptoms of bloating, diarrhea, or malabsorption. The sole current treatment is
  to follow a gluten-free diet for the rest of one's life. Intestinal barriers are
  enriched with Unconventional T cells such as iNKT, MAIT, and gammadelta T cells,
  which lack or express only a limited range of rearranged antigen receptors. Unconventional
  T cells play a crucial role in regulating mucosal barrier function and microbial
  colonization. Unconventional T cell populations are widely represented in diseased
  conditions, where changes in disease activity related to iNKT and MAIT cell reduction,
  as well as gammadelta T cell expansion, are demonstrated. In this review, we discuss
  the role and potential employment of Unconventional T cells as a therapeutic target
  in the pathophysiology of celiac disease.
