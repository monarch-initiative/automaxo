input_text: '[Successful therapy for enteropathy-associated peripheral T-cell lymphoma
  using high-dose polychemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation].
  Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL) is a rare disease that accounts for
  not more than 1.4% of all lymphomas. It is most common in Europe, followed by North
  America and Asia. The disease is associated with gluten-sensitive celiac disease
  in 50% of cases and divided into types I and II. Mean-dose CHOP-like therapy is
  ineffective, with a median overall survival of 7-10 months. With high-dose therapy,
  5-year survival rates can be 60%, but it can be used in not more than half of the
  cases. This is associated with the serious somatic status of most patients at diagnosis
  and with a median age of 57-64 years. The article presents a literature review and
  a case of successful therapy in a 58-year-old patient with type I EATL using the
  mNHL-BFM-90 protocol and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.'
