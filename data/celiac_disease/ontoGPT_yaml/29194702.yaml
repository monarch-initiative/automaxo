input_text: The role of TMPRSS6 and HFE variants in iron deficiency anemia in celiac
  disease. We investigated the role of HFE C282Y, H63D, and TMPRSS6 A736V variants
  in the pathogenesis of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in celiac disease (CD) patients,
  at diagnosis and after 1 year of gluten-free diet (GFD). Demographic and clinical
  features were prospectively recorded for all CD patients between 2013 and 2017.
  C282Y, H63D, and A736V variants were evaluated for CD patients and controls. Finally,
  505 consecutive CD patients and 539 age-matched control subjects were enrolled.
  At diagnosis, 229 CD subjects had IDA (45.3%), with a subgroup of anemic patients
  (45.4%) presented persistent IDA at follow-up. C282Y allele frequency was significantly
  increased in CD compared with controls (1.1% vs 0.2%, P = .001), whereas H63D and
  A736V allele frequencies were similar among patients and controls (P = .92 and .84,
  respectively). At diagnosis, C282Y variant in anemic CD patients was significantly
  increased compared to nonanemic group (2% and 0.5%, P = .04). At follow-up, A736V
  was significantly increased in IDA persistent than in IDA not persistent (57.7%
  vs 35.2%, P < .0001). CD patients with H63D mutation showed higher Hb, MCV, serum
  iron, and ferritin levels than subjects without HFE mutations. Decreased hepcidin
  values were observed in anemic compared to nonanemic subjects at follow-up (1.22
  +- 1.14 vs 2.08 +- 2.15, P < .001). This study suggests a protective role of HFE
  in IDA CD patients and confirms the role of TMPRSS6 in predicting oral iron response
  modulating hepcidin action on iron absorption. Iron supplementation therapeutic
  management in CD could depend on TMPRSS6 genotype that could predict persistent
  IDA despite iron supplementation and GFD.
