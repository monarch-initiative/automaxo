input_text: 'Outcome in pediatric celiac disease is independent of the diagnostic
  approach in patients with high antibody levels. OBJECTIVES: European Society for
  Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition guidelines enable the diagnosis
  of celiac disease (CD) without biopsies in patients with immunoglobulin A (IgA)-antibodies
  against tissue transglutaminase (TGA-IgA) >= 10x the upper limit of normal (ULN)
  and positivity of endomysial antibodies in a second blood sample. Limited data exist
  comparing the biopsy versus the nonbiopsy diagnostic approach regarding long-term
  outcomes in CD patients. Our study aimed to investigate the influence of the diagnostic
  approach on adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD), serological remission (defined
  as normalization of TGA-IgA during follow-up (FU)) and clinical remission in CD
  patients with TGA-IgA >= 10x ULN. METHODS: Retrospective multicenter study. Patients
  with CD and TGA-IgA >= 10x ULN at diagnosis were included in the study. Patients
  with confirmed diagnosis by biopsy were compared to patients diagnosed by nonbiopsy
  approach using univariate analysis, Kaplan-Meier survival curve, and logistic regression
  models. RESULTS: A total of 282 CD patients (192 [68.1%] in the biopsy group; 90
  [31.9%] in the nonbiopsy group) were analyzed. The median time to normalization
  of TGA-IgA was 16.5 months [interquartile range, IQR: 13, 28] in the biopsy and
  15 months [IQR: 12, 26] in the nonbiopsy group; p = 0.14). Rates of normalized TGA-IgA
  at first to third-year FU were comparable between both groups. Adherence to GFD
  did not seem to be influenced by the diagnostic approach. CONCLUSIONS: The nonbiopsy
  approach is not inferior to the biopsy approach in terms of adherence to GFD and
  serological remission in patients with CD.'
