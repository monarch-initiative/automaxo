input_text: IgA Nephropathy as the Initial Presentation of Celiac Disease in an Adolescent.
  Immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy (Berger's disease) is the most common glomerulonephritis
  worldwide. The disease typically is chronic and lifelong and eventually progresses
  to impaired renal function in a substantial proportion of cases. It has been known
  for some time that there is a correlation between IgA nephropathy and celiac disease,
  but until now it has remained unclear whether treatment of the underlying celiac
  disease has any meaningful impact on the progression of the renal disease. Therefore,
  until now, screening for celiac disease in patients presenting with IgA nephropathy
  has not been universally recommended in the absence of suggestive gastrointestinal
  symptoms. This report describes a case of IgA nephropathy in an adolescent boy that
  turned out to be the initial presentation of celiac disease. More importantly, it
  documents the complete laboratory normalization of his renal anomalies at 5-year
  follow-up after treatment of his celiac disease with implementation of a gluten-free
  diet. This case highlights the importance of awareness that suspected IgA nephropathy,
  even in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms, should prompt screening for underlying
  celiac disease as a potential, and possibly treatable, cause.
