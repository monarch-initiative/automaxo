input_text: 'Refractory celiac disease. Refractory celiac disease (RCD) affects patients
  who have failed to heal after 6-12 months of a strict gluten-free diet (GFD) and
  when other causes of symptoms (including malignancy) have been ruled out. It may
  also occur in patients who previously had responded to a long-term GFD. RCD may
  be categorized as RCD1 (normal immunophenotype) and RCD2 (aberrant immunophenotype).
  RCD1 usually responds to a continued GFD, nutritional support, and therapeutic agents
  such as corticosteroids. In contrast, clinical response in RCD2 is incomplete and
  prognosis is often poor. RCD (particularly RCD2) is associated with serious complications,
  such as ulcerative jejunitis and enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL).
  Strict clinical and laboratory criteria should be used to diagnose RCD and specialized
  tests for aberrancy and clonality should be interpreted in the context of their
  sensitivity and specificity. Adequate nutritional support and anti-inflammatory
  treatment may even allow patients with RCD2 to attain a clinical remission. '
