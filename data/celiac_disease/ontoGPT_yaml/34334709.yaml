input_text: "Self-reported nonceliac wheat sensitivity in an outpatient digestive
  endoscopy center: high frequency but insufficient medical approach. OBJECTIVE: 'Self-reported
  wheat sensitivity' (SRWS) is a self-reported condition caused by wheat ingestion
  in the absence of celiac disease or wheat allergy. The aim of the study was to investigate
  the frequency and characteristics of SRWS in outpatients referred for digestive
  endoscopy. METHODS: The study, performed at the University of Palermo, enrolled
  496 outpatients. RESULTS: Seven individuals (1.4%) had an already established diagnosis
  of celiac disease. The questionnaire was administered to the other 489 individuals:
  98 subjects (20%) were SRWS, the remaining 391 served as controls (i.e. not-SRWS).
  SRWS patients were younger (P < 0.001), with a higher percentage of females (P =
  0.002) than not-SRWS. 'gastroesophageal reflux disease and ulcer-like dyspepsia'
  and 'chronic unexplained diarrhea' were more frequently the reasons for the endoscopy
  study in SRWS than in not-SRWS (P = 0.002, and P = 0.05, respectively). Food allergies/intolerances
  (P = 0.04), milk allergy/intolerance (P = 0.0001), GERD (P = 0.0001), IBS (0.0001),
  anxiety (P = 0.005) and depression (P = 0.04) were the previous medical diagnoses
  reported more frequently in SRWS patients than in not-SRWS. In the SRWS group, 38%
  of the patients had already undergone previous upper endoscopy and 24% colonoscopy.
  After these investigations, 58% of SRWS patients received no diagnosis, and the
  other 42% were informed that they 'were not suffering from celiac disease or wheat
  allergy'. Finally, 28.6% SRWS patients had followed a gluten-free diet (GFD), and
  71.4% of them referred being asymptomatic on GFD. CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed a
  high frequency of SRWS in outpatients referred to a digestive endoscopy center and
  a lack of medical accuracy in identifying a possible gluten-related disease. REGISTRATION:
  The study was registered on Clinicaltrials.gov (registration number: NCT04154137),
  accessible at: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04154137?term=non+celiac+wheat&draw=2&rank=1."
