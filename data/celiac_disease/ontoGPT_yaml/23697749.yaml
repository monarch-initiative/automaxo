input_text: 'An excess of prior irritable bowel syndrome diagnoses or treatments in
  Celiac disease: evidence of diagnostic delay. OBJECTIVE: It is recognized that celiac
  disease can present with symptoms characteristic of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
  and that a substantial proportion of patients referred to gastroenterologists with
  these symptoms may have celiac disease. The authors set out to discover how commonly
  those suffering with celiac disease are misdiagnosed as suffering from IBS and whether
  such misdiagnosis delays the correct diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case control
  study using computerized records from the General Practice Research Database was
  conducted. The authors compared the proportion of patients with celiac disease who
  had a diagnosis of or had undergone treatment for IBS over a variety of time periods
  before the diagnosis of celiac disease with the proportion of a matched group without
  celiac disease who were similarly diagnosed or treated. RESULTS: It was found that
  16% of celiac patients had such a prior diagnosis compared to 4.9% of controls (a
  threefold increased risk of prior IBS; OR = 3.8, 95% CI: 3.6-4.2), and that if one
  looked at typical treatment for IBS rather than diagnostic codes, 28% of celiac
  patients appeared to have been treated compared to 9% of controls. Many of the diagnoses
  of IBS occurred within the last year before diagnosis of celiac disease, but there
  was a clear excess of IBS even 10 years earlier. CONCLUSIONS: In contemporary UK
  practice, it is likely that at least some patients with celiac disease spend many
  years being treated as having IBS. Following guidelines to test serologically for
  celiac disease will minimize this problem.'
