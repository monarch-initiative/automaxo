input_text: Novel approaches for enzymatic gluten degradation to create high-quality
  gluten-free products. Celiac disease (CD), a chronic enteropathy of the small intestine
  caused by ingestion of gluten, is one of the most prevalent food hypersensitivities
  worldwide. The essential treatment is a strict lifelong gluten-free diet based on
  the avoidance of gluten-containing products from wheat, rye, barley and, in rare
  cases, oats. Products made from naturally gluten-free raw materials often have inferior
  nutritional, textural and sensory properties compared to the corresponding gluten-containing
  products. Therefore, the incorporation of wheat, rye and barley flours after efficient
  removal of the harmful component gluten into gluten-free products would be beneficial.
  Gluten modification resulting in decreased CD-immunoreactivity may be achieved via
  the formation of crosslinks using microbial transglutaminase. To effectively eliminate
  CD-immunoreactivity, plant, fungal, bacterial, animal or engineered peptidases are
  capable of degrading gluten proteins and peptides into harmless fragments. The application
  of peptidases from germinated cereal grains, fungal peptidases and/or lactic acid
  bacteria during food processing yielded high-quality sourdough wheat breads, pasta,
  wheat starch and bran, rye products and beer, all with gluten contents below the
  Codex Alimentarius threshold of 20mg/kg for gluten-free products. As with all gluten-free
  products, the legislative compliance of such treated materials needs to be monitored
  closely. Provided that all safety requirements are met, gluten-containing raw materials
  treated in an adequate way to remove CD-active gluten fragments may be used together
  with naturally gluten-free ingredients to create an extended choice of high-quality
  gluten-free products.
