input_text: 'Tooth Wear Is Frequent in Adult Patients with Celiac Disease. (1) Background:
  Celiac disease (CD) patients can be affected by mouth and tooth disorders, which
  are influenced by their gluten-free diet. The aim of our research was to evaluate
  the pathological conditions of the stomatognathic system observed in celiac patients
  on a gluten-free diet. (2) Methods: we consecutively recruited celiac patients on
  a gluten-free diet at our celiac center, as well as healthy volunteers. Two dentists
  examined all patients/controls and checked them for any mouth disorder. (3) Results:
  Forty-nine patients affected by celiac disease (age at test 31.8 +- 11.58, time
  on GFD 8.73 +- 7.7) and 51 healthy volunteers (age at test 30.5 +- 8.7) were included.
  Recurrent aphthous stomatitis was reported in 26 patients (53.0%) and in 13 (25.5%)
  controls (p = 0.005). Dental enamel disorders were reported in 7 patients (14.3%)
  and in 0 controls (p = 0.002), with none having geographic tongue. We found non-specific
  tooth wear, characterized by loss of the mineralized tissue of the teeth, in 9 patients
  (18.3%) and in 3 (5.9%) controls (p = 0.05). (4) Conclusion: Recurrent aphthous
  stomatitis and enamel hypoplasia are "risk indicators" that may suggest that an
  individual has CD. We detected a high prevalence of non-specific tooth wear that
  can be caused by several factors such as malocclusion, sleep bruxism, parafunctional
  activity, and age.'
