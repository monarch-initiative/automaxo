input_text: 'Seronegative Celiac Disease in Patients with Isolated Refractory Dyspepsia
  and Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease. Background/Aims: To investigate the presence
  of seronegative celiac disease in patients with isolated refractory dyspepsia and
  gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)-related complaints. Methods: This was a single-center,
  prospective study performed at a tertiary care referral hospital. Among 968 consecutive
  patients, 129 seronegative patients with tissue damage consistent with Marsh IIIa
  classification or above were included. The patients were divided into two groups:
  dyspepsia (n=78) and GERD (n=51). Biopsies were taken from the duodenum regardless
  of endoscopic appearance, and patients with Marsh IIIa or above damage were advised
  to consume a gluten-free diet. The Glasgow Dyspepsia Severity (GDS) score, Reflux
  Symptom Index (RSI), and Biagi score were calculated at baseline and every 3 months.
  Control endoscopy was performed every 6 months during follow-up. Results: The median
  follow-up time was 19.9 months (range, 6 to 24 months) in the dyspepsia group and
  19.2 months (range, 6 to 24 months) in the GERD group. All the patients were positive
  for the HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 haplotypes. The differences between the mean GDS scores
  (14.3+-2.1 vs 1.1+-0.2, respectively, p<0.05), RSI scores (6.3+-0.8 vs 0.7+-0.1,
  respectively, p<0.05), and Biagi scores (3.1+-0.4 vs 0.7+-0.3 in the dyspepsia group
  and 2.5+-0.4 vs 0.5+-0.2 in GERD group) before and after implementation of the gluten-free
  diet were statistically significant. The decreases in the scores were consistent
  with improvements in the histological findings. There was no significant correlation
  between endoscopic appearance and histological examination results (p=0.487). Conclusions:
  Seronegative celiac disease may be considered in this group of patients. Even if
  a patient is seronegative and has normal endoscopic findings, duodenal biopsy should
  be considered.'
