input_text: 'Celiac disease: clinical update. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review highlights
  literature from the past year and explores the impact on current understanding of
  celiac disease pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management. RECENT FINDINGS: In contrast
  to earlier clinical trials, recent data suggests that early gluten introduction
  may protect against the development of celiac disease. Celiac disease is underdiagnosed,
  associated with high burden of disease and linked to excess mortality risk, yet,
  there remains considerable uncertainty regarding the utility of mass screening in
  asymptomatic individuals. The gut microbiome is increasingly implicated in celiac
  disease pathogenesis, although the exact mechanism is undefined. Probiotics have
  been proposed as a disease-modifying option for celiac disease but most studies
  assessing efficacy are of low-quality. Patients with celiac disease do not appear
  to be at increased risk of contracting or developing adverse outcomes from COVID-19.
  Little is known about the pathogenesis of nonceliac gluten sensitivity; however,
  recent findings suggest an autoimmune basis for the condition. SUMMARY: Current
  understanding of celiac disease continues to advance, though significant knowledge
  gaps remain. Large, rigorous, prospectively designed studies are needed to further
  characterize celiac disease pathogenesis, management and therapeutic options.'
