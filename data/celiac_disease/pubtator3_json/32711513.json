METHODS: Coeliac children, aged 8-18, who are members of the Madrid Coeliac Association (MCA) and their parents, answered the Spanish version of the CDDUX and KIDSCREEN-52 questionnaires via e-mail. CDDUX was answered by 266 children and 428 parents and KIDSCREEN-52 by 255 children and 387 parents. Linear regression models were fitted to evaluate the association of demographic and clinical factors with HRQOL scores. CDDUX scores were compared with the subjective perception of health status assessed by the first question of KIDSCREEN-52. The correlation between the questionnaires was analysed. RESULTS: We found that the main factors that negatively affected HRQOL were having social or economic difficulties associated with following the diet and having transgression-related symptoms. The maximum correlation between the questionnaires was 0.309 and - 0.254 in parents and children respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is a poor correlation between the two questionnaires, both agreed that the main concerns of the respondents were related to the social and economic difficulties of following the diet. It would be interesting to use both types of questionnaires in order to perform a more complete assessment of HRQOL in coeliac children. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Not applicable.",
