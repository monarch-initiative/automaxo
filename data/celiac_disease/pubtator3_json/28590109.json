The onlyknown treatment consists of a permanent adherence to a strictgluten-free diet, which represents an important challenge forpatients. Objective. To describe the gluten-free processedfood offer in food locals from 3 neighborhoods representativeof high, middle and low economic status in Buenos Aires,Argentina. METHODS: Cross-sectional study. Specially trainedmonitors performed a standardized direct assessment offood locals. Whenever direct observation was not possible,we interviewed the personnel as an indirect assessment. Weclassified dish offer in different categories, and evaluated theprocesses of food elaboration, storage and distribution. RESULTS: We included 112 food locals. Results for neighborhoodsrepresentative of high, middle and low economic status were,respectively: no gluten free dish available in 27.5% (45/62),27.0% (27/37) and 30.8% (9/13), (p = 0.96); adequateelaboration in 17.7%, 13.5% and 7.7%, (p = 0.61); appropriate food storage in 12.9% (8), 13.5% (5) and 7.7%(1); (p = 0.85); adequate distribution in 8.1%, 8.1% and0% (0), (p = 0.56). Conclusion. In 1 out of 4 food localsthere was not even one gluten free dish. In addition, therewas a lack of compliance with safety measures to avoid glutencross-contamination.",
