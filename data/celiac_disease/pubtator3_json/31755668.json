Complementary feeding is the period of time when infants introduce food different from milk in their diet, together with a gradual reduction of the intake of milk (either breast milk or formula), to finally acquire the diet model of their family. This period is important in the transition of the infant from milk feeding to family foods, and is necessary for both nutritional and developmental reasons. The timing for introducing complementary foods and the method of feeding have changed over time. Available literature data show increasing interest and concerns about the impact of complementary feeding timing and modality on the onset of later non-communicable disorders, such as overweight and obesity, allergic diseases, celiac disease, or diabetes. While international scientific guidelines on complementary feeding have been published, many baby food companies' websites, blogs, and books, in most European countries exist. The aim of this manuscript is to look over current recommendations, and to revise \"old myths.\" The adoption of an adequate weaning method is a cornerstone in the development of life-long health status. A correct strategy could reduce the risk of feeding disorders and other health problems later in life.",
