The results of 1162 samples of patients diagnosed with CD showed that 8.3% of individuals who have a combined score of less than 13 exhibited excellent or very good adherence to the GFD. Furthermore, moderate and fair to poor adherence to the GFD was demonstrated, respectively and 71.9% of the patients had poor HRQoL levels. A significant and moderate positive correlation between FI and GFD adherence (r = 0.489) was found, indicating that 24% of the variance in FI is shared with GFD adherence. The patients' gender, marital status, and monthly income made statistically significant contributions to the prediction (p < 0.05). Females had significantly lower HRQoL scores than males (B = -4.619, 95% CL: -6.08, -3.16) after holding all other variables constant. In conclusion, FI is mediated by GFD adherence to HRQoL. Moreover, a significant total effect relation was found between HRQoL and both FI and GFD adherence, suggesting that lowering symptoms and complications associated with CD may reduce the impact of FI on HRQoL.",
