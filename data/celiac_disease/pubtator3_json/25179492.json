A common method used to analyze localized secretions is lavage. The flow of fluid over the lining of a cavity picks up both cells and soluble factors, and the effluent can be collected for study. Gastrointestinal (GI) lavage is easily and noninvasively performed by the administration of gut lavage solutions such as those routinely given to patients prior to colonoscopy, with GI lavage fluid being the copious, watery rectal effluent subsequently induced. Residual effluent is currently suctioned from the colon and discarded during colonoscopy. With millions of routine colonoscopies performed per year, GI lavage fluid is a rich and largely untapped resource for basic and clinical research. Rectal effluent can also be easily collected in a toilet receptacle without need for a colonoscopy. Rectal effluent generated in this manner has been used to study diarrheal disease, mucosal immunology, inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, and cancer. It is often referred to as gut lavage, colon lavage, GI lavage, or whole gut lavage fluid, which makes it challenging to locate previous studies in the literature and there are currently no comprehensive reviews of its use as a research tool. This review attempts to fill this void by discussing previous applications of rectal effluent in research and the methods that have been developed for its collection, stabilization, and analysis. ",
