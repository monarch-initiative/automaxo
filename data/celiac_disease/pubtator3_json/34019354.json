Relevant adjustment of the diet enables to reduce the risk of the celiac syndrome. Balanced nutrient composition of diet is necessary for the harmonious growth and development of a child. The aim of the research was to develop specialized diet for children with gluten intolerance and celiac desease in municipal preschool educational institutions. Material and methods. A study of the 10-days full-day menu of children aged 3 to 7 years was carried out. To compose the specialized menu, we used the computational program \"MDOU Calculate menu. Universal program for kindergarten\". Technological maps of dishes in municipal preschool educational institutions were used. The calculation of the supply of the diet with vitamins, minerals and trace elements and the deviation of the nutritional and energy value of the diet from the recommended daily intake was made. Results. The necessity of developing a specialized diet for children 3-7 years old with a confirmed diagnosis of celiac disease, as well as for children on a gluten-free diet has been substantiated. A specialized daily food ration has been developed, consisting of four meals. Analysis of the nutritional and energy value of the dishes offered in the menu showed the minimum deviation of the obtained indicators from recommended daily intake. The necessity of introducing the developed diet into the system of specialized nutrition in preschool educational institutions has been substantiated. Conclusion. The results of the work indicate that under the conditions of state funding, there is a possibility of adjusting the existing food rations for the full-fledged socialization of children with various diseases.",
