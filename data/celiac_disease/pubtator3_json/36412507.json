                    "text": "Purpose: When admitted to the hospital, individuals with celiac disease rely on food handlers for provision of safe, uncontaminated gluten-free meals. We aimed to assess the knowledge of gluten-free diet (GFD) amongst individuals involved in meal preparation for patients.Methods: A questionnaire with 10 demographic and 35 test items to assess knowledge of GFD, including workplace scenarios encountered in meal preparation, was administered to food handlers including cooks, utility workers, dietary technicians, and supervisors in 2 tertiary care, university-affiliated hospitals. A score of >=28 of 35 (>=80%) was considered a \"pass\".Results: A total of 72 individuals completed the study, mean age 40.3 +- 1.6 years, 75% female. Only 42 (56.8%) scored >=80% and achieved a pass. The average score was 75.9% +- 13.4%, range 25.7%-100%. The supervisors had significantly higher scores (87.9% +- 11.4%) than utility workers (73.0% +- 11.4%; P = 0.01) and cooks (71.7% +- 14.5%; P = 0.01). Cooks had the lowest scores with 80% scoring <80%. Females scored higher than males (77.8% vs. 68.8%; P = 0.02).Conclusions: There are significant differences in GFD knowledge amongst various groups involved in food preparation in hospitals. The gaps identified in knowledge can potentially compromise the safety of patients with celiac disease. Targeted interventions to educate hospital food handlers about GFD are warranted. Registered Dietitians can play an important role in providing this education.",
