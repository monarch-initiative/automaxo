Several studies have demonstrated that without proper dietary assessment, this diet leads to nutritional deficiencies and/or imbalances. The present study aimed to improve the dietary habits of newly diagnosed children with CD through ongoing and face-to-face dietary counseling. Forty-three participants were followed during the first year after CD diagnosis. Dietary data were collected at diagnosis (Vt0), after 3 months on a GFD (Vt3), and after 1 year following a GFD (Vt12). Participants completed a 3-day 24-h food recall, a food frequency questionnaire, and the KIDMED index. After each data collection, participants received dietary assessment and nutritional education. Participants consumed more plant-origin foods after the intervention, with most of them reaching the daily recommendations. Fresh food intake increased and that of ultra-processed foods decreased. Compliance with the Mediterranean diet also improved. Personalized dietary assessment and ongoing follow-up improved the dietary patterns of children recently diagnosed with CD, highlighting the importance of dietitian involvement in the management of CD.",
