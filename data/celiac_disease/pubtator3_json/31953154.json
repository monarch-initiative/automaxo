An electronic literature search of four databases (Cochrane Database for systematic reviews, CINAHL, Embase, and Ovid MEDLINE) was conducted to identify articles examining nutrition care in CD individuals. Except for narrative review, grey literature, and case study/report, all types of peer-reviewed articles published between January 2007 and August 2018 were eligible. There were a total of 10,823 records; 10,368 were excluded during the first round of screening due to irrelevancy and/or duplication. Of the 455 full-text articles that were assessed, 292 met the criteria and were included. Most of the studies were observational studies (n=212), followed by experimental trials (n=50), evidence-based practice guideline (EBPG)/report/statement (n=16), and systematic review (SR) (n=14). Nine original studies examined assessment, focusing mainly on different tools/ways to assess GFD adherence. The majority of the included original articles (n=235) were in the nutrition intervention category with GFD, oats, and prebiotics/probiotics as the top-three most studied interventions. There were eight SRs on GFD and five on oats. One SR and 21 original studies investigated the effectiveness of different measures to monitor GFD adherence/compliance. Although recent CD EBPGs were identified, different methods with varying levels of rigor, in terms of literature search and assessment of evidence strength, were used. Based on this scoping review, interventions focused on gluten-free diet and oats have been significantly covered by either SRs or EBPGs. Studies related to prebiotics/probiotics and education program/counseling focused interventions, as well as assessment, in CD patients have increased in recent years. Thus, it might be beneficial to conduct SRs/EBPGs focused on these topics to guide practitioners.",
