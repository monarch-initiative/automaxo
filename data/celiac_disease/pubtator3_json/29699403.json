METHODS: prospective multi-center double blind study of 225 children that were followed up from birth. All cases were HLA-DQ2/HLA-DQ8 positive with a 1st degree relative with celiac disease and were followed up in three centers from Madrid, Reus and Valencia. Gluten intake was determined between four and ten months according to the protocol. Gluten intake was ad libitum between eleven and 36 months and was prospectively quantified by means of dietary records. Clinical visits and specific antibody analysis for celiac disease were performed periodically. RESULTS: twenty-six cases were diagnosed, all had a positive biopsy and serology; 21 had gastrointestinal symptoms and five were asymptomatic. In addition, 2,565 food records were analyzed and statistically significant differences (p < 0.001) were found with regard to gluten consumption among the three centers, although not between celiac and non-celiac children (p = 0.025). The HLA-DQ2.5/DQ2.5 and DQ2.5/DQ2.2 genotypes had a relative risk of 4.7 (95% CI: 0.80-27.55; p = 0.08), which was higher than for the rest of genotypes. Female gender also had a relative risk that was five times higher than that for males. CONCLUSIONS: the amount of gluten intake between 11 and 36 months or the duration of breast feeding were not risk factors for the development of CD in the Spanish population. The HLA genotype and gender were the most relevant associated factors. In this at-risk group, the disease presented before two years of age in the majority of the cases with a weak clinical expression.",
