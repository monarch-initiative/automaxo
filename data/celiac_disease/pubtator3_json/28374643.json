Areas covered: In order to evaluate the literature with respect to burden associated with celiac disease in the U.S. and identify any knowledge gaps, we performed a literature review of journal articles published between 2000-2016. We note that celiac disease is a prevalent condition associated with a significant burden of disease through its impact on morbidity, quality of life, as well as through increased costs associated with its diagnosis and management. At the same time, knowledge gaps exist in our understanding of the precise epidemiologic burden in the U.S.; the trade-offs between burden and benefit of a gluten-free diet; and better estimation of the costs of diagnosis, treatment and management.Expert commentary: Additional research is necessary to better understand these gaps to be able to reduce burden of celiac disease, particularly the impact on health-related quality of life and the costs associated with inaccurate or delayed diagnoses and insufficient treatment of disease.",
