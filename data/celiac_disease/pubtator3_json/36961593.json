MATERIALS AND METHODS: Previously and recently diagnosed groups were formed from children with CD, aged 4 to 15 years. A questionnaire was completed about the children's dental history and nutritional and oral hygiene habits. All the children underwent an oral examination, and dmft-DMFT indices were determined. Dental plaque status, periodontal health, and dental enamel defects were recorded. Oral soft tissues were examined for the presence of lesions. Unstimulated salivary flow rate and pH value were evaluated. RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was determined between the previously and recently diagnosed patients in terms of toothpaste preference (p=0.003), frequency of going to the dentist (p=0.039), and the types of dental treatment they had received (p=0.001). A statistically significant difference was determined between the previously and recently diagnosed patient groups in terms of dmft values (p=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Children with CD should be directed to a pediatric dentist to improve oral and dental health, relieve the symptoms of oral mucosal lesions, be informed about enamel defects, and be encouraged to use gluten-free oral care products. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The collaboration of pediatric gastroenterologists and pediatric dentists can prevent the progression of oral symptoms in children with CD and eliminate long-term complications in terms of both oral health and multisystemic problems.",
