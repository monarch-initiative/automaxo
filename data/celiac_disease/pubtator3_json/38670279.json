Challenges to developing and evaluating better biomarkers include significant interindividual variability-related to immune amplification of gluten exposure and how effects of immune activation are manifest. Furthermore, the current \"gold standard\" for assessment of end-organ damage, small intestinal biopsy, is itself highly imperfect, such that a marker that is a better reflection of the \"ground truth\" may indeed appear to perform poorly. The goal of this review was to analyze past and present efforts to establish robust noninvasive tools for monitoring treated patients with celiac disease and to highlight emerging tools that may prove to be useful in clinical practice.",
