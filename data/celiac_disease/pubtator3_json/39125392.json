Limited education about the disease and a GFD is an attributing factor to inadequate adherence. Thus, our aim was to assess the current knowledge about a GFD and the clinical monitoring of adherence to the diet among CeD people and HCPs. Specific questionnaires were designed and distributed to assess the knowledge of CeD people (Q1 questionnaire) (n = 2437) and to analyze the follow-up of the disease from the perspective of patients (Q2 questionnaire) (n = 1294) and HCPs (Q3 questionnaire) (n = 346). Two-thirds of HCPs specialized in pediatric care, while one-third did so in adult care. In CeD people, general questions regarding food classification and cross-contamination are well understood. When patients have doubts, 51.4% reported using the Internet and social networks. Thus, it is crucial that resources like social media are reliable and provide valuable information. Q3 revealed the lack of time to follow up the diet after diagnosis (48% of HCPs allocate < 15 min), the interest in further training, and the need for a professional specialized in diets within the healthcare system. In conclusion, it is essential to enhance nutritional education to increase awareness of a GFD.",
