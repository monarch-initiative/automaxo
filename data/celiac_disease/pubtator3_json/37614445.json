Addressing the variables hampering attitudes might help direct appropriate patient advocacy and doctor-patient communication endeavors to encourage vaccination among celiac disease patients. The present investigation seeks to explore the coverage against vaccine-preventable diseases, vaccination attitudes, and related possible factors among celiac disease patients in the Pakistani setting. Methods: A self-reported online survey was conducted in Islamabad, Pakistan, for celiac disease patients aged 18 and above. The questionnaire was completed by 226 participants, with a response rate of 43.8%. The influencing variables for vaccination hesitancy were examined, and 95% confidence intervals for the crude and adjusted odds ratios were computed. Results: Among the study population, the majority were females, with a ratio of 75.66%. A prominent proportion of 69.03% was observed for influenza vaccination, while 39.82% were unable to recall all of the vaccinations they had previously received. Only 7% of the patients were considered to have a negative attitude toward vaccination, compared to an estimated 76% who were in favor of it. The significantly positive influencing factors observed toward vaccination were being well-educated (graduate, master, or above), possible recurrence of vaccine-preventable diseases with declining vaccination coverage (adjusted OR: 13.36), and increased confidence in vaccines from health care experts compared to electronic media (adjusted OR: 8.41). Contrarily, practicing complementary and alternative medicines (adjusted OR: 5.59), willingness to get vaccinated again in the future (adjusted OR: 15.59), and prior negative perspectives (adjusted OR: 1.01) were the determinants with a significant negative association. Discussion: In conclusion, the outcomes of the current work raise the possibility that health practitioners may be accountable for inappropriately prescribing vaccines to this demographic since 77% of the participants had a favorable attitude toward vaccination. These findings could serve as a springboard for creating targeted immunization efforts to raise vaccination coverage against vaccine-preventive diseases among celiac disease patients.",
