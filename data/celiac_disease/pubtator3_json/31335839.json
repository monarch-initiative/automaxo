Of them, 70 (78%) came to a 5-year follow-up where anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies 2 was tested and a questionnaire was filled in, including CDAT, which consists of 7 questions related to adherence. Nonparametrical tests were used to determine associations between adherence measures. RESULTS: Among the adolescents, 86% were adherent to a gluten-free diet 5 years after screening, 38% reported their general well being as excellent, 50% very well, and 12% well. Statistically significant associations were seen between anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies 2 and the CDAT score (P = 0.033), and the self-reported adherence question and the CDAT score (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The screening-detected adolescents reported a high level of well being and adherence to a gluten-free diet 5 years after screening. We conclude that the CDAT can be used in clinical practice as an estimation of adherence to a gluten-free diet. It would be most suitable to use in conjunction with currently used adherence measures, but can also be used as a stand-alone method when others are not accessible.",
