Other diets may be recommended for a short period of time to aid in symptom relief but may not be recommended for the long- term (eg, LFD). Popular diets continue to come and go with varying levels of success. When considering adolescents, continued growth and development are most important, and restrictive diets can lead to nutrient inadequacies and poor growth. Before making any recommendation, it is important to consider the goal of the diet and the cost versus benefits associated with following the diet. Adherence is always a challenge, regardless of the type of diet implemented. If a special diet is not warranted for the health, safety, and desired quality of life of the individual, it should not be implemented.",
