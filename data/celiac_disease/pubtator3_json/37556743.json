Patients with celiac disease are more careful about gluten cross-contamination in their homes than in restaurants.  Patients with celiac disease from South Brazil have adopted good eating habits with a balanced gluten-free diet.  Nutritional status improved after diagnosis of celiac disease according to body mass index. Background - Celiac disease is defined as a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the small intestine in genetically predisposed people, triggered by exposure to gluten. The only treatment for celiac disease to date is a lifelong gluten-free diet. Eating habits of celiacs play an important role in their nutritional status.Objective - To evaluate the eating habits and nutritional status of patients with celiac disease in Rio Grande do Sul.Methods - This is a cross-sectional study with patients diagnosed with celiac disease residing in Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil) over 18 years of age. An online questionnaire was applied with calls through social networks and also by the Associacao dos Celiacos do Brasil - Rio Grande do Sul Section. Sociodemographic data, history of celiac disease, general medical history, reported weight and height and food consumption data (SISVAN food frequency questionnaire and general questions) were collected. Results - The sample consisted of 142 individuals with a mean age of 39.75+-11.5 years, 94.4% were women and 93% were white. The patients showed care regarding a gluten-free diet, with the majority not ingesting gluten (82.2%) and being careful regarding cross-contamination by gluten in their homes (85.9%) and in restaurants (62, 4%). Most patients also had good eating habits, with frequent consumption of fruits, vegetables, meats, eggs and low frequency of processed foods and fats. Body weight before and after the diagnosis of celiac disease did not show significant changes (62.3+-13.8 versus 63.6+-11.7 kg; P=0.147); however, there was an improvement in the classification of nutritional status by body mass index (malnourished: 11.6% before versus 2.3% after; P=0.016). Conclusion - Most celiac disease patients in this study have good eating habits with a balanced gluten-free diet and improved nutritional status after diagnosis according to body mass index classification.",
