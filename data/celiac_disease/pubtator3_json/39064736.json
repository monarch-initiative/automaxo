                    "text": "BACKGROUND: The differential diagnosis between patients with celiac disease (CD) and non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is difficult when a gluten-free diet (GFD) has been initiated before the diagnostic work-up. Isolated increases in TCRgammadelta+ and celiac lymphogram (increased TCRgammadelta+ plus decreased CD3-) may enable differential diagnosis in this challenging clinical setting. This study evaluated: (1) the accuracy of %TCRgammadelta+ and celiac lymphogram for diagnosing CD before and after GFD and for differentiation with NCGS; (2) TCRgammadelta+ kinetics at baseline and after starting GFD in both CD and NCGS. METHODS: The inclusion criteria were patients with CD (n = 104), NCGS (n = 37), and healthy volunteers (n = 18). An intestinal biopsy for intraepithelial lymphogram by flow cytometry was performed at baseline and after GFD. The optimal cutoff for CD diagnostic accuracy was established by maximizing the Youden index and via logistic regression. RESULTS: %TCRgammadelta+ showed better diagnostic accuracy than celiac lymphogram for identifying CD before and after GFD initiation. With a cutoff > 13.31, the accuracy for diagnosing CD in patients under GFD was 0.88 [0.80-0.93], whereas the accuracy for diagnosing NCGS (%TCRgammadelta+ <= 13.31) was 0.84 [0.76-0.89]. The percentage of TCRgammadelta+ cells showed differential kinetics between CD (baseline 22.7% [IQR, 16.4-33.6] vs. after GFD 26.4% [IQR, 17.8-36.8]; p = 0.026) and NCGS (baseline 9.4% [IQR, 4.1-14.6] vs. after GFD 6.4% [IQR, 3.2-11]; p = 0.022). CONCLUSION: TCRgammadelta+ T cell assessment accurately diagnoses CD before and after a GFD. Increased TCRgammadelta+ was maintained in the long term after GFD in CD but not in NCGS. Altogether, this suggests the potential usefulness of this marker for the differential diagnosis of these two entities in patients on a GFD.",
