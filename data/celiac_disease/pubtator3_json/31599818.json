METHODS: Celiac children diagnosed between 2005 and 2016 at our centre were classified into 2 groups based on serum assay (ELISA vs CLIA) used for atTG monitoring, and were compared on percentage of decrease and time to normalization of atTG on GFD. RESULTS: Among 260 included children, the rate of normalization of atTG levels at 30 months' follow-up was 86% and 70% in ELISA and CLIA group, respectively (P < 0.01). Median time to normalization was 11.7 and 14.7 months in ELISA and CLIA group respectively (P = 0.003). Marsh score at diagnosis was not associated with time to atTG normalization (P = 0.770), whereas older age at diagnosis and higher baseline atTG predicted longer time to atTG normalization (P = 0.01, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The percentage and the time of the atTG normalization in celiac children on GFD should be interpreted according to the utilized assay: at 30 months' follow-up children tested by CLIA are less likely to normalize atTG levels compared to those tested by ELISA. Younger age at diagnosis and lower baseline atTG are predictors of earlier atTG normalization, regardless of the adopted assay.",
