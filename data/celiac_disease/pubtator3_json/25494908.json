The disorder has a very heterogeneous clinical and histopathological spectrum. Current treatment with a gluten-free diet is very effective, but the diet is difficult to maintain and remains costly. AREAS COVERED: Alternatives to the gluten-free diet have been proposed to either replace this current treatment, or at least, to supplement use of the gluten-free diet. Studies in the published English language literature relevant to this review were examined for this report. EXPERT OPINION: Most recent published double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials have focused on an orally administered recombinant glutenase (ALV003) showing significant but limited benefit to celiac disease patients already compliant with a gluten-free diet. Other studies have addressed other immune mechanisms that may play a role in its pathogenesis and have not been so positive. Added investigations, particularly over the long-term, in other larger and more heterogeneous populations are needed.",
