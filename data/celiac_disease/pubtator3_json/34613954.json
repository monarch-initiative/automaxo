The aim of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of urinary gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) determination to detect gluten contamination of the GFD. METHODS: In study A, 25 healthy adults on a standard GFD performed 6 gluten challenges (0, 10, 50, 100, 500, and 1,000 mg) with quantification of urinary GIP before (T0) and during the following 24 hours. In study B, 12 participants on a gluten contamination elimination diet underwent urinary GIP determination at T0 and after challenge with 5 or 10 mg gluten. Urine GIP concentration was determined by an immunochromatographic assay. RESULTS: In study A, 51 of 150 baseline urine samples were GIP+ on GFD and 7 of 17 were GIP+ after the zero-gluten challenge, whereas only 55 of 81 were GIP+ after the 10-1,000 mg gluten challenges. There was no significant change in the 24-hour urinary GIP when increasing gluten from 10 to 1,000 mg. In study B, 24 of 24 baseline urine samples were GIP-, whereas 8 of 24 were GIP+ after 5 or 10 mg of gluten. DISCUSSION: Traces of gluten in the standard GFD may cause positivity of urinary GIP determination, whereas a false negativity is common after a gluten intake of 10-1,000 mg. Owing to the impossibility of standardizing the test in normal conditions, it seems unlikely that urinary GIP determination may represent a reliable tool to assess the compliance to the GFD of patients with celiac disease or other gluten-related disorders.",
