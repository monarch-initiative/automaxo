We used a 23-point Likert questionnaire and exploratory factor analysis to identify and classify the barriers. Adherence to gluten-free diet was assessed by measuring the serum level of anti-tTG-IgA. The correlation between the barriers and adherence to gluten-free diet was assessed using logistic regression. A total of 117 subjects completed the study. Seven factors were extracted: \"gluten-free diet restrictions,\" \"self-awareness and social awareness,\" \"psychological barriers,\" \"education,\" \"situational barriers and gatherings,\" \"lack of access/labeling,\" and \"cost.\" There was a significant correlation between the situational barriers and gatherings and nonadherence to the diet in the adjusted model (odds ratio = 1.63; 95% confidence interval [1.03, 2.54], p = .03). Nutritionists and physicians should consider these barriers when consulting patients with celiac disease.",
