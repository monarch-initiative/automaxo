However, the evidence on this relationship in children and adolescents is limited. Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to analyze the effect of GFD on the bone health and anthropometric profile of children and adolescents with CD. Five databases were searched up to January, 2022 to identify relevant studies. The studies' methodological quality was evaluated using two scales. The Hedge's g standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals were estimated using a random-effects model. The GRADE approach was used to assess the quality of evidence. Twenty-eight studies were included in the final review. GFD increased bone mineral content (BMC) (SMD = 0.39; 95%CI = 0.16, 0.62) and bone mineral density (BMD) (SMD = 0.29; 95%CI = 0.10, 0.47) in CD individuals. Difference in mean BMC and BMD between children and adolescents with CD versus healthy individuals was -0.49 (95%CI = -0.76, -0.22) and -0.47 (SMD = -95%CI = -0.72, -0.22), respectively. There was no difference in BMI and body fat among celiac children and adolescents versus healthy controls. In conclusion, GFD was associated with higher BMC and BMD in children and adolescents with CD.",
