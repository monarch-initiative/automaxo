                    "text": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Celiac disease is a common chronic inflammatory condition of the small bowel triggered by gluten in wheat, rye and barley in the diet. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity presents with symptoms similar to celiac disease with the ingestion of gluten or other components of wheat. In this article, we review challenges presented by a gluten free diet for the treatment of both disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Wheat is ubiquitous in the diet and medications/products. A registered dietitian is mandatory for patient education on the gluten free diet. Naturally gluten free foods provide a healthy diet for those with celiac disease. Whole grains labelled gluten free, including oats, are encouraged in the diet as refined grains may be deficient in fiber, protein, and micronutrients, particularly folate. Gluten contamination is the most common cause of persistent symptoms in celiac disease though shared equipment of food preparation may not be as large a problem as suspected. Most with celiac disease on a gluten free diet will fully recover and gain weight that poses a problem for those overweight to start. The gluten free diet may have a negative impact on quality of life for both celiac patients and their families. Those with hypervigilance of the gluten free diet and avoidance of dining out have the lowest quality of life. The gluten free diet is currently the only effective treatment for celiac disease. A registered dietitian is needed to educate patients on the complexity of the gluten free diet with a goal of healthy eating, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding disordered eating or diet hypervigilance; key to a good quality of life.",
