Avoiding gluten brings difficulties with following the diet and can affect the social life of people with CD. The Zeliakide Project is a nutrition education program aimed at increasing the knowledge of the general population about healthy diets, CD and GFD, and, therefore, to improve the social inclusion and quality of life of people with CD. It is a one-month intervention program, two-armed cluster, non-randomised and controlled trial, conducted among 10-12-year-old children. Pre- and post-intervention evaluation and 1 month follow-up will be carried out to assess the effectiveness of the program. It is based on competencies and their respective learning outcomes. The teaching methodology chosen is a STEAM methodology: inquiry-based learning (IBL). A teaching unit has been created to develop the project, which, in the future, will be useful for the self-application of the program. This study will provide a valid and useful tool to achieve changes in the diet at the school level and will help to promote the social inclusion of people with CD. Moreover, it will enforce the STEAM competences of children.",
