RECENT FINDINGS: There are new serological markers with potential use not only in the diagnosis of celiac disease but also as important follow-up tools. As our understanding of celiac disease increases with further isolation of nonhuman leukocyte antigen genes and clarification of the intracellular pathways that underlie its pathogenesis, there are new modalities which will not only allow improved risk stratification of individuals but also facilitate the development of novel therapeutic agents. SUMMARY: Small bowel biopsy remains the gold standard for both diagnosis and monitoring. A gluten-free diet currently remains the only treatment option, with potential other options being discovered such as glutenases for predigestion of gluten.",
