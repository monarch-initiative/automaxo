Participation in food-related activities and self-managing the chronic health condition involve use of cognitive skills. This cross-sectional study examined how executive functions might be associated with participation in food-related activities. Adolescents aged 12-18 years (N = 65; Mage = 14.67) with celiac were interviewed about participation, and their parents completed an executive function questionnaire. Poorer participation significantly correlated with poorer executive abilities. Identifying executive function profiles may contribute to understanding and advancing resourceful daily functioning and participation in daily food-related activities.",
