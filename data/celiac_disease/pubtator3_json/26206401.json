There is a paucity of data on long-term adherence to the gluten-free diet in the adult population. AIMS: To determine the long-term adherence to the gluten-free diet and potential associated factors in a large coeliac disease referral centre population. METHODS: We performed a mailed survey of adults with clinically, serologically and histologically confirmed coeliac disease diagnosed >=5 years prior to survey. The previously validated Celiac Disease Adherence Test was used to determine adherence. Demographic, socio-economic and potentially associated factors were analysed with adherence as the outcome. RESULTS: The response rate was 50.1% of 709 surveyed, the mean time on a gluten-free diet 9.9 +- 6.4 years. Adequate adherence (celiac disease adherence test score <13) was found in 75.5% of respondents. A higher level of education was associated with adequate adherence (P = 0.002) even after controlling for household income (P = 0.0220). Perceptions of cost, effectiveness of the gluten-free diet, knowledge of the gluten-free diet and self-effectiveness at following the gluten-free diet correlated with adherence scores (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Long-term adherence to a gluten-free diet was adequate in >75% of respondents. Perceived cost remains a barrier to adherence. Perceptions of effectiveness of gluten-free diet as well as its knowledge, are potential areas for intervention.",
