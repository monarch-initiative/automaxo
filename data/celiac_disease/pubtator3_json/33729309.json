Since 2009, Brazil has a Clinical Protocol of Therapeutic Guidelines for Celiac Disease, but there are frequent complaints by persons with gluten-related disorders concerning the lack of healthcare professionals' knowledge of this topic and the difficulties related to healthcare, for both diagnosis and treatment. This study aimed to understand the weaknesses in healthcare perceived by persons with gluten-related disorders. An online qualitative survey was conducted in the Living Without Gluten group on Facebook, consulting the records saved by the group for 65 months, which totaled 510 posts and the respective comments. The data were grouped in categories, and thematic content analysis was performed, adopting the theoretical references on healthcare. The analysis revealed that the searches for diagnosis and adequate treatment were often described as a forced pilgrimage, resulting from shortcomings in healthcare, including lack of up-to-date knowledge on gluten-related disorders among the healthcare professionals and problems in the physician-patient relationship. Weaknesses in patient care and late diagnoses contribute to increasing the risk of complications and deaths. In this context, the Living Without Gluten group plays a leading role as a support group and network of solidarity, favoring increased awareness and empowerment of numerous Brazilians with gluten-related disorders.",
