Despite stable CD rates in many countries, an increasing number of healthy individuals are adopting gluten-free diets, believing that this diet is an inherently healthier choice. The health effects of gluten-free diets are controversial, and a recent study added to the debate by reporting a lower acidogenic potential of this diet. The effects of the GFD on potential renal acid load (PRAL) and net endogenous acid production (NEAP)-two important markers of dietary acid load (DAL)-are poorly understood, and have never been examined in a Western population. Using cross-sectional data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, we estimated DAL in U.S. individuals reporting a GFD and contrasted the results to the general U.S. population consuming gluten and denying special diets. The GFD was associated with significantly lower crude DAL scores, and after adjustments for confounders in multivariate regression, the results remain significant. Yet, our study could not confirm the reported alkalizing properties of the GFD. Although overall DAL scores were significantly lower in the GFD group, they were comparable to Western diets producing 50-75 mEq of acid per day.",
