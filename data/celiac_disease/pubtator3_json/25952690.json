This is not only challenging but also leads to several psychosocial morbidities and affects the quality of life of children and their parents. METHODS: An observational study was conducted on 50 children (5-18 years) diagnosed with celiac disease on gluten-free diet for at least 6 months and their parents to evaluate of the impact of celiac disease and its dietary manipulation on them. The quality of life was assessed by applying celiac disease-specific questionnaire. Dietary compliant and noncompliant groups were compared to assess the factors leading to poor compliance. Anthropometric parameters were utilized to ascertain clinical response. RESULTS: Fifty children with a mean age of 9.06 years were enrolled. Seventy-four percent of the children were compliant. In the compliant group, height and weight correlated with dietary compliance (p = 0.0087 and p = 0.023). Dietary compliance was found to be better in adolescent males and single child and those living in nuclear families. Quality of life was found to be higher among parents of noncompliant children (quality of life score: 63) as compared to the compliant children (quality of life score: 59). The acceptance of celiac disease was better among children whose parents had a higher level of education. The scale diet proved to be a useful indicator for evaluating compliance among children (p = 0.0036). CONCLUSIONS: Noncompliance to gluten-free diet was noted in 24 % of children with celiac disease.",
