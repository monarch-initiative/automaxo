There is paucity of data on the nutritional content and cost of GF food products compared with their gluten-containing (GC) counterparts from India (Asia). DESIGN: After a detailed market survey, packaged and labeled GF food products (n=485) and their packaged GC counterparts (n=790) from the supermarkets of Delhi (India) and e-commerce websites were included. Nutritional content and cost/100 g food (in US dollars) were calculated using the information on food label. RESULTS: Gluten-free food products were 232% (range: 118% to 376%) more expensive than their GC counterparts. Energy content of all GF food products was similar to their GC counterparts, except cereal-based snacks (GF: 445 kcal vs. GC: 510 kcal, p<0.001). The protein content was significantly lower in GF pasta and macaroni products (single-grain: GF: 6.5 g vs. GC:11. 5 g, p-0.002; multigrain: GF:7.6 g vs. GC:11.5 g, p-0.027), cereal flours (single-grain: GF: 7.6 g vs. GC: 12.3 g, p<0.001; multigrain: GF:10.9 g vs. GC: 14.1 g, p-0.009) and nutritional bars (GF: 21.81 g vs. GC:26 g, p-0.028) than their GC counterparts. Similarly, the dietary-fiber content of GF pasta and macaroni products, cereal flours, cereal premix and nutritional bars of GF foods was significantly lower than their GC counterparts. Gluten-free bread and confectionary items, biscuits and cookies and snacks had higher total fats and trans-fat content than their GC counterparts. Gluten-free cereal-based snacks had higher sodium content than their GC counterparts (GF: 820 mg vs. GC:670 mg; p<0.001). CONCLUSION: GF foods are significantly more expensive, contain less protein and dietary fiber and higher fat, trans-fat and sodium than their GC counterparts. Strategies must be developed to reduce the cost and improve the nutritional profile of GF foods.",
