The self-administered questionnaire was distributed through the Italian Coeliac Association channels (link on social media, websites, and newsletters) to all of the celiac patients willing to participate in 2011 and 2022 (2427 and 3529 responders who answered the same questions, respectively). Descriptive analyses and the Pearson's chi-squared test were performed. The responders were 1 to 84 years old and mainly female. The prevalence of adherent patients in 2022 was 91%, with the highest value (94%) in children (<=10 years old) and adolescents (15-17 years old). Overall, young adults were the most worried group. About a decade after the first survey, we observed a decreasing prevalence of transgression events (-5%) and (at least) occasional temptation (-17%), a decreasing prevalence of health-related and general worries, but an increasing prevalence of social life withdrawal. In conclusion, it is important to periodically monitor celiac patients' compliance and attitudes towards the gluten-free diet. As also highlighted in international guidelines, a reorganization of the diagnosis/follow-up visits, including an expert dietary consultation, is needed.",
