                    "text": "Several studies have suggested a protective role of breastfeeding and/or the timing and quantity of gluten introduction in the subsequent development of celiac disease. Especially, prolonged breastfeeding during the introduction of gluten-containing feeding has been associated with a reduced risk of developing celiac disease in infancy. The mentioned results suggest the existence of a 'window of opportunity' between 4 and 6 months of age in which gluten can be introduced in small amounts. Therefore, the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition recommends avoiding gluten introduction before the age of 4 months and after the age of 7 months and that gluten should be preferably introduced during ongoing breastfeeding. However, the influence of breastfeeding in the development of celiac disease is not clear, since some studies report prevention and others do not, and the studies reporting a protective effect of breastfeeding do not make clear if it concerns prevention of the disease or delays the onset of symptoms. In addition, most of the studies on this topic have been observational and retrospective. For these reasons, prospective studies are needed to understand the relationship between early nutrition in particular and environmental factors in general, concerning the development and possible prevention of celiac disease. Some of these studies are ongoing. One example is the European multicenter PreventCD project (www.preventcoeliacdisease.com) among infants with a first-degree family member with celiac disease carrying HLA-DQ2 and/or -DQ8, randomized to a double-blind dietary intervention with 100 mg of gluten daily or placebo between the age of 4-6 months. All included children are already 3 years old, and the first analyses are being prepared (http://www.trialregister.nl).",
