A case study analysis was conducted on data from 16 households of youth with CD to examine how factors related to parental food literacy, the home food environment, and food purchasing patterns may influence food guide uptake by Canadian youth with CD and their families. Households were of higher socioeconomic status, parents had good food literacy, and the home food availability of fruits, vegetables and GF grains was diverse. However, households also had a diverse supply of convenience foods and snack options. Youth reported consuming a larger proportion of these foods (>35% dietary intake) and had suboptimal diet quality. Dietary intake of fruits and vegetables were below GF plate model recommendations by over 30%. Despite limited economical barriers, good parental food literacy, and diverse food availability, meeting fruit and vegetable recommendations based on the pediatric GF food guide remains a major challenge. Findings inform that effective strategies and healthy public policies to support the uptake of GF food guide recommendations are needed to improve the health outcomes of youth with CD.",
