Therefore, the quantification of gluten in products intended for consumption by individuals who may suffer from these pathologies must be accurate and reproducible, in a way that allows their proper labeling and protects the health of consumers. Immunochemical methods have been the methods of choice for quantifying gluten, and several kits are commercially available. Nevertheless, they still face problems such as the initial extraction of gluten in complex matrices or the use of a standardized reference material to validate the results. Lately, other methodologies relying mostly on mass spectrometry-based techniques have been explored, and that may allow, in addition to quantitative analysis, the characterizationof gluten proteins. On the other hand, although the level of 20 mg/kg of gluten detected by these methods is sufficient for a product to be considered gluten-free, its immunogenic potential for celiac patients has not been clinically validated. In this sense, in vitro and in vivo models, such as the organoid technology applied in gut-on-chip devices and the transgenic humanized mouse models, respectively, are being developed for investigating both the gluten-induced pathogenesis and the treatment of celiac disease. Due to the ubiquitous nature of gluten in the food industry, as well as the increased prevalence of gluten-related disorders, here we intend to summarize the available methods for gluten quantification in food matrices and for the evaluation of its immunogenic potential concerning the development of novel therapies for celiac disease to highlight active research and discuss knowledge gaps and current challenges in this field.",
