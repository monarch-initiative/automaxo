A linear discriminant model, based on the signals of 11 polymeric membranes, selected from the 36 above using a stepwise procedure, was used to semi-quantitatively classify samples of a \"Gluten-free\" foodstuff (baby milked flour), previously contaminated with known amounts of gliadins (<10, 20-50 or >50mg/kg), as \"Gluten-free\", \"Low-Gluten content\" or \"Gluten-containing\". For this food matrix, the device had sensitivity towards gliadins of 1-2mg/kg and overall sensitivity and specificity of 77% and 78%, respectively. Moreover, the device never identified an ethanolic extract containing gliadins as \"Gluten-free\". Finally, the system also allowed distinguishing \"Gluten-free\" and \"Gluten-containing\" foodstuffs (15 foods, including breads, flours, baby milked flours, cookies and breakfast cereals) with an overall sensitivity and specificity greater than 83%, using the signals of only 4 selected polymeric membranes (selected using a stepwise procedure). Since only one \"Gluten-containing\" foodstuff was misclassified as \"Gluten-free\", the device could be used as a preliminary tool for quality control of foods for celiac patients.",
