BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is common; however, little is known about long-term symptom outcomes. STUDY: We performed a retrospective chart review on individuals with celiac disease followed at a tertiary referral center between 2012 and 2018. To minimize bias, strict inclusion/exclusion criteria were utilized. Only those with definitive biopsy-proven celiac disease, on a gluten-free diet, and with systematic follow-up were included. The standardized care at this center reduced the risk that decisions on testing and follow-up visits were determined by symptom status. Summary statistics were computed and generalized linear models with a logit link were used to associate the proportion of symptomatic visits with various covariates using R statistical programming. RESULTS: Of the 1023 records reviewed, 212 met inclusion/exclusion criteria; 146 (69%) were female and the mean age at diagnosis was 43 (range: 11 to 84 y old). During follow-up, over 50% remained symptomatic, with many having the same symptoms that prompted the diagnosis. The only predictors for remaining symptomatic were female sex and younger age at diagnosis. Abnormal serology during follow-up and small bowel normalization were not predictive. CONCLUSIONS: In individuals with definitive celiac disease with systematic long-term follow-up in a Celiac Clinic, roughly half remained symptomatic despite a gluten-free diet. Many suffer from the same symptoms that prompted the diagnosis of celiac disease. Small bowel healing and abnormal serology in follow-up were not predictive of remaining symptomatic. These findings stress the importance of long-term care in celiac disease.",
