The objective of the present study is to explore adherence challenges experienced by young adults in college. Responses from the online survey (N = 50), interview (N = 21), and focus group (N = 7) indicate students were motivated to adhere but experience challenges related to dining services and social situations. Dining services from 6 colleges reported a variety of accommodations for students with celiac disease, but request increased student involvement. Tools and strategies that facilitate communication between students and dining services may improve adherence.",
