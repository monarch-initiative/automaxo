Standard treatment is a strict gluten-free diet (GFD), which poses significant challenges due to dietary restrictions, cross-contamination and subsequent persistent intestinal inflammation. This underscores the need for new treatment options addressing the complex pathophysiology of CeD. Recent research focuses on developing drugs that target intestinal barrier regeneration, gluten peptide modification, immune response alteration, and gut microbial ecosystem modulation. These approaches offer potential for more effective management of CeD beyond GFD. Gluten-independent treatments may be particularly relevant under the FDA's draft guidance for CeD, which emphasizes drug development as an adjunct to GFD for patients with ongoing signs and symptoms of CeD despite strict GFD.",
