This study involved 66 children with CD (29 boys and 37 girls) from 5 hospitals belonging to the Ministry of Health. Socioeconomic characteristics were obtained using a structured questionnaire. Anthropometric indices were measured using a body composition analyzer. Dietary intake was assessed using three 24 h dietary records. The biochemical parameters were determined in the hospitals' laboratories. According to the findings, the majority of respondents had ages ranging from 10 to 13 years, a father and mother with a university education, a high family income, and 5 to 7 family members. Carbohydrates and protein intake for both genders were significantly higher than the DRI's recommended dietary intake. However, the majority of nutrients consumed were at levels significantly lower than the DRI. Both genders had normal anthropometric indices, with girls having at significantly higher indices than boys. The biochemical parameters of both genders were comparable and within the normal range, except for vitamin D, which was below the normal range. The most important factors influencing nutritional status were age for both genders, and family income and number of family members for boys. In conclusion, data obtained for nutrient intake, anthropometric indicators, body composition, and biochemical analysis indicated that CD children following the Ministry of Health GFD program have a generally good nutritional status.",
