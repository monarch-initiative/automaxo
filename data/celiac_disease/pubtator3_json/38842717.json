                    "text": "OBJECTIVE: The present study aims to investigate the potential impact of celiac disease (CD) on hearing functions and assess the effect of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on this condition. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 55 children with CD (110 ears) and 25 healthy controls (50 ears) matched for age and gender. The CD group was divided into adherent (n = 31) and nonadherent (n = 24) to GFD. Participants underwent tympanometry and pure tone audiometry assessments covering frequencies from 500 to 4000 Hz. RESULTS: Patients with CD showed significantly higher air and bone conduction hearing averages compared to the control group at frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz for air conduction, and at 500 Hz for bone conduction (P < 0.05). Celiac patients, those who fully adhered to GFD, had notably higher air conduction hearing averages at 500, 2000, and 4000 Hz compared to healthy controls (P < 0.05). However, there was no difference in bone conduction hearing averages between the two groups. In contrast, celiac patients who did not comply with GFD had statistically significantly higher air and bone conduction hearing averages than the control group (P < 0.05), at frequencies of 500, 1000, and 4000 Hz for air conduction, and at 500 and 1000 Hz for bone conduction (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that nonadherence to GFD may elevate the risk of hearing loss in children with CD. As a result, it is recommended to conduct hearing screenings for children with CD and underscore the importance of complying with GFD to mitigate further detrimental effects on hearing functions.",
