In this retrospective cohort study, we aimed to investigate factors aligned with baseline and a follow-up regarding BMI in CD cases diagnosed at the University of Pecs (Hungary). Data were collected regarding gender, age, clinical presentation, histology, serology, extraintestinal manifestations, and BMI upon diagnosis and during follow-up. To compare variables with baseline BMI and BMI changes in short-, intermediate-, and long-term periods, we applied univariate analyses. A total of 192 CD patients were included. Males had significantly higher mean BMI when compared with females at diagnosis (22.9 +- 4.1 vs. 21.4 +- 4.3 kg/m2, p = 0.041) and during follow-up (p = 0.031, p = 0.029, and p = 0.033 for short-, intermediate-, and long-term follow-ups, respectively). Non-classical CD patients experienced higher mean BMI at diagnosis (22.9 +- 4.0 vs. 20.7 +- 4.4 kg/m2, p < 0.001) and following long-term follow-up (24.5 +- 3.2 vs. 22.6 +- 3.4 kg/m2, p = 0.039) than classical patients. In conclusion, although the mean BMI remained in the normal range, it increased significantly during follow-up, even at the short-term follow-up. This change was characteristic for non-classical cases and males on the long-term follow-ups.",
