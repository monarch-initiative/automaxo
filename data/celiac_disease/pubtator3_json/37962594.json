Undoubtedly similarly well-established is the gluten-free diet. It is the only recognized therapy for celiac disease to date. However, this presents some pitfalls in its implementation, which will be discussed in the following review. In addition, current developments that have the potential to significantly change both diagnosis and treatment of celiac disease are discussed. On the one hand, such an outlook was chosen since colleagues want to be \"ready\" when such developments are integrated into daily clinical routine. On the other hand, the realization that the field of mucosal immunology is moving forward has the potential to lift the spirits of the reader.",
