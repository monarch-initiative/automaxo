This integrative review investigated current knowledge about the experience of living with a gluten-free diet, as well as social support and the role played by nurses and/or associations in the process. A total of 18 articles were selected. Results revealed greater family support is needed to deal with the day-to-day issues of a gluten-free diet. Furthermore, women diagnosed with celiac disease have more psychological distress than men according to some studies. Sufferers of celiac disease report that more information is needed at all levels (hotel and catering, healthcare, social), which would help generate coping strategies. The few studies retrieved that talk about this topic show that following a gluten-free diet affects the personal, family, emotional, social, and financial dimensions of sufferers of celiac disease. The nurse tends to be the person whom those coping with the illness go to for support, although celiac disease associations are also a fundamental pillar in this support. Policy makers need to adapt health services to the needs of individuals with celiac disease.",
