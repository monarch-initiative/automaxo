                    "text": "Introduction and aim: With the rising consumer's health awareness, especially towards patients with celiac disease, gluten has become a food ingredient to be avoided by many people expecting various positive health effects. The strict adherence of diet requires serious abandonments and lifestyle changes that affect directly their quality of life. The aim of the present study was to recognise the quality of life of Hungarian and Romanian consumers following a gluten-free diet as well as to explore the negative effects on them. Method: An online questionnaire survey was conducted upon 1155 Hungarian and Romanian respondents. Results: For gluten-free consumers, self-control was relatively easy to overcome, but their lifestyle was negatively affected by social events and dining out. In addition, diet adherence was a burden from both lifestyle and financial point of view. For Hungarian consumers, external factors such as price, choice, taste and availability of products had become a major obstacle, while Romanian ones were more likely to be affected by internal factors (product information, diet knowledge, lifestyle, self-control). Mandatory labelling of substances and products causing allergies and intolerances has achieved its purpose, as it has made it easier for consumers on diet to choose food and increased their confidence. Conclusions: The study points out that dieters' quality of life can be enhanced not only by general actions (improving the preparedness of out-of-home meal services and rationalising the price of products), but also through country-specific community intervention.
