In an optimetrical examination a decline in sharpness of sight was found: Right (R) - 6/19, Left (L) - 6/12. Following a few months of a gluten-free diet his situation improved and the signs of celiac disease disappeared. The sharpness of sight was re-examined and good improvement was found: L - 6/9, R - 6/12. This means that gluten might influence the sharpness of sight.",
