The concern of celiac patients is that these foods should be safe. However, gluten contamination can affect these foods. The objectives of this review and meta-analysis were first, to identify articles that detected gluten contamination in gluten-free foods using validated methods. Second, to quantify the overall prevalence of gluten contamination of naturally gluten-free foods, labelled gluten-free products, and meals prepared in food services. Third, to highlight the influence of the country's income and the period of study on this prevalence. The studies were identified in Scopus, Science Direct, Web of Science, PubMed, and Google Scholar. Forty articles were included according to PRISMA guidelines. The statistical meta-analysis was performed using MedCalc 19 software. The results show that in the gluten-free foods analysed, the overall prevalence of gluten contamination was estimated at 15.12% (95% CI: 9.56%-21.70%), with more than 20 mg/kg of gluten. Naturally gluten-free foods were significantly more contaminated than labelled gluten-free products and than meals in food services (28.32%; 9.52%; 4.66% respectively; p < 0.001). Moreover, it was noticed that oats were the most contaminated food. In addition, the prevalence of gluten contamination has significantly decreased over time. The majority of the studies were carried out in upper-middle-income and high-income countries, while only one study was conducted in lower-middle income countries. Therefore, it is necessary to implement preventive actions to reduce gluten contamination, ensuring safe gluten-free foods for celiac patients, including low-income countries.",
