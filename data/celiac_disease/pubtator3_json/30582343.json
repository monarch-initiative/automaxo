The only treatment for GRD is still so far is the lifelong complete exclusion of gluten from the daily diet. The correct information about the presence/absence of gluten in food is very important to this group. The present study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of gluten contamination in gluten-free industrial and non-industrial products. In this systematic review, 24 cross-sectional studies were analyzed. The authors developed specific search strategies for Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global. The authors evaluated the methodological quality of the included studies using criteria from Meta-analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (MASTARI). We performed the statistical meta-analysis by metafor package of R program. 95.83% (n = 23) of the studies presented positive results for contamination (over 20 ppm). In industrial food products, studies showed a contamination prevalence of 13.2% (95% CI: 10.8%-15.7%). In non-industrial food products, studies showed a contamination prevalence of 41.5% (95% CI: 16.6%-66.4%). Despite the non-industrial products presented higher contamination prevalence than the industrial products, the difference was not significant (p = 0.072). The findings indicate cross-contamination in industrialized and non-industrialized products. As expected, industrial products labeled as gluten-free showed a lower percentage of gluten-contamination than non-industrialized. Despite that, any contaminated sample found in this group present greater relevance than non-labeled foods. It indicates that foods labeled as \"gluten-free\" should not be considered safe for patients with GRD since information on the label regarding the presence/absence of gluten is unreliable. Therefore, any gluten-contamination in products labeled as gluten-free is a serious problem to whom present GRD. Further studies are needed to estimate gluten cross-contamination in food service meals and industry better.",
