In mother, atypical celiac disease was diagnosed at the age of 39 yers. In two twin dughters potential celiac disease was diagnosed at the age of 4,5 years and in 18-years old daughter- atypical celiac disease. In father and two sons celiac disease was excluded. In genetic studies, in mother and three daughters the presence of HLA DQ2 or DQ8 was confirmed. In father and one son HLA DQ8 was present and in the remaining son HLA DQ2/DQ8 haplotyp was absent. In all family members with diagnosed celiac disease free-gluten diet was introduced.",
