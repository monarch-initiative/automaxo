37131195	Clinical features, treatment, and outcomes of celiac-associated arthritis: a retrospective cohort study.	BACKGROUND: Although arthritis is recognized as an extra-intestinal manifestation of celiac disease, little is known about the clinical course and outcomes of pediatric celiac-associated arthritis. This study describes clinical characteristics, treatments, and outcomes of children with celiac-associated arthritis. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of children with celiac disease seen in pediatric rheumatology clinic between 2004 and 2021 for joint complaints. Data was abstracted from electronic health records. Patient demographics and clinical manifestations were evaluated using standard descriptive statistics. Physician- and patient-reported outcomes were evaluated at the index visit, 6-month follow-up, and last recorded visit, and were compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients with celiac disease were evaluated for joint complaints, and 13 were diagnosed with arthritis. Their mean age was 8.9 years (SD 5.9), and 61.5% were female. Celiac disease diagnosis was made before arthritis diagnosis in only 2 cases (15.4%). Initial testing that led to the celiac disease diagnosis was obtained by the rheumatologist in 6 cases (46.2%). Only 8 patients (61.5%) had concomitant GI symptoms, and of these, 3 patients had BMI z-scores <-1.64 and 1 had impaired linear growth. Arthritis presentation was most often oligoarticular (76.9%) and asymmetric (84.6%). Most cases required systemic therapy (n = 11, 84.6%) with DMARDs, biologics, or both. Of the 10 patients who required systemic therapy and reported compliance with the gluten-free diet, 3 (30%) were able to stop systemic medications. Two of 3 patients who cleared celiac serologies came off systemic medications. Statistically significant improvement was noted in the number of joints involved (p = 0.02) and physician global assessment of disease activity (p = 0.03) between the index and final visit. CONCLUSIONS: Rheumatologists play an important role in the identification of celiac disease, as arthritis was the presenting symptom in most cases and was not always associated with GI symptoms or poor growth. The arthritis was most often oligoarticular and asymmetric. Most children required systemic therapy. The gluten-free diet may not be sufficient to manage arthritis, but antibody clearance may be an indicator of higher likelihood of disease control off medications. Outcomes are promising with a combination of diet and medical therapy.
31173891	Rate, Risk Factors, and Outcomes of Nonadherence in Pediatric Patients With Celiac Disease: A Systematic Review.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The only treatment for celiac disease is strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). We performed a systematic review to investigate the rate of adherence to a GFD in children with celiac disease, risk factors that affect adherence, and outcomes of non-adherence. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, EBSCO, and Scopus for studies through January 2019. We included observational studies of >=50 children diagnosed with celiac disease and recommended for placement on a GFD. We collected data on adherence assessment (self-report, serology tests, structured dietary interview, biopsies, or assays for gluten immunogenic peptides), risk factors, and outcomes related to adherence. Findings were presented with medians, range, and a narrative synthesis. RESULTS: We identified 703 studies; of these, 167 were eligible for full-text assessment and 49 were included in the final analysis, comprising 7850 children. Rates of adherence to a GFD ranged from 23% to 98%. Comparable rates (median rates of adherence, 75%-87%) were found irrespective of how assessments were performed. Adolescents were at risk of non-adherence and children whose parents had good knowledge about celiac disease adhered more strictly. Non-adherence associated with patient growth, symptoms, and quality of life. CONCLUSION: In a systematic review of 49 studies of children with celiac disease, we found substantial variation in adherence to a GFD among patients. Rate of adherence was not associated with method of adherence measurement, so all methods appear to be useful, with lack of consensus on the ideal metric. Studies are needed to determine the best method to ensure adherence and effects on long-term health.
36097404	Anti-inflammatory effects of vagal nerve stimulation with a special attention to intestinal barrier dysfunction.	The vagus nerve (VN), the longest nerve of the organism innervating the gastrointestinal tract, is a mixed nerve with anti-inflammatory properties through its afferents, activating the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis, and its efferents through the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNFalpha) by splenic and gut macrophages. In addition, the VN is also able to modulate the permeability of the intestinal barrier although the VN does not innervate directly the intestinal epithelium. Targeting the VN through VN stimulation (VNS) has been developed in experimental model of intestinal inflammation and in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and might be of interest to decrease intestinal permeability in gastrointestinal disorders with intestinal barrier defect such as IBD, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and celiac disease. In this issue of neurogastroenterology and motility, Mogilevski et al. report that a brief non-invasive transcutaneous auricular VNS in healthy volunteers consistently reduces the permeability of the small intestine induced by intravenous administration of the stress peptide corticotropin releasing hormone, known to increase intestinal permeability and to inhibit the VN. In this review, we outline the mechanistic underpinning the effect of stress, of the VN and VNS on intestinal permeability. In particular, the VN can act on intestinal permeability through enteric nerves, and/or cells such as enteric glial cells. We also review the existing evidence of the effects VNS on intestinal permeability in models such as burn intestinal injury and traumatic brain injury, which pave the way for future clinical trials in IBD, IBS, and celiac disease.
36674460	New Developments in Celiac Disease Treatment.	Celiac disease (CD) is a common autoimmune disease affecting around 1% of the population. It consists of an immune-mediated enteropathy, triggered by gluten exposure in susceptible patients. All patients with CD, irrespective of the presence of symptoms, must endure a lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD). This is not an easy task due to a lack of awareness of the gluten content in foods and the extensive incorporation of gluten in processed foods. Furthermore, a GFD imposes a sense of limitation and might be associated with decreased quality of life in CD patients. This results in gluten contamination in the diet of four out of five celiac patients adhering to a GFD. Furthermore, one in three adult patients will report persistent symptoms and two in three will not achieve full histological recovery when on a GFD. In recent years, there has been extensive research conducted in the quest to find the holy grail of pharmacological treatment for CD. This review will present a concise description of the current rationale and main clinical trials related to CD drug therapy.
30346951	Pancreatic autoimmunity: An unknown etiology on patients with assisted reproductive techniques (ART)-recurrent reproductive failure.	Pancreatic Autoimmunity is defined as the presence of autoantibodies and more frequent need for insulin treatment. Affected women presenting recurrent implantation failure (RIF) or recurrent miscarriage (RM) are often misdiagnosed. The objective of thestudy was to describe clinical and metabolic profiles suggestive of Pancreatic Autoimmunity and therapeutic strategy in patients with RIF/RM. We analyzed retrospectively 735 patients, and have identified a subset (N = 20) with similar metabolic characteristics. At the same time, we included a control group (n = 39), with similar demographic characteristics and negative for pancreatic, thyroid or celiac disease autoimmunity. The patients identified with autoimmune metabolic problem (N = 20) had relatives with diabetes mellitus. At 120 minutes after Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) low level of insulin secretion (<2 IU/ml) was found in 70% of patients. Glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD 65) antibodies, with or without other autoantibodies, were positive in80% of patients and anti-IA2 alone were positive I the rest. Since pregestational period, insulin administration was recommended for 10 patients, metformin for 4 patients and exclusively diet control in 5 of them. Significantly increased live bith rates (LBR) per cycle were observed after metabolic control (52%) compared with live birth rate (LBR) after cycles without control (7.5%) (p<0.0001). We noticed 2 cases of pre-eclampsia and 6 low-birth weights. Insulin administration was needed during the pregnancy in 68% of patients and after childbirth in 31.57% of them. In our control group, all of patients (n = 39) underwent ART (53.8% SET and 46.1% DET) with a 50% (SET) and 61.9% (DET) live birth rate (LBR) per cycle. Patients with RIF/RM, normal BMI, low insulin levels after OGTT could benefit from additional metabolic immune testing. A correct diagnosis and treatment could have a positive impact on their reproductive results and live birth rate.
37299417	Determinants of Adherence to a Gluten-Free Diet in Children with Celiac Disease and the Influence of the Methods Used to Assess It.	Lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) is the cornerstone of management of celiac disease (CD), but adhering to a GFD can be hard. Although several factors are positively associated with adherence of pediatric CD patients to a GFD, it is unknown whether these are influenced by variability caused by the specific tool used to assess adherence to a GFD. Here, we aimed to evaluate how individual patient characteristics and dietary counselling by a trained dietitian influence adherence to a GFD in children with CD, as assessed by two validated questionnaires: the Biagi questionnaire and the Leffler short questionnaire adapted for pediatric patients. Some 139 children and adolescents were recruited in a cross-sectional, multicenter study. Concordance between the two questionnaires in defining adherence was fair (weighted Cohen's kappa coefficient 0.39, 95%CI 0.19-0.60). Upon regression analysis, having a cohabiting family member with CD, being of Italian origin, and receiving specialized dietary counselling during follow-up were found to positively influence stricter adherence to a GFD for children with CD. Neither questionnaire detected a significant relationship between adherence to a GFD and the presence of symptoms after gluten ingestion. This study provides important new data on the factors influencing GFD adherence in the pediatric population, and highlights the importance of dietician input and overcoming language and cultural barriers when educating patients.
35807860	Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity and Protective Role of Dietary Polyphenols.	Pathogenetically characterized by the absence of celiac disease and wheat allergy, non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a clinical entity triggered by the consumption of gluten-containing foods that relieved by a gluten-free diet. Since it is very difficult to maintain a complete gluten-free diet, there is a high interest in discovering alternative strategies aimed at reducing gluten concentration or mitigating its toxic effects. Plant-based dietary models are usually rich in bioactive compounds, such as polyphenols, recognized to prevent, delay, or even reverse chronic diseases, including intestinal disorders. However, research on the role of polyphenols in mitigating the toxicity of gluten-containing foods is currently limited. We address the metabolic fate of dietary polyphenols, both as free and bound macromolecule-linked forms, with particular reference to the gastrointestinal compartment, where the concentration of polyphenols can reach high levels. We analyze the potential targets of polyphenols including the gluten peptide bioavailability, the dysfunction of the intestinal epithelial barrier, intestinal immune response, oxidative stress and inflammation, and dysbiosis. Overall, this review provides an updated overview of the effects of polyphenols as possible dietary strategies to counteract the toxic effects of gluten, potentially resulting in the improved quality of life of patients with gluten-related disorders.
29351811	Rate and determinants of non-adherence to a gluten-free diet and nutritional status assessment in children and adolescents with celiac disease in a tertiary Brazilian referral center: a cross-sectional and retrospective study.	BACKGROUND: Compliance with a gluten-free diet (GFD) is difficult at all ages but particularly for teenagers due to social, cultural, economic, and practical pressures. The multidisciplinary team responsible for the treatment of patients with celiac disease and give support to their parents plays a special role on strengthening GFD and assessing the nutritional and physical health. METHODS: A cross-sectional and retrospective study including patients under 20 years of age, with biopsy-confirmed CD, followed regularly at the Department of Pediatrics, Division of Gastroenterology, Hospital das Clinicas, University of Sao Paulo, School of Medicine, Sao Paulo, Brazil, were surveyed using a questionnaire and serologic test applied between November 2011 and February 2012. A retrospective chart review of these patients was performed to collect the anthropometric data along with the results of the serologic test performed at the time of diagnosis and after at least 1 year of treatment with a GFD. RESULTS: We evaluated 35 patients aged between 2.4 and 19.9 years. Of these 68.6% were female, 88.6% had the typical form of the disease and 51.4% had other comorbidities. The mean age at diagnosis was 5.4 years. Despite dietary guidance, 20% reported non-adherence to the diet. Most children recovered the weight and height deficit after 5 years of treatment, and in some children, excessive weight gain became a concern. CONCLUSION: The majority of transgressions occurred intentionally at home or at parties. There was a risk of excessive weight gain, especially in the first two years of treatment. More alternatives and easier access to low cost gluten-free foods, increasing the discussion about the benefits of adhering to a GFD among patients, families, and the general population, besides the acquisition of self-management skills, are crucial to fostering independent children and adolescents who have the knowledge and tools to manage life with CD.
32459902	[Gluten-free diet in the treatment of extra-intestinal forms of gluten intolerance].	Following a gluten-free diet is recommended by clinical guidelines in the presence of gluten intolerance. However, due to the variety of clinical picture of various forms of intolerance, the elimination of gluten occurs not always timely. There are also diseases that classic treatment regimen does not include diet therapy, however, studies have confirmed the effectiveness of its use. The aim of the research - to study current data on the effectiveness of a gluten-free diet for extra-intestinal manifestations of gluten intolerance. Material and methods. Literature data concerning the effectiveness of including a gluten-free diet in the treatment of various diseases according to the PubMed and eLIBRARY portal were studied. Results. Modern data on the forms of gluten intolerance and their clinical manifestations are presented. The results of both randomized studies and individual clinical cases of gluten intolerance that occurred under the guise of other diseases are presented. A clinical case of an acute onset of the disease - celiac crisis, accompanied by acute diarrheal syndrome with subsequent malabsorption and progressive loss of body weight, anasarca and electrolyte disorders is considered. Neurological and psycho-neurological manifestations of celiac disease are described, including current data on the results of including a glutenfree diet in the treatment of autism spectrum disorders. The question of using dietary therapy for autism remains controversial to nowadays. The article outlines the arguments of supporters and opponents of excluding gluten in this pathology. Particular attention is paid to the diagnosis of gluten intolerance in patients with hematological disorders. The significance of a complete survey to identify celiac disease and timely diet therapy of the disease under stunted growth in children, after excluding other causes of malabsorption and even in the presence of negative serological markers of celiac disease is shown. The article also contains information on the pathology of kidneys and reproductive system, which were leveled only after the exclusion of gluten from the diet. Conclusion. The presented cases demonstrate a wide variety of clinical forms of gluten intolerance, examples of diagnostic search and dynamics of the clinical picture with the timely appointment of a gluten-free diet are given.
33317091	Influence of HLA-DQ2.5 Dose on Clinical Picture of Unrelated Celiac Disease Patients.	The clinical phenotype of celiac disease varies considerably among patients and the dosage of HLA-DQ2.5 alleles has been suggested to be a contributing factor. We investigated whether HLA-DQ2.5 allele dosage is associated with distinct clinical parameters at the time of diagnosis and with patients' response to a gluten-free diet. The final cohort included 605 carefully phenotyped non-related Finnish celiac disease patients grouped as having 0, 1 or 2 copies of HLA-DQ2.5. Clinical data at the time of diagnosis and during gluten-free diet were collected systematically from medical records and supplementary interviews. An increasing HLA-DQ2.5 dose effect was detected for celiac disease antibody positivity at diagnosis (p = 0.021) and for the presence of any first-degree relatives with celiac disease (p = 0.011 and p = 0.031, respectively). Instead, DQ2.5-negative patients were suffering most often from classical symptoms at diagnosis (p = 0.007 between HLA groups). In addition, during follow-up they were most often symptomatic despite a gluten-free diet (p = 0.002 between groups). Our results thus suggest that increasing HLA-DQ2.5 dose only has a minor effect on the clinical picture of celiac disease. However, HLA-DQ2.5-negative patients should not be overlooked in clinical practice and particular attention should be paid to this patient group during gluten-free diet.
31393225	Insights in the Evaluation of Gluten Dietary Avoidance in Healthy Subjects.	Background: The amount of healthy subjects adopting a gluten-free diet (GFD) for nonmedical reasons actually surpasses the numbers of those who are dealing with a permanent gluten-related disorder.Objective: The study aimed to better clarify the interactions between a GFD and physical and psychological well-being.Methods: Sixty healthy subjects with normal weight were enrolled. Thirty subjects (15 female) were submitted to a normocaloric GFD and considered as the experimental group (EG), and 30 subjects (15 female) were submitted to a normocaloric diet (CG) for 6 months. The hematochemical and psychological parameters before and after the diet were recorded.Results: Significant improvement was demonstrated in red blood count, hemoglobin, total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein parameters in the EG after the gluten-free diet. However, a significant increase of alpha-amylase pancreatic activity and reduction of vitamin B12 and magnesium levels in the EG were observed. Regarding the psychological parameters, the GFD significantly improved scores assessing body satisfaction, but increased social insecurity.Conclusions: The study is the first to consider significant modulation in hematochemical parameters as well as psychological ones by gluten avoidance in healthy individuals. Although these subjects were not characterized by intestinal mucosa damage, some of the effects were similar to those observed in celiac disease patients who began to adhere to a GFD.
33122841	HLA class II genes in precision-based care of childhood diseases: what we can learn from celiac disease.	Celiac disease (CeD) is a chronic immuno-mediated enteropathy caused by dietary gluten with marked autoimmunity traits. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II heterodimers represent the main predisposing factor, although environmental agents, as viral infection, gut microbiota, and dietary regimen, also contribute to CeD risk. These molecules are involved in autoimmunity as they present self-antigens to autoreactive T cells that have escaped the thymic negative selection. In CeD, the HLA class II risk alleles, DQA1*05-DQB1*02 and DQA1*03-DQB1*03, encode for DQ2.5 and DQ8 heterodimers, and, furthermore, disease susceptibility was found strictly dependent on the dose of these genes. This finding questioned how the expression of HLA-DQ risk genes, and of relative surface protein on antigen-presenting cells, might be relevant for the magnitude of anti-gluten inflammatory response in CeD patients, and impact the natural history of disease, its pathomechanisms, and compliance to dietary treatment. In this scenario, new personalized medical approaches will be desirable to support an early, accurate, and non-invasive diagnosis, and to define genotype-guided preventive and therapeutic strategies for CeD. To reach this goal, a stratification of genetic risk, disease outcome, and therapy compliance based on HLA genotypes, DQ2.5/DQ8 expression measurement and magnitude of T cell response to gluten is mandatory. IMPACT: This article revises the current knowledge on how different HLA haplotypes, carrying the DQ2.5/DQ8 risk alleles, impact the onset of CeD. This review discusses how the expression of susceptibility HLA-DQ genes can determine the risk assessment, outcome, and prevention of CeD. The recent insights on the environmental factors contributing to CeD in childhood are reviewed. This review discusses the use of HLA risk gene expression as a tool to support medical precision approaches for an early and non-invasive diagnosis of CeD, and to define genotype-guided preventive and therapeutic strategies.
31755668	Complementary feeding: new styles versus old myths.	Early life feeding habits may potentially alter future metabolic programming and body composition. Complementary feeding is the period of time when infants introduce food different from milk in their diet, together with a gradual reduction of the intake of milk (either breast milk or formula), to finally acquire the diet model of their family. This period is important in the transition of the infant from milk feeding to family foods, and is necessary for both nutritional and developmental reasons. The timing for introducing complementary foods and the method of feeding have changed over time. Available literature data show increasing interest and concerns about the impact of complementary feeding timing and modality on the onset of later non-communicable disorders, such as overweight and obesity, allergic diseases, celiac disease, or diabetes. While international scientific guidelines on complementary feeding have been published, many baby food companies' websites, blogs, and books, in most European countries exist. The aim of this manuscript is to look over current recommendations, and to revise "old myths." The adoption of an adequate weaning method is a cornerstone in the development of life-long health status. A correct strategy could reduce the risk of feeding disorders and other health problems later in life.
32109493	Impact of gastrointestinal physiology on drug absorption in special populations--An UNGAP review.	The release and absorption profile of an oral medication is influenced by the physicochemical properties of the drug and its formulation, as well as by the anatomy and physiology of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. During drug development the bioavailability of a new drug is typically assessed in early clinical studies in a healthy adult population. However, many disease conditions are associated with an alteration of the anatomy and/or physiology of the GI tract. The same holds true for some subpopulations, such as paediatric or elderly patients, or populations with different ethnicity. The variation in GI tract conditions compared to healthy adults can directly affect the kinetics of drug absorption, and thus, safety and efficacy of an oral medication. This review provides an overview of GI tract properties in special populations compared to healthy adults and discusses how drug absorption is affected by these conditions. Particular focus is directed towards non-disease dependent conditions (age, sex, ethnicity, genetic factors, obesity, pregnancy), GI diseases (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, celiac disease, cancer in the GI tract, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, lactose intolerance, Helicobacter pylori infection, and infectious diseases of the GI tract), as well as systemic diseases that change the GI tract conditions (cystic fibrosis, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, HIV enteropathy, and critical illness). The current knowledge about GI conditions in special populations and their impact on drug absorption is still limited. Further research is required to improve confidence in pharmacokinetic predictions and dosing recommendations in the targeted patient population, and thus to ensure safe and effective drug therapies.
35418551	Survey-Based Study on Food Insecurity During COVID-19 for Households With Children on a Prescribed Gluten-Free Diet.	Gluten-free (GF) foods are generally costlier than their gluten-containing counterparts. We conducted an anonymous electronic survey to assess food insecurity in households with a child on a prescribed GF diet and how this relates to GF diet adherence during the COVID-19 pandemic. The proportion of households who screened positive using the Hunger Vital Sign was similar to national rates (19%-24%). Approximately 5% of families who screened food secure reported GF food insecurity. Parent-reported intentional gluten consumption due to limited GF food availability in the household increased during the pandemic (7.5%). Food insecurity should be considered in the management of celiac disease.
37447198	Metabolomic Profiling in Children with Celiac Disease: Beyond the Gluten-Free Diet.	Celiac disease (CD) is included in the group of complex or multifactorial diseases, i.e., those caused by the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. Despite a growing understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease, diagnosis is still often delayed and there are no effective biomarkers for early diagnosis. The only current treatment, a gluten-free diet (GFD), can alleviate symptoms and restore intestinal villi, but its cellular effects remain poorly understood. To gain a comprehensive understanding of CD's progression, it is crucial to advance knowledge across various scientific disciplines and explore what transpires after disease onset. Metabolomics studies hold particular significance in unravelling the complexities of multifactorial and multisystemic disorders, where environmental factors play a significant role in disease manifestation and progression. By analyzing metabolites, we can gain insights into the reasons behind CD's occurrence, as well as better comprehend the impact of treatment initiation on patients. In this review, we present a collection of articles that showcase the latest breakthroughs in the field of metabolomics in pediatric CD, with the aim of trying to identify CD biomarkers for both early diagnosis and treatment monitoring. These advancements shed light on the potential of metabolomic analysis in enhancing our understanding of the disease and improving diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. More studies need to be designed to cover metabolic profiles in subjects at risk of developing the disease, as well as those analyzing biomarkers for follow-up treatment with a GFD.
34579108	Quality of Life and Psychological Disorders in Coeliac Disease: A Prospective Multicentre Study.	Coeliac disease (CeD) has been associated with psychological disorders and reduced quality of life. Our prospective study evaluated the changes in the quality of life, anxiety and depression in CeD patients up to two years after diagnosis. We recruited adult patients residing in the Veneto region with a new diagnosis of CeD. Several validated questionnaires were administered to measure quality of life, psychological symptoms and adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) at the time of diagnosis and after 1 and 2 years. Ninety-three patients reached the 1-year follow-up (81.7% were females with a median age at diagnosis of 35 years), and 55 patients reached the 2-year follow-up. We observed a significant improvement in quality of life, anxiety and depression scores at 1 year after diagnosis, particularly in patients who complied with a GFD. The improvements among classical CeD patients were similar to those observed in nonclassical patients except for anxiety, which improved only in patients with a classical presentation at diagnosis. Age, sex and other disease factors did not affect the change in quality of life (QoL) or other mood disorders. Most of the improvements measured 1 year after diagnosis and 2 years after diagnosis were not significant. In conclusion, QoL and mood disorders must be considered, and psychological counselling should be used when needed.
32146601	Gynecological Disorders in Patients with Non-celiac Wheat Sensitivity.	BACKGROUND: Non-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCWS) most frequently presents clinically with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like symptoms, although many extra-intestinal manifestations have also been attributed to it. No studies to date have evaluated the presence and frequency of gynecological symptoms in NCWS. AIM: To evaluate the frequency of gynecological disorders in patients with NCWS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-eight women with NCWS were included in the study. A questionnaire investigating gynecological symptoms and recurrent cystitis was administered, and patients reporting symptoms were then examined by specialists. Three control groups were selected: 52 patients with IBS not related to NCWS, 56 patients with celiac disease (CD), and 71 healthy controls. RESULTS: 59% of the patients with NCWS showed gynecological symptoms, a higher frequency than in healthy controls (P = 0.04), IBS controls (P = 0.01) and CD controls (P = 0.02). Menstrual cycle alterations were more frequent in patients with NCWS than in healthy controls (26.5% vs 11.3%; P = 0.03); the patients with NCWS suffered from recurrent vaginitis (16%) and dyspareunia (6%) significantly more frequently than healthy controls. Twenty-nine percent of patients with NCWS reported recurrent cystitis, a finding higher than in the control groups (vs healthy P = 0.0001, vs IBS P = 0.001, vs CD controls P = 0.04). Microbiological examinations were negative in most of the patients with NCWS and recurrent vaginitis or cystitis. During the 1-year follow-up, 46% of patients with menstrual disorders and 36% with recurrent vaginitis reported resolution of symptoms on a wheat-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with NCWS showed a significantly higher frequency of gynecological symptoms and recurrent cystitis than patients with IBS.
35394589	Consumption of Yeast-Fermented Wheat and Rye Breads Increases Colitis and Mortality in a Mouse Model of Colitis.	BACKGROUND: Cereals are known to trigger for wheat allergy, celiac disease and non-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCWS). Inflammatory processes and intestinal barrier impairment are suspected to be involved in NCWS, although the molecular triggers are unclear. AIMS: We were interested if different bread types influence inflammatory processes and intestinal barrier function in a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: Epithelial caspase-8 gene knockout (Casp8DeltaIEC) and control (Casp8fl) mice were randomized to eight groups, respectively. The groups received different diets for 28 days (gluten-free diet, gluten-rich diet 5 g%, or different types of bread at 50 g%). Breads varied regarding grain, milling and fermentation. All diets were isocaloric. RESULTS: Regardless of the diet, Casp8DeltaIEC mice showed pronounced inflammation in colon compared to ileum, whereas Casp8fl mice were hardly inflamed. Casp8fl mice could tolerate all bread types. Especially yeast fermented rye and wheat bread from superfine flour but not pure gluten challenge increased colitis and mortality in Casp8DeltaIEC mice. Hepatic expression of lipopolysaccharide-binding protein and colonic expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha genes were inversely related to survival. The bread diets, but not the gluten-rich diet, also decreased colonic tight junction expression to variable degrees, without clear association to survival and inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Bread components, especially those from yeast-fermented breads from wheat and rye, increase colitis and mortality in Casp8DeltaIEC mice highly susceptible to intestinal inflammation, whereas control mice can tolerate all types of bread without inflammation. Yet unidentified bread components other than gluten seem to play the major role.

33897715	The Evolving Landscape of Biomarkers in Celiac Disease: Leading the Way to Clinical Development.	Celiac disease is a common immune-mediated disease characterized by abnormal T-cell responses to gluten. For many patients, symptoms and intestinal damage can be controlled by a gluten-free diet, but, for some, this approach is not enough, and celiac disease progresses, with serious medical consequences. Multiple therapies are now under development, increasing the need for biomarkers that allow identification of specific patient populations and monitoring of therapeutic activity and durability. The advantage of identifying biomarkers in celiac disease is that the underlying pathways driving disease are well characterized and the histological, cellular, and serological changes with gluten response have been defined in gluten challenge studies. However, there is room for improvement. Biomarkers that measure histological changes require duodenal biopsies and are invasive. Less invasive peripheral blood cell and cytokine biomarkers are transient and dependent upon gluten challenge. Here, we discuss established biomarkers and new approaches for biomarkers that may overcome current limitations.
32425731	COVID-19 pandemic perception in adults with celiac disease: an impulse to implement the use of telemedicine.	Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes severe complications and deaths all over the world. COVID-19 also has indirect effects from the lockdown and the possible lack of food. We aimed to evaluate the perception of this in Celiac Disease (CeD) patients who require a lifelong gluten-free diet as a therapy. Methods: We invited by e-mail CeD adult patients from the University of Salerno (Campania, South Italy) and the University of Padua (Veneto, North Italy) to answer an ad hoc COVID-19 survey. Results: We sent the web survey to 651 email addresses and we received 276 answers (42,4%). CeD patients did not feel more vulnerable because they had CeD (not at all 56.6%) and they did not worry much about the possible shortness of gluten-free food during the epidemic (not at all 48.5%). The most worried were the elderly patients, patients with other comorbidities and females. Finally, CeD patients were happy with remote consultations and explicitly asked to have them. Discussion: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted a proportion of patients with CeD; in particular, women, elderly patients, patients with other comorbidities. COVID-19, although a challenging experience from the medical and the psychological point of view, has offered an opportunity to practice, on a large-scale, a remote consultation approach for CeD healthcare.
31851101	Bone Mineral Density in Patients With Celiac Disease: A Further Association With Extent of Disease on Capsule Endoscopy.	
35129887	[Cereal related complaints in children].	There's a lot of attention for gluten-free diets on social media. Doctors get many questions about gluten sensitivity or possible wheat allergy. With some basic knowledge, it's easier to give answers to these questions and to prevent unnecessary and sometimes harmful diets. This article gives basic information about cereals, gluten, grasses and their crossreactivity. We give an overview about the differences between celiac disease, gluten sensitivity and IgE-mediated wheat allergy. We also describe diagnostics, treatment and natural history of coeliakie, gluten sensitivity and wheat or cereal allergy.
31344206	[Clinical features and management of 205 adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus].	BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated the details of insulin therapy for type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) in Chile. AIM: To describe clinical features and treatment details of adults with T1D and its association with metabolic control. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Review of medical records of patients with T1D treated in a clinical network. Demographic and clinical features, types and doses of insulin and glycated hemoglobin levels were registered. The use flash glucose monitors (FGM) and insulin pumps (CSII) were also recorded. RESULTS: 205 records were reviewed, with T1d lasting 12 +- 10 years. Twenty six percent had hypothyroidism, 1% had celiac disease, 12% had hypertension, 20% had dyslipidemia; 13% had diabetic retinopathy, 2% had diabetic nephropathy, 8% had neuropathy and 2% cardiovascular diseases. Mean body mass index was 25 kg/ m2 and mean glycated hemoglobin was 8%. Eighty-two percent used multiple daily injections, 18% used CSII and 24% used FGM. As basal insulin, 35% used slow acting analogs and 65% used ultra-slow analogs. As rapid acting insulin, 69 patients used Lispro, 79 Aspart and 50 Glulisin. Bolus doses were calculated using only capillary glucose in 22%, while 78% also considered carbohydrate consumption. Variables significantly associated to better control were the use of carbohydrates for dosing rapid insulin (A1c 7,85% vs 8,59%, p = 0,008), use of CSII (A1c 7,36% vs 8,16%, p = 0,008), and basal dose < 0,4 U/kg (A1c 7,81% vs 8,58%, p = 0,003). There were no differences regarding insulin type or use of FGM. CONCLUSIONS: The use of formulas considering carbohydrates for dosing rapid insulin, use of infusion pumps and physiological doses of basal insulin are significantly associated with a better metabolic control in adults with T1d.
33837830	Gluten-degrading bacteria: availability and applications.	Gluten is a mixture of storage proteins in wheat and occurs in smaller amounts in other cereal grains. It provides favorable structure to bakery products but unfortunately causes disease conditions with increasing prevalence. In the human gastrointestinal tract, gluten is cleaved into proline and gluten rich peptides that are not degraded further. These peptides trigger immune responses that might lead to celiac disease, wheat allergy, and non-celiac gluten sensitivity. The main treatment option is a gluten-free diet. Alternatively, using enzymes or microorganisms with gluten-degrading properties might alleviate the disease. These components can be used during food production or could be introduced into the digestive tract as food supplements. In addition, natural food from the environment is known to enrich the microbial communities in gut and natural environmental microbial communities have high potential to degrade gluten. It remains to be investigated if food and environment-induced changes in the gut microbiome could contribute to the triggering of gluten-related diseases. KEY POINTS:   Wheat proteins, gluten, are incompletely digested in human digestive tract leading to gluten intolerance.   The only efficient treatment of gluten intolerance is life-long gluten-free diet.   Environmental bacteria acquired together with food could be source of gluten-degrading bacteria detoxifying undigested gluten peptides.
34787864	The role of gluten-free diet in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease development.	OBJECTIVE: Celiac Disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease involving the small bowel, generated by the ingestion of gluten-containing foods in genetically predisposed subjects. Currently, the unique therapy for CD is the absolute adherence to gluten-free diet, but this treatment has been related to the onset of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In this systematic review, we provide an update from the most recent studies on the risk of developing NAFLD patients adhering to GFD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: According to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Statement (PRISMA) criteria, we performed a systematic literature search on PubMed and Google Scholar from 2012 to 2021. RESULTS: In the present systematic review, eight studies investigated how GFD in CD patients may be a risk factor for the onset of NAFLD from a minimum of six months to the maximum follow-up period represented by a median of 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: Present systematic review evaluates how GFD plays a key role in NAFLD for consumption of products rich in saturated fats and carbohydrates that promotes accumulation of lipids and lead to hepatic steatosis and inflammation.
31627463	New Software for Gluten-Free Diet Evaluation and Nutritional Education.	Following a gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only treatment for celiac disease. This diet must ensure the absence of gluten but also needs to be nutritionally balanced. Dietitians working in this field cannot properly evaluate energy and nutrient intake of celiac people because dietary programs available on the market do not contain the nutritional composition of gluten-free products (GFP). Here we present a new GFD evaluation software that contains more than 700 gluten-free rendered foodstuffs and their macronutrient composition. Apart from diet evaluation and design, the software represents a tool for nutritional education as well, since it shows diet appropriacy and indicates how to promote balanced self-care. Moreover, anthropometric and biochemical data or symptoms presence and diet adherence can be recorded and evaluated. This open free software, can be downloaded in its app format for mobiles and tablets. Software evaluation indicated its correct functionality and the importance of assessing a GFD with GFP instead of with their gluten-containing analogues. Thus, this software represents an essential e-Health tool, not only for proper GFD evaluation, but also for improving life quality of celiac and gluten sensitive people.
30791371	The Impact of Autoantibodies on IVF Treatment and Outcome: A Systematic Review.	The role of autoantibodies in in vitro fertilization (IVF) has been discussed for almost three decades. Nonetheless, studies are still scarce and widely controversial. The aim of this study is to provide a comprehensive systematic review on the possible complications associated to autoantibodies (AA) impeding the chances of a successful IVF cycle. An Embase, PubMed/Medline and Cochrane Central Database search was performed on 1 December 2018, from 2006 until that date. From the 598 articles yielded in the search only 44 relevant articles ultimately fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were qualitatively analyzed. Five subsets of results were identified, namely, thyroid related AA, anti-phospholipid antibodies, anti-nuclear antibodies, AA affecting the reproductive system and AA related to celiac disease. It may be implied that the majority of auto-antibodies exert a statistically significant effect on miscarriage rates, whereas the effects on clinical pregnancy and live birth rates differ according to the type of auto-antibodies. While significant research is performed in the field, the quality of evidence provided is still low. The conduction of well-designed prospective cohort studies is an absolute necessity in order to define the impact of the different types of autoantibodies on IVF outcome.
29741603	Phenotype and Clinical Course of Inflammatory Bowel Disease With Co-existent Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammatory bowel diseases, principally Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, and celiac disease are among the most common immune-mediated gastrointestinal diseases. We aim to elucidate the clinical course and outcomes of patients with concomitant inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease, a unique population that remains scarcely studied to date. METHODS: A retrospective matched case-control study of adults with co-existent inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] and celiac disease was performed at a tertiary referral institution in North America. Logistic regression and Kaplan-Meier curves compared disease characteristics and clinical outcomes of the two groups. RESULTS: A total of 342 inflammatory bowel disease patients were included in this study, of whom 114 had co-existent celiac disease and 228 did not. Patients with co-existent inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease had higher rates of primary sclerosing cholangitis [19.3% vs 5.7%; odds ratio, 4.4; 95% confidence interval, 2.1-9.4; p <0.001], extensive ulcerative colitis [78.1% vs 59.0%; odds ratio, 2.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-5.5; p =0.002], and family history of celiac disease [10.5% vs 3.5%; odds ratio 3.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-8.2; p =0.01], compared with patients without concomitant celiac disease. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease with concomitant celiac disease have unique phenotypic features compared with non-celiac inflammatory bowel disease, with higher risks for colitis-related hospitalisations, extensive colitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Increased recognition of co-existent IBD and celiac disease can prompt clinicians to investigate for concomitant disease sooner, particularly in patients with seemingly refractory disease.

37242250	Nutritional Composition of Breakfast in Children and Adolescents with and without Celiac Disease in Spain-Role of Gluten-Free Commercial Products.	Eating a nutritionally balanced breakfast can be a challenge when following a gluten-free diet (GFD). We assessed the ingredients and nutrient composition of 364 gluten-free breakfast products (GFPs) and 348 gluten-containing counterparts (GCCs), and we analysed the nutritional quality of breakfast in a group of Spanish children and adolescents with celiac disease (CD) (n = 70), as compared to controls (n = 67). Food intakes were estimated using three 24 h dietary records. The composition of GFPs and GCCs was retrieved from the package labels of commercially available products. Most participants (98.5%) ate breakfast daily, and only one person in each group skipped breakfast once. The breakfast contribution of the total daily energy was 19% in participants with CD and 20% in controls. CD patients managed a balanced breakfast in terms of energy (54% from carbohydrates; 12% from proteins; 34% from lipids) and key food groups (cereals, dairy, fruits), but their intake of fruits needs improvement. Compared to controls, breakfast in the CD group provided less protein and saturated fat, a similar amount of carbohydrates and fibre, and more salt. Fibre is frequently added to GFPs, but these contain less protein because of the flours used in formulation. Gluten-free bread contains more fat and is more saturated than is GCC. Sugars, sweets, and confectionery contribute more to energy and nutrient intakes in participants with CD, while grain products do so in controls. Overall, breakfast on a GFD can be adequate, but can be improved by GFPs reformulation and a lower consumption of processed foods.
31008803	Protocol for the transition of pediatrics for adult medicine in celiac disease: a proposal approach.	
37204826	Gluten Immunogenic Peptides are not correlated with reported adherence to gluten-free diet in children with celiac disease.	OBJECTIVE: There is no gold standard to assess adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD) among patients with celiac disease (CeD). Gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) in urine and stool were suggested as novel markers for evaluating adherence to GFD. Our aim was to assess the presence of GIP in pediatric patients with CeD, and to compare the results with alternative methods for evaluating GFD adherence. METHODS: Pediatric patients diagnosed with CeD, who were on GFD for at least one year, were enrolled and followed prospectively between November 2018 and January 2021. Study visits included clinical assessment, a dietitian interview, Biagi score, food questionnaires, anthropometric and laboratory measurements; and urine and stool samples obtained for laboratory GIP analysis. RESULTS: The study included 74 patients (63.5% females), with median (IQR) age of 9.9 (7.8-11.7) years, and median (IQR) duration on GFD of 2.5 (2-5.5) years. Good GFD adherence, assessed by Biagi score, was reported in 93.1% of cases. GIP was evaluated during 134 visits, with GIP detected in 27/134 (20.1%) of the visits (16.3% of stool samples and 5.3% of urine samples). Positive GIP results were significantly more common in males compared to females (30.6% vs. 14.1%, respectively, p<0.05). Detection of positive GIP was not associated with dietary assessment of GFD adherence, celiac serology results, or reported symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Stool and urine GIP can be detected in children with CeD, even when dietary assessment indicate good adherence to GFD. The role of GIP testing in clinical practice should be further explored.
35893918	Dietary Acid Load in Gluten-Free Diets: Results from a Cross-Sectional Study.	The gluten-free diet (GFD) ensures improvement of clinical symptoms in the vast majority of celiac disease (CD) patients. Despite stable CD rates in many countries, an increasing number of healthy individuals are adopting gluten-free diets, believing that this diet is an inherently healthier choice. The health effects of gluten-free diets are controversial, and a recent study added to the debate by reporting a lower acidogenic potential of this diet. The effects of the GFD on potential renal acid load (PRAL) and net endogenous acid production (NEAP)-two important markers of dietary acid load (DAL)-are poorly understood, and have never been examined in a Western population. Using cross-sectional data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, we estimated DAL in U.S. individuals reporting a GFD and contrasted the results to the general U.S. population consuming gluten and denying special diets. The GFD was associated with significantly lower crude DAL scores, and after adjustments for confounders in multivariate regression, the results remain significant. Yet, our study could not confirm the reported alkalizing properties of the GFD. Although overall DAL scores were significantly lower in the GFD group, they were comparable to Western diets producing 50-75 mEq of acid per day.
29194702	The role of TMPRSS6 and HFE variants in iron deficiency anemia in celiac disease.	We investigated the role of HFE C282Y, H63D, and TMPRSS6 A736V variants in the pathogenesis of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in celiac disease (CD) patients, at diagnosis and after 1 year of gluten-free diet (GFD). Demographic and clinical features were prospectively recorded for all CD patients between 2013 and 2017. C282Y, H63D, and A736V variants were evaluated for CD patients and controls. Finally, 505 consecutive CD patients and 539 age-matched control subjects were enrolled. At diagnosis, 229 CD subjects had IDA (45.3%), with a subgroup of anemic patients (45.4%) presented persistent IDA at follow-up. C282Y allele frequency was significantly increased in CD compared with controls (1.1% vs 0.2%, P = .001), whereas H63D and A736V allele frequencies were similar among patients and controls (P = .92 and .84, respectively). At diagnosis, C282Y variant in anemic CD patients was significantly increased compared to nonanemic group (2% and 0.5%, P = .04). At follow-up, A736V was significantly increased in IDA persistent than in IDA not persistent (57.7% vs 35.2%, P < .0001). CD patients with H63D mutation showed higher Hb, MCV, serum iron, and ferritin levels than subjects without HFE mutations. Decreased hepcidin values were observed in anemic compared to nonanemic subjects at follow-up (1.22 +- 1.14 vs 2.08 +- 2.15, P < .001). This study suggests a protective role of HFE in IDA CD patients and confirms the role of TMPRSS6 in predicting oral iron response modulating hepcidin action on iron absorption. Iron supplementation therapeutic management in CD could depend on TMPRSS6 genotype that could predict persistent IDA despite iron supplementation and GFD.
33673062	Relationship between Persistent Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Duodenal Histological Findings after Adequate Gluten-Free Diet: A Gray Area of Celiac Disease Management in Adult Patients.	A gluten-free diet (GFD) leads to a rapid improvement in gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, biochemical alterations and duodenal histological damage in the majority of celiac disease (CD) patients. This study aimed to assess the frequency and factors associated with the persistence of GI symptoms/malabsorption signs and their relationship with duodenal histological findings among CD patients on an adequate GFD (mean duration 16 months, range 12-28 months). This longitudinal cohort study included 102 adult CD patients (median age 38.5 years, range 18-76 years, F = 71.6%) diagnosed between 2012 and 2018. A total of 36.3% of the included patients had persistent GI symptoms and/or malabsorption signs (Group 1), while the remaining patients had complete GI well-being without malabsorption signs (Group 2) at the time of histological re-evaluation. The persistence of GI symptoms/signs was associated with a long duration of symptoms/signs before CD diagnosis (>=5 years) (OR 5.3; 95% CI 1.3-21.8) and the presence of constipation at the time of CD diagnosis (OR 7.5; 95% CI 1.3-42) while for other variables, including age at CD diagnosis, sex, duration of GFD, comorbidities, CD serology positivity and severity of duodenal damage at histological re-evaluation, no association was found. According to our results, the persistence of symptoms/signs is not associated with histological findings, and their relationship could be a gray area in CD management.
34836247	The Gluten-Free Diet for Celiac Disease and Beyond.	The gluten-free diet (GFD) has gained popularity beyond its main medical indication as the treatment for gluten-induced immune-mediated disorders such as celiac disease (CD), dermatitis herpetiformis, gluten ataxia, wheat allergy, and non-celiac gluten sensitivity. However, the diet carries some disadvantages such as elevated costs, nutritional deficiencies, and social and psychological barriers. The present work aims to review indications, proven benefits, and adverse events of a gluten-free diet. Close follow-up with patients following the diet is recommended. More data is needed to assess the effectiveness of the diet in managing mental and cognitive disorders and to establish a connection between the brain and gluten.
32740074	Probiotics for Celiac Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.	INTRODUCTION: Many patients with celiac disease (CD) experience persistent symptoms despite adhering to the gluten-free diet. Different studies have assessed the use of probiotics as an adjuvant treatment for CD. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics in improving gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and quality of life (QOL) in patients with CD. METHODS: We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, CENTRAL, and DARE databases up to February 2019 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating probiotics compared with placebo for treating CD. We collected data on GI symptoms, QOL, adverse events, serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha, intestinal permeability, and microbiota composition. RESULTS: We screened 2,831 records and found that 7 articles describing 6 RCTs (n = 279 participants) were eligible for quantitative analysis. Probiotics improved GI symptoms when assessed by the GI Symptoms Rating Scale (mean difference symptom reduction: -28.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -43.96 to -13.52; P = 0.0002). There was no difference in GI symptoms after probiotics when different questionnaires were pooled. The levels of Bifidobacteria increased after probiotics (mean difference: 0.85 log colony-forming units (CFU) per gram; 95% CI 0.38-1.32 log CFU per gram; P = 0.0003). There were insufficient data on tumor necrosis factor-a levels or QOL for probiotics compared with placebo. No difference in adverse events was observed between probiotics and placebo. The overall certainty of the evidence ranged from very low to low. DISCUSSION: Probiotics may improve GI symptoms in patients with CD. High-quality clinical trials are needed to improve the certainty in the evidence (see Visual abstract, Supplementary Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/AJG/B595).
31688364	Effect of a Gluten-free Diet on Quality of Life in Patients With Nonclassical Versus Classical Presentations of Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) often presents with symptoms of diarrhea and malabsorption, termed classical CD. However, it can also present as nonclassical CD, which is commonly associated with nongastrointestinal symptoms. Studies suggest that nonclassical CD tends to have less severe symptoms than classical CD, which may affect both adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) and psychological stress. Therefore, we compared adherence to a GFD and psychological measures, including quality of life (QOL) and somatization, between patients with nonclassical and classical presentations of CD. METHODS: Patients at a tertiary care center with biopsy-proven CD, who completed a Talley Bowel Disease Questionnaire and the Short Form-36 at diagnosis and who had been on a GFD for at least 1 year, were included in this study. Patients were further surveyed to assess gastrointestinal symptoms, QOL, Somatization Symptom Checklist (SSC), and adherence to a GFD. Results were compared between patients with classical versus nonclassical CD presentation. RESULTS: Among 122 patients included in this study, 62 had classical CD and 60 had nonclassical CD. At diagnosis, health-related QOL was lower in the classical CD group than in the nonclassical CD group. After following a GFD, both groups had improved QOL after following a GFD, and body mass index significantly increased in both groups. Most subscales of QOL, SSC scores, and adherence to the GFD were similar between the groups, except the Short Form-36 Mental Component summary scores that were still lower in the classical CD (48.4 vs. 52.6 nonclassical CD group; P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Despite QOL at diagnosis being higher in those with nonclassical CD versus lower in those with classical CD, both groups had improved QOL and achieved a similar QOL after following a GFD.
33183548	Inconsistent effects of gluten on obesity: is there a role for the haptoglobin isoforms?	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There is no clear evidence about the effects of gluten intake on obesity. It is known that gluten's effects on gut permeability are mediated by zonulin, a protein identified as pre-haptoglobin 2, a physiological regulator of the intestinal barrier. We investigated the obesogenic and inflammatory effects of gluten and its association with the haptoglobin genotype. METHODS: This was a single blinded, crossover study, including 40 overweight or obesity women free of celiac disease. Participants adopted a gluten-free diet (GFD) for 8 weeks and consumed a gluten-free muffin (GF-M) or a gluten-containing muffin (GLU-M, 24 g gluten) for 4 weeks, switching muffin type during the subsequent 4 weeks. During a follow-up period of 4 weeks we evaluated the usual diet (UD). Food diaries were collected to estimate the macronutrient intake and dietary inflammatory index (DII ). Bodyweight and composition, resting energy expenditure (REE), and cytokines were assessed. Haptoglobin alleles (Hp1 and Hp2) were genotyped to characterize zonulin expression. RESULTS: Energy and macronutrient intakes were similar during both periods, except for protein intake, which was higher during GLU-M. DII scores indicated a more inflammatory profile during the GF-M and GLU-M periods compared to UD. No differences were observed in body composition or REE between interventions when the Hp genotype was not considered. Nonetheless, those carrying the Hp2-2 genotype (overexpressing zonulin) presented lower REE and higher levels of IL6 and IL1beta only during gluten intake (GLU-M and UD) compared to age- and body mass index-matched Hp1-1 carrier. These results suggest an obesogenic and inflammatory action of gluten only in those overexpressing zonulin (Hp2-2). CONCLUSION: These results highlight the importance of zonulin as the mediator of gluten obesogenic and inflammatory effects. Our data suggest that in the presence of gluten, zonulin release is associated with a reduction of REE and an increase of inflammatory markers that are not seen in zonulin low producers.
33267589	Adherence to a gluten-free diet and quality of life in Chilean celiac patients.	INTRODUCTION: a gluten-free diet (GFD) is the treatment for celiac disease (CD), with adherence oscillating between 42 % and 91 %. The purpose of this study was to assess adherence to GFD and its relation to quality of life in Chilean celiac patients. METHODS: three surveys were performed on-line: sociodemographic-health status, adherence to GFD and quality of life. RESULTS: forty-eight per cent of respondents reported an excellent adherence to GFD and 49 % a good quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: adherence to GFD is low among Chilean celiac patients.
29670007	Prevalence of Self-Reported Gluten-Related Disorders and Adherence to a Gluten-Free Diet in Salvadoran Adult Population.	Gluten-related disorders are not considered of relevance at public health level in Central America. The prevalence of gluten-related disorders, and adherence to a gluten-free diet, remain unknown in the Central American region. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of the Central American population from San Salvador, El Salvador, to estimate the prevalence rates of self-reported gluten-related disorders and adherence to a gluten-free diet. 1326 individuals were surveyed. Self-reported prevalence rates were (95% Confidence Interval): gluten sensitivity 3.1% (2.3&ndash;4.2); physician-diagnosed celiac disease 0.15% (0.04&ndash;0.5); wheat allergy 0.75% (0.4&ndash;1.3); non-celiac gluten sensitivity 0.98% (0.5&ndash;1.6). The prevalence rate of adherence to a gluten-free diet was 7.0% (5.7&ndash;8.5). Seven self-reported physician diagnosed gluten-sensitive cases informed the co-existence of non-celiac gluten sensitivity with celiac disease and/or wheat allergy. Among the non-self-reported gluten sensitivity individuals following a gluten-free diet, 50% reported that they were seeing a health professional for gluten-free dietary advice. Gluten sensitivity is commonly reported in Salvadoran population, but some health professionals acknowledge the coexistence of wheat allergy, celiac disease, and non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Among studies at population level, the prevalence of adherence to a gluten-free diet in Salvadoran population is the highest reported until now. However, just a few of the gluten-free diet followers were doing it for health-related benefits; the others reported weight control and the perception that the diet is healthier as the main motivation for adopting such a diet.
30221333	Systematic Literature Review of the Economic Burden of Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND: The prevalence of celiac disease (CD) has rapidly increased over recent decades, but costs related to CD remain poorly quantified. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review assessed the economic burden of CD in North America and Europe. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, EconLit, and the Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched to identify English-language literature from 2007 to 2018 that assessed costs, cost effectiveness, and health resource utilization for CD. RESULTS: Forty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 28 (57.1%) addressed costs of testing and diagnosis; 33 (67.3%) were from Europe. The cost per positive CD diagnosis of testing patients already undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy for other indications ranged from 1300 Canadian dollars ($Can) in Canada (2016 value) to $44,712 in the Netherlands (2013 value). Adding the CD test was cost effective when it combined diagnostic modalities (e.g., serology and biopsy). Direct annual excess costs to a US payer per diagnosed CD patient totaled $US6000 (2013 value) more than for a person without CD, chiefly due to outpatient care. Hospitalizations, emergency visits, and medication use were more common with CD. After initiating a gluten-free diet (GFD), patients visited primary care providers less often, used more medications, and missed fewer days from school and work. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the few available economic studies of CD assess testing and diagnosis costs, especially in Europe. Methods of testing generally are considered cost effective when they combine diagnostic modalities in symptomatic patients. Most costs to a payer of managing CD derive from outpatient care. Following GFD initiation, patients lose fewer days from work and school than pretreatment.
29561985	REVIEW OF CELIAC DISEASE PRESENTATION IN A PEDIATRIC TERTIARY CENTRE.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is an immune-mediated disorder with a multiform presentation and therefore a challenging diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: Our purpose is to identify the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and histologic characteristics of children with celiac disease at diagnosis and on follow-up. METHODS: Children with previously established or newly diagnosed celiac disease, admitted in a tertiary centre in a two-year period (2014-2016) were recruited. Data was collected retrospectively from electronic medical records and clinical notes, and subsequently analysed with SPSS version 20.0. RESULTS: A total of 159 patients, out of 312, were included. Age ranged from 1 to 17 years (mean +- SD: 8.5+-4.5 years, 69% girls). Disease presentation was classical in 60%, non-classical in 25%, subclinical in 10% and 5% classified as potential celiac disease. Non-classical and subclinical profiles had a higher mean age at presentation but not statistically significant (P-value 0.24). The most frequent gastrointestinal features at presentation were abdominal pain (58%), diarrhea (43%) and bloating (27%). A positive family history for celiac disease was present in 24% (n=35). We found anaemia in 23%, low ferritin in 63% and a moderate to severe deficiency of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in 62%. celiac disease -specific serologic testing and esophagogastroduodenoscopy were performed in 99%. Histology revealed modified Marsh 2 or 3 enteropathy in 94%, the remaining had normal histology but positive human leukocyte antigen typing. Clinical improvement at 12 months of gluten-free diet was complete in 51% and partial in 49%. IgA tTG normalized after 12-30 months of gluten-free diet in 45%. On growth assessment at diagnosis and after 12-28 months of gluten-free diet, 100% had height increase (mean +-SD: 7.11+-4.43 cm) and 96% weight gain (mean +-SD: 5.60+-4.91 kg). CONCLUSION: Our findings outline the diverse clinical presentations of pediatric celiac disease that should be considered irrespective of age. Increased clinician's awareness will enable an early diagnosis and treatment, with subsequent symptom and nutritional status improvement.
30833539	Severe Coagulopathy as a Rare Feature of Celiac Crisis in a Patient Previously Diagnosed with Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND Celiac crisis is an uncommon but critical complication of celiac disease (CD) manifesting with copious diarrhea, dehydration, and severe metabolic imbalances. Celiac crisis occurring in individuals who have been formerly diagnosed with CD and displaying severe coagulopathy is tremendously rare. CASE REPORT We report a case of a 76-year-old male, previously diagnosed with CD and non-compliant with gluten free diet, who presented with severe coagulopathy manifesting as gastrointestinal bleeding in addition to other features of celiac crisis, including severe diarrhea, dehydration, metabolic acidosis, electrolyte disturbances, and renal dysfunction. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed flattened mucosa and mucosal nodularity in the duodenum. Duodenal biopsies exhibited active chronic inflammation with intraepithelial lymphocytosis and subtotal villous blunting. The patient was diagnosed with celiac crisis and treatment with vitamin K, parenteral nutrition, and steroids was commenced. After initial clinical improvement, a gluten-free diet was implemented with complete resolution of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Though celiac crisis typically presents in patients with undiagnosed CD, it should be considered in patients who have been previously diagnosed CD but who are non-compliant with gluten free diet. Severe coagulopathy, though extremely rare, can be a feature of celiac crisis and should be consider when encountered in a patient with history of steatorrhea and gastrointestinal bleeding.
30562306	The Effect of Gluten-free Diet on Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Newly Diagnosed Pediatric Celiac Disease Patients.	OBJECTIVES: Although gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only proven therapy for celiac disease (CD), its effect on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors is still unclear. Our aim was to determine whether adherence to GFD affects CVD risk factors among newly diagnosed pediatric CD subjects. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled pediatric subjects undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for suspected CD. We collected anthropometric and laboratory parameters related to CVD risk factors at the time of CD diagnosis and 1 year after initiation of a GFD and evaluated changes in CVD risk factors. Paired t tests or Wilcoxon nonparametric tests were used, each when appropriate. RESULTS: One hundred ten newly diagnosed CD pediatric subjects were included in the analysis. There were 64 (58.2%) girls and the mean age at diagnosis was 6.8 +- 3.4 years. Median body mass index z scores (P = 0.84), rates of underweight or overweight (P = 0.32), and rates of elevated blood pressure (P = 0.78) remained unchanged. Although median fasting insulin levels increased (1.9 vs 5.4 muU/mL, P < 0.001), insulin resistance as measured by homeostatic model assessment did not increase after 1 year of GFD (P = 0.16). Although rates of dyslipidemia remained unchanged, median high-density lipoprotein levels increased on GFD (47 vs 51 mg/dL, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In this pediatric CD cohort, GFD for 1 year was not associated with increased CVD risk factors. The long-term significance of these mild changes is yet to be determined.
32751809	Celiac Dietary Adherence Test and Standardized Dietician Evaluation in Assessment of Adherence to a Gluten-Free Diet in Patients with Celiac Disease.	Adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) is currently the mainstay of treatment strategy for celiac disease (CD). The aim of our study was measuring a GFD adherence in CD patients using two newly validated methods of dietary assessment-Standardized Dietician Evaluation (SDE) and the Celiac Dietary Adherence Test (CDAT). Ninety-two adults with CD were evaluated by a registered dietitian with extensive experience with the use of SDE and CDAT. Duodenal biopsy was performed and blood was drawn for serum anti-endomysial, anti-deamidated gliadin peptide and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies in forty four of those patients. The results of CDAT and SDE were very convergent, but SDE scores better correlated with serologic and histologic findings. As many as 24-52% of study participants did not adhere well enough to a GFD. Insufficient adherence to a GFD in CD patients is still a significant problem. The knowledge about gluten content in food ingredients and additives is very low among adults with CD. SDE is the most accurate method in assessing compliance with a GFD and is especially helpful in determining hidden sources of gluten. The CDAT may be a fast tool for screening for a GFD adherence in CD patients.
30413127	Celiac Male's Gluten-Free Diet Profile: Comparison to that of the Control Population and Celiac Women.	The aim of the present work was to analyze the body composition and dietary profile of Spanish celiac men and to compare them to control men and celiac women from our previous studies. Forty-two celiac men (31.5 +- 11.9 years) were recruited and anthropometric measurements were taken. Analysis of energy consumption, macro- and micronutrient intake and food frequency consumption was carried out. Celiac men were more overweight and obese than celiac women, but less than the control population, reporting the same energy intake and macronutrient distribution. Most micronutrient deficiencies in celiac men were not directly related to a gluten free diet; these were also observed for the entire population. The least adherence to Dietary Reference Intakes in women was reported for iron, iodine, potassium and selenium, whereas magnesium intake was higher than in men. Among celiac participants (both genders), cereal, vegetable and legume consumption was poor and meat intake was contrastingly excessive. In conclusion, the dietary profile of celiac men is as unbalanced as that of control men but slightly more than that of celiac women. General nutritional education should be given to both general and celiac populations, and specific advices to celiac men, in order to decrease the risk of celiac disease-related pathologies.
29797748	When your patient's parent asks: "My child's alopecia areata is not getting better. Should he or she get tested for celiac disease?"	The relationship between alopecia areata and celiac disease has been suspected for more than 20 years. For a particular individual with alopecia areata, the risk of coexisting celiac disease and the potential benefit of a gluten-free diet on hair loss or regrowth is known. Despite this limited information, patients often aske dermatologists whether they should undergo celiac disease testing or begin a gluten-free diet. We reviewed all available studies of the relationship between alopecia areata and celiac disease to provide guidance to practicing clinicians.
32654085	Enteric-Release Budesonide May Be Useful in the Management of Non-Responsive Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND: Non-responsive celiac disease (NRCD) has many aetiologies, including gluten exposure. Budesonide may be used for refractory celiac disease (RCD) and celiac crisis. AIMS: We reviewed the effectiveness of budesonide to induce clinical and histologic response in NRCD with villous atrophy (VA). METHODS: Case series of adult cases with NRCD and VA prescribed budesonide at two celiac centers. Clinical variables and mucosal recovery (i.e., normal villous architecture within 1 year of treatment) were evaluated. RESULTS: Forty-two cases [77% female, median age 45.0 (IQR 28.3-60.0) years] were included. Most common symptoms were diarrhea (64%) and abdominal pain (62%). Budesonide was initiated at 9 mg (83%) for a median duration of 16.0 weeks (IQR 6.8-25.0 weeks). In total, 57% exhibited a clinical response, positively associated with diarrhea (adjusted OR 6.08 95% CI 1.04-35.47) and negatively with fatigue (adjusted OR 0.18 95% CI 0.03-0.98). Clinical response was higher among those with dietitian counseling prior to budesonide (n = 29, 70 vs. 23%, p < 0.01). Mucosal recovery was observed in 11/24 with follow-up duodenal biopsies. There was no association between clinical response and mucosal recovery, and 79% of clinical responders had a symptomatic relapse. RCD (48%) and chronic gluten exposure (24%) were the main suspected aetiologies of NRCD. Most individuals without a clinical response subsequently received an IBS-related diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Budesonide may be effective to induce clinical response in NRCD presenting with diarrhea and VA, but clinical recurrence and lack of mucosal recovery are frequent after tapering. Other diagnoses, including coexisting IBS, may be considered in non-responders to budesonide therapy.
29380821	Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Crossover Trial for the Diagnosis of Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity in Children.	OBJECTIVES: Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is characterized by intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms that are related to the ingestion of gluten in subjects who are not affected by either celiac disease (CD) or wheat allergy (WA). In this multicenter study, we aim for the first time to evaluate the prevalence of NCGS in pediatric subjects with chronic functional gastrointestinal symptoms associated with gluten ingestion using a double-blind placebo-controlled (DBPC) gluten challenge with crossover. METHODS: Among 1,114 children with chronic gastrointestinal symptoms (negative CD and WA), those exhibiting a positive correlation between symptoms and gluten ingestion were eligible for a diagnostic challenge including the following phases: run-in, open gluten-free diet (GFD) and DBPC crossover gluten challenge. Patients were randomized to gluten (10 g/daily) and placebo (rice starch) for 2 weeks each, separated by a washout week. The gluten challenge was considered positive in the presence of a minimum 30% decrease of global visual analogue scale between gluten and placebo. RESULTS: Out of 1,114 children, 96.7% did not exhibit any correlation with gluten ingestion. Thirty-six children were eligible; after the run-in and open GFD, 28 patients entered the gluten challenge. Eleven children (39.2%; 95% CI: 23.6-53.6%) tested positive. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first demonstration of the existence of NCGS in children that reinforce the need for a DBPC for the diagnosis as the diagnosis is ruled out in >60% of cases. The registration identifier in ClinicalsTrials.gov is NCT02431585.
30759766	The Impact of Low-FODMAPs, Gluten-Free, and Ketogenic Diets on Gut Microbiota Modulation in Pathological Conditions.	The gut microbiota performs several essential protective, structural, and metabolic functions for host health. The maintenance of a beneficial microbiota requires a homeostatic equilibrium within microbial communities, and between the microorganisms and the host. The gut microbiota composition may be affected by external factors, among them diet habits may be considered most important. In some pathological conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), celiac disease (CD), or neurological disorders (ND), specific dietary regimens as low-fermentable, oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyols (FODMAPs), ketogenic (KD), and gluten-free (GFD) diets are considered therapeutic. These kinds of diets are characterized by a reduction or exclusion of a specific nutrient from the entire dietary pattern. Despite these alimentary regimens showing beneficial effects on disease symptoms, they can affect microbiota composition, especially if they are protracted for a long time. To date, only a few studies have reported the effects of these diets on gut microbiota. In this review, we discuss the effects of low-FODMAPs, KD, and GFD on gut microbiota modulation in pathological conditions, advancing the possibility of depicting a balanced diet and developing personalized dietary intervention protocols.
36780094	Patterns of practice in the diagnosis, dietary counselling and follow-up of patients with celiac disease- A patient-based survey.	BACKGROUND: The pattern of practice regarding the diagnosis, dietary counselling and follow-up of patients with celiac disease (CeD) varies between practice to practice. METHODS: A web-based questionnaire based on review of literature, group discussions and expert group meetings was developed to understand the practice of CeD in India. The questionnaire was administered through social media (WhatsApp) to 18 Indian celiac support groups comprising 2980 patients with CeD. RESULTS: Overall, 970 (32.5%) patients responded to the questionnaire (median age: 21 years; females 63.9%). While 679 (71.1%) patients were diagnosed based on a combination of serology and biopsy, 214 (22.4%) were diagnosed based on serology alone. After diagnosis, 875 (91%) patients were counselled initially by physician and only 585 (61%) were referred to a dietician for dietary counselling. In a majority of cases, the time spent by doctors and dietitians during first counselling was between 10 and 20 minutes only. After first counselling, 191 (20%) and 355 (37.3%) patients did not re-visit the physician and the dietitian, respectively. Among those who followed up, structured follow-up was conducted in only 515 (53.8%) patients. Overall, 232 (24.3%) patients were self-monitoring their serological parameters, while 495 (51.8%) patients did not receive a formal assessment of dietary adherence during follow-up. CONCLUSION: The practice of diagnosis, dietary counselling and follow-up of patients with CeD in India is not as per standard guidelines. Most of the patients are not referred to a dietitian. There is a need for reinforcement of guidelines for proper care and management of patients with CeD.
30700359	Intestinal Spirocheteosis in a Patient with Celiac Disease.	A young girl presented to us with recurrent diarrhea along with a history of 5 kg weight loss in one year. On examination, she appeared pale, while her laboratory reports showed a low hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and serum albumin. Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was slightly raised with her iron profile suggestive of iron deficiency anemia. Viral markers, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serology along with thyroid profile were all unremarkable. There was no history of tuberculosis, and purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test was also negative. Computed tomography (CT) abdomen showed thickening of the terminal ileum with multiple enlarged lymph nodes. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) along with colonoscopy was done. Multiple biopsies were taken, which were suggestive of sprue along with intestinal spirochetosis. Her tissue transglutaminase (TTG) was negative while deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP) was positive. She was kept on gluten-free diet and started on tablet metronidazole. This case shows that intestinal spirochetosis should be kept in mind in patients belonging to lower socio-economic status, who present with chronic diarrhea symptoms.
29382373	Refeeding syndrome in adults with celiac crisis: a case report.	BACKGROUND: Refeeding syndrome is a rare and life-threatening pathology with polyvisceral manifestations occurring in severely malnourished patients. It is rarely described in adults with celiac disease. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 28-year-old Tunisian woman followed up for celiac disease, who did not adhere to the gluten-free diet. She presented to our hospital with celiac crisis manifested by severe diarrhea, and metabolic and electrolyte disturbances. The treatment of electrolyte abnormalities, hydration, and nutritional support was marked by the occurrence on the fifth day of refeeding syndrome with psychomotor agitation followed by respiratory distress and a state of cardiogenic shock. CONCLUSIONS: Refeeding syndrome is still under-recognized. It should be systematically prevented for high-risk patients. Nutritional support in patients with celiac crisis should be monitored carefully since the risk of refeeding syndrome is very high with a poor prognosis.
31781909	A miRNA-Based Blood and Mucosal Approach for Detecting and Monitoring Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND: The role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in celiac disease (CD) is unclear. AIMS: We evaluated inflammation-related miRNA-146a, miRNA-155, miRNA-21, and miRNA-125b expression in peripheral blood and intestinal mucosa of CD adults. METHODS: Thirty patients with CD were included: patients with active CD on a gluten-containing diet (CD-active, n = 10), patients on a gluten-free diet (for at least 1 year), and patients with negative blood antibodies (CD-inactivePE, n = 10). In addition, ten healthy volunteers formed the comparison/control group. MiRNA expression was measured in duodenal biopsies from patients (CD-inactiveMU, n = 10) after in vitro exposure to PT gliadin and 33-mer peptide. MiRNAs expression was measured in plasma and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and monocytes, before and after in vitro exposure to native gliadin (gliadinN). RESULTS: Expression levels of miRNA-146a, miRNA-155, and miRNA-21 in PBMCs, miRNA-155 in monocytes and miRNA-155, miRNA-21, and miRNA-125b in plasma were elevated in both groups of celiac patients. After in vitro exposure with gliadinN, miRNA-146a and miRNA-155 expression markedly increased in PBMCs and monocytes, while miRNA-155 and miRNA-21 increased in the CD-active group. MiRNAs expression in intestinal mucosa did not change. MiRNA-146a and miRNA-155 expression showed high sensitivity and specificity for the presence of CD, irrespective of the current dietary treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Selected inflammation-related miRNAs expression is elevated in the peripheral blood of celiac. This suggests their participation in the immune processes underlying the pathology. Their similar response in active and inactive CD suggests that they should be further evaluated, as potential diagnostic biomarkers for CD.
31888055	Celiac Disease: A Common Unrecognized Health Problem with a Very Delayed Diagnosis.	Celiac disease (CD) is a clinical entity of autoimmune nature, related to the presence of a permanent gluten intolerance that affects genetically predisposed individuals, producing a chronic inflammation process that usually occurs in the small bowel [...].
36751856	Gluten-free diet affects fecal small non-coding RNA profiles and microbiome composition in celiac disease supporting a host-gut microbiota crosstalk.	Current treatment for celiac disease (CD) is adhering to a gluten-free diet (GFD), although its long-term molecular effects are still undescribed. New molecular features detectable in stool may improve and facilitate noninvasive clinical management of CD. For this purpose, fecal small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) and gut microbiome profiles were concomitantly explored in CD subjects in relation to strict (or not) GFD adherence over time. In this observational study, we performed small RNA and shotgun metagenomic sequencing in stool from 63 treated CD (tCD) and 3 untreated subjects as well as 66 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. tCD included 51 individuals on strict GFD and with negative transglutaminase (TG) serology (tCD-TG-) and 12 symptomatic with not strict/short-time of GFD adherence and positive TG serology (tCD-TG+). Samples from additional 40 healthy adult individuals and a cohort of 19 untreated pediatric CD subjects and 19 sex/age matched controls were analyzed to further test the outcomes. Several miRNA and microbial profiles were altered in tCD subjects (adj. p < .05). Findings were validated in the external group of adult controls. In tCD-TG-, GFD duration correlated with five miRNA levels (p < .05): for miR-4533-3p and miR-2681-3p, the longer the diet adherence, the less the expression differed from controls. tCD-TG+ and untreated pediatric CD patients showed a similar miRNA dysregulation. Immune-response, trans-membrane transport and cell death pathways were enriched in targets of identified miRNAs. Bifidobacterium longum, Ruminococcus bicirculans, and Haemophilus parainfluenzae abundances shifted (adj. p < .05) with a progressive reduction of denitrification pathways with GFD length. Integrative analysis highlighted 121 miRNA-bacterial relationships (adj. p < .05). Specific molecular patterns in stool characterize CD subjects, reflecting either the long-term GFD effects or the gut inflammatory status, in case of a not strict/short-time adherence. Our findings suggest novel host-microbial interplays and could help the discovery of biomarkers for GFD monitoring over time.
35404303	Evidence-Based and Emerging Diet Recommendations for Small Bowel Disorders.	Diet plays a key role in the manifestation and severity of gastrointestinal symptoms, with increasing research interest on the role of diet in small bowel disorders. There are predominantly 3 small bowel conditions that have potential dietary interventions. Self-reported nonceliac gluten/wheat sensitivity is prevalent. Although gluten is believed to be a potential trigger for symptoms, other components of wheat may also be triggers, including fructans, alpha-amylase trypsin inhibitors, and wheat germ agglutinins. The diagnosis can be challenging, given the lack of validated biomarkers. A gluten-free diet that excludes the abovementioned triggers is the cornerstone of treatment; however, unlike celiac disease, there is uncertainty about the level of adherence or whether the gluten-free diet is a lifelong intervention. Several primary gastrointestinal disorders are associated with an increase in inflammatory cells including eosinophils. Diet seems to be an important driver of disease pathogenesis in eosinophilic gastroenteritis, with elimination and elemental diets showing promise in management, with further robust trials required. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is an example of microbial dysbiosis, with renewed interest in diet being postulated to cause an adaptive change of the microbes colonizing the small intestine. However, the diagnosis of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is limited by a lack of sensitive and specific tests, with significant knowledge gaps in relation to therapeutic measures to manage and cure small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Currently, antimicrobials are the established management option. There have been significant clinical advances in dietary interventions related to the small bowel, but this area is currently a novel and advancing field for both patients and clinicians.
34684433	Iron Deficiency in Celiac Disease: Prevalence, Health Impact, and Clinical Management.	Iron is an essential nutrient to life and is required for erythropoiesis, oxidative, metabolism, and enzymatic activities. It is a cofactor for mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes, the citric acid cycle, and DNA synthesis, and it promotes the growth of immune system cells. Thus, iron deficiency (ID) leads to deleterious effects on the overall health of individuals, causing significant morbidity. Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is the most recognized type of anemia in patients with celiac disease (CD) and may be present in over half of patients at the time of diagnosis. Folate and vitamin B12 malabsorption, nutritional deficiencies, inflammation, blood loss, development of refractory CD, and concomitant Heliobacter pylori infection are other causes of anemia in such patients. The decision to replenish iron stores and the route of administration (oral or intravenous) are controversial due, in part, to questions surrounding the optimal formulation and route of administration. This paper provides an algorithm based on the severity of symptoms; its impact on the health-related quality of life (HRQL); the tolerance and efficiency of oral iron; and other factors that predict a poor response to oral iron, such as the severity of histological damage, poor adherence to GFD, and blood loss due to mucosal lesions.
36778054	Association of Serum Albumin, Globulin, and Transferrin Levels in Children of Poorly Managed Celiac Disease.	Background: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune genetic disorder in which gluten protein causes inflammation of the intestinal enterocytes. CD diagnosis in most cases is delayed or mistreated due to its varied clinical features. We aimed to evaluate the protein profile imbalance in different CD groups of children, which could help aid in the diagnosis and proper management of the disease. Methodology. This was a cross-sectional study with a nonrandom purposive sampling technique. All samples were taken from tertiary care hospitals of Hyderabad, Pakistan. In total, there were 175 children (age 3-15 years) divided into five equal groups (n = 35), namely, group A (control), group B (celiac diagnosed), group C (celiac-like symptoms), group D (celiac with type 1 diabetes mellitus), and group E (type 1 diabetes mellitus only). Clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters were analyzed among all the groups. Sera proteins, albumin, globulins, and transferrin levels were evaluated and compared with healthy individuals. Results: The albumin in serum of celiac groups B and C was 3.0 g/dl and 2.8 g/dl, respectively. While in diabetic patients with CD, it is 2.7 g/dl. The globulin levels were raised among all the celiac groups with typical GIT symptoms. The highest transferrin was observed in group B, celiac patients with severe anemia. Patients were not on GFD, hence had no or less recovery and had chronic symptoms of celiac. Conclusion: The misdiagnosis and poor management of celiac leads to chronic villous atrophy with imbalance in metabolic profile. Serum analysis of albumin, globulins, and transferrin may help in the diagnosis and proper management of the disease to recover the celiac symptoms.
33979762	Predictors of adherence to a gluten-free diet in celiac disease: Do knowledge, attitudes, experiences, symptoms, and quality of life play a role?	OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to identify the relationship between adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) and demographic characteristics, knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs regarding celiac disease (CD) and GFD, experiences of following a GFD, symptoms, and quality of life (QoL). METHODS: Patients with CD were recruited from outpatient clinics. Adherence to GFD was assessed using the CD adherence test (CDAT) and GFD score (GFD-S). Knowledge, attitudes, experiences, symptoms, and QoL were assessed using existing questionnaires. A multivariate logistic regression was performed. RESULTS: Overall, 116 patients with CD were included (48 +- 16 y; 70% female). Based on the CDAT, 58 patients (50%) were adequate adherers, but 86 patients (74%) were adequate adherers according to GFD-S. When adherence was measured using the CDAT, being female was associated with lower odds of adherence (odds ratio [OR]: 0.36; P = 0.028), and better emotional wellbeing was associated with higher odds of adherence (OR: 1.19; P < 0.001). When adherence was measured using GFD-S, membership in a support group (OR: 6.17; P = 0.002), stronger beliefs about the chronicity of CD (OR: 1.15; P = 0.059), and weaker beliefs on accident/chance causing CD (OR: 1.94; P = 0.05) were associated with greater odds of adherence. Difficulties when eating with family/friends (OR: 0.98; P = 0.005) and weaker beliefs on immunity causing CD (OR: 0.77; P = 0.031) were associated with lower odds of adherence. CONCLUSIONS: The association between gender, attending support groups, attitudes, experiences, and QoL with adherence to a GFD should be considered by health care professionals managing patients with CD.
30947869	The Liver and Celiac Disease.	Celiac disease is a multisystem disorder. Celiac hepatitis characterized by gluten-responsive mild elevation of transaminases is the more common liver manifestation of celiac disease. Celiac disease may also be associated or coexist with other chronic liver disorders. Shared genetic risk and increased intestinal permeability have been suggested to be the most relevant events in the pathogenesis of liver injury in celiac disease. The aim of this article is to review the full spectrum of liver disorders in patients with celiac disease.
29793402	Gluten in "gluten-free" food from food outlets in Melbourne: a cross-sectional study.	
30400639	The Handbook of Minerals on a Gluten-Free Diet.	The importance of a gluten-free diet (GFD) in the treatment of celiac disease and other gluten-related disorders is undisputable. However, strict GFD often lead to nutritional imbalances and, therefore, to deficiencies. One of the most common deficiencies from a GFD are an insufficient amount of Ca, Fe, Mg, and Zn. This is mainly because the most of popular gluten-free (GF) raw materials are poor in minerals. Although the popularity of GFD is constantly growing, the data on minerals in GF products are still limited. More importantly, an access to the data is even more restricted. Therefore, the paper reviews the Ca, Fe, Mg, and Zn contents in hundreds of grain GF products available worldwide. The data for 444 products from categories of flours, mixes for cooking, bakery products, cereals, groats, rice, and pasta are obtained from research papers and nutritional databases. The calculation of the realization of mineral requirements from a portion of each product with its graphical classification as rich/average/poor source of each mineral is given. The review is a handbook of minerals for people on a GFD, dietitians, and food producers.
36749498	Neurological manifestation of celiac disease: Role of anti-neuronal antibodies.	
33057793	Analysis of gluten immunogenic peptides in feces to assess adherence to the gluten-free diet in pediatric celiac patients.	PURPOSE: In celiac disease (CD) there is a need for precise and non-invasive tools to assess dietary compliance to the gluten-free diet (GFD). Our aim is to evaluate the efficacy of the detection of gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) in feces, to monitor in real life, the adherence to GFD in pediatric patients with CD. METHODS: A cross-sectional, prospective study was conducted. Fecal samples from CD children were analyzed by a rapid immunochromatographic (IC) test and by an ELISA method, both based on the antigliadin 33-mer monoclonal antibody. RESULTS: Group 1 comprises 43 children on a GFD. According to the food records (FR), 39/43 patients were compliant with the GFD and gluten consumption was recorded in 4. GIP were detected in 15/43 individuals by the ELISA method and also in 7 by IC strips. Group 2: comprise 18 children at CD diagnosis; GIP levels decreased over time (p < 0.001) in a non-linear way (p = 0.028) after starting a GFD and were below the detection limit on the third day in most individuals. CONCLUSION: GIP were detected, both by ELISA and by IC strips, in CD patients on a GFD, in which no consumption of gluten had been registered on the FR, confirming GIP detection to be superior to FR discovering involuntary transgressions. Despite a positive correlation between the amount of gluten intake and the concentration of GIP in feces, the interindividual variations observed suggest gastrointestinal factors influencing GIP recovery need to be further investigated.
35810096	Adherence to a gluten-free diet in celiac disease patients from Paraguay.	INTRODUCTION AND AIM: The treatment for celiac disease is a gluten-free diet that should be strictly and permanently carried out. Our aims were to determine adherence to the gluten-free diet and the risk factors for non-adherence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An observational, cross-sectional, comparative study was conducted. It included individuals of both sexes and of any age that presented with celiac disease, lived in Paraguay from January to April 2021, and agreed to participate in the survey. Incomplete questionnaires were excluded. Non-probabilistic convenience sampling was utilized. Adherence was measured using the Leffler questionnaire. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Universidad Privada del Este. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 371 respondents, 322 (87%) of whom were adults, with a mean age of 38 +- 12 years, and 49 (13%) of whom were children and adolescents, with a mean age of 10 +- 5 years. Female sex was predominant (85%). Adherence to the gluten-free diet was detected in 59% of the adults and 73% of the children and adolescents. The factors significantly associated with adherence included belonging to the child and adolescent age group and having had the diagnosis for a longer time: 9 +- 8 years for the adherence group and 7 +- 8 years for the non-adherence group. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated the frequency of adherence to the gluten-free diet in celiac patients in Paraguay. Psychologic and nutritional support is recommended for individuals with celiac disease that do not adhere to their treatment.
32439499	Celiac Disease Patients Should No Longer Be Consuming Measurable Amounts of Gluten.	
30711211	Nutritional Considerations of the Gluten-Free Diet.	Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune-related disease causing inflammation in the small intestine triggered by the ingestion of gluten in the diet. The gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only treatment. Nutritional deficiencies of macronutrients and micronutrients are frequently found in untreated or newly diagnosed CD. A registered dietitian nutritionist is uniquely qualified to educate on the GFD and assess and support nutritional status at diagnosis and long term as well as helping patients with nonresponsive CD. Quality of life is important to address in individuals with CD because the GFD affects all aspects of life.
29207559	Tooth Wear Is Frequent in Adult Patients with Celiac Disease.	(1) Background: Celiac disease (CD) patients can be affected by mouth and tooth disorders, which are influenced by their gluten-free diet. The aim of our research was to evaluate the pathological conditions of the stomatognathic system observed in celiac patients on a gluten-free diet. (2) Methods: we consecutively recruited celiac patients on a gluten-free diet at our celiac center, as well as healthy volunteers. Two dentists examined all patients/controls and checked them for any mouth disorder. (3) Results: Forty-nine patients affected by celiac disease (age at test 31.8 +- 11.58, time on GFD 8.73 +- 7.7) and 51 healthy volunteers (age at test 30.5 +- 8.7) were included. Recurrent aphthous stomatitis was reported in 26 patients (53.0%) and in 13 (25.5%) controls (p = 0.005). Dental enamel disorders were reported in 7 patients (14.3%) and in 0 controls (p = 0.002), with none having geographic tongue. We found non-specific tooth wear, characterized by loss of the mineralized tissue of the teeth, in 9 patients (18.3%) and in 3 (5.9%) controls (p = 0.05). (4) Conclusion: Recurrent aphthous stomatitis and enamel hypoplasia are "risk indicators" that may suggest that an individual has CD. We detected a high prevalence of non-specific tooth wear that can be caused by several factors such as malocclusion, sleep bruxism, parafunctional activity, and age.
31320223	Celiac Disease and Its Role in the Development of Metabolic Bone Disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy that occurs in genetically susceptible hosts with the ingestion of gluten-containing products. Ongoing gluten consumption leads to intestinal damage, characterized by villous blunting and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes, resulting in malabsorption. Pertinent to the development of bone disease, malabsorption of calcium and vitamin D leads to secondary hyperparathyroidism and metabolic bone disease among individuals with CD. In this article, we review the pathogenesis of CD and the effects of malabsorption on bone health. Imbalances in bone resorption and formation particularly in individuals with CD and persistent disease activity ultimately lead to a state of bone loss and impaired mineralization. Initiation of a gluten-free diet is critical in the management of CD-related metabolic bone disease, demonstrating improvements in bone mineral density within the first year of dietary adherence.
29191561	Epitope-Specific Immunotherapy Targeting CD4-Positive T Cells in Celiac Disease: Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Effects on Intestinal Histology and Plasma Cytokines with Escalating Dose Regimens of Nexvax2 in a Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Phase 1 Study.	BACKGROUND: Nexvax2  is a novel, peptide-based, epitope-specific immunotherapy intended to be administered by regular injections at dose levels that increase the threshold for clinical reactivity to natural exposure to gluten and ultimately restore tolerance to gluten in patients with celiac disease. Celiac disease patients administered fixed intradermal doses of Nexvax2 become unresponsive to the HLA-DQ2 5-restricted gluten epitopes in Nexvax2, but gastrointestinal symptoms and cytokine release mimicking gluten exposure, that accompany the first dose, limit the maximum tolerated dose to 150mug. Our aim was to test whether stepwise dose escalation attenuated the first dose effect of Nexvax2 in celiac disease patients. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at four community sites in Australia (3) and New Zealand (1) in HLA-DQ2 5 genotype positive adults with celiac disease who were on a gluten-free diet. Participants were assigned to cohort 1 if they were HLA-DQ2 5 homozygotes; other participants were assigned to cohort 2, or to cohort 3 subsequent to completion of cohort 2. Manual central randomization without blocking was used to assign treatment for each cohort. Initially, Nexvax2-treated participants in cohorts 1 and 2 received an intradermal dose of 30mug (consisting of 10mug of each constituent peptide), followed by 60mug, 90mug, 150mug, and then eight doses of 300mug over six weeks, but this was amended to include doses of 3mug and 9mug and extended over a total of seven weeks. Nexvax2-treated participants in cohort 3 received doses of 3mug, 9mug, 30mug, 60mug, 90mug, 150mug, 300mug, 450mug, 600mug, 750mug, and then eight of 900mug over nine weeks. The dose interval was 3 or 4days. Participants, care providers, data managers, sponsor personnel, and study site personnel were blinded to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was the number of adverse events and percentage of participants with adverse events during the treatment period. This completed trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02528799. FINDINGS: From the 73 participants who we screened from 19 August 2015 to 31 October 2016, 24 did not meet eligibility criteria, and 36 were ultimately randomized and received study drug. For cohort 1, seven participants received Nexvax2 (two with the starting dose of 30mug and then five at 3mug) and three received placebo. For cohort 2, 10 participants received Nexvax2 (four with starting dose of 30mug and then six at 3mug) and four received placebo. For cohort 3, 10 participants received Nexvax2 and two received placebo. All 36 participants were included in safety and immune analyses, and 33 participants completed treatment and follow-up; in cohort 3, 11 participants were assessed and included in pharmacokinetics and duodenal histology analyses. Whereas the maximum dose of Nexvax2 had previously been limited by adverse events and cytokine release, no such effect was observed when dosing escalated from 3mug up to 300mug in HLA-DQ2 5 homozygotes or to 900mug in HLA-DQ2.5 non-homozygotes. Adverse events with Nexvax2 treatment were less common in cohorts 1 and 2 with the starting dose of 3mug (72 for 11 participants) than with the starting dose of 30mug (91 for six participants). Adverse events during the treatment period in placebo-treated participants (46 for nine participants) were similar to those in Nexvax2-treated participants when the starting dose was 3mug in cohort 1 (16 for five participants), cohort 2 (56 for six participants), and cohort 3 (44 for 10 participants). Two participants in cohort 2 and one in cohort 3 who received Nexvax2 starting at 3mug did not report any adverse event, while the other 33 participants experienced at least one adverse event. One participant, who was in cohort 1, withdrew from the study due to adverse events, which included abdominal pain graded moderate or severe and associated with nausea after receiving the starting dose of 30mug and one 60mug dose. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events in the Nexvax2 participants were headache (52%), diarrhoea (48%), nausea (37%), abdominal pain (26%), and abdominal discomfort (19%). Administration of Nexvax2 at dose levels from 150mug to 900mug preceded by dose escalation was not associated with elevations in plasma cytokines at 4h. Nexvax2 treatment was associated with trends towards improved duodenal histology. Plasma concentrations of Nexvax2 peptides were dose-dependent. INTERPRETATION: We show that antigenic peptides recognized by CD4-positive T cells in an autoimmune disease can be safely administered to patients at high maintenance dose levels without immune activation if preceded by gradual dose escalation. These findings facilitate efficacy studies that test high-dose epitope-specific immunotherapy in celiac disease.
29880904	Oxidative stress as a biomarker for monitoring treated celiac disease.	INTRODUCTION: High levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and impaired antioxidant defense systems lead to oxidative stress (OxS) and tissue injury in different intestinal and extra intestinal conditions, including celiac disease (CD). The aim of the present study was to investigate the role and potential use of ROS and other biomarkers of OxS in the clinical management of CD. METHODS: We collected duodenal specimens and blood samples from naive patients (N-CD), patients on a gluten free diet (GFD) including responders (CD-GFD) and non-responders (NRCD). We measured plasmatic ROS production (electron paramagnetic resonance, EPR), lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, TBARS), protein oxidation (protein carbonyl, PC), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), nitric oxides and glutathione (GSH) in erythrocytes. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients affected by CD were enrolled (17 N-CD, 18 CD-GFD and 19 NRCD; 44 F; age 44 +- 13 years). A significant increase of plasmatic OxS biomarkers (ROS, peroxidated lipids, oxidized proteins, and nitrate concentrations) and decrease of antioxidant species (TAC and GSH levels) were found in NRCD and N-CD compared to CD-GFD. Comparably, a significant direct relationship between the severity of duodenal atrophy, ROS production rates and TBARS was found; conversely, TAC and GSH presented an inverse correlation. DISCUSSION: OxS is involved in CD tissue damage and correlates with the degree of duodenal atrophy. These findings suggest the possible role of OxS biomarkers as indicators of CD activity during the clinical follow-up.
37447301	Heavy Metal and Rice in Gluten-Free Diets: Are They a Risk?	A gluten-free diet (GFD) is the treatment of choice for gluten-related disorders. It has been associated with macro- and micronutrient deficiencies. Recently, consumption of arsenic-contaminated rice has raised concern because of the potential greater risk that it may represent for people on GFDs, whose rice consumption is high, since it is a fundamental cereal in GFDs. We reviewed the data published over the last 20 years in Medline and Scielo, in English, French and Spanish, on four metals (As, Hg, Cd, and Pb), to assess whether the evidence suggests that celiac disease or consumption of a GFD is associated with increased levels of blood/urinary metal concentrations. The review revealed a few articles that were directly related to the four metals and their relationships with a GFD. The evidence supports that rice-based products are a relevant source of As and other metals. Clinical studies and evaluations based on NHANES have indicated that persons on GFDs have higher As and Hg blood/urinary levels, suggesting that the diet and not the disease is responsible for it. The levels described are statistically significant compared to those of persons on complete diets, but far from toxic levels. The question of whether higher exposure to heavy metals associated with a GFD is biologically relevant remains unanswered and deserves study.
30189691	PNPLA3 rs738409 Polymorphism Predicts Development and Severity of Hepatic Steatosis but Not Metabolic Syndrome in Celiac Disease.	Metabolic syndrome (MS) and hepatic steatosis (HS) have been described in patients with celiac disease (CD) after starting a gluten-free diet (GFD), but data on predictive factors for these conditions are scarce. Recently, the patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3) rs738409 has been identified as a key factor for HS development in the general population. The aim of the study was to evaluate the role of PNPLA3 rs738409 in the development of MS and HS in CD patients after starting GFD. Between June 2014 and September 2016, we consecutively enrolled CD patients with HS, while those without steatosis served as a control group. All patients underwent anthropometric and serologic investigations, ultrasonography (US) to assess the degree and severity of HS, and genotyping of the PNPLA3 rs738409 polymorphism. Finally, 370 subjects were enrolled (136 with and 234 without HS). At genotyping assays, the CC genotype was found in 194 subjects (52.4%), the CG genotype in 138 subjects (37.3%), and the GG genotype in 38 subjects (10.2%). At binary logistic regression, only CG and GG alleles were predictive for the development of HS (odds ratio (OR) 1.97; p < 0.01 for CG and OR 6.9; p < 0.001 for GG). Body mass index (BMI) (OR 3.8; p < 0.001) and waist circumference (OR 2.8; p = 0.03) at CD diagnosis were the only independent factors for the development of MS. Intergroup comparisons showed that the severe grade of HS was more frequently observed in GG than in CC carriers (74% vs. 11.3%, p < 0.001, OR 21.8). PNPLA3 CG and GG carriers with CD have a higher susceptibility to hepatic steatosis, but not to metabolic syndrome. Moreover, patients with GG alleles display more severe forms of HS based on ultrasound.
32919023	Determinants of gluten-free diet adoption among individuals without celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity.	OBJECTIVES: Gluten-free (GF) foods are typically less nutritious and more expensive than their gluten-containing variants, yet people without a diagnosed gluten sensitivity continue to adopt this diet. There is a lack of research about what factors drive people without Celiac disease or non-Celiac gluten sensitivity to follow the GF diet. METHODS: A nationally representative sample of 2982 US residents without a diagnosed gluten sensitivity were surveyed about their attitudes, perceptions, and experiences with the GF diet. Logistic regression was used to compare respondents who were currently avoiding or had avoided gluten previously (GF consumer) to respondents who had never tried a GF diet (non-GF consumer). RESULTS: Over one-fifth of respondents were GF consumers. Beliefs that a gluten-reduced diet is healthier (OR 1.69; 95% CI [1.30,2.18]), that GF products are more nutritious (OR 1.46, 95% CI [1.11,1.90), and that a GF diet can help clear acne (OR 1.46; 95% CI [1.13,1.88]) were all positively associated with trying a GF diet. Personal research was the most influential source of information associated with trying a GF diet (OR 2.92; 95% CI [1.91,4.52]). This was followed by "healthcare center or health professional" (OR 2.57; 95% CI [1.71,3.90]. Respondents who were never encouraged to try the GF diet were less likely to try the diet (OR 0.33, 95% CI [0.23,0.46]). CONCLUSIONS: Positive, but scientifically unsubstantiated, beliefs about the benefits of the GF diet were strongly associated with trying a GF diet, and the source of recommendation to try a GF diet was important.
32900652	Clinical characteristics and long-term health in celiac disease patients diagnosed in early childhood: Large cohort study.	BACKGROUND: Early detection of celiac disease could theoretically prevent most of the disease-associated complications, but long-term effects of this approach are unclear. AIMS: To investigate features at diagnosis and adulthood health in celiac disease patients diagnosed in early childhood in 1965-2014. METHODS: Medical data on 978 pediatric patients were collected and study questionnaires sent to 559 adult patients who were diagnosed in childhood. Results were compared between patients diagnosed in early (<=3.0 years) and later (3.1-17.9 years) childhood. RESULTS: Early diagnosed patients (n=131) had more often total villous atrophy (37% vs 25%, p=0.001), gastrointestinal presentation (61% vs 47%, p<0.001), growth disturbances (70% vs 32%, p=0.001) and severe symptoms (30% vs 9%, p<0.001) and were less often screen-detected (10% vs 27%, p<0.001) at diagnosis than those diagnosed later (n=847). Among 239 adult responders, early diagnosed patients (n=36) had fewer comorbidities (33% vs 53%, p=0.034) but considered their health less often good/excellent (69% vs 84%, p=0.029). The groups were comparable in current age, dietary adherence, symptoms and health-related quality of life. CONCLUSION: Despite more severe initial presentation, the long-term health in early diagnosed patients was mostly comparable or even better to those diagnosed later in childhood. Poorer self-perceived health suggests a need for support during the transition to adulthood care.
36028163	The Exploration of the Eating Experience in Adults with Celiac Disease: A Phenomenological Qualitative Study.	BACKGROUND: The adjustment to a strict gluten-free diet for adults diagnosed with celiac disease (CD) may lead to changes in the eating experience affecting the physical, social, and emotional states. OBJECTIVE: Through the application of the Social Cognitive Transition Model of Adjustment, the aim of the study was to explore the adjustment in the eating experience in adults recently diagnosed with CD and transitioning to a gluten-free diet. DESIGN: This was a qualitative phenomenological study conducted using semistructured interviews. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Seventeen adults from the midwestern United States who were diagnosed with CD between 6 months and 5 years before the study were recruited using social media CD sites and snowball sampling. Participants completed a semistructured interview on Zoom and the Celiac Disease Adherence Test and CeliacQ-7 questionnaires from May to November 2020. STATISTICA ANALYSES PERFORMED: Two trained qualitative researchers engaged in four steps to reduce and contextualize the data: horizontilization, reduction and elimination, clustering and thematizing, and composition of textural description. During analysis, the Social Cognitive Transition Model of Adjustment was incorporated for organization of themes and text description. RESULTS: There was moderate to high dietary adherence in 14 of 17 participants and quality of life scores ranged from 19 to 43 (median = 33). Five themes emerged aligning with Social Cognitive Transition Model of Adjustment, describing the adjustment in pre- and postdiagnosis eating experience and the coping and behaviors enacted during adjustment to a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: In individuals with CD, moving beyond problem solving and identifying psychosocial and emotional attributes in the adoption of a gluten-free diet need to be considered to promote maintenance of quality of life and dietary adherence.
30167988	Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass and Celiac Disease : Gastric Bypass and Celiac Disease.	
35493494	Case Report: Fulminant Celiac Disease With Combination Immune Checkpoint Therapy.	Since the first approval of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in 2011, these agents have rapidly become an integral treatment option across tumor types. However, with the increased adoption of ICIs, the incidence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) continues to rise, and rare toxicity continues to be reported. Here, we present a case of a 70-year-old male patient with widespread metastatic melanoma who developed rapid onset anasarca and transaminitis after initiation of dual anti-PD-1/CTLA-4 inhibition with nivolumab and ipilimumab. An extensive workup was performed with serologies returning positive for anti-tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin (tTG-IgA) and endoscopy revealing duodenal mucosal atrophy with duodenal biopsies confirming celiac disease. All symptoms resolved after initiation of a gluten-free diet without the addition of immunosuppression. This case highlights the importance of considering celiac disease in patients with suspected protein-losing enteropathy on ICI, the fulminant nature this uncommon irAE can present with, and underscores the broad differential clinicians must maintain when managing presumed irAEs.
37985252	Sieving out non-celiac gluten sensitivity amongst patients with irritable bowel syndrome.	OBJECTIVES: It is challenging to make diagnosis of non-celiac gluten sensitivity/non-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCGS/NCWS) in clinical practice, since there is no biomarker and diagnosis is based on response to gluten-free-diet (GFD). We used anti-gliadin antibody (AGA) for screening patients with IBS for gluten-sensitivity. METHODS: 492 Adult-patients with IBS underwent screening for celiac disease and gluten-sensitivity using IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody and IgA-AGA and IgG-AGA, respectively. Patients with positive AGA (IgA and/or IgG) were invited to follow GFD, those willing were put on GFD for 6-weeks. Responsive patients were given gluten re-challenge. Diagnosis of NCGS was confirmed if they had recurrence of symptoms. RESULTS: Of 492 patients with IBS, AGA was positive in 61(12.4 %), hence suspected to have gluten-sensitivity. Of 31 who agreed to participate and followed GFD for 6-weeks, 17 (54.8 %) had complete (>30 % improvement) and 10(32.2 %) had partial (>20 % improvement) response. All 17 complete-responders were given gluten re-challenge for 6-weeks, symptoms recurred in all and hence were confirmed to have NCGS/NCWS. Significant decrease in AGA levels occurred almost in all GFD-responders. CONCLUSIONS: 12.4 % IBS patients have biological evidence of gluten/wheat-sensitivity. Almost 87 % patients with IBS having AGA responded to GFD. The value of AGA may further be explored as a biomarker for screening for the presence of NCGS, before recommending this test for the clinical practice.
37625870	Isolation and cryopreservation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells.	The study of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in immune-mediated diseases, such as celiac disease (CD), is important to uncover pathogenesis, find new biomarkers and discover and evaluate new treatments. Many studies have been published about the use and value of PBMCs in CD such as those including enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays, flow cytometry, peptide-MHC tetramers, genetic and proteomic analyses, and in vitro and proliferation assays. We present here and easy and efficient method for isolation of PBMCs using density gradient centrifugation. We also describe a simple way to freeze PBMCs in order to preserve their number and viability and a thawing procedure leading to high rates of viability of the cryopreserved cells to be used in subsequent applications.
33361748	Celiac Disease in an Adult Presenting as Behavioral Disturbances.	BACKGROUND Celiac disease is very common, with some estimates placing the prevalence at approximately 1: 300 worldwide. Typified by autoimmune degradation of the duodenal brush border due to reactivity with dietary gluten, causing malabsorption, it classically presents with both gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms. Gastrointestinal symptoms commonly include diarrhea, constipation, foul steatorrhea, flatulence, and bloating. With increased awareness and availability of testing, it is rare that a patient would present with celiac crisis, which is a syndrome of profuse diarrhea and severe metabolic/nutritional disturbances. In children, interestingly, celiac disease can present primarily as behavioral disturbance, such as increased aggression or anxiety, with milder or absent gastrointestinal symptoms. CASE REPORT A 25-year-old man with a history of schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder presented for behavioral disturbance after breaking into a neighbor's house to eat food. He also reported several months of diarrhea and fecal incontinence and was noted to have severe malnutrition on exam, despite dramatic food intake. Tissue transglutaminase IgA antibody (TTG) and gliadin IgA were highly suggestive of celiac disease, which was confirmed by biopsy. He was started on a lactose-free and gluten-free diet, and required a short course of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for nutritional resuscitation. He improved rapidly with this intervention, and returned to nutritional and behavioral baseline. CONCLUSIONS We report a unique case in which an adult with psychiatric comorbidities presented with predominantly behavioral disturbances, a more common presentation in children with the disorder. These patients may present in an atypical fashion, and the clinician should have a high index of suspicion.
30405092	Motility Disorders in Celiac Disease and Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity: The Impact of a Gluten-Free Diet.	Background: There is evidence that digestive motor disorders are frequently present in untreated celiac disease (CD) patients. Similarly, non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) can be associated with gut motor disorders. In both cases, gut dysmotility can improve or be completely reversed with a gluten-free diet (GFD). Methods: A literature search for motility disorders in CD and NCGS patients was carried out using the online databases PubMed, Medline and Cochrane. Results: Esophageal, gastric, small bowel and gallbladder motor disorders are common in both children and adults with CD. Although the clinical consequences of these disorders are not clearly defined, gastric dysfunction could affect drug absorption and metabolism in the thyroid and neurological conditions associated with CD. The impact of a GFD on motility disorders is, however, controversial. No systematic studies are available on NCGS. NCGS frequently overlaps with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and similar pathophysiological mechanisms may be hypothesized. Conclusions: Mucosal damage may affect gut motility in untreated CD through perturbation of hormonal and neuro-immunomodulatory regulation. A persistent low-grade mucosal inflammation could explain the cases of persistent motor disorders despite a GFD. Further studies are needed to definitely assess the role of gut motor disorders in NCGS.
30711207	Nondietary Therapies for Celiac Disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune enteropathy triggered by gluten. Gluten-free diets can be challenging because of their restrictive nature, inadvertent cross-contaminations, and the high cost of gluten-free food. Novel nondietary therapies are at the preclinical stage, clinical trial phase, or have already been developed for other indications and are now being applied to CD. These therapies include enzymatic gluten degradation, binding and sequestration of gluten, restoration of epithelial tight junction barrier function, inhibition of tissue transglutaminase-mediated potentiation of gliadin oligopeptide immunogenicity or of human leukocyte antigen-mediated gliadin presentation, induction of tolerance to gluten, and antiinflammatory interventions.
29986423	Psychiatric Comorbidity in Children and Adults with Gluten-Related Disorders: A Narrative Review.	Gluten-related disorders are characterized by both intestinal and extraintestinal manifestations. Previous studies have suggested an association between gluten-related disorder and psychiatric comorbidities. The objective of our current review is to provide a comprehensive review of this association in children and adults. A systematic literature search using MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO from inception to 2018 using terms of &lsquo;celiac disease&rsquo; or &lsquo;gluten-sensitivity-related disorders&rsquo; combined with terms of &lsquo;mental disorders&rsquo; was conducted. A total of 47 articles were included in our review, of which 28 studies were conducted in adults, 11 studies in children and eight studies included both children and adults. The majority of studies were conducted in celiac disease, two studies in non-celiac gluten sensitivity and none in wheat allergy. Enough evidence is currently available supporting the association of celiac disease with depression and, to a lesser extent, with eating disorders. Further investigation is warranted to evaluate the association suggested with other psychiatric disorders. In conclusion, routine surveillance of potential psychiatric manifestations in children and adults with gluten-related disorders should be carried out by the attending physician.
29063352	Multivariable Analysis of Gluten-Free Pasta Elaborated with Non-Conventional Flours Based on the Phenolic Profile, Antioxidant Capacity and Color.	The phenolic compounds, color and antioxidant capacity of gluten-free pasta prepared with non-conventional flours such as chickpea (CHF), unripe plantain (UPF), white maize (WMF) and blue maize (BMF) were analyzed. Fifteen phenolic compounds (five anthocyanins, five hydroxybenzoic acids, three hydroxycinnamic acids, one hydroxyphenylacetic acid and one flavonol) were identified in pasta prepared with blue maize, and 10 compounds were identified for samples prepared with white maize. The principal component analysis (PCA) led to results describing 98% of the total variance establishing a clear separation for each pasta. Both the proportion (25, 50 and 75%) and type of maize flour (white and blue) affected the color parameters (L*, C ab *, h ab and DeltaE* ab ) and antioxidant properties (DPPH, ABTS and FRAP methods) of samples, thus producing gluten-free products with potential health benefits intended for general consumers (including the population with celiac disease).
32239752	Thiol-disulfide homeostasis in children with celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: Toxic gliadin peptide damages enterocytes in celiac disease by causing oxidative stress. Thiols are organic compounds that defend against oxidative stress. This study aimed to investigate the changes in thiol-disulfide homeostasis in children with celiac disease. METHODS: The study included patients with celiac disease, children diagnosed with functional gastrointestinal disorders, and healthy children. Patients' serum native and total thiol-disulfide amounts, disulfide/total thiol percentage ratios, disulfide / native thiol percentage ratios, and native thiol/total thiol percentage ratios were measured. RESULTS: The study involved 172 children, of whom 90 (52.3%) were girls. The mean participant age was 8.6 +- 4.2 years. A total of 59 (34.3%) children had celiac disease, 56 (32.6%) had functional gastrointestinal disorders, and 57 (33.1%) were healthy. The total thiol and disulfide levels of patients with celiac disease (305 +- 87 mumol/L and 25 +- 15 mumol/L, respectively) were significantly lower than those of healthy children (349 +- 82 mumol/L and 40 +- 15 mumol/L, respectively) (P = 0.006 and P < 0.001, respectively). Native and total thiol levels (226 +- 85 mumol/L and 279 +- 99 mumol/L, respectively) in patients with celiac disease who consumed a gluten-containing diet were significantly lower than those of patients who consumed a gluten-free diet (278 +- 64 mumol/L and 327 +- 69 mumol/L, respectively) (P = 0.017 and P = 0.041, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Thiol-disulfide homeostasis, an important antioxidant defense component of the gastrointestinal system, is disrupted in children with celiac disease. A gluten-free diet helped partially ameliorate this decline.
31254168	Celiac disease: What the Indian pediatricians know about the disease.	To ascertain the knowledge, awareness, and practices pertaining to celiac disease (CD) among the Indian pediatricians. A survey link containing a questionnaire was shared through electronic mail using a pediatric database. The survey was kept active for 6 months; all responses received at the end of the survey were analyzed. Two hundred and seventy one pediatricians out of more than 10,000 chose to respond to the survey. Most pediatricians agreed that more patients with CD are being diagnosed than earlier. The reasons for higher detection of CD were perceived to be higher index of clinical suspicion by pediatricians (86.7%) followed by increased awareness among parents (45.8%). Most pediatricians opined that clinical manifestations which prompted to a diagnosis of CD were failure to thrive (96.2%) and chronic diarrhea (81.4%). Knowledge about atypical manifestations of celiac disease was low.  Though knowledge about the common association of CD with type 1 diabetes (62.1%) and autoimmune hepatitis (55.8%) was there, awareness about its association with other uncommon conditions was lacking. Though 68% of the pediatricians were of the opinion that the confirmation of diagnosis by a mucosal biopsy is necessary, 26.5% of respondents believed that only a positive serology was sufficient for a diagnosis. A trial of gluten-free diet (GFD) was thought to be a logical step if serology was positive by 31.3% of respondents. While 87.7% of pediatricians advocated lifelong adherence to GFD, 12.3% felt that GFD could be discontinued in the future. This web-based survey revealed that though pediatricians are seeing increasing number of celiac disease patients, there is a need to increase awareness regarding the disease, its associated conditions, the need for mucosal biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and the necessity of lifelong adherence to GFD.
32090062	Female Patients with Dermatitis Herpetiformis Show a Reduced Diagnostic Delay and Have Higher Sensitivity Rates at Autoantibody Testing for Celiac Disease.	OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to characterize the demographic information, clinical features, and laboratory data of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). METHODS: In this multicentre cross-sectional study, consecutive patients with a new diagnosis of DH that referred to nine different Italian centers between 2011 and 2016 were characterized assessing demographic, clinical and laboratory findings, and evaluating gender and age differences across selected variables. RESULTS: A total of 151 patients were included. Among them, 81 (53.6%) were males and 70 (46.4%) were females, with a male to female ratio of 1.2 : 1. The median age at the time of diagnosis was 41 years (range 0-85). Males had a significant longer diagnostic delay if compared to females (9 vs. 3 months, respectively; p = 0.01). Direct immunofluorescence was positive in 94.7% of the patients, while duodenal biopsy showed partial to total villous atrophy in 70.1% of patients. All the females resulted positive to at least one of the antibodies tested, while a total of 12 male patients (10.5%) tested negative to celiac-specific antibodies. Female patients had a high rate (14.1%) of autoimmune thyroiditis. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed some of the most relevant data regarding DH that have been previously reported in the literature. In addition, we found a reduced diagnostic delay in females with respect to males, possibly related to the higher sensitivity of serologic testing in females with DH compared to males. Finally, we demonstrated that intestinal involvement could be severe in patients with DH and that females should be tested for thyroiditis.
36145072	Mucosal Healing in Celiac Disease: Villous Architecture and Immunohistochemical Features in Children on a Long-Term Gluten Free Diet.	Considerable heterogeneity exists across studies assessing intestinal mucosal recovery in celiac (CD) patients on a gluten-free diet (GFD). We aimed at investigating histological and immunohistochemical features in CD patients on a long-term GFD and to correlate them to the GFD duration. Morphometrical and immunohistochemical analysis were retrospectively performed on duodenal biopsies in three groups of children: 33 on a long-term (>2 years) GFD (GFD-group), four of which remained seropositive despite dietary adherence, 31 with villous atrophy (ACD-group) and 76 heathy, non-celiac (CTR-group). Moreover, in the GFD-group, we correlated immunohistochemical alterations to the GFD duration. The villous to crypt (V/C) ratio significantly improved after the GFD and completely normalized in all patients, becoming even higher than in the CTR-group (median value 3.2 vs. 3, p = 0.007). In parallel, the number of CD3+ and TCRgammadelta+ cells in the epithelium were significantly reduced in the GFD compared to ACD patients, even if they remained higher than in the CTR-group (p < 0.05). In contrast, CD25+ cells in the lamina propria significantly decreased after the GFD (p < 0.05) and become comparable to the CTR-group (p = 0.9). In the GFD-group there was no difference in the immunohistochemical parameters between seropositive and seronegative patients and alterations did not correlate to GFD length. In conclusion, a GFD is able to both restore a normal V/C ratio and reduce inflammation, but the epithelium maintains some stigmata of the disorder, such as an increased number of CD3+ and TCRgammadelta+ cells. These alterations persist regardless of the duration of the GFD.
28806297	Adherence to a Gluten-free Diet: Assessment by Dietician Interview and Serology.	We aimed to determine whether tissue transglutaminase (tTG) autoantibody positivity was associated with dietitian-assessed adherence to a gluten-free diet in pediatric patients with celiac disease and identify areas where adherence falters. We reviewed the records of children with celiac disease who had a standardized evaluation of adherence by a registered dietitian. A negative tTG value was not associated with good adherence (P = NS). Adherent and nonadherent children differed with respect to purposeful and accidental gluten exposure (P < 0.0001), knowledge (P = 0.003), cross-contact (P = 0.003), potential exposure via medications and cosmetics (P = 0.004), and potential exposure while at restaurants (P < 0.0001), but not with respect to potential exposure at school (P = NS). Based on our findings, we suggest that negative tTG levels are not necessarily indicative of good adherence to a gluten-free diet in pediatric patients with celiac disease. A separate assessment of adherence is needed focusing on knowledge, behavior while dining out, and intent to adhere.
31540157	Translation, Cultural Adaptation, and Evaluation of a Brazilian Portuguese Questionnaire to Estimate the Self-Reported Prevalence of Gluten-Related Disorders and Adherence to Gluten-Free Diet.	BACKGROUND: A Spanish version of a questionnaire intended to estimate, at the population level, the prevalence rates of self-reported gluten-related disorders and adherence to gluten-free diets has been applied in four Latin American countries. However, idiom issues have hampered the questionnaire application in the Brazilian population. Thus, the aim of the present study was to carry out a translation, cultural adaptation, and evaluation of a Brazilian Portuguese questionnaire to estimate the self-reported prevalence of gluten-related disorders and adherence to gluten-free diets in a Brazilian population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two bilingual Portuguese-Spanish health professionals carried out the translation of the original Spanish version of the questionnaire to Brazilian-Portuguese. Matching between the two translations was evaluated using the WCopyFind.4.1.5 software. Words in conflict were conciliated, and the conciliated version of the Brazilian Portuguese instrument was evaluated to determine its clarity, comprehension, and consistency. A pilot study was carried out using an online platform. RESULTS: The two questionnaires translated into Brazilian Portuguese were highly matched (81.8%-84.1%). The questions of the conciliated questionnaire were clear and comprehensible with a high agreement among the evaluators (n = 64) (average Kendall's W score was 0.875). The participants did not suggest re-wording of questions. The answers to the questions were consistent after two applications of the questionnaire (Cohen's k = 0.869). The pilot online survey yielded low response rates (9.0%) highlighting the need for face-to-face interviews. CONCLUSIONS: The translation and evaluation of a Brazilian Portuguese questionnaire to estimate the self-reported prevalence rates of gluten-related disorders and adherence to gluten-free diets was carried out. The instrument is clear, comprehensible, and generates reproducible results in the target population. Further survey studies involving face-to-face interviews are warranted.
30311150	Ultra-short Celiac Disease Is a Distinct and Milder Phenotype of the Disease in Children.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Approximately 10% of children with celiac disease (CD) have ultra-short celiac disease (USCD), where histological abnormalities are limited to the duodenal bulb. The aim of our retrospective study was to identify clinical and serological characteristics at baseline and at follow-up of children with USCD. METHODS: All children that were diagnosed with CD in our unit during 7/2010-12/2017, in whom biopsies were taken from duodenal bulb and second part, were included. We compared disease characteristics and course between children with USCD and children with involvement in the second part of the duodenum. RESULTS: Out of 3740 children who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopies, 648 were diagnosed with CD. Seventy-one (11%) of those children had limited involvement in the duodenal bulb. The USCD group included more females (P = 0.021), were older (P = 0.005), had a lower prevalence of diarrhea (P = 0.003), anemia (P = 0.007), anti-tissue transglutaminase (TTG) antibodies count (P < 0.001) at presentation, lower frequency of endoscopic abnormality, lower Marsh score, and a trend toward shorter time to the normalization of anti-TTG antibodies under a gluten-free diet compared to the extensive CD. There were no differences in body mass index or duration of symptoms before diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Children with USCD presented with a distinct phenotype of milder symptoms, lower celiac serology, and milder endoscopic and histological findings, with a trend toward faster normalization under a gluten-free diet compared to those with extensive CD. Further studies are needed to determine the long-term course and prognosis of USCD.
30820708	Diagnosis and Treatment Patterns in Celiac Disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated gastrointestinal (GI) disorder driven by innate and adaptive immune responses to gluten. Presentation of CD has changed over time, with non-GI symptoms, such as anemia and osteoporosis, presenting more commonly. With improved screening and diagnostic methods, the reported prevalence of CD has increased globally, and there is considerable global variation in diagnostic and treatment practices. The objective of this study was to describe the current state of CD diagnosis and treatment patterns. A targeted review of literature from MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and screening of relevant conference abstracts was performed. The generally recommended diagnostic approach is GI endoscopy with small bowel biopsy; however, in selected patients, biopsy may be avoided and diagnosis based on positive serology and clinical symptoms. Diagnosis often is delayed; the average diagnostic delay after symptom onset is highly variable and can last up to 12 years. Barriers to accurate and timely diagnosis include atypical presentation, lack of physician awareness about current diagnostic criteria, misdiagnosis, and limited access to specialists. Currently, strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only recommended treatment, which is not successful in all patients. Only one-third of patients are monitored regularly following diagnosis. Unmet needs for CD include improvements in the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis, and the development of treatments for both refractory CD and GFD nonresponsive CD. Further research should investigate the impact of education about gluten-free eating and the availability of gluten-free foods support adherence and improve outcomes in patients with CD.
29481779	Dietary Patterns After the Weaning and Lactation Period Are Associated With Celiac Disease Autoimmunity in Children.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: There have been many studies of associations between infant feeding practices and development of celiac disease during childhood, but few studies have focused on overall diets of young children after the weaning period. We aimed to examine the association between common dietary patterns in infants and the occurrence of celiac disease autoimmunity during childhood. METHODS: We performed a prospective analysis of data from the Generation R Study that comprised 1997 children born from April 2002 through January 2006 in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Food consumption around 1 year of age was assessed with a validated food-frequency questionnaire. Dietary data were examined using a priori (based on existing guidelines) and a posteriori (principal component analysis and reduced rank regression) dietary pattern analyses. Five dietary patterns were compared. Celiac disease autoimmunity, determined on the basis of serum concentration of transglutaminase-2 autoantibody (ie, TG2A) below or above 7 U/mL, was evaluated at 6 years. Associations between dietary pattern adherence scores and celiac disease autoimmunity were examined using multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: Higher adherence to the a posteriori-derived prudent dietary pattern (high intake of vegetables, vegetable oils, pasta, and grains and low consumption of refined cereals and sweet beverages) at 1 year was significantly associated with lower odds of celiac disease autoimmunity at 6 years (odds ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.53-0.84). No significant associations were found for the 4 remaining dietary patterns. CONCLUSIONS: In a prospective study of dietary patterns of young children in the Netherlands, we associated a dietary pattern characterized by high consumption of vegetables and grains and low consumption of refined cereals and sweet beverages, with lower odds of celiac disease autoimmunity. Early-life dietary patterns might therefore be involved in the development of celiac disease during childhood.
30029707	Novel approaches for enzymatic gluten degradation to create high-quality gluten-free products.	Celiac disease (CD), a chronic enteropathy of the small intestine caused by ingestion of gluten, is one of the most prevalent food hypersensitivities worldwide. The essential treatment is a strict lifelong gluten-free diet based on the avoidance of gluten-containing products from wheat, rye, barley and, in rare cases, oats. Products made from naturally gluten-free raw materials often have inferior nutritional, textural and sensory properties compared to the corresponding gluten-containing products. Therefore, the incorporation of wheat, rye and barley flours after efficient removal of the harmful component gluten into gluten-free products would be beneficial. Gluten modification resulting in decreased CD-immunoreactivity may be achieved via the formation of crosslinks using microbial transglutaminase. To effectively eliminate CD-immunoreactivity, plant, fungal, bacterial, animal or engineered peptidases are capable of degrading gluten proteins and peptides into harmless fragments. The application of peptidases from germinated cereal grains, fungal peptidases and/or lactic acid bacteria during food processing yielded high-quality sourdough wheat breads, pasta, wheat starch and bran, rye products and beer, all with gluten contents below the Codex Alimentarius threshold of 20mg/kg for gluten-free products. As with all gluten-free products, the legislative compliance of such treated materials needs to be monitored closely. Provided that all safety requirements are met, gluten-containing raw materials treated in an adequate way to remove CD-active gluten fragments may be used together with naturally gluten-free ingredients to create an extended choice of high-quality gluten-free products.
33259438	Evaluation of Daily Lives of Children and Adolescents with Celiac Disease and Nursing Approaches.	The incidence of celiac disease has been increasing in recent years. Celiac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy that emerges mostly in the childhood period. This disorder is a chronic condition of the small intestine due to gluten intake in individuals with genetic predisposition. In the treatment of celiac disease, gluten-free diet therapy is applied. However, the adaptation process to the diet may create difficulties for patients. Compliance with diet is much more difficult among patients with celiac disease in childhood and adolescence than in adult patients. Children and adolescents face distinct difficulties in their homes, at school, and in their social lives. Besides following dietary treatment, children and adolescents living with celiac disease need peer support to manage their daily routines. In this article, we aimed to discuss the problems experienced by children and adolescents living with celiac disease and nursing approaches to these problems.
30279384	A Review on the Gluten-Free Diet: Technological and Nutritional Challenges.	Consumers, food manufacturers and health professionals are uniquely influenced by the growing popularity of the gluten-free diet. Consumer expectations have urged the food industry to continuously adjust and improve the formulations and processing techniques used in gluten-free product manufacturing. Health experts have been interested in the nutritional adequacy of the diet, as well as its effectiveness in managing gluten-related disorders and other conditions. In this review, we aim to provide a clear picture of the current motivations behind the use of gluten-free diets, as well as the technological and nutritional challenges of the diet as a whole. Alternative starches and flours, hydrocolloids, and fiber sources were found to play a complex role in mimicking the functional and sensory effects of gluten in gluten-free products. However, the quality of gluten-free alternatives is often still inferior to the gluten-containing products. Furthermore, the gluten-free diet has demonstrated benefits in managing some gluten-related disorders, though nutritional imbalances have been reported. As there is limited evidence supporting the use of the gluten-free diet beyond its role in managing gluten-related disorders, consumers are urged to be mindful of the sensorial limitations and nutritional inadequacies of the diet despite ongoing strategies to improve them.
33836647	Is mass screening for coeliac disease a wise use of resources? A health economic evaluation.	BACKGROUND: Living with undiagnosed symptomatic coeliac disease is connected with deteriorated health, and persons with coeliac disease often wait a long time for their diagnosis. A mass screening would lower the delay, but its cost-effectiveness is still unclear. Our aim was to determine the cost-effectiveness of a coeliac disease mass screening at 12 years of age, taking a life course perspective on future benefits and drawbacks. METHODS: The cost-effectiveness was derived as cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) using a Markov model. As a basis for our assumptions, we mainly used information from the Exploring the Iceberg of Celiacs in Sweden (ETICS) study, a school-based screening conducted in 2005/2006 and 2009/2010, where 13,279 12-year-old children participated and 240 were diagnosed with coeliac disease, and a study involving members of the Swedish Coeliac Association with 1031 adult participants. RESULTS: The cost for coeliac disease screening was 40,105 Euro per gained QALY. Sensitivity analyses support screening based on high compliance to a gluten-free diet, rapid progression from symptom-free coeliac disease to coeliac disease with symptoms, long delay from celiac disease with symptoms to diagnosis, and a low QALY score for undiagnosed coeliac disease cases. CONCLUSIONS: A coeliac disease mass screening is cost-effective based on the commonly used threshold of 50,000 Euro per gained QALY. However, this is based on many assumptions, especially regarding the natural history of coeliac disease and the effects on long-term health for individuals with coeliac disease still eating gluten.
37836454	Gluten-Free Product Recalls and Their Impact on Consumer Trust.	The range of gluten-free food products available to consumers is steadily expanding. In recent years, recalls of food products have highlighted the importance of accurate labeling of food products for the presence of wheat, other gluten-containing cereals, or gluten itself as refined ingredient. The purpose of this study was to gain more insights into recent food recalls related to undeclared gluten/wheat contamination and consumer experiences with these recalls. Recalls of products triggered by gluten contamination are relatively scarce and are not often triggered by a consumer complaint. The impact of these recalls on consumer trust was evaluated through an online survey that was distributed among supporters of Celiac Canada (CCA) and covered (i) strategies to adhere to a gluten-free diet, (ii) experiences with gluten-free recalls and their impact on consumer trust, and (iii) demographic information. Consumer concern regarding gluten-free product recalls is significant, but the concern regarding recalls is not heightened after experiencing a recall. Companies pursuing transparency in the process, identification of the source of contamination, and mitigation strategies going forward are likely to retain consumer trust in their product and brand. Based on the survey results, further efforts focusing on consumer education regarding interpreting nutrient labels, identifying sources of information on product recalls, and understanding procedures to follow upon suspected gluten contamination of a gluten-free product are recommended.
29459801	The effect of gluten-free diet among celiac patients aged 3-12 years old on BMI during 2006 to 2014 at Nemazee Teaching hospital.	INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease (CD) is increasingly diagnosed and weight changes are common after adoption of a glutenfree diet (GFD) and there is concern that patients might gain further weight on a GFD. OBJECTIVES: This study examined to evaluate the impact of a GFD on the body mass index (BMI), whether favorable or unfavorable. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, we reviewed electronic records of 44 patients with serologic study and intestinal biopsy confirmed CD who was visited in Nemazee hospital, Shiraz. All patients were put on GFD for 2 years and followed closely by pediatric gastroenterologist. BMIs were categories to four group underweight, normal weight, overweight and obese. Initial BMI and follow-up BMI was comparing together and also compared with general population. RESULT: At diagnosis, 27.27% of subjects were underweight, 63.64% normal and 9.09% were obese. On a GFD, 66.66% of underweight patients gained weight and became normal weight and 25% of normal weight and 75% of obese patients had increase weight; and the rest of the patients, BMI remained stable. The follow-up BMIs were statistically higher than initial BMIs (mean 17.17 vs. 15.62, p <0.0001). CONCLUSION: Individuals with celiac disease have lower BMI than the regional population at diagnosis. On the GFD, BMI is increased significantly in all categories.
31673859	Psychological Needs and Services in a Pediatric Multidisciplinary Celiac Disease Clinic.	This study aims to describe the psychological needs in children with celiac disease (CD) and to examine the feasibility of psychological consultation in a multidisciplinary clinic. Participants (N = 69) included children with CD and their parents who completed a pre-clinic mental health survey and a 30-min psychological consultation as part of a multidisciplinary clinic (including gastroenterology, nutrition, education, neurology, and neuropsychology). Quantitative and qualitative analyses examined psychological needs, experiences, and satisfaction. The psychologist identified clinically significant symptoms and provided referrals in 49% of children. There were no significant differences by time since CD diagnosis. During the psychology consultation, families discussed emotional adjustment, impact on life and physical well-being, and management of the gluten-free diet. Parents reported high levels of satisfaction from the clinic visit. We identified frequent psychological needs in pediatric CD. The multidisciplinary approach may be a feasible model for specialized, optimal treatment in this population.
30840918	Daily oligofructose-enriched inulin intake impacts bone turnover markers but not the cytokine profile in pediatric patients with celiac disease on a gluten-free diet: Results of a randomised, placebo-controlled pilot study.	BACKGROUND: Bone metabolism disturbances are commonly observed in patients with newly diagnosed celiac disease (CD). The only available treatment for CD-the intake of a gluten-free diet (GFD)-has been found to be insufficient in effectively improving bone health in some patients. Therefore, there is an urgent need to modify the GFD so as to allow for the provision of all the necessary nutrients and improved absorption. Prebiotics intake reportedly improves the absorption of bone-related vitamin D and calcium as well as bone metabolism. The effect of prebiotic intake on bone health in CD patients has not been studied yet. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of oligofructose-enriched inulin intake on bone metabolism and immune response in children with CD on a GFD. METHODS: A total of 34 children with CD were randomised into two groups receiving 10 g of oligofructose-enriched inulin (Synergy 1) or a placebo (maltodextrin) for three months, together with a strict GFD. The children's bone metabolism marker levels and cytokine profiles were analysed before and after the intervention. RESULTS: After supplementation, the concentration of osteocalcin increased significantly in children receiving Synergy 1, while the concentration of bone alkaline phosphatase increased in both groups, independent of supplementation. After the intervention, the level of pyridinoline increased significantly in the placebo group, resulting in a concentration that was two times higher than that in the Synergy 1 group, in which it remained stable. Moreover, the plasma concentrations of N-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen decreased in both the groups, whereas the tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b level increased particularly in the Synergy 1 group. The intervention did not lead to immunological response changes. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed supplementation beneficially altered bone metabolism, through increased bone formation rates and decreased bone resorption process rates. Supplementation of GFD with prebiotic oligofructose-enriched inulin may be a promising auxiliary therapy for bone metabolism improvements in children with CD.
34073654	Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity: An Update.	Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a clinical entity characterized by the absence of celiac disease and wheat allergy in patients that trigger reproducible symptomatic responses to gluten-containing foods consumption. Due to the lack of sensitive and reproducible biomarkers for NCGS diagnosis, placebo-controlled gluten challenges must be carried out for its diagnosis. The gluten challenges can be either double- or single-blind, for research or clinical practice purposes, respectively. For improving our understanding about the magnitude and relevance of NCGS in different populations, epidemiological studies based on self-report have been carried out. However, the gluten challenge-based prevalence of NCGS remains to be estimated. Since NCGS was recently recognized as a clinical entity, more studies are needed to delve into NCGS pathogenesis, for instance, the molecular interactions between the suspected cereal grain components that trigger NCGS, such as fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) and amylase and trypsin inhibitors, and the immune system remains to be elucidated. Although still under debate, NCGS patients can be susceptible to only one or more than one of the NCGS triggers. The treatment of NCGS involves the dietary restriction of the suspected triggers of the disease, but there is controversial data about the effectiveness of different dietary interventions such as the gluten-free diet and low-FODMAP diet. Certainly, our understanding of NCGS is improving quickly due to the constant availability of new scientific information on this topic. Thus, the aim of the present narrative review is to present an up-to-date overview on NCGS from epidemiology to current therapy.
30908383	Pediatric Nonceliac Gluten Sensitivity: A Gluten-related Disorder Treatment Center Experience.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to identify the prevalence and clinical characteristics of children with nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) presenting to a tertiary care center specialized for evaluation of gluten-related disorders. METHODS: The medical records of all patients aged 0 to 18 years who presented to our center over a 4-year period (July 2013-June 2018) and consented to participate in our research registry were reviewed. Patients meeting the clinical criteria for NCGS were reviewed in detail. RESULTS: Among 500 pediatric patients who volunteered to participate in the registry during the study period, we identified 26 (5.2%) with NCGS. Both gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms associated with gluten ingestion were common with abdominal pain (57.7%), bloating (53.9%), rash (53.9%), diarrhea/loose stool (42.3%), and emotional/behavioral issues (42.3%) emerging as the predominant complaints. In addition, children with NCGS demonstrated a high personal history (61.5%) and family history (61.5%) of concomitant allergic/atopic disease. CONCLUSIONS: Even within our highly specialized population of patients with a suspected gluten-related disorder, pediatric NCGS is relatively uncommon. The estimated prevalence and clinical features mirror those previously reported in a similarly highly selective population of adults. In the absence of celiac disease, clinical suspicion for NCGS should arise in a child with gastrointestinal and/or extraintestinal complaints alleviated with gluten removal and considered in symptomatic patients with associated allergic/atopic disease. Proper and adequate exclusion of celiac disease and other potential causes of the clinical complaints is essential to justify adoption of the gluten-free diet according to an appropriate stringency and with dietitian supervision to avoid nutritional deficiencies.
33218026	New Perspectives on Gluten-Free Diet.	Celiac disease (CD) is a permanent, chronic, gluten-sensitive disorder characterized by small intestinal inflammation and malabsorption in genetically predisposed individuals [...].
37062174	Targeting the gut microbiota in inflammatory bowel diseases: where are we?	The gut microbiota is now recognized to be a key driver of mucosal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Robust functional and compositional alterations of the gut microbiota have been described in IBD with a reduction in bacterial diversity, a reduction in some anti-inflammatory anaerobic bacteria, and an increase in bacteria with pro-inflammatory potential. However, despite 15 years of active research, therapeutical applications are still lacking. Recent studies have shed new light on how targeting the gut microbiota can be beneficial in IBD with fecal microbiota transplantation, next-generation probiotics, and phage therapy. Given the similarities in dysfunction and structure of the gut microbiota between IBD and other chronic conditions associated with intestinal inflammation, such as celiac disease, Familial Mediterranean Fever, or common variable immunodeficiency, common therapeutic strategies targeting the host-microbiota symbiosis may be applied in these different conditions.
33503952	Rationale for Timing of Follow-Up Visits to Assess Gluten-Free Diet in Celiac Disease Patients Based on Data Mining.	The assessment of compliance of gluten-free diet (GFD) is a keystone in the supervision of celiac disease (CD) patients. Few data are available documenting evidence-based follow-up frequency for CD patients. In this work we aim at creating a criterion for timing of clinical follow-up for CD patients using data mining. We have applied data mining to a dataset with 188 CD patients on GFD (75% of them are children below 14 years old), evaluating the presence of gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) in stools as an adherence to diet marker. The variables considered are gender, age, years following GFD and adherence to the GFD by fecal GIP. The results identify patients on GFD for more than two years (41.5% of the patients) as more prone to poor compliance and so needing more frequent follow-up than patients with less than 2 years on GFD. This is against the usual clinical practice of following less patients on long term GFD, as they are supposed to perform better. Our results support different timing follow-up frequency taking into consideration the number of years on GFD, age and gender. Patients on long term GFD should have a more frequent monitoring as they show a higher level of gluten exposure. A gender perspective should also be considered as non-compliance is partially linked to gender in our results: Males tend to get more gluten exposure, at least in the cultural context where our study was carried out. Children tend to perform better than teenagers or adults.
36219175	Anemia-Resistant to Gluten-Free Diet in Patients With Celiac Disease: Is It Just a Malabsorption Problem?	
29515723	[Celiac disease in adult patients revealed by polyserositis: about a case].	Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease affecting multiple organs. It often presents as gastrointestinal manifestations associated with malabsorption. However, serosa involvement uncommonly reveals this enteropathy, making the diagnosis difficult. We here report the case of JA, aged 63 years, admitted to hospital to detect the cause of malabsorption syndrome associated with polyserositis signs including pleurisy, pericarditis, ascites and hydrocephalus. The diagnosis of CD was based on endoscopic signs without serology tests. Patient's evolution was partially favorable, due to lack of compliance with a gluten-free diet. Our study reports the first case of CD revealed by polyserositis. CD should be suspected in patients with malabsorption syndrome, in the absence of evocative signs.
34192430	A Randomized Trial of a Transglutaminase 2 Inhibitor for Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND: In celiac disease, small intestinal transglutaminase 2 causes deamidation of glutamine residues in gluten peptides, which enhances stimulation of T cells and leads to mucosal injury. Inhibition of transglutaminase 2 is a potential treatment for celiac disease. METHODS: In a proof-of-concept trial, we assessed the efficacy and safety of a 6-week treatment with ZED1227, a selective oral transglutaminase 2 inhibitor, at three dose levels as compared with placebo, in adults with well-controlled celiac disease who underwent a daily gluten challenge. The primary end point was the attenuation of gluten-induced mucosal damage, as measured by the ratio of villus height to crypt depth. Secondary end points included intraepithelial lymphocyte density, the Celiac Symptom Index score, and the Celiac Disease Questionnaire score (for assessment of health-related quality of life). RESULTS: Of the 41 patients assigned to the 10-mg ZED1227 group, the 41 assigned to the 50-mg group, the 41 assigned to the 100-mg group, and the 40 assigned to the placebo group, 35, 39, 38, and 30 patients, respectively, had adequate duodenal-biopsy samples for the assessment of the primary end point. Treatment with ZED1227 at all three dose levels attenuated gluten-induced duodenal mucosal injury. The estimated difference from placebo in the change in the mean ratio of villus height to crypt depth from baseline to week 6 was 0.44 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.15 to 0.73) in the 10-mg group (P = 0.001), 0.49 (95% CI, 0.20 to 0.77) in the 50-mg group (P<0.001), and 0.48 (95% CI, 0.20 to 0.77) in the 100-mg group (P<0.001). The estimated differences from placebo in the change in intraepithelial lymphocyte density were -2.7 cells per 100 epithelial cells (95% CI, -7.6 to 2.2) in the 10-mg group, -4.2 cells per 100 epithelial cells (95% CI, -8.9 to 0.6) in the 50-mg group, and -9.6 cells per 100 epithelial cells (95% CI, -14.4 to -4.8) in the 100-mg group. Use of the 100-mg dose may have improved symptom and quality-of-life scores. The most common adverse events, the incidences of which were similar across all groups, were headache, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Rash developed in 3 of 40 patients (8%) in the 100-mg group. CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary trial, treatment with ZED1227 attenuated gluten-induced duodenal mucosal damage in patients with celiac disease.

34569646	Bone Fractures in Children and Young Adults With Type 1 Diabetes: Age Distribution, Fracture Location, and the Role of Glycemic Control.	Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a known risk factor for fractures, but the underlying pathophysiology is still not fully understood. This study aims to define age peaks and frequent fracture sites of children and young adults with T1D. Additionally, associations of fractures with metabolic and lifestyle factors as well as with additional complications in individuals with T1D were analyzed. A total of 750 individuals with T1D aged <=25 years with fractures were matched to 3750 patients with T1D without fractures by demographics and insulin regimen. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values were compared using linear regression, and logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) for fractures in individuals with acute complications and diseases. Median (Q1-Q3) age was 12.7 (9.9 to 14.9) years in individuals with fractures and 16.3 (12.6 to 17.8) years in the entire control group with 65% versus 53% males. Peak age for fractures was 7 to <15 years in males and 9 to <11 years in females, which is earlier than reported for the general population. HbA1c (%) was significantly higher in individuals with fractures than in controls (difference of estimated means: 0.26%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.07-0.46), especially in postpubertal females (0.68; 0.10-1.26). Significantly higher odds for fractures were observed in individuals with severe hypoglycemia (OR = 1.90; 95% CI 1.47-2.47), especially in prepubertal females (OR = 2.81; 1.21-6.52]) and postpubertal males (2.44; 1.11-5.38), celiac disease (2.02; 1.67-2.45), and with a history of smoking (1.38; 1.02-1.88). The age peak of fractures seems to be earlier in T1D than in the general population. Poor glycemic control is related to fractures, even before puberty. Associations of HbA1c and severe hypoglycemia with fractures highly depend on age and sex.   2021 The Authors.

29753760	Gluten-free living in China: The characteristics, food choices and difficulties in following a gluten-free diet - An online survey.	BACKGROUND: Individuals adhering to a gluten-free diet (GFD) have been scarcely researched within a Chinese population. This present study was conducted to assess the characteristics, food choices, shopping preferences, and emotions and attitudes of individuals following a GFD. METHODS: Individuals following a GFD were invited to complete an online questionnaire about their demography and geography characteristics, gluten-free food choices, shopping preferences, GFD management and subjective difficulty towards the diet. Distribution of the characteristics was described, and univariate and multivariate logistic regressions performed to explore the relationship between the above-mentioned variables and subjective difficulty in following a GFD. RESULT: 209 individuals following a GFD completed the questionnaire, most of whom were young, single and well-educated females from developed provinces or municipalities in China. Multiple regression showed that age, education level, advice on starting a GFD, duration before discovering a gluten intolerance, food choices and ways of GFD management were significantly associated with the subjective difficulty in following a GFD. CONCLUSION: Our findings offer a basic characteristics pattern of the population on a GFD in mainland China. Nearly one-third of GFD followers found the diet challenging to be followed. We suggest that sufficient celiac disease and gluten-induced disorder education be conducted among healthcare practitioners. Early diagnosis of gluten-induced disorders and defining an Asian-adapted GFD, as well as an increase in public awareness, may help adherence to a strict GFD in China.
34334763	Patient Perspectives on the Long-term Management of Celiac Disease.	GOAL: The aim of this study was to survey adults with celiac disease (CD) on the utility of specific aspects of follow-up and on information needs. BACKGROUND: Currently, the treatment for CD is strict gluten avoidance. Although this places the onus on the patient for disease management, patient perspectives on CD care have not been formally assessed. STUDY: The Manitoba Celiac Disease Cohort prospectively enrolled adults newly diagnosed with CD using serology and histology. At the 24-month study visits, participants rated the utility of aspects of CD care on a 5-point scale anchored by "not at all useful" and "very useful" and the helpfulness of information on CD-related topics on a 6-point scale anchored by "not at all helpful" and "very helpful." RESULTS: The online survey was completed by 149 of 211 cohort members [median age 40 (interquartile range 30 to 56) y; 68% female]. Adherence to a gluten-free diet was good. Most participants (87%) responded that they should be seen regularly for medical follow-up of CD, preferably every 6 (26%) or 12 months (48%). Blood tests were the most highly rated care component (rated scored >=4/5 by 78% of respondents), followed by the opportunity to ask about vitamins and supplements (50%), symptom review (47%), and information on CD research (44%). Diet review was not considered helpful. CONCLUSIONS: Two years after diagnosis, most individuals with CD find regular specialist follow-up helpful, particularly for biochemical assessment of disease activity and its complications. Furthermore, information on research and long-term complications of CD is also valued.
37962594	[What is established in the management of celiac disease?]	Nowadays, celiac disease is well-established in internal medicine as an autoimmune disease induced by gluten as a trigger. Undoubtedly similarly well-established is the gluten-free diet. It is the only recognized therapy for celiac disease to date. However, this presents some pitfalls in its implementation, which will be discussed in the following review. In addition, current developments that have the potential to significantly change both diagnosis and treatment of celiac disease are discussed. On the one hand, such an outlook was chosen since colleagues want to be "ready" when such developments are integrated into daily clinical routine. On the other hand, the realization that the field of mucosal immunology is moving forward has the potential to lift the spirits of the reader.

31138509	Device-assisted enteroscopy: An update on techniques, clinical indications and safety.	After more than 15 years since its introduction into clinical practice, indications for device-assisted enteroscopy have greatly expanded. Alongside the consolidated indications such as the diagnosis and treatment of small bowel bleeding, Crohn's disease, hereditary polyposis, small-bowel tumors and complicated celiac disease, device-assisted enteroscopy is nowadays largely used to perform endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in patients with altered anatomy, stent placement, retrieval of foreign bodies, direct insertion of jejunal feeding tubes, and in selected cases of incomplete colonoscopy. This has been made possible by the technical improvements of the enteroscopes and accessories and by the widespread use of the method. Device-assisted enteroscopy endotherapy currently offers a safe and effective alternative to major surgery and often represents the preferred option for treatment of small-bowel pathology. Its safety profile is favourable even in the elderly patient, provided that it is performed in high-volume and experienced centers. The evolution of the enteroscopy technique is a challenge for the future and could be facilitated by the new enteroscopes models. These prototypes need a thorough clinical and safety assessment especially for the complex therapeutic procedures. Large prospective, multicenter studies should be performed to assess whether the use of device-assisted enteroscopy leads to improved patients' long-term outcomes.

30341866	Prevalence of Chronic Liver Disease Among the Patients of Celiac Disease and Effect of Gluten-Free Diet on Outcome of Liver Disease: A Prospective Study.	Objectives: Descriptive reports of liver involvement in celiac disease (CD) are sparse, and the effect of a strict gluten-free diet (GFD) on the course of liver injury is also poorly understood. We conducted a study on 94 adult patients with CD and found that 39 of them were having chronic liver disease as well. We further followed patients of 'CD with CLD' with strict Gluten-free diet (GFD) for six months. Methods: We screened 94 patients of CD for CLD and found 39 patients to have CLD as well. We further followed these 39 patients of 'CD with CLD' for six month with strict gluten-free diet. Follow up was done in terms of Child Pugh score. We recorded their clinical as well as laboratory findings after 1 month, 3 months and 6 months and compared them with those at the time of recruitment. Results: The liver involvement was found in 39(41.5%) out of 94 patients celiac disease. Mean Child-Pugh score on admission was 10.22+-1.09 and on first follow-up mean Child-Pugh score was 7.38+-1.47 was found to be statistically highly significant (p <0.001) Mean Child-Pugh score on admission was 10.15+-1.09 and on second follow-up 7.33+-1.33 respectively and was statistically highly significant (p <0.001) Mean Child-Pugh score on admission was 10.12+-1.09 and on third follow-up mean Child-Pugh score was 6.31+-0.93 respectively was statistically highly significant (p <0.001).
30661899	Liver Transplantation for Fulminant Hepatic Failure Due to Heat Stroke: A Case Report.	Heat stroke is a condition caused by an excessive increase in body temperature in a relatively short period of time, and is clinically characterized by central nervous system dysfunction, including delirium, seizures, coma, and severe hyperthermia. In this context, the resulting fulminant hepatic failure makes liver transplant the best choice when there are no guarantees of better results with conservative treatment. We present our experience in this case, possible alternative choices, and the current role of liver transplantation in the resolution of fulminant liver failure due to heat stroke. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 32-year-old man with a history of malabsorption syndrome and unconfirmed celiac disease controlled with a gluten-free diet, who, while working on a typical summer midday in southern Spain (approximately 40 C), abruptly presented with loss of consciousness, coma, and a temperature of 42 C, as well as seizures at the initial medical assessment that subsided after the administration of diazepam. On the third day, the patient presented with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, requiring mechanical ventilation, hemodialysis, and inotropic support. He did not improve with the support of conservative treatment, therefore it was decided to perform an urgent liver transplant, after which he recovered completely. CONCLUSIONS: Liver transplantation should be a main choice of treatment for cases in which, despite intensive medical treatment, there is still clinical and analytical evidence of massive and/or irreversible hepatocellular damage.
32032584	Gliadin Nanoparticles Induce Immune Tolerance to Gliadin in Mouse Models of Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease could be treated, and potentially cured, by restoring T-cell tolerance to gliadin. We investigated the safety and efficacy of negatively charged 500-nm poly(lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles encapsulating gliadin protein (TIMP-GLIA) in 3 mouse models of celiac disease. Uptake of these nanoparticles by antigen-presenting cells was shown to induce immune tolerance in other animal models of autoimmune disease. METHODS: We performed studies with C57BL/6; RAG1-/- (C57BL/6); and HLA-DQ8, huCD4 transgenic Ab0 NOD mice. Mice were given 1 or 2 tail-vein injections of TIMP-GLIA or control nanoparticles. Some mice were given intradermal injections of gliadin in complete Freund's adjuvant (immunization) or of soluble gliadin or ovalbumin (ear challenge). RAG-/- mice were given intraperitoneal injections of CD4+CD62L-CD44hi T cells from gliadin-immunized C57BL/6 mice and were fed with an AIN-76A-based diet containing wheat gluten (oral challenge) or without gluten. Spleen or lymph node cells were analyzed in proliferation and cytokine secretion assays or by flow cytometry, RNA sequencing, or real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Serum samples were analyzed by gliadin antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and intestinal tissues were analyzed by histology. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, or immature dendritic cells derived from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, were cultured in medium containing TIMP-GLIA, anti-CD3 antibody, or lipopolysaccharide (controls) and analyzed in proliferation and cytokine secretion assays or by flow cytometry. Whole blood or plasma from healthy volunteers was incubated with TIMP-GLIA, and hemolysis, platelet activation and aggregation, and complement activation or coagulation were analyzed. RESULTS: TIMP-GLIA did not increase markers of maturation on cultured human dendritic cells or induce activation of T cells from patients with active or treated celiac disease. In the delayed-type hypersensitivity (model 1), the HLA-DQ8 transgenic (model 2), and the gliadin memory T-cell enteropathy (model 3) models of celiac disease, intravenous injections of TIMP-GLIA significantly decreased gliadin-specific T-cell proliferation (in models 1 and 2), inflammatory cytokine secretion (in models 1, 2, and 3), circulating gliadin-specific IgG/IgG2c (in models 1 and 2), ear swelling (in model 1), gluten-dependent enteropathy (in model 3), and body weight loss (in model 3). In model 1, the effects were shown to be dose dependent. Splenocytes from HLA-DQ8 transgenic mice given TIMP-GLIA nanoparticles, but not control nanoparticles, had increased levels of FOXP3 and gene expression signatures associated with tolerance induction. CONCLUSIONS: In mice with gliadin sensitivity, injection of TIMP-GLIA nanoparticles induced unresponsiveness to gliadin and reduced markers of inflammation and enteropathy. This strategy might be developed for the treatment of celiac disease.
32415563	Impact of a Child's Celiac Disease Diagnosis and Management on the Family.	BACKGROUND: Little attention has been paid to family-wide repercussions of a child's celiac disease diagnosis and concomitant gluten-free diet management. AIMS: We quantitatively and qualitatively describe positive and negative family-wide effects of a child's celiac disease diagnosis and disease management. METHODS: We interviewed 16 families with at least one child currently following a gluten-free diet, with a biopsy-confirmed celiac disease diagnosis >= 1 year prior. Mothers and fathers independently rated child's dietary adherence, concern about child's health status, burden in caring for child's dietary needs, and level of change in various aspects of life post- diagnosis. Children rated their own celiac-specific quality of life through a validated scale. Seventy-one in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 children with celiac disease, 31 parents, and 24 siblings. RESULTS: Mothers and fathers rated the effects of their child's celiac disease differently, with mothers reporting more lifestyle changes and heavier burden. Negative and positive themes emerged from the interviews. Mothers felt the burden of managing a gluten-free diet. Fathers felt guilty for carrying a celiac disease-associated gene and both fathers and siblings regretted limited food choices at restaurants and home. The need to be a more creative cook was seen as a positive effect by mothers. Fathers appreciated new family traditions. Siblings felt they had developed empathy for others. A framework is proposed to illustrate these family-wide interactions. CONCLUSIONS: A child's celiac disease diagnosis and disease management affects the entire family. Our results will inform family-centered interventions that maximize quality of life for families.
31601008	Neighborhood Deprivation and Risks of Autoimmune Disorders: A National Cohort Study in Sweden.	Background: No study to date, as far as we know, has analyzed the potential effect of neighborhood-level deprivation on autoimmune disorders (ADs), when adjusted for individual-level characteristics. Methods: A total of 5.4 million individuals from 8363 neighborhoods, comprising the whole Swedish population (ages 25-74 years), were followed for the period 1 January 2000, until admission due to diagnosis of ADs during the period of the study, or the conclusion of the study (31 December 2010). We used a neighborhood deprivation index, constructed from variables such as low education, low income, unemployment, and social welfare assistance, to assess the level of neighborhood deprivation. Multilevel logistic regression was used in the analysis with individual level characteristics at the first level and level of neighborhood deprivation at the second level. Results: A significant association between level of neighborhood deprivation and ADs was found. The crude odds were 1.32 (95% confidence interval 1.27-1.36) for those residing in the high-deprived neighborhoods compared to those living in low-deprivation neighborhoods. In the full model, where individual level characteristics were taken into account, the odds of ADs were 1.18 (1.14-1.22) in the most deprived neighborhoods. Certain Ads-angiitis hypersensitive (5.14), ankylosing spondylitis (1.66), celiac disease (1.65), Crohn's disease (1.21), diabetes mellitus type 1 (1.45), Graves's disease (1.13), Hashimoto thyroiditis (1.51), psoriasis (1.15), rheumatoid arthritis (1.15), sarcoidosis (1.20), and systemic sclerosis (1.27)-remained significantly associated with high level of neighborhood deprivation after adjustment for the individual-level variables. Conclusion: This study is the largest to date analyzing the potential influence of neighborhood deprivation on ADs. Our results indicate that neighborhood deprivation may affect risk of ADs, independent of individual level sociodemographic characteristics. For health care policies, both individual and neighborhood level approaches seem to be of importance.
29884481	Addressing Barriers for Patients with Celiac Disease When Assessing for Gluten in Medications.	
38474870	Preparation and Immunochemical Characterization of a Water-Soluble Gluten Peptide Fraction for Improving the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease.	The diagnosis of celiac disease (CD) is complex and requires a multi-step procedure (symptoms, serology, duodenal biopsy, effect of a gluten-free diet, and optional genetic). The aim of the study was to contribute to the improvement of CD diagnosis by preparing a water-soluble gluten peptide fraction (called Solgluten) and by selecting gluten-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for the detection of gluten immunogenic gluten peptides (GIPs) in urine and blood serum spiked with Solgluten. Food-grade Solgluten was prepared by the extraction of a peptic digest of vital gluten with water, centrifugation, and freeze-drying. The process was relatively easy, repeatable, and cheap. The content of gliadin-derived GIPs was 491 mg/g. Solgluten was used as antigenic material to compare two competitive ELISA kits (R7021 and K3012) and two sandwich ELISA kits (M2114 and R7041) in their quality regarding the quantitation of GIPs in urine and blood serum. The quality parameters were the reactivity, sensitivity, coefficients of variation and determination, and curve shape. The evaluation of the kits showed a number of discrepancies in individual quality parameters measured in urine and serum. Due to the lowest limit of quantitation and the highest coefficient of determination, M2114 may be the first choice, while R7021 appeared to be less suitable because of the high coefficients of variation and unfavorable curve progression. The results set the stage for improving CD diagnosis by supplementing conventional blood tests with oral provocation with Solgluten and subsequent ELISA measurement of GIPs that could support the no-biopsy approach and by better assessing the effect of a gluten-free diet by monitoring adherence to the diet by measuring GIPs in urine and blood.

34456226	Celiac disease: clinical update.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review highlights literature from the past year and explores the impact on current understanding of celiac disease pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management. RECENT FINDINGS: In contrast to earlier clinical trials, recent data suggests that early gluten introduction may protect against the development of celiac disease. Celiac disease is underdiagnosed, associated with high burden of disease and linked to excess mortality risk, yet, there remains considerable uncertainty regarding the utility of mass screening in asymptomatic individuals. The gut microbiome is increasingly implicated in celiac disease pathogenesis, although the exact mechanism is undefined. Probiotics have been proposed as a disease-modifying option for celiac disease but most studies assessing efficacy are of low-quality. Patients with celiac disease do not appear to be at increased risk of contracting or developing adverse outcomes from COVID-19. Little is known about the pathogenesis of nonceliac gluten sensitivity; however, recent findings suggest an autoimmune basis for the condition. SUMMARY: Current understanding of celiac disease continues to advance, though significant knowledge gaps remain. Large, rigorous, prospectively designed studies are needed to further characterize celiac disease pathogenesis, management and therapeutic options.
30143412	Are the dietary habits of treated individuals with celiac disease adherent to a Mediterranean diet?	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The only treatment for celiac disease (CD) is strict, lifelong adherence to a gluten-free (GF) diet. To date, there are contrasting data concerning the nutritional adequacy of GF products and diet. There have been no studies that have assessed the adherence of individuals with CD to a Mediterranean diet (MD), a protective dietary regimen against major non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Therefore, we examined the adherence to an MD of a group of Italian individuals with CD and compared it with that of a healthy control group. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a cross-sectional study, a sample of individuals with CD and a group of healthy subjects were included. The dietary habits of all participants were recorded using a validated food frequency questionnaire, and the adherence to an MD was determined using the Italian Mediterranean Index. Typical Mediterranean food consumption was not significantly different between individuals with CD and the healthy participants, except for fruits (P = 0.017). However, individuals with CD consumed significantly higher amounts of potatoes (P = 0.003) and red and processed meat (P = 0.005) than healthy participants. The resulting mean Italian Mediterranean Index was significantly higher in healthy participants than in individuals with CD (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The results raise questions concerning the food choices of individuals with CD, suggesting the need of encouraging them to make better food choices more in line with an MD, which would improve their nutritional status and better protect them from NCDs at long term. PROTOCOL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov (ID NCT01975155) on November 4 2013.
38216646	Barriers at various levels of human ecosystem for maintaining adherence to gluten free diet in adult patients with celiac disease.	INTRODUCTION: While lifelong and strict adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD) is essential for the successful treatment of celiac disease (CeD), only 30-50% of patients are able to maintain a good adherence to GFD. We determined factors influencing the adherence to GFD at various ecological levels including intra-personal, inter-personal, organizational, community and system-based levels in adult patients with CeD. METHODS: A questionnaire to assess the adherence was developed and it was administered in the CeD clinic to patients with CeD on GFD for >1 year. Adherence to GFD was assessed in a subset of patients (n = 320) using Celiac Disease Adherence Test (CDAT). RESULTS: Overall, 978 patients [median age: 29 years; females: 592] with CeD on GFD were recruited. They reported many barriers to adherence to GFD including intra-personal barriers such as lack of knowledge about GFD (19%), inadequate financial resources (27.2%) and lack of self-motivation/confidence (55.3%); inter-personal barriers such as intake of gluten-containing food upon forceful insistence of friends/family (23.4%); organizational barriers such as high cost (70.8%) and non-availability of GF-food products (48.6%); community-based barriers like consumption of gluten-containing food at religious occasions/festivals (11.1%) and social occasions (27.2%); and system-based barriers such as non-referral to dietitian for counseling (21.9%). As per CDAT, 204 (63.7%), 73(22.8%) and 43(13.4%) patients had good, average, and poor adherence to GFD, respectively. On multivariable analysis, occasional consumption of gluten, non-availability of GF-food while dining out and coercing by family and friends for consumption of GC-food were found to have highest odds for poor adherence to GFD. CONCLUSIONS: Non-referral to a dietitian for counseling, irregular follow-up visits, unavailability of flour mill, non-supportive family/friends, high cost and limited availability of GF-food are the most common barriers to adherence to GFD. There is a need to create infrastructure and develop strategies to overcome these diverse barriers at various levels of ecosystem and thereby facilitate better adherence to GFD.
28948465	Going Gluten Free: the History and Nutritional Implications of Today's Most Popular Diet.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The gluten-free diet (GFD) has become one of the most popular diets in modern history. Claims of improved health and increased energy fuel this popularity, though there is little evidence to substantiate these claims. The present review focuses on outlining known gluten-related disorders (GRD), discussing the GFD in the general population, exploring nutritional considerations, and providing advice for physicians in managing these patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Currently, about a quarter of the population reports keeping a GFD despite GRDs affecting less than half of these individuals. Reduced intake of calcium, B vitamins, and fiber as well as enhanced consumption of fat and simple carbohydrates has consistently been reported and needs to be continually addressed. Although a necessity in proper management of GRDs, unforeseen nutritional complications may develop in patients who are gluten free for which enhanced physician awareness is vital to achieving optimal patient care.
32971511	Clinical characteristics of hospitalized and home isolated COVID-19 patients with type 1 diabetes.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To elucidate the clinical features of COVID-19 patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) under hospitalization and home isolation conditions. METHOD: This retrospective study was conducted among 32 patients with COVID-19 and T1D, who sought treatment at the Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia between May 01, 2020 and July 30, 2020. Patients data were extracted from electronic medical records. RESULTS: Of the total of 32 COVID-19 patients with T1D, 21.9% required hospitalization, while 78.1% underwent home isolation. Among the study population, 9.4% (3/32) were reported to have hypertension, 21.9% (7/32) had chronic pulmonary disease (CPD), 18.8% (6/32) had thyroid disorders, and 18.8% (6/32) had the celiac disease. Of the 32 studied patients, 68.8% (22/32) of them were reported as normal, while 28.1% (9/32) had chronic kidney disease (CKD) II and 3.1% (1/32) had end-stage renal failure. The most common symptoms observed among the hospitalized patients were nausea and vomiting (71.4%; 5/7), followed by fever (57.1%; 4/7), cough (42.8%; 3/7), sore throat (42.8%; 3/7), abdominal pain (42.8%; 3/7) and dyspnea (42.%; 3/7). The most common reasons for hospitalization were diabetic ketoacidosis (71.4%; 5/7) followed by bacterial pneumonia (14.3%; 1/7), fever (14.3%; 1/7), sore throat (14.3%; 1/7), severe hyperglycemia (14.3%; 1/7) and COVID-19 pneumonia (14.3%; 1/7). Except the severity of COVID-19 (p = 0.0001), none of the demographic and clinical parameters indicated statistically significant differences between patients requiring hospitalization and home isolation. CONCLUSION: Majority of the COVID-19 patients with T1D recovered with conservative treatment at home. Diabetic ketoacidosis was the most common reason for hospitalization.
33155859	ENT Manifestations of Celiac Disease: A Scholarly Review.	OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease is a common multisystemic autoimmune disorder. It is now increasingly recognized that it may present with extraintestinal manifestations which contribute to the difficulty in its diagnosis. The objective of this scholarly review was to examine the extraintestinal ENT manifestations of celiac disease and its pathophysiology and management, in order to highlight that some patients with celiac disease may present initially to the otolaryngologist. Improving awareness of celiac disease among otolaryngologists may aid in the correct diagnosis and correct management plan. METHODS: A literature review was conducted using the PubMed database to identify original articles related to celiac disease and ENT manifestations between the years 2000 and 2020. The search was performed using the search string: ("coeliac disease" OR "celiac disease") AND ("ENT manifestations" OR "hearing loss" OR "epistaxis" OR "nasal septal perforation" OR "obstructive sleep apnoea" OR "vertigo" OR "tonsillitis" OR "sinusitis"). Only articles written in English were reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 17 papers met the inclusion criteria. Extraintestinal ENT manifestations of celiac disease include sensorineural hearing loss, obstructive sleep apnea, nasal septal perforation, epistaxis, and vertigo with nystagmus. Sensorineural hearing loss, obstructive sleep apnea, nasal septal perforation, vertigo, and nystagmus are thought to result from immunologically mediated mechanisms, with intestinal malabsorption resulting in epistaxis. CONCLUSIONS: Celiac disease can cause extraintestinal ENT manifestations and requires a high index of suspicion from the otolaryngologist to diagnose and suitably manage. A gluten-free diet may result in sufficient symptom resolution for most manifestations. Sensorineural hearing loss due to celiac disease appears to be progressive and permanent and may require frequent audiological monitoring.
30149623	Quality of Life of Celiac Patients in Brazil: Questionnaire Translation, Cultural Adaptation and Validation.	(1) Background: Celiac disease (CD) is a common autoimmune disorder. The manifestations of the disease and the obligatory life-long gluten-free diet (GFD) are associated with the impairment of patients' quality of life. Therefore, the present study aimed to translate, culturally adapt and validate a celiac disease quality of life (CD-QoL) questionnaire and apply it to a representative number of Brazilian CD patients. (2) Methods: A cross-cultural Brazilian-Portuguese version of the CD-QoL was developed according to revised international guidelines. The questionnaire was administered to 450 celiac patients. The reliability, reproducibility and validity were studied. (3) Results: The Brazilian CD-QoL questionnaire presents valid measures of reproducibility and internal consistency. Early diagnosis is related to higher scores of Brazilian CD-QoL social, sub- and total scale. There was a positive correlation between higher education level and higher QoL. Individuals with partners tend to have a better emotional subscale of QoL. CD-patients who follow a strict GFD have highest QoL scale values. Men scored higher than women on the CD-QoL. All results were statistically significant except for the gastrointestinal subscale. (4) Conclusions: Brazilian CD-QoL allows comparative research between different celiac populations in the world. QoL research will help in the development of effective strategies to improve Brazilian celiac patients' quality of life.
35705069	Referral for Dietary Intervention in Celiac Disease Is Low among Gastroenterologists and Primary Care Providers.	BACKGROUND: Strict adherence to a gluten-free diet is the only known effective treatment for celiac disease currently. Multiple organizations recommend follow-up with a dietitian and guideline-directed management after diagnosis. Few studies have evaluated follow-up post diagnosis. However, these do not include a systematic process for monitoring dietary referral among celiac disease patients. We sought to evaluate and compare the frequency of early dietary referral and guideline-directed preventive care and management for celiac disease patients managed by gastroenterologists and primary care providers. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of celiac disease patients receiving care at a single tertiary care facility. Our primary outcome was to compare the frequency of dietary intervention between gastroenterologists and primary care providers in an outpatient setting after initial diagnosis. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine associated factors for referral for dietary intervention and recommended follow-up lab work. RESULTS: 261 patients were included in the study, 81.6% were followed by gastroenterologist and only 51% were seen by a dietitian. Patients following up with gastroenterologists had higher odds of referral for dietary intervention on multivariate analysis (OR 3.29, p value <0.003). Only 16% of all patients completed appropriate guideline-directed follow-up care. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary intervention and follow-up of preventive care lab work were low in celiac disease patients. There is an opportunity for further education of both primary care providers and gastroenterologists on the importance of early dietary referral and appropriate medical management at follow-up.
29243104	Skepticism Regarding Vaccine and Gluten-Free Food Safety Among Patients with Celiac Disease and Non-celiac Gluten Sensitivity.	BACKGROUND: There has been a marked increase in the adoption of the gluten-free (GF) diet. AIMS: To query individuals with celiac disease (CD) and non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) on their beliefs toward the health effects of gluten, and safety of vaccines and GF food products. METHODS: We distributed a Web-based survey to individuals with CD and NCGS on a CD center e-mail list. We used univariate and multivariate analysis to compare responses of respondents with CD and NCGS. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 27% (NCGS n = 217, CD n = 1291). Subjects with NCGS were more likely than those with CD to disagree with the statement that "vaccines are safe for people with celiac disease" (NCGS 41.3% vs. CD 26.4% (p < 0.0001), and were more likely to decline vaccination when offered (30.9 vs. 24.2%, p = 0.007). After adjusting for age and gender, NCGS subjects were more likely than CD subjects to avoid genetically modified (GMO) foods (aOR 2.30; 95% CI 1.71-3.10), eat only organic products (aOR 2.87; 95% CI 2.04-4.03), believe that the FDA is an unreliable source of information (aOR 1.82, 95% CI 1.26-2.64), and believe a GF diet improves energy and concentration (aOR 2.52; 95% CI 1.86-3.43). CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with NCGS were more likely than those with CD to have doubts about vaccine safety and believe in the value of non-GMO and organic foods. Our findings suggest that the lack of reliable information on gluten and its content in food and medications may reinforce beliefs that result in a detriment to public health.
34062843	Intracortical and Intercortical Motor Disinhibition to Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Newly Diagnosed Celiac Disease Patients.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) may present or be complicated by neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) probes brain excitability non-invasively, also preclinically. We previously demonstrated an intracortical motor disinhibition and hyperfacilitation in de novo CD patients, which revert back after a long-term gluten-free diet (GFD). In this cross-sectional study, we explored the interhemispheric excitability by transcallosal inhibition, which has never been investigated in CD. METHODS: A total of 15 right-handed de novo, neurologically asymptomatic, CD patients and 15 age-matched healthy controls were screened for cognitive and depressive symptoms to the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), respectively. TMS consisted of resting motor threshold, amplitude, latency, and duration of the motor evoked potentials, duration and latency of the contralateral silent period (cSP). Transcallosal inhibition was evaluated as duration and latency of the ipsilateral silent period (iSP). RESULTS: MoCA and HDRS scored significantly worse in patients. The iSP and cSP were significantly shorter in duration in patients, with a positive correlation between the MoCA and iSP. CONCLUSIONS: An intracortical and interhemispheric motor disinhibition was observed in CD, suggesting the involvement of GABA-mediated cortical and callosal circuitries. Further studies correlating clinical, TMS, and neuroimaging data are needed.

35016615	The effect of group-based education on gastrointestinal symptoms and quality of life in patients with celiac disease: randomized controlled clinical trial.	BACKGROUND: In this trial, we investigated the effect of a group-based education program on gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and quality of life (QOL) in patients with celiac disease (CD). METHOD: In the present study, 130 patients with CD who were on a GFD for at least 3 months, randomly assigned to receive group-based education (n = 66) or routine education in the celiac clinic (n = 64) for 3 months. We assessed gastrointestinal symptoms and quality of life using the gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (GSRS) questionnaire and SF-36 questionnaire at baseline and 3 months after interventions. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 37.57 +- 9.59 years. There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding the baseline values. Results showed that the mean score of total GSRS score in the intervention group was significantly lower compared with the control group 3 months post-intervention (p = 0.04). Also, there was a significant difference in the mean score of SF-36 between the two groups 3 months post-intervention (p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Results showed that group-based education was an effective intervention in patients with celiac disease to improve gastrointestinal symptoms and quality of life. Trial registration IRCT code: IRCT20080904001197N21; registration date: 5/23/2019.
37004970	Effectiveness of Hepatitis B Vaccination for Patients With Inflammatory Bowel and Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Guidelines recommend measuring antibody (Ab) titers to hepatitis B virus (HBV) after vaccination for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or celiac disease (CD) ("IBD/CD patients") and revaccinating when titers are low. Few data, however, support this recommendation. We aimed to compare effectiveness of HBV vaccination (immunity and infection rates) for IBD/CD patients vs matched referents. METHODS: Using the Rochester Epidemiology Project, we performed a retrospective cohort study of patients first diagnosed with IBD/CD (index date) while residing in Olmsted County, Minnesota, from January 1, 2000, through December 31, 2019. HBV screening results were obtained from health records. RESULTS: In 1,264 incident cases of IBD/CD, only 6 HBV infections were diagnosed before the index date. A total of 351 IBD/CD cases had documented receipt of 2 or more HBV vaccines before their index date and had hepatitis B surface antigen Ab (anti-HBs) titers measured after their index date. The proportion of patients with HBV-protective titers (>=10 mIU/mL) decreased with time before plateauing, with protective-titer rates of 45% at 5 up to 10 years and 41% at 15 up to 20 years after the last HBV vaccination. The proportion of referents with protective titers also decreased with time and was consistently higher than IBD/CD patients' levels within 15 years after the last HBV vaccination. However, no new HBV infection developed in any of 1,258 IBD/CD patients during a median follow-up of 9.4 (IQR, 5.0-14.1) years. CONCLUSIONS: Routine testing of anti-HBs titers may not be indicated for fully vaccinated IBD/CD patients. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings in other settings and populations.
31082840	Promotion of Testing for Celiac Disease and the Gluten-Free Diet Among Complementary and Alternative Medicine Practitioners.	INTRODUCTION: We identified the frequency and assessed the validity of marketing claims made by American chiropractors, naturopaths, homeopaths, acupuncturists, and integrative medicine practitioners relating to the diagnosis and treatment of celiac disease and nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), both of which have increased in prevalence in recent years. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study analyzing websites of practitioners from 10 cities in the United States and analyzed the websites for any mention of celiac or NCGS as well as specific claims of ability to diagnose, ability to treat, and treatment efficacy. We classified treatments promoted as true, false, or unproven, as assessed independently by 2 authors. RESULTS: Of 500 clinics identified, 178 (35.6%) made a claim regarding celiac disease, NCGS, or a gluten-free diet. Naturopath clinic websites have the highest rates of advertising at least one of diagnosis, treatment, or efficacy for celiac disease (40%), followed by integrative medicine clinics (36%), homeopaths (20%), acupuncturists (14%), and chiropractors (12%). Integrative medicine clinics have the highest rates of advertising at least one of diagnosis, treatment, or efficacy for NCGS (45%), followed by naturopaths (37%), homeopaths (14%), chiropractors (14%), and acupuncturists (10%). A geographic analysis yielded no significant variation in marketing rates among clinics from different cities. Of 232 marketing claims made by these complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) clinic websites, 138 (59.5%) were either false or unproven. DISCUSSION: A significant number of CAM clinics advertise diagnostic techniques or treatments for celiac disease or NCGS. Many claims are either false or unproven, thus warranting a need for increased regulation of CAM advertising to protect the public.
36503568	Malignant complications of celiac disease: a case series and review of the literature.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. Diagnosis is based on evaluating specific autoantibodies and histopathologic findings of duodenal biopsy specimens. The only therapy for celiac disease is a gluten-free diet. Celiac disease can be complicated by malnutrition, other autoimmune diseases, refractoriness to treatment, and gastrointestinal tumors. This article presents seven cases of malignancies in patients with celiac disease. Its objective is to raise awareness of the malignant complications of celiac disease, leading to earlier diagnosis and improved outcomes. CASE PRESENTATION: Seven cases of malignant complications of celiac disease occurred among 190 patients followed at the Department of Internal Medicine and Gastroenterology, University Hospital Brno from 2014 to 2021. We describe these cases and the presentation, diagnostic process, course, management, and outcomes for each, along with proposed potential risk factors of malignant complications. There was one Caucasian man who was 70 years old and six Caucasian women who were 36, 46, 48, 55, 73, and 82 years old in our cohort. Of the seven cases of malignancies in our cohort, four patients were diagnosed with small bowel adenocarcinoma, one with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, one with carcinoma of the tongue, and one with colorectal carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: Malignancies occurred in 3.7% of patients followed up for celiac disease. Awareness of the malignant complications of celiac disease, risk factors, presentation, and disease course could lead to earlier diagnosis and improved outcomes.
32239378	Characteristics and Maternal-Fetal Outcomes of Pregnant Women Without Celiac Disease Who Avoid Gluten.	BACKGROUND: Gluten avoidance among patients without celiac disease has become increasingly popular, especially among young and female demographics; however, no research has explored gluten avoidance during pregnancy, when nutrition is particularly important. AIMS: To determine whether avoiding gluten in pregnancy is associated with any medical, obstetric, or neonatal characteristics. METHODS: In this single-center retrospective cohort study, we identified women with singleton pregnancies who avoid gluten based on antenatal intake questionnaire responses and inpatient dietary orders, excluding those with celiac disease. Certain demographic, medical, obstetric, and neonatal characteristics were compared to matched controls who do not avoid gluten. RESULTS: From July 1, 2011 to July 1, 2019, 138 pregnant women who avoid gluten were admitted for delivery of singleton gestations. Compared to controls, gluten-avoidant women had fewer prior pregnancies (p = 0.005), deliveries (p < 0.0005), and living children (p < 0.0005), higher rates of hypothyroidism (OR = 3.22; p = 0.001) and irritable bowel syndrome (OR = 6.00; p = 0.019), higher second trimester hemoglobin (p = 0.018), and lower body mass index at delivery (p = 0.045). Groups did not differ in any obstetric or fetal characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Gluten avoidance in pregnancy is common and, in women without celiac disease, is associated with higher rates of hypothyroidism and irritable bowel syndrome, fewer pregnancies, term births, and living children, and lower peripartum BMI, but is not associated with any obstetric or neonatal comorbidities. Avoiding gluten does not appear to adversely affect maternal or fetal health, but reasons for gluten avoidance, as well as long-term maternal and pediatric outcomes after gluten avoidance in pregnancy, warrant further study.
38716937	Did diet compliance and remission reduce oxidative stress in celiac patients?	OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the effect of remission status on thiol-disulfide homeostasis in celiac patients and thus to indirectly determine the effect of oxidative stress and inflammation caused by non-compliance with the diet. METHODS: Between February 2019 and December 2021, 117 patients diagnosed with celiac disease were included in this prospective randomized and controlled study. In addition to routine tests of celiac patients, thiol and disulfide measurements were made from the blood both at the beginning of the study and at the end of the first year. RESULTS: While 52 of the patients (44.4%) were in remission, 65 patients (55.6%) were not. There was an evident increase in native thiol levels of the patients who were initially not in remission but went into at the end of the first year (347.4+-46.7 mumol/L vs. 365.3+-44.0 mumol/L; p=0.001). Mean plasma disulfide levels of patients with celiac going into remission became reduced in the first year from the level of 14.5+-5.1 mumol/L down to 8.9+-4.2 mumol/L (p<0.001). In celiac patients who entered remission, disulfide and anti-tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin A levels decreased in a correlation (r=0.526; p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Not being in remission in celiac disease leads to increased oxidative stress, and thiol-disulfide homeostasis is an indirect indicator of this. Additionally, providing remission in celiac patients reduces oxidative stress.
30835989	Pediatric Celiac Disease - A Review.	Our understanding of celiac disease is rapidly expanding. Previously thought to be a rare food intolerance, celiac disease is now recognized as a multifactorial autoimmune disorder with a vast array of presentations. Symptoms range from classic diarrhea, weight loss, and abdominal pain to constipation and extra-intestinal manifestations including anemia, elevated transaminase levels, osteoporosis, or aphthous stomatitis. Some cases are "silent" with no apparent symptoms at all. Although endoscopic biopsy and histology findings remain the gold standard for confirmatory diagnosis, serologic testing options continue to advance. Tissue-transglutaminase (tTG) IgA antibody levels alone have shown high sensitivity and specificity in patients over 2 years of age. The mainstay of treatment remains strict lifetime adherence to a gluten-free diet. Further discussion on the prevalence, pathogenesis, presentation, testing, and management of celiac disease will follow.

33053456	Symptoms of gluten ingestion in patients with non-celiac gluten sensitivity: A randomized clinical trial.	OBJECTIVES: Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is the presence of symptoms induced by gluten and relieved by a gluten-free diet (GFD) in patients without celiac disease or wheat allergy. Studies are mixed as to whether gluten is the main symptom trigger in patients with NCGS. Gluten immunogenic peptides (GIPs) in stool and urine are novel methods to monitor GFD compliance. Few studies have investigated their use in patients with NCGS. The aim of this study was to assess whether patients with NCGS have increased symptoms with gluten ingestion and to assess compliance with the GFD using stool and urine GIPs. METHOD: This was a prospective, randomized, double-blinded crossover trial evaluating symptoms in patients with NCGS. Thirty patients with NCGS and 43 healthy controls were placed on a GFD. Patients received 0.5 or 2 g/d of gluten for 7 d each. The remaining weeks, they received placebo for a total of 4 wk. Symptoms were evaluated weekly using the Celiac Symptom Index (CSI). Urine and stool samples were collected weekly and measured for the detection of GIPs to detect exposure to gluten. RESULTS: There was no difference in symptom severity within the NCGS group whether receiving placebo or gluten (32.69 versus 31.54, P = 0.64). Patients with NCGS had significantly higher CSI scores at baseline than healthy controls. Patients with NCGS were less likely to have stool and urine GIPs than healthy patients. CONCLUSION: Patients with NCGS were more adherent to the GFD based on stool and urine GIP results. Patients with NCGS had increased symptom severity at baseline compared with healthy controls. Neither group had significantly increased symptoms after ingestion of gluten.
31569610	Measuring Quality of Life in Parents or Caregivers of Children and Adolescents with Celiac Disease: Development and Content Validation of the Questionnaire.	Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder triggered by the ingestion of gluten and affects approximately 1% of the global population. Currently, the only treatment available is lifelong strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). Chronic diseases such as CD affect patients and their family members' quality of life (QoL); particularly parents and caregivers who play an essential role in the child's care and treatment. A higher level of psychological distress has been found in the parents of children with chronic ailments due to limited control over the child's daily activities and the child's illness. In this context, the validation of a specific questionnaire of QoL is a valuable tool to evaluate the difficulties faced by parents or caregivers of children with this chronic illness. A specific questionnaire for this population can elucidate the reasons for stress in their daily lives as well as the physical, mental, emotional, and social impact caused by CD. Therefore, this study aimed to develop and validate a specific questionnaire to evaluate the QoL of parents and caregivers of children and adolescents with CD. Overall results showed that a higher family income resulted in a higher score of the worries domain. In addition, having another illness besides CD decreased the QoL (except in the worries domain). The other variables studied did not present a statistically significant impact on the QoL, which was shown to be low in all aspects. Knowledge of the QoL is important to help implement effective strategies to improve celiac patients' quality of life and reduce their physical, emotional, and social burden.
31789773	The Impact of Celiac Disease on Caregivers' Well-being: An Integrative Review.	OBJECTIVES: A diagnosis of celiac disease (CD) requires individuals to adopt a strict gluten-free diet. As children with CD must rely on their caregivers for guidance and support with managing the gluten-free diet, CD may challenge the caregiver's emotional and social well-being. The primary objective of this mixed-methods systematic review was to synthesize research investigating the impact of CD on caregiver's well-being. METHODS: Five databases were systematically searched from 1990 to 2018 to identify all empirical studies that assessed well-being in caregivers of children (0-18 years) with CD. Qualitative and quantitative data were extracted separately before being integrated to explore key themes across the studies. RESULTS: Twelve studies were identified that explored the well-being of caregivers of children with CD (3 qualitative, 9 quantitative), reporting on 665 caregivers. The quality of evidence was limited across studies. Synthesis of results revealed 3 themes (Caregiver Responsibility, Caregiver Well-Being and Concern for Child's Health, Implications for the Family) describing the impact of a child with CD on caregiver well-being. CONCLUSIONS: Caregivers of children with CD may experience difficulties that impact their well-being; specific difficulties identified included the impact of caregivers' social activities, finances, and anxiety. The findings detailed in this review point toward factors that may guide health care personnel to provide support for the caregivers of children with CD.
29699403	Ten years of follow-up of the Spanish cohort of the European PreventCD study: the lessons learned.	AIM: to evaluate the influence of gluten consumption on celiac disease development and to describe its natural history in the Spanish cohort of the European PreventCD study. METHODS: prospective multi-center double blind study of 225 children that were followed up from birth. All cases were HLA-DQ2/HLA-DQ8 positive with a 1st degree relative with celiac disease and were followed up in three centers from Madrid, Reus and Valencia. Gluten intake was determined between four and ten months according to the protocol. Gluten intake was ad libitum between eleven and 36 months and was prospectively quantified by means of dietary records. Clinical visits and specific antibody analysis for celiac disease were performed periodically. RESULTS: twenty-six cases were diagnosed, all had a positive biopsy and serology; 21 had gastrointestinal symptoms and five were asymptomatic. In addition, 2,565 food records were analyzed and statistically significant differences (p < 0.001) were found with regard to gluten consumption among the three centers, although not between celiac and non-celiac children (p = 0.025). The HLA-DQ2.5/DQ2.5 and DQ2.5/DQ2.2 genotypes had a relative risk of 4.7 (95% CI: 0.80-27.55; p = 0.08), which was higher than for the rest of genotypes. Female gender also had a relative risk that was five times higher than that for males. CONCLUSIONS: the amount of gluten intake between 11 and 36 months or the duration of breast feeding were not risk factors for the development of CD in the Spanish population. The HLA genotype and gender were the most relevant associated factors. In this at-risk group, the disease presented before two years of age in the majority of the cases with a weak clinical expression.
30714395	Optimization of hot-air drying conditions for cassava flour for its application in gluten-free pasta formulation.	The design and development of gluten-free foods requires a comprehensive understanding of the behavior of the raw materials to attain the same cooking and nutritional quality as gluten-based food. The objective of this study was to determine the optimal hot-air drying conditions for elaboration of cassava flour to be used in a gluten-free pasta formulation. The results showed that the operational conditions to minimize the hot-air drying time (57 min) to produce cassava flour with higher water holding capacity was 57 C at 3 m/s. Then, the optimal formulation for the pasta was found to be cassava (26 g/100 g), amaranth flour (12 g/100 g), and carboxymethyl cellulose (0.23 g/100 g), which maximized the Aw (0.160), moisture content (3.10 g/100 g), hardness (5.02 N), and protein content (9.30 g/100 g), and it is used for the sensorial analysis, which showed that an earthy taste was the main problem with consumer satisfaction.
29529159	Determination of gluten consumption in celiac disease patients on a gluten-free diet.	Background: Celiac disease (CD) patients adhering to a gluten-free diet (GFD) are exposed frequently to low levels of gluten that contribute to symptoms and persistent intestinal histologic damage. Objective: We analyzed prior clinical data to determine how much gluten is accidentally consumed while on a GFD. The aim was to understand the range of gluten consumption for a wide distribution of CD patients. Design: A meta-analysis was conducted on data from 2 different clinical programs: 1) measurements of gluten in stool and urine in CD and non-CD populations; and 2) analysis of data from trials for the investigational therapeutic latiglutenase. The stool and urine studies included controlled gluten challenges. A calibration factor was applied that allowed normal ingestion of gluten to be computed from the urine and stool measurements. From the latiglutenase trial data, a determination of gluten consumption was made by estimating how much gluten was eliminated from patients' diets due to a trial effect that led to improved histology even in the placebo group. Results: The average inadvertent exposure to gluten by CD individuals on a GFD was estimated to be ~150-400 (mean) and ~100-150 (median) mg/d using the stool test and ~300-400 (mean) and ~150 (median) mg/d using the urine test. The analyses of the latiglutenase data for CD individuals with moderate to severe symptoms indicate that patients ingested significantly >200 mg/d of gluten. Conclusions: These surrogate biomarkers of gluten ingestion indicate that many individuals following a GFD regularly consume sufficient gluten to trigger symptoms and perpetuate intestinal histologic damage.
37686713	Uncovering the Concerns and Needs of Individuals with Celiac Disease: A Cross-Sectional Study.	The treatment for celiac disease (CD) involves a strict gluten-free diet, which can be challenging and lead to questions for patients. Pinpointing these uncertainties can enable the creation of efficient educational resources. In this study, a questionnaire was specifically designed to gain insights into the knowledge, concerns, and needs of individuals with CD and their supporters. The questionnaire was distributed through the Instagram social network and received adequate responses from 300 participants, 258 (86%) being female and 152 (50.7%) falling in the age range of 25-44 years. The concerns of individuals with celiac disease and celiac supporters were rated on a 1-4 scale, with a mean score of 3.5 indicating significant concern. A total of 255 (85%) of all participants expressed that their principal concern was the social limitations they faced, such as difficulties in eating out and sharing food with others. Every participant evaluated their overall disease knowledge, averaging at 2.92 out of 4, indicating a reasonable level of awareness. When asked if they believed that improving general knowledge about CD in the general population would enhance their quality of life, the vast majority responded affirmatively. This finding underscores the importance of not only educating individuals with CD but also reaching out to the wider population, especially those who have a direct impact on the daily lives of individuals with CD, such as family members, friends, and food service providers.
35051648	A Low FODMAP Diet Reduces Symptoms in Treated Celiac Patients With Ongoing Symptoms-A Randomized Controlled Trial.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: A gluten-free diet usually leads to mucosal remission in celiac disease, but persistent symptoms are common. A low fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) diet is an established treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We have assessed the efficacy of a moderately low FODMAP diet on persistent symptoms in treated celiac patients. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was performed from 2018 to 2019 in 70 adults with biopsy-proven celiac disease. Inclusion criteria were as follows: persistent gastrointestinal symptoms defined by a Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS)-IBS version score of 30 or higher, gluten-free diet adherence for 12 months or longer, and serologic and mucosal remission. Participants were randomized to a low FODMAP-gluten-free diet (intervention) or usual gluten-free diet (control). The GSRS-IBS score was recorded at baseline and at weeks 1 to 4, and the Celiac Symptom Index at baseline and at week 4. Statistics included marginal models for repeated data and analyses of covariance. RESULTS: We included 34 participants in the intervention group and 36 in the control group. Time development of GSRS-IBS total scores differed significantly between the groups (Pinteraction < .001), evident after 1 week (mean difference in intervention vs control, -8.2; 95% CI, -11.5 to -5.0) and persisting through week 4 (mean difference in intervention vs control, -10.8; 95% CI, -14.8 to -6.8). Moreover, significantly lower scores were found for the dimensions of pain, bloating, diarrhea, and satiety (Pinteraction <= .04), but not constipation (Pinteraction = .43). FODMAP intake during the intervention was moderately low (mean, 8.1 g/d; 95% CI, 6.7-9.3 g/d). The Celiac Symptom Index was significantly lower in the intervention group at week 4 (mean difference, -5.8; 95% CI, -9.6 to -2.0). CONCLUSIONS: A short-term moderately low FODMAP diet significantly reduced gastrointestinal symptoms and increased celiac disease-specific health, and should be considered for the management of persistent symptoms in celiac disease. CLINICALTRIALS: gov: NCT03678935.
35889899	Hepatic Steatosis in Patients with Celiac Disease: The Role of Packaged Gluten-Free Foods.	Background: An increased risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in patients with celiac disease (CD) adhering to a gluten-free diet (GFD) was recently reported. The nutritional composition of packaged gluten-free foods (PGFF) has been proposed as a possible cause. This hypothesis has not been investigated further, since a systematic structural nutritional interview for all patients would be problematic in clinical practice. Methods: We administered a simple questionnaire based on a Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value (RFM) analysis (a cornerstone of direct marketing segmentation) to consecutive CD patients on a GFD for >6 months and verified its association with NAFLD. Subgroup analyses were performed to understand whether specific patterns of PGFF consumption were significantly associated with NAFLD. Results: Amongst 147 patients (female 82%, median age 42 years), 45 (30.6%) had NAFLD. Total RFM score (adjusted odds ratio = 1.223, 95% CI: 1.059-1.413, p = 0.006), body mass index, and total cholesterol and triglycerides were independently related to NAFLD, and "Bread and bakery" (p = 0.002), "salty convenience" (p = 0.005), and "sweet convenience" (p = 0.049) products were significantly related with NAFLD. Also, questions about the number of purchased PGFF in the last month (monetary value) and different categories of PGFF consumed in the last week (recency) were particularly able to identify NAFLD patients. Conclusions: The specific GFD dietary habits of CD patients were correlated with the degree of risk of NAFLD. Information was obtained through a questionnaire which could be used in clinical practice to favor a patient-tailored approach and in future studies to verify the reproducibility of our results in different geographical areas.
35164408	Extrusion Cooking Effect on Carbohydrate Fraction in Novel Gluten-Free Flours Based on Chickpea and Rice.	Extrusion cooking allows the development of value-added products from pulses, such as gluten-free snacks with added functional properties. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the changes induced by the extrusion process on the carbohydrate fraction (total carbohydrates, soluble sugars and oligosaccharides, dietary fiber, and arabinoxylans) of novel flour formulations based on chickpeas and rice enriched with different dietary fiber sources. Moreover, the influence of the addition of fiber-rich ingredients, such as Fibersol  and passion fruit, on the analyzed compounds was also evaluated. Sucrose was the main soluble sugar found in analyzed formulations, and raffinose was the prevalent oligosaccharide, followed by stachyose. The content of total alpha-galactosides tended to be higher after extrusion cooking. As a consequence of the extrusion treatment, the content of total and soluble dietary fiber was statistically increased in most of the analyzed samples. In general, no significant changes were observed in total arabinoxylan content as a consequence of the extrusion process, while the content of water-soluble arabinoxylans was significantly increased in extruded formulations. It was observed that the content of total available carbohydrates, stachyose, and water-soluble arabinoxylans were significantly influenced by the addition of passion fruit, Fibersol , and both. The incorporation of these ingredients in gluten-free formulations based on chickpeas and rice allows one to obtain suitable functional formulations for the development of innovative, gluten-free, extruded snack-type products, which could be an interesting alternative for people with celiac disease.
35889749	Nutritional Status of Saudi Children with Celiac Disease Following the Ministry of Health's Gluten-Free Diet Program.	This study aimed to evaluate the nutritional status of Saudi children with celiac disease (CD) who followed the Ministry of Health's gluten-free diet (GFD) program. This study involved 66 children with CD (29 boys and 37 girls) from 5 hospitals belonging to the Ministry of Health. Socioeconomic characteristics were obtained using a structured questionnaire. Anthropometric indices were measured using a body composition analyzer. Dietary intake was assessed using three 24 h dietary records. The biochemical parameters were determined in the hospitals' laboratories. According to the findings, the majority of respondents had ages ranging from 10 to 13 years, a father and mother with a university education, a high family income, and 5 to 7 family members. Carbohydrates and protein intake for both genders were significantly higher than the DRI's recommended dietary intake. However, the majority of nutrients consumed were at levels significantly lower than the DRI. Both genders had normal anthropometric indices, with girls having at significantly higher indices than boys. The biochemical parameters of both genders were comparable and within the normal range, except for vitamin D, which was below the normal range. The most important factors influencing nutritional status were age for both genders, and family income and number of family members for boys. In conclusion, data obtained for nutrient intake, anthropometric indicators, body composition, and biochemical analysis indicated that CD children following the Ministry of Health GFD program have a generally good nutritional status.
32111387	Two decades of pediatric celiac disease in a tertiary referral center: What has changed?	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is common worldwide with increasing prevalence and changing presentation. AIMS: To evaluate changes in the presentation and management of CD over the last two decades. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of pediatric patients with CD between 01.1999 to 12.2018 was performed. Comparisons were made between an early (1999 to 2008) and late (2009 to 2018) decade, regarding clinical and laboratory parameters at presentation and follow-up. RESULTS: In a cohort of 932 patients (early decade n = 316, late decade n = 616), patients from the late decade presented with lower rates of weight loss and abdominal distention (24.2% vs 34.7% and 6% vs 11%, respectively p < 0.01), and with higher rates of abdominal pain or asymptomatic presentation (41.4% vs 27.4%, p < 0.01, and 18% vs 13%, p < 0.05, respectively). Good adherence to gluten-free diet was reported more often in the late decade (64% vs 50.6%, p < 0.001), and fewer patients were lost to follow-up. During the late decade, significantly higher rates of celiac serology normalization were achieved during the first two years of follow-up. CONCLUSION: In recent years, children with CD were diagnosed with milder symptoms, showed better adherence and demonstrated earlier normalization of celiac serology.
33729309	[Weaknesses in healthcare for persons with gluten-related disorders].	Gluten-related disorders affect 1% to 6% of the population, with complications and high risk of short and long-term morbidity and mortality. Since 2009, Brazil has a Clinical Protocol of Therapeutic Guidelines for Celiac Disease, but there are frequent complaints by persons with gluten-related disorders concerning the lack of healthcare professionals' knowledge of this topic and the difficulties related to healthcare, for both diagnosis and treatment. This study aimed to understand the weaknesses in healthcare perceived by persons with gluten-related disorders. An online qualitative survey was conducted in the Living Without Gluten group on Facebook, consulting the records saved by the group for 65 months, which totaled 510 posts and the respective comments. The data were grouped in categories, and thematic content analysis was performed, adopting the theoretical references on healthcare. The analysis revealed that the searches for diagnosis and adequate treatment were often described as a forced pilgrimage, resulting from shortcomings in healthcare, including lack of up-to-date knowledge on gluten-related disorders among the healthcare professionals and problems in the physician-patient relationship. Weaknesses in patient care and late diagnoses contribute to increasing the risk of complications and deaths. In this context, the Living Without Gluten group plays a leading role as a support group and network of solidarity, favoring increased awareness and empowerment of numerous Brazilians with gluten-related disorders.
33462461	Gluten content in labeled and unlabeled gluten-free food products used by patients with celiac disease.	OBJECTIVE: Gluten-free (GF) diet is the only reliable treatment for patients with celiac disease (CeD), but data on the extent of gluten contamination in GF food available in India is scanty. We evaluated gluten content in labeled, imported, and non-labeled GF food products currently available in the Indian market. METHODS: Overall, 794 processed and commercially available packaged GF products (labeled GF (n = 360), imported GF (n = 80), and non-labeled/naturally GF (n = 354)) were collected from supermarkets of National Capital Region of India. Those unavailable in stores were purchased from e-commerce sites or directly from the manufacturers. Gluten level in them was determined by Ridascreen Gliadin sandwich R5 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R-Biopharm AG, Germany). As per Codex Alimentarius and Food Safety and Standard Authority of India, "gluten free" labeled products must not contain > 20 mg/kg of gluten. RESULTS: Overall, 10.1% of 794 GF products including 38 (10.8%) of 360 labeled and 42 (11.8%) of 354 non-labeled/naturally GF food products had gluten content > 20 mg/kg (range: 24.43-355 and 23.2-463.8 mg/kg, respectively). None of the imported GF products had gluten more than the recommended limits. Contaminated products most commonly belonged to cereal and their products (flours, coarse grains, pasta/macaroni, snack foods) pulse flours, spices, and bakery items. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion (10.1%) of GF food products (both labeled and non-labeled) available in India have gluten content greater than the prescribed limits of <20 mg/kg. Physicians, dietitians, support group, and patients with CeD should be made aware of this fact and regulatory bodies should ensure quality assurance.
31546057	A Cooking-Based Intervention Promotes Gluten-Free Diet Adherence and Quality of Life for Adults with Celiac Disease.	Current treatment for celiac disease (CD) requires a life-long gluten-free diet (GFD).1 Among the top challenges are eating outside the home2 and over-reliance on processed foods, which are often high-fat, low-fiber, and high-sugar.3 Home cooking is a GFD management strategy that addresses both. Research not specific to CD suggests a variety of positive outcomes related to home cooking: healthier dietary pattern, positive self-management behaviors (eg, improved glycosylated hemoglobin and cholesterol levels), increased willingness to integrate complex dietary changes, and improved quality of life (QOL).4-6 In this study we assessed the feasibility and acceptability of a cooking-based nutrition education intervention to promote GFD adherence and QOL among adults with CD.
34210037	Food Safety and Cross-Contamination of Gluten-Free Products: A Narrative Review.	A gluten-free diet (GFD) is currently the only effective treatment for celiac disease (CD); an individual's daily intake of gluten should not exceed 10 mg. However, it is difficult to maintain a strict oral diet for life and at least one-third of patients with CD are exposed to gluten, despite their best efforts at dietary modifications. It has been demonstrated that both natural and certified gluten-free foods can be heavily contaminated with gluten well above the commonly accepted threshold of 20 mg/kg. Moreover, meals from food services such as restaurants, workplaces, and schools remain a significant risk for inadvertent gluten exposure. Other possible sources of gluten are non-certified oat products, numerous composite foods, medications, and cosmetics that unexpectedly contain "hidden" vital gluten, a proteinaceous by-product of wheat starch production. A number of immunochemical assays are commercially available worldwide to detect gluten. Each method has specific features, such as format, sample extraction buffers, extraction time and temperature, characteristics of the antibodies, recognition epitope, and the reference material used for calibration. Due to these differences and a lack of official reference material, the results of gluten quantitation may deviate systematically. In conclusion, incorrect gluten quantitation, improper product labeling, and poor consumer awareness, which results in the inadvertent intake of relatively high amounts of gluten, can be factors that compromise the health of patients with CD.
37855116	The use of urine peptidomics to define dietary gluten peptides from patients with celiac disease and the clinical relevance.	INTRODUCTION: Determination of urinary gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) has emerged as one of the most attractive test to monitor the adherence to the gluten-free diet (GFD) of patients with celiac disease (CD), being a simple, noninvasive and direct method to detect gluten contamination of the GFD. AREAS COVERED: We conducted a scoping review in Medline (PubMed) of articles published up to April 2023 that analyzed any aspect of the clinical relevance of the use of urinary GIP measurement in patients with CD. A total of 17 articles reporting the clinical use of urinary peptidomics for the follow-up of CD patients were finally included. EXPERT OPINION: Available data suggest that a negative urinary GIP result is a reliable noninvasive predictor of intestinal mucosa healing in CD patients treated with the GFD, especially if testing three urine samples on different days including the weekend. Due to conflicting results about the sensitivity and the specificity of the urinary GIP determination, additional in-depth information is needed, particularly related to (1) the relationship between the amount of ingested gluten and the quantity of urinary GIP excreted in treated CD patients, (2) the GIP kinetics and best timing for sample collection.
37049570	Evaluation of the Usefulness of an Automatable Immunoassay for Monitoring Celiac Disease by Quantification of Immunogenic Gluten Peptides in Urine.	A gluten-free diet (GFD) is currently the only treatment available for patients with celiac disease (CD). However, adherence to a GFD can be challenging because gluten is present in many foods. A lifelong follow-up of patients with CD must be performed to promote adherence to a GFD and to identify the appearance of symptoms and the associated diseases. Therefore, the development of tools to analyze gluten exposure in these patients is important. This study proposes the development of the first automatable ELISA to monitor adherence to a GFD through the quantification of urine gluten immunogenic peptides (u-GIP). Seven healthy volunteers without suspicion of CD and 23 patients with CD were monitored as part of this study to optimize, validate, and apply this assay. Non-interference was found in the urine matrix, and the recovery percentage for spiked samples was 81-101%. The u-GIP was stable for up to 16 days when the samples were stored at different temperatures. Overall, 100% of the patients had detectable u-GIP at diagnosis (range of 0.39-2.14 ng GIP/mL), which reduced to 27% after 12 months on a GFD. Therefore, this highly sensitive immunoassay would allow the analysis of u-GIP from a large battery of samples in clinical laboratories of specialized healthcare centers.
30002342	Celiac Disease and Liver Disorders: From Putative Pathogenesis to Clinical Implications.	Immunologically mediated liver diseases belong to the common extraintestinal manifestations of celiac disease. We have reviewed the current literature that addresses the association between celiac disease and liver disorders. We searched relevant articles on MEDLINE/PubMed up to 15 June 2018. The objective of the article is to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date review on the latest hypotheses explaining the pathogenetic relationship between celiac disease and liver injury. Besides the involvement of gut-liver axis, tissue transglutaminase antibodies, and impairment of intestinal barrier, we integrate the latest achievements made in elucidation of the role of gut microbiota in celiac disease and liver disorders, that has not yet been sufficiently discussed in the literature in this context. The further objective is to provide a complete clinical overview on the types of liver diseases frequently found in celiac disease. In conclusion, the review highlights the clinical implication, recommend a rational approach for managing elevated transaminases in celiac patients, and underscore the importance of screening for celiac disease in patients with associated liver disease.
31476445	Antigen-specific tolerance to self-antigens in protein replacement therapy, gene therapy and autoimmunity.	Trials of antigen-specific tolerance have been undertaken in the clinic for over fifty years and the results of these antigen-specific clinical trials are described in this review. Antigen-specific tolerization of the immune system in protein replacement therapy for hemophilia A is an accepted treatment. Clinical trials are ongoing for autoimmune conditions such as type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, and rheumatoid arthritis with various antigen-specific strategies. Trials for tolerization in celiac disease aim for antigen specific tolerance to gluten, an environmental trigger, which may then halt the progression to autoimmunity targeting a self-antigen, tissue transglutaminase. Although many promising approaches have been demonstrated in pre-clinical models, this review will focus primarily on clinical trials of antigen-specific tolerance that have been taken to the clinic and with initial results reported in the peer reviewed literature. A separate article on approaches with CAR-T cells appears in this volume.
30012987	Effects of a Gluten-Containing Meal on Gastric Emptying and Gallbladder Contraction.	The ingestion of gluten has been associated with gastrointestinal symptoms even in the absence of detectable immune responses. Little is known about the pathophysiological effects of gluten on the upper gastrointestinal tract. We aimed to assess whether the ingestion of gluten leads to an impairment of the physiological mechanisms of gastric emptying, gallbladder contraction and relaxation. A total of 17 healthy subjects underwent ultrasound evaluation of gastric emptying dynamics and gallbladder contractions at baseline and every 30 min after a standard gluten-containing and gluten-free meal (250 kcal, 70% carbohydrates). The pattern of gastric emptying was similar after a standard meal with or without gluten, but differed in terms of the peak of the antral filling curve, which was wider (mean area 5.69, median 4.70, range 3.71-9.27 cm2 vs. mean 4.89, median 4.57, 2.27-10.22 cm2, p = 0.023) after the gluten-containing meal. The pattern of gallbladder contractions was different after the gluten-free meal (p < 0.05), with higher gallbladder volumes in the late refilling phases. The results of this study show that gluten ingestion exerts objective effects on gastric and gallbladder motility. Although the underlying pathophysiological mechanism remains unknown, these results could account for some of the gluten-related symptoms reported by patients with celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity.
29287009	Adherence to the Gluten-free Diet and Health-related Quality of Life in an Ethnically Diverse Pediatric Population With Celiac Disease.	OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease that requires lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). Adherence to the GFD in childhood may be poor and adversely influence health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The study purpose was to determine sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors influencing adherence to the GFD and HRQOL in a multiethnic cohort of youth with CD. METHODS: A multisite (Edmonton, Hamilton, Toronto) study examining child-parent HRQOL in youth with CD (n = 243) and/or mild gastrointestinal complaints (GI-CON; n = 148) was conducted. Sociodemographic (age, child-parental age/education/ethnicity/place of birth), anthropometric (weight, height, body mass index), disease (diagnosis, age at diagnosis, duration, Marsh score, serology), household characteristics (income, family size, region, number of children/total household size), HRQOL (Peds TM/KINDL and Celiac Disease DUX), GI Complaints (PedsQL: Gastrointestinal Symptom Scale) and gluten intake were measured. RESULTS: Younger age (<10 years), non-Caucasian ethnicity (parent/child), and presence of GI symptoms were associated with the highest rates of adherence to the GFD in CD children (P < 0.05). CD children (parent/child) had higher HRQOL (average, composite domains) than GI-CON (P < 0.05), but CD children were comparable to healthy children. Lack of GI symptoms, non-Caucasian ethnicity and age (<10 years) were associated with increased HRQOL in composite/average domains for CD (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Child-parent perceptions of HRQOL in a multiethnic population with CD are comparable to healthy reference populations, but significantly higher than in parent/child GI-CON. Adherence to the GFD in ethnically diverse youth with CD was related to GI symptoms, age of the child, and ethnicity of the parent-child.
30287726	The Effect of Gluten-Free Diet on Health and the Gut Microbiota Cannot Be Extrapolated from One Population to Others.	Gluten-related disorders (GRD) affect millions of people worldwide and have been related to the composition and metabolism of the gut microbiota. These disorders present differently in each patient and the only treatment available is a strict life-long gluten-free diet (GFD). Several studies have investigated the effect of a GFD on the gut microbiota of patients afflicted with GRD as well as healthy people. The purpose of this review is to persuade the biomedical community to think that, while useful, the results from the effect of GFD on health and the gut microbiota cannot be extrapolated from one population to others. This argument is primarily based on the highly individualized pattern of gut microbial composition and metabolic activity in each person, the variability of the gut microbiota over time and the plethora of factors associated with this variation. In addition, there is wide variation in the composition, economic viability, and possible deleterious effects to health among different GFD, both within and among countries. Overall, this paper encourages the conception of more collaborative efforts to study local populations in an effort to reach biologically and medically useful conclusions that truly contribute to improve health in patients afflicted with GRD.
32604710	Living with Gluten and Other Food Intolerances: Self-Reported Diagnoses and Management.	People suffering from a food intolerance (FI) tend to initiate restrictive diets such as a gluten-free diet (GFD), to alleviate their symptoms. To learn about how people live with these problems in daily life (independent of their medical diagnoses), 1203 participants answered a previously validated questionnaire and were divided into: G1 (those self-reporting symptoms after gluten consumption) and G2 (those informing no discomfort after gluten consumption). Self-reported clinical characteristics, diagnoses and diets followed were registered. Twenty nine percent referred some FI (8.5% in G1). In G1, self-reported diagnoses were more frequent (p < 0.0001), including a high proportion of eating and mood disorders. Diagnoses were reported to be given by a physician, but GFD was indicated by professional and nonprofessional persons. In G2, despite declaring no symptoms after gluten consumption, 11.1% followed a GFD. The most frequent answer in both groups was that GFD was followed "to care for my health", suggesting that some celiac patients do not acknowledge it as treatment. Conclusion: close to one third of the population report suffering from some FI. Those perceiving themselves as gluten intolerant report more diseases (p < 0.0001). A GFD is followed by ~11% of those declaring no symptoms after gluten ingestion. This diet is perceived as a healthy eating option.
30368766	Disordered eating behaviors in adolescents with celiac disease.	PURPOSE: Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic immune-mediated systemic disease characterized by inflammation and villous atrophy of the small intestine. A strict, lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only treatment for CD. Disordered eating behaviors (DEBs) prevail in adolescence and young adulthood, and confer a risk of developing into full-blown eating disorders. The aims of the current study were to assess the incidence and risk factors for DEBs among individuals with CD, and to examine an association between adherence to GFD and DEBs. METHODS: A cohort of 136 individuals with CD responded to a web-mediated survey that assessed DEBs and adherence to a GFD. The survey included demographic data (gender, age, weight, disease duration) and two self-rating questionnaires: the Eating Attitudes Test-26 and the gluten-free diet questionnaire. RESULTS: DEBs were found in 19% of female and 7% of male responders. These individuals were characterized by being overweight (p = 0.02), of an older age (p = 0.04) and female sex (p = 0.06). Strict adherence to a GFD was reported by 32% of the responders and was not correlated with age, disease duration, age at diagnosis of CD and with being overweight. CONCLUSIONS: Caregivers should be aware of the increased occurrence of DEBs in adolescents with CD, especially those who are overweight, older and of a female gender. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level V, cross-sectional descriptive study.
36583900	Celiac crisis with thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy in a child.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease rarely presents with edema, hypoalbuminemia, acute metabolic deterioration, and electrolyte imbalances. This life-threatening condition is defined as a celiac crisis and may mimic disorders with metabolic derangement and sepsis. The crisis may present at onset or develop in celiac disease patients with poor compliance to a gluten-free diet. The fluid resuscitation and replacement of electrolyte deficits are life-saving modalities. CASE: A 14-month-old girl was admitted with fever, lethargy, severe dehydration, edema, hypotension, and commenced sepsis therapy. However, the patient had a growth delay and loss of weight with diarrhea and delayed motor skills. On admission, laboratory evaluation showed anemia, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminemia, electrolyte disturbances, and metabolic acidosis and developed thrombocytopenia during follow-up. The celiac serological tests and upper gastrointestinal endoscopic duodenal mucosa appearance, and duodenum histopathology findings suggested celiac disease. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights that a celiac patient may present with a severe illness like sepsis and may be associated with cytopenia and coagulopathy in the celiac crisis.
29684362	Characterization of the Small Intestinal Lesion in Celiac Disease by Label-Free Quantitative Mass Spectrometry.	Global characterization of tissue proteomes from small amounts of biopsy material has become feasible because of advances in mass spectrometry and bioinformatics tools. In celiac disease (CD), dietary gluten induces an immune response that is accompanied by pronounced remodeling of the small intestine. Removal of gluten from the diet abrogates the immune response, and the tissue architecture normalizes. In this study, differences in global protein expression of small intestinal biopsy specimens from CD patients were quantified by analyzing formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded material using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and label-free protein quantitation. Protein expression was compared in biopsy specimens collected from the same patients before and after 1-year treatment with gluten-free diet (n = 10) or before and after 3-day gluten provocation (n = 4). Differential expression of proteins in particular from mature enterocytes, neutrophils, and plasma cells could distinguish untreated from treated CD mucosa, and Ig variable region IGHV5-51 expression was found to serve as a CD-specific marker of ongoing immune activation. In patients who had undergone gluten challenge, coordinated up-regulation of wound response proteins, including the CD autoantigen transglutaminase 2, was observed. Our study provides a global and unbiased assessment of antigen-driven changes in protein expression in the celiac intestinal mucosa.
38592719	Diagnostic Delay of Celiac Disease in Childhood.	Importance: The extent and factors associated with risk of diagnostic delay in pediatric celiac disease (CD) are poorly understood. Objectives: To investigate the diagnostic delay of CD in childhood, and to assess factors associated with this delay. Design, Setting, and Participants: Multicenter, retrospective, cross-sectional study (2010-2019) of pediatric (aged 0-18 years) patients with CD from 13 pediatric tertiary referral centers in Italy. Data were analyzed from January to June 2023. Main Outcomes and Measures: The overall diagnostic delay (ie, the time lapse occurring from the first symptoms or clinical data indicative of CD and the definitive diagnosis), further split into preconsultation and postconsultation diagnostic delay, were described. Univariable and multivariable linear regression models for factors associated with diagnostic delay were fitted. Factors associated with extreme diagnostic delay (ie, 1.5 x 75th percentile) and misdiagnosis were assessed. Results: A total of 3171 patients with CD were included. The mean (SD) age was 6.2 (3.9) years; 2010 patients (63.4%) were female; and 10 patients (0.3%) were Asian, 41 (1.3%) were Northern African, and 3115 (98.3%) were White. The median (IQR) overall diagnostic delay was 5 (2-11) months, and preconsultation and postconsultation diagnostic delay were 2 (0-6) months and 1 (0-3) month, respectively. The median (IQR) extreme overall diagnostic delay (586 cases [18.5%]) was 11 (5-131) months, and the preconsultation and postconsultation delays were 6 (2-120) and 3 (1-131) months, respectively. Patients who had a first diagnosis when aged less than 3 years (650 patients [20.5%]) showed a shorter diagnostic delay, both overall (median [IQR], 4 [1-7] months for patients aged less than 3 years vs 5 [2-12] months for others) and postconsultation (median [IQR], 1 [0-2] month for patients aged less than 3 years vs 2 [0-4] months for others). A shorter delay was registered in male patients, both overall (median [IQR], 4 [1-10] months for male patients vs 5 [2-12] months for female patients) and preconsultation (median [IQR], 1 [0-6] month for male patients vs 2 [0-6] months for female patients). Family history of CD was associated with lower preconsultation delay (odds ratio [OR], 0.59; 95% CI, 0.47-0.74) and lower overall extreme diagnostic delay (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.56-0.99). Neurological symptoms (78 patients [21.5%]; OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.03-1.78), gastroesophageal reflux (9 patients [28.1%]; OR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.02-3.42), and failure to thrive (215 patients [22.6%]; OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.31-2.00) showed a more frequent extreme diagnostic delay. A previous misdiagnosis (124 patients [4.0%]) was more frequently associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease, diarrhea, bloating, abdominal pain, constipation, fatigue, osteopenia, and villous atrophy (Marsh 3 classification). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study of pediatric CD, the diagnostic delay was rather short. Some factors associated with risk for longer diagnostic delay and misdiagnosis emerged, and these should be addressed in future studies.
28849767	Joint Involvement in Children with Celiac Disease.	OBJECTIVE: To determine early joint involvement as detected by ultrasonography in children with newly diagnosed celiac disease, and in children with celiac disease on gluten-free diet for more than 6 months. METHODS: Cross-sectional comparative study evaluating joint abnormalities by ultrasonography. RESULTS: Ultrasonography showed abnormalities in 19 out of 60 (31.7%) children with newly diagnosed celiac disease as compared to 2 (3.3%) out of 60 in those on a gluten-free diet for more than 6 months. CONCLUSION: Subclinical synovitis as detected by ultrasound is a frequent finding in newly diagnosed children with celiac disease.
30469412	A Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Pilot Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Effect of Supplementation with Prebiotic Synergy 1 on Iron Homeostasis in Children and Adolescents with Celiac Disease Treated with a Gluten-Free Diet.	Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) occurs in 15-46% of patients with celiac disease (CD), and in some cases, it may be its only manifestation. Studies in animal models have shown that prebiotics, including inulin, may help to increase intestinal absorption of iron. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a prebiotic, oligofructose-enriched inulin (Synergy 1), on iron homeostasis in non-anemic children and adolescents with celiac disease (CD) in association with a gluten-free diet (GFD). Thirty-four CD patients (4-18 years old) were randomized into two groups receiving Synergy 1 (10 g/day) or a placebo (maltodextrin) for three months. Before and after intervention, blood samples were collected from all patients for assessment of blood morphology, biochemical parameters and serum hepcidin concentration. We found that serum hepcidin concentration after the intervention was significantly decreased by 60.9% (p = 0.046) in the Synergy 1 group, whereas no significant difference was observed in the placebo group. No differences in morphological and biochemical blood parameters (including ferritin, hemoglobin and C-reactive protein (CRP)) were observed after intervention in either group. Given that hepcidin decrease may improve intestinal iron absorption, these results warrant further investigation in a larger cohort and especially in patients with IDA.
34753529	Gluten contamination in labelled gluten-free, naturally gluten-free and meals in food services in low-, middle- and high-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	The gluten-free diet is based on the consumption of foods without gluten, which aims to manage celiac disease. The concern of celiac patients is that these foods should be safe. However, gluten contamination can affect these foods. The objectives of this review and meta-analysis were first, to identify articles that detected gluten contamination in gluten-free foods using validated methods. Second, to quantify the overall prevalence of gluten contamination of naturally gluten-free foods, labelled gluten-free products, and meals prepared in food services. Third, to highlight the influence of the country's income and the period of study on this prevalence. The studies were identified in Scopus, Science Direct, Web of Science, PubMed, and Google Scholar. Forty articles were included according to PRISMA guidelines. The statistical meta-analysis was performed using MedCalc 19 software. The results show that in the gluten-free foods analysed, the overall prevalence of gluten contamination was estimated at 15.12% (95% CI: 9.56%-21.70%), with more than 20 mg/kg of gluten. Naturally gluten-free foods were significantly more contaminated than labelled gluten-free products and than meals in food services (28.32%; 9.52%; 4.66% respectively; p < 0.001). Moreover, it was noticed that oats were the most contaminated food. In addition, the prevalence of gluten contamination has significantly decreased over time. The majority of the studies were carried out in upper-middle-income and high-income countries, while only one study was conducted in lower-middle income countries. Therefore, it is necessary to implement preventive actions to reduce gluten contamination, ensuring safe gluten-free foods for celiac patients, including low-income countries.
29895731	Extra-Intestinal Manifestation of Celiac Disease in Children.	The aim of this literature review is to discuss the extra-intestinal manifestations of celiac disease within the pediatric celiac population.
31680344	Small-bowel capsule endoscopy in patients with celiac disease, axial versus lateral/panoramic view: Results from a prospective randomized trial.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: Capsule enteroscopy (CE) is recommended in the management of complicated celiac disease (CD). However, published data are derived from axial-view capsule systems. No data are available on the use of lateral/panoramic view capsules. This study aimed at evaluating the diagnostic yield and efficacy of the lateral/panoramic versus the axial view capsule system in CD. METHODS: Consecutive CD patients were enrolled in a prospective monocentric study. Each patient ingested an axial (PillCam SB3) and a lateral/panoramic (CapsoCam Plus) view capsule with a 3-h interval in a randomized order. Two experts blindly evaluated the CE carried out. A third expert reviewed the videos in cases of discordance. RESULTS: Twenty-five CD patients were enrolled (four males, age at CE 51.2 +- 16.6 years, age at CD diagnosis 41.7 +- 20.6, years on a gluten-free diet [GFD] 9.6 +- 9.4). Indications at CE were refractory CD in nine cases, non-responsiveness to GFD in 10 and GFD non-compliance in six. A positive finding was evidenced in 15 (60%) and 13 (52%) cases by CapsoCam and PillCam respectively (not significant). Atrophy was detected by both capsules. Considering the percentage of the small-bowel mucosa presenting atrophy signs, mean values were 22% +- 35 and 20% +- 29 for lateral/panoramic and axial systems, respectively (not significant). Compared to duodenal histology, PillCam correctly identified 80% of patients with SB atrophy, whereas CapsoCam identified 73% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Lateral/panoramic view CE is effective in the detection of small-bowel atrophy in CD and presents good sensitivity and specificity when compared to histology.
30921260	Pediatric Celiac Disease and Eosinophilic Esophagitis: Outcome of Dietary Therapy.	OBJECTIVE: The coexistence of celiac disease (CeD) and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) in pediatric patients has been increasingly recognized. In the current study, we have aimed to assess the outcomes of therapeutic dietary interventions in a cohort of pediatric patients with CeD and EoE. METHODS: Pediatric patient records obtained from the University of Chicago Celiac Center Database from August 2008 to July 2013 were reviewed. Information was collected on patients with concomitant CeD and EoE regarding age, sex, dates of diagnoses, presenting symptoms, length of symptoms before diagnosis, familial and personal atopic history, dietary therapy, and esophageal histologic response to dietary therapy. RESULTS: A total of 350 records of patients with CeD were reviewed. Twenty-two (6.3%) had a confirmed diagnosis of CeD and EoE, 17 had repeat biopsies. Four of 17 (23.5%) had resolution of esophageal eosinophilia on an exclusive gluten-free diet, 10 of 17 (59%) required additional eliminations to show histologic resolution, 1 of 17 (6%) had not reached histological remission, and 2 of 17 (12%) were lost to follow-up. Success rates of single food reintroductions were: soy 5 of 5 (100%), eggs 3 of 5 (60%), dairy 3 of 7 (43%), nuts 2 of 4 (50%), and fish 2 of 4 (50%). CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the largest pediatric study to assess the histologic outcome of EoE-associated esophageal eosinophilia in response to dietary management of pediatric patients with concomitant CeD and EoE. We demonstrate that soy is well tolerated in this cohort, and suggest that reintroducing this food first, or trialing a soy-inclusive elimination diet is a viable strategy.
30060266	The Effect of Gluten-Free Diet on Thyroid Autoimmunity in Drug-Naive Women with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis: A Pilot Study.	BACKGROUND: Autoimmune thyroid disease is often accompanied by celiac disease. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a gluten-free diet affects thyroid autoimmunity, hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis activity and thyroid function tests in women with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and incidentally found positive anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies. METHODS: The study included 34 women with autoimmune thyroiditis divided into two group. The patients belonging to the first one (group A, n=16) complied with the gluten-free diet for 6 months, while the remaining patients (group B, n=18) remained without any dietary treatment. Serum titers of thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies, as well as serum levels of thyrotropin, free thyroid hormones and 25-hydroxyvitamin D were measured at the beginning of the study and 6 months later. Based on thyrotropin and free thyroid hormone levels, Jostel's thyrotropin index, the SPINA-GT index and the SPINA-GD index were calculated. RESULTS: All patients completed the study protocol. In group B, serum thyrotropin and free thyroid hormones levels, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels as well as the calculated indices remained at the similar levels. The gluten-free diet reduced thyroid antibody titers, as well as slightly increased 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and the SPINA-GT index. In group A, the impact on TPOAb and TgAb titers correlated with the changes in the SPINA-GT index, whereas the impact on TPOAb with the changes in 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results suggest that the gluten-free diet may bring clinical benefits to women with autoimmune thyroid disease.
32216476	Advances in understanding the potential therapeutic applications of gut microbiota and probiotic mediated therapies in celiac disease.	INTRODUCTION: Celiac Disease (CD) is an autoimmune enteropathy caused by exposure to gluten in genetically predisposed people. While gluten is the main driving force in CD, evidence has shown that microbiota might be involved in the pathogenesis, development, and clinical presentation of CD. Microbiota manipulation may modify its functional capacity and may be crucial for setting-up potential preventive or therapeutic application. Moreover, probiotics are an excellent source of endopeptidases for digesting gluten. AREAS COVERED: In this narrative review we illustrate all the recent scientific discoveries in this field including CD pathogenetic mechanism where gut microbiota might be involved and possible use of probiotics in CD prevention and treatment. EXPERT OPINION: In the future, probiotics could be used as an add-on medication for strengthening/facilitating the gluten-free diet (GFD) and improving symptoms; the prospect of using it for therapeutic purposes is to be sought in a more distant future.
36907258	Impact of adherence to gluten-free diet in paediatric celiac patients on optical coherence tomography findings: Ocular imaging based study.	OBJECTIVE: This study aims to measure choroidal thickness, retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, GCC thickness, and foveal thickness by optical coherence tomography and to investigate whether there is a difference between celiac patients who adhere to the gluten-free diet and who do not. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 68 eyes of 34 pediatric patients diagnosed with celiac disease were included in the study. Celiac patients were divided into two groups those who adhere to the gluten-free diet and those who do not. Fourteen patients who adhere to the gluten-free diet and 20 patients who do not adhere to the gluten-free diet were included in the study. Choroidal thickness, GCC, RNFL, and foveal thickness of all subjects were measured and recorded using an optical coherence tomography device. RESULTS: The mean choroidal thickness of the dieting and non-diet groups was 249.05 +- 25.60 and 244.18 +- 33.50 microm, respectively. The mean GCC thickness of the dieting and non-diet groups was 96.56 +- 6.26 and 93.83 +- 5.62 microm, respectively. The mean RNFL thickness of the dieting and non-diet groups was 108.83 +- 9.97 and 103.20 +- 9.74 microm, respectively. The mean foveal thickness of the dieting and non-diet groups was 259.25 +- 33.60 and 261.92 +- 32.94 microm, respectively. There was not a statistically significant difference between the dieting group and the non-diet group in terms of choroidal, GCC, RNFL and foveal thicknesses (p = 0.635, p = 0.207, p = 0.117, p = 0.820, respectively). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the present study states that adhering to a gluten-free diet does not make any difference in choroidal, GCC, RNFL, and foveal thicknesses in pediatric celiac patients.
33184625	Genetic, lifestyle, and health-related characteristics of adults without celiac disease who follow a gluten-free diet: a population-based study of 124,447 participants.	BACKGROUND: The number of gluten-free diet followers without celiac disease (CD) is increasing. However, little is known about the characteristics of these individuals. OBJECTIVES: We address this issue by investigating a wide range of genetic and phenotypic characteristics in association with following a gluten-free diet. METHODS: The cross-sectional association between lifestyle and health-related characteristics and following a gluten-free diet was investigated in 124,447 women and men aged 40-69 y from the population-based UK Biobank study. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of following a gluten-free diet was performed. RESULTS: A total of 1776 (1.4%) participants reported following a gluten-free diet. Gluten-free diet followers were more likely to be women, nonwhite, highly educated, living in more socioeconomically deprived areas, former smokers, have lost weight in the past year, have poorer self-reported health, and have made dietary changes as a result of illness. Conversely, these individuals were less likely to consume alcohol daily, be overweight or obese, have hypertension, or use cholesterol-lowering medication. Participants with hospital inpatient diagnosed blood and immune mechanism disorders (OR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.18, 2.21) and non-CD digestive system diseases (OR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.42, 1.77) were more likely to follow a gluten-free diet. The GWAS demonstrated that no genetic variants were associated with being a gluten-free diet follower. CONCLUSIONS: Gluten-free diet followers have a better cardiovascular risk profile than non-gluten-free diet followers but poorer self-reported health and a higher prevalence of blood and immune disorders and digestive conditions. Reasons for following a gluten-free diet warrant further investigation.
33707543	Precision medicine and machine learning towards the prediction of the outcome of potential celiac disease.	Potential Celiac Patients (PCD) bear the Celiac Disease (CD) genetic predisposition, a significant production of antihuman transglutaminase antibodies, but no morphological changes in the small bowel mucosa. A minority of patients (17%) showed clinical symptoms and need a gluten free diet at time of diagnosis, while the majority progress over several years (up to a decade) without any clinical problem neither a progression of the small intestine mucosal damage even when they continued to assume gluten in their diet. Recently we developed a traditional multivariate approach to predict the natural history, on the base of the information at enrolment (time 0) by a discriminant analysis model. Still, the traditional multivariate model requires stringent assumptions that may not be answered in the clinical setting. Starting from a follow-up dataset available for PCD, we propose the application of Machine Learning (ML) methodologies to extend the analysis on available clinical data and to detect most influent features predicting the outcome. These features, collected at time of diagnosis, should be capable to classify patients who will develop duodenal atrophy from those who will remain potential. Four ML methods were adopted to select features predictive of the outcome; the feature selection procedure was indeed capable to reduce the number of overall features from 85 to 19. ML methodologies (Random Forests, Extremely Randomized Trees, and Boosted Trees, Logistic Regression) were adopted, obtaining high values of accuracy: all report an accuracy above 75%. The specificity score was always more than 75% also, with two of the considered methods over 98%, while the best performance of sensitivity was 60%. The best model, optimized Boosted Trees, was able to classify PCD starting from the selected 19 features with an accuracy of 0.80, sensitivity of 0.58 and specificity of 0.84. Finally, with this work, we are able to categorize PCD patients that can more likely develop overt CD using ML. ML techniques appear to be an innovative approach to predict the outcome of PCD, since they provide a step forward in the direction of precision medicine aimed to customize healthcare, medical therapies, decisions, and practices tailoring the clinical management of PCD children.
31947949	Nutritional Status, Dietary Intake, and Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet of Children with Celiac Disease on a Gluten-Free Diet: A Case-Control Prospective Study.	The only effective treatment for celiac disease (CD) is a life-long strict gluten-free diet (GFD). Nutritional adequacy of the GFD has remained controversial and a matter of debate for a long time. No large case-control studies on children regarding the nutritional adequacy of the GFD has been performed. In this study, children diagnosed with CD on a GFD for >= 2 years were recruited. Controls were age and gender-matched healthy children not affected with CD. In both groups, anthropometric measurements and energy expenditure information were collected. Dietary assessment was performed by a 3-day food diary. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was estimated by the KIDMED index. Overall, 120 children with CD and 100 healthy children were enrolled. No differences were found between CD children and controls in anthropometric measurements and energy expenditure. In the CD group, the daily intake of fats was significantly higher while the consumption of fiber was lower in comparison with the control group. The median KIDMED index was 6.5 in CD children and 6.8 in healthy controls. The diet of children with CD in this study was nutritionally less balanced than controls, with a higher intake of fat and a lower intake of fiber, highlighting the need for dietary counseling.
31297187	Recent advances in celiac disease and refractory celiac disease.	Celiac disease (CeD), defined as gluten-induced enteropathy, is a frequent and largely underdiagnosed disease. Diagnosis relies on the detection of highly specific serum IgA anti-transglutaminase auto-antibodies and on the demonstration of duodenal villous atrophy. Treatment necessitates a strict gluten-free diet, which resolves symptoms and enables histological recovery. However, regular follow-up is necessary to assess mucosal healing, which emerges as an important prognostic factor. Recent work on CeD pathogenesis has highlighted how the cross-talk between gluten-specific CD4 + T cells and interleukin-15 can activate cytotoxic intraepithelial lymphocytes and trigger epithelial lesions. Moreover, acquisition by a subset of intraepithelial lymphocytes of somatic gain-of-function mutations in the JAK-STAT pathway was shown to be a decisive step in the progression toward lymphomas complicating CeD, thus opening new therapeutic perspectives for these rare but life-threatening complications.
33022759	Gluten-Free Diet and Migraine.	Migraine is common in celiac disease (CD) and usually improves on a gluten-free diet (GFD). The benefit for people impacted by migraine without CD is poorly evidenced. A GFD may have adverse health consequences and is expensive.
32921753	Celiac disease and headache in children: a narrative state of the art.	Celiac disease (CD) is one of the most important entity of the wide spectrum of gluten-related disorders (GRDs). It is well known that neurological manifestation can be present either at the onset of CD, or appear during the development of the pathology, and different can be the neurologic findings. Clinical features are very variable, ranging from typical manifestations of gastrointestinal involvement to neurologic symptom. The most frequent neurologic signs reported were headache, epileptic seizure, migraine, mental retardation, ataxia and attention deficit and hyperactive disorder. Headache either in form of migraine, or in non-specific form represents one of the main clinical presentation in CD. The aim of this work is to provide a narrative review of the pediatric literature focused on the cephalalgic features of children with CD evaluating the potential benefits of a gluten free diet (GFD).  Papers were identified by searching for related literature in Medline (PubMed) and Embase using the words "Celiac Disease" and "Headache" or "Migraine" by specifying "children"/"paediatric age" for reports published since 1972 till 31th October 2018. According to our inclusion criteria, a total of 25 papers has been evaluated. Although it is still controversial if headache is prevalent in CD children a correct compliance to a GFD seems to improve the neurological symptoms even if the underlying pathogenic relationship between CD and neurologic system involvement is still not fully understood.
31349675	Daily Life Restrictions are Common and Associated with Health Concerns and Dietary Challenges in Adult Celiac Disease Patients Diagnosed in Childhood.	The prevalence and associated factors of daily life restrictions due to a gluten-free diet in adult celiac disease patients diagnosed in childhood are poorly known. We investigated these issues by collecting the medical data of 955 pediatric patients and sending questionnaires evaluating various health outcomes to the 559 patients who had reached adulthood. Of the 231 respondents, 46% reported everyday life restrictions caused by dietary treatment. Compared with those without restrictions, they more often had anemia at diagnosis (37% vs. 22%, p = 0.014), but the groups were comparable in other diagnostic features. In adulthood, patients with restrictions reported more overall symptoms (32% vs. 17%, p = 0.006), although the symptoms measured with the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale questionnaire were comparable. Despite strict dietary adherence in both groups, the experience of restrictions was associated with dietary challenges (34% vs. 9%, p < 0.001), health concerns (22% vs. 13%, p = 0.050), and lower vitality scores in the Psychological General Well-Being questionnaire. The groups did not differ in their current age, socioeconomic status, family history of celiac disease, general health or health-related lifestyle, the presence of co-morbidities, or regular follow up. Our results encourage healthcare professionals to discuss the possible health concerns and dietary challenges with patients to avoid unnecessary daily life restrictions, especially when young patients start to take responsibility for their treatment.
36649519	The Relationship between Zonulin and Metabolic Syndrome in Renal Transplant Patients.	BACKGROUND: Levels of zonulin, a surrogate marker of intestinal permeability, are elevated in various disorders including insulin resistance, obesity, celiac disease, and inflammatory bowel disease. We aimed to elucidate the association of zonulin levels and metabolic syndrome (MS) in renal transplant recipients. METHODS: Seventy-nine renal transplant recipients were enrolled. Diagnosis of MS was established employing the Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) criteria. Serum zonulin level was determined using the double antibody sandwich ELISA method. RESULTS: MS was encountered in 37 (41.6%) of the 79 patients. Serum zonulin level was significantly higher in patients with MS compared to those without MS (p < 0.001). Serum zonulin level correlated with presence of MS (r: 739, p < 0.001), abdominal obesity (r: 514, p < 0.001), fasting glucose level (r: 361, p: 0.001), presence of fasting glucose/diabetes criterion of MS (r: 316, p: 0.005), presence of low HDL criterion of MS (r: 266, p: 0.018), and BMI (r: 527, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A Zonulin-mediated increase in intestinal permeability may play a role in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome. We propose that zonulin may be a suitable surrogate marker of MS in renal transplant recipients.
30272603	Use of an Educational Module to Improve Confidence and Knowledge of Celiac Disease Among Nurse Practitioners in Pennsylvania: A Quasi-Experimental Mixed-Methods Design.	Accurate and prompt diagnosis of celiac disease has proven difficult due to the myriad of presenting symptoms and a lack of a clear diagnostic protocol. This pilot study investigated the use of an evidence-based multimedia educational module on nurse practitioner confidence and knowledge of celiac disease. Thirteen nurse practitioners in Pennsylvania completed all study activities, which involved the use of an online pretest, learning component, an immediate post-test, along with 2 follow-up surveys. Results revealed that nurse practitioner confidence (p <= .05) and knowledge (p <= .05) levels significantly improved after participation in the educational intervention. Qualitative data also revealed that nurse practitioners are more aware of the various presentations and symptoms of celiac disease and stated that with this knowledge, their clinical practice has changed to include recognition of the various celiac disease presentations. Findings suggest that nurse practitioners are now more knowledgeable of the various presentations of celiac disease and may be more likely to consider celiac disease as a diagnosis if patients present with typical or atypical symptoms.
32679754	Gluten Degrading Enzymes for Treatment of Celiac Disease.	Celiac disease (CeD) affects about 1% of most world populations. It presents a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from minor symptoms to mild or severe malabsorption, and it may be associated with a wide variety of autoimmune diseases. CeD is triggered and maintained by the ingestion of gluten proteins from wheat and related grains. Gluten peptides that resist gastrointestinal digestion are antigenically presented to gluten specific T cells in the intestinal mucosa via HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8, the necessary genetic predisposition for CeD. To date, there is no effective or approved treatment for CeD other than a strict adherence to a gluten-free diet, which is difficult to maintain in professional or social environments. Moreover, many patients with CeD have active disease despite diet adherence due to a high sensitivity to traces of gluten. Therefore, safe pharmacological treatments that complement the gluten-free diet are urgently needed. Oral enzyme therapy, employing gluten-degrading enzymes, is a promising therapeutic approach. A prerequisite is that such enzymes are active under gastro-duodenal conditions, quickly neutralize the T cell activating gluten peptides and are safe for human consumption. Several enzymes including prolyl endopeptidases, cysteine proteases and subtilisins can cleave the human digestion-resistant gluten peptides in vitro and in vivo. Examples are several prolyl endopeptidases from bacterial sources, subtilisins from Rothia bacteria that are natural oral colonizers and synthetic enzymes with optimized gluten-degrading activities. Without exception, these enzymes must cleave the otherwise unusual glutamine and proline-rich domains characteristic of antigenic gluten peptides. Moreover, they should be stable and active in both the acidic environment of the stomach and under near neutral pH in the duodenum. This review focuses on those enzymes that have been characterized and evaluated for the treatment of CeD, discussing their origin and activities, their clinical evaluation and challenges for therapeutic application. Novel developments include strategies like enteric coating and genetic modification to increase enzyme stability in the digestive tract.
32932082	Sprouted oat as a potential gluten-free ingredient with enhanced nutritional and bioactive properties.	This study is aimed to produce and characterize a novel gluten-free ingredient from oat through sprouting at 18  C for 96 h. The nutritional and bioactive properties as well as key enzymatic activities were studied in sprouted oat powder and compared with those of oat grain powder (control). Sprouted oat powder was an excellent source of protein (10.7%), beta-glucan (2.1%), thiamine (687.1 mug/100 g), riboflavin (218.4 mug/100 g), and minerals (P, K, Mg and Ca), and presented better amino acid and fatty acid compositions and levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (54.9 mg/100 g), free phenolics (507.4 mg GA/100 g) and antioxidant capacity (1744.3 mg TE/100 g) than control. Enhanced protease and alpha-amylase and reduced lipase activities were observed in sprouted oat powder, which are promising features to improve its nutritional, sensorial and health-promoting properties. These results support the use of sprouted oat powder as a promising gluten-free functional ingredient.
31530521	Does celiac disease cause autoimmune sensorineural hearing loss?	BACKGROUND/AIMS: The primary aim of this study is to identify whether an autoimmune sensorineural hearing loss is an extraintestinal neurological manifestation in adult CD patients. The secondary aim is to identify whether the duration of a gluten-free diet has an effect on the hearing levels of CD patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study consisting of 103 adult CD patients and 79 healthy controls between May 2012 and August 2018 at the University of Gaziantep Gastroenterology and Otorhinolaryngology Departments. CD patients were divided into two groups as remission or active, according to their gluten-free diet duration and serum levels of anti-t-TG. The control group was checked both for CD symptoms and anti-t-TG serum levels. Both participants performed a pure tone audiometry after detailed ear nose and throat examination. RESULTS: Only 4 of 103 CD patients showed sensorineural hearing loss. There was no statistically significant difference between hearing levels of the CD patients and the control group in both measurements of air and bone conductions. The hearing levels comparing the remission and active CD patients did not show any difference in air and bone conduction frequencies. CONCLUSION: In this study with a higher number of CD patients when compared with the previous studies, it has been shown that CD does not appear to cause autoimmune sensorineural hearing loss. In addition, the status of the patients regarding the activeness or the remission of CD did not display a differ between the CD patients in terms of hearing levels.
34244963	Dental enamel defects and oral cavity manifestations in Asian patients with celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: While the small intestine is the main site of disease, many other organs are affected by celiac disease (CeD). Dental enamel defects (DED) are common in patients with CeD, and these are one of the indicators of CeD, even when no other symptom of CeD is present. Data on dental and oral cavity manifestations in Asian patients with CeD are scanty. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate dental and oral manifestations in Asian patients with CeD. METHODS: We recruited 118 patients with biopsy-confirmed CeD (36 treatment naive and 82 on follow-up for at least 1 year on gluten-free diet [GFD]) and 40 controls. Diagnosis was made as per the standard criteria. Oral and dental manifestations were evaluated by a dental surgeon. The DED were evaluated according to Aine's criteria. RESULTS: Overall higher number of patients with CeD (66.9%), both treatment naive (69.4%) and those on GFD (65.8%) had DED in comparison to controls (20%) (odds ratio, 8.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.4-19.2; p<0.001). Specific/bilaterally symmetrical DED were significantly higher in patients with CeD than controls. Recurrent aphthous ulcers were also significantly higher in patients with CeD. Approximately 80.6% and 63.4% treatment-naive patients and those on GFD, respectively reported dry mouth sensation, which was significantly higher than the controls. CONCLUSION: Almost two-third of patients with CeD had DED. Physicians and dietitians caring for patients with CeD should be trained in identification of DED and other oral manifestations of CeD.
36913036	Study of the immune response in celiac patients with selective IgA deficiency who start a gluten-free diet.	Studies are scarce regarding IgG anti-tissue transglutaminase 2 (tTG) normalization in selective IgA deficient (SIgAD) celiac disease (CD) patients after beginning a gluten free diet (GFD). The aim of this study is to analyse the decreasing dynamics of IgG anti-tTG in patients diagnosed with CD who start a GFD. To achieve this objective, IgG and IgA anti-tTG levels at diagnosis and during follow-up in 11 SIgAD CD patients and in 20 IgA competent CD patients were retrospectively evaluated. At diagnosis, statistical differences were not found when comparing IgA anti-tTG levels of IgA competent subjects with IgG anti-tTG levels of SIgAD subjects. Regarding the decreasing dynamics, even though no statistical differences were found (p = 0.06), normalization rates were slower for SIgAD CD patients. After 1 and 2 years on GFD, respectively, only 18.2% and 36.3% of the SIgAD CD patients normalized IgG anti-tTG levels; otherwise, IgA anti-tTG reached values under the reference values in 30% and 80% of the IgA competent patients in the same time-points. Although IgG anti-tTG has demonstrated a high diagnostic efficiency in SIgAD CD pediatric patients, this test does not appear to be as precise for long-term GFD response monitoring as IgA anti-tTG levels in IgA sufficient patients.
37294459	Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency Is Common in Celiac Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	The prevalence of celiac disease (CD) is approximately 1% in the US. Studies have shown possible association between exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) and CD, with numerous hypothesized biological mechanisms including small bowel mucosal damage causing disruption of enteric-mediated hormonal secretion such as cholecystokinin and loss of enterokinase. The overall prevalence of EPI in CD remains unknown. We performed systematic review and metanalysis and examined the prevalence of EPI in patients who were first diagnosed with CD versus those who had been on treatment with gluten-free diet (GFD). Results  Six studies were included in the analysis totaling 446 CD patients (Avg age 44.1 years; 34% Males). One hundred and forty-four patients had newly diagnosed CD, and 302 patients had known CD with at least 9 months treatment with GFD. Four studies examined newly diagnosed CD patients. The individual rates of EPI in new CD patients ranged from 10.5 to 46.5%. The pooled prevalence of EPI in newly diagnosed CD patients was 26.2% (95% CI 8.43-43.92%, Q = 2.24, I2 = 0%). Five studies examined CD patients on GFD. The rate of EPI ranged from 1.9% to 18.2%. The prevalence of EPI in patients treated with GFD is 8% (95% CI 1.52-14.8%, Q = 4.42, I2 = 9.59%). Patients with newly diagnosed CD are significantly more likely to have EPI compared to those patients treated with GFD (p = 0.031). CD patients on GFD with persistent symptoms have a significantly higher rate of EPI (28.4%) compared to CD patients on GFD who are asymptomatic (3%) (p < 0.001).
32425730	A negative fallout of COVID-19 lockdown in Italy: Life-threatening delay in the diagnosis of celiac disease.	
37646811	Cross-sectional imaging: current status and future potential in adult celiac disease.	Celiac disease (CD), triggered by exposure to gluten in genetically susceptible individuals, is an immune-mediated small bowel disease affecting about 1% of the population worldwide. But the prevalence of CD varies with age, sex, and location. A strict gluten-free diet remains the primary treatment for CD, currently. Most of patients with CD respond well to gluten-free diet with good prognosis, while some patients fail to get symptomatic relief or histological remission (e.g., nonresponsive or refractory CD). Because of heterogeneous clinical appearance, the diagnosis of CD is difficult. Moreover, malignant complications and poor outcomes accompanied with refractory CD present great challenges in disease management. Over the past three decades, cross-sectional imaging techniques (computed tomography [CT] and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) play an important role in small bowel inflammatory and neoplastic diseases. Compared with endoscopic techniques, cross-sectional imaging permits clearly presentation of both intraluminal and extraluminal abnormalities. It provides vascular and functional information, thus improving the possibility as diagnostic and follow-up tool. The value of cross-sectional imaging for patients with suspected or confirmed CD has been gradually demonstrated. Studies revealed that certain features suggested by cross-sectional imaging could help to establish the early diagnosis of CD. Besides, the potential contributions of cross-sectional imaging may lie in the evaluation of disease activity and severity, which helps guiding management strategies. The purpose of this review is to provide current overviews and future directions of cross-sectional imaging in adult CD, thus facilitating the understanding and application in clinical practice. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: In this review, we systematically summarized the existing knowledge of cross-sectional imaging in adult CD and analyzed their possible roles in clinical practice, including disease diagnosis, complication identification, treatment evaluation, and prognostic prediction. KEY POINTS:   Regarding a condition described as "celiac iceberg", celiac disease remains underdiagnosed and undertreated.   Cross-sectional imaging is helpful in clinical management of celiac disease, including disease diagnosis, complication identification, treatment evaluation, and prognostic prediction.   Cross-sectional imaging should be considered as the valuable examination in patients suspected from celiac disease.
31262542	Metabolism of wheat proteins by intestinal microbes: Implications for wheat related disorders.	Wheat is a common cereal in the Western diet and an important source of protein as well as fiber. However, some individuals develop adverse reactions to a wheat-containing diet. The best characterized is celiac disease which develops after intake of gluten in individuals with genetic predisposition. Other wheat-related conditions are less well defined in terms of diagnosis, specific trigger and underlying pathways. Despite this, the overall prevalence of wheat-related disorders has increased in the last decades and the role of microbial factors has been suggested. Several studies have described an altered intestinal microbiota in celiac patients compared to healthy subjects, but less information is available regarding other wheat-related disorders. Here, we discuss the importance of the intestinal microbiota in the metabolism of wheat proteins and the development of inflammatory or functional conditions. Understanding these interactions will open new directions for therapeutic development using bacteria with optimal wheat protein degrading capacity.
30025705	New Onset Villous Atrophy in a Patient With Celiac Disease.	
29325090	The 5 Ws of a gluten challenge for gluten-related disorders.	Gluten-related disorders (GRDs) are gradually emerging as epidemiologically relevant diseases, with a global prevalence estimated to be approximately 5% in the population. Conditions related to gluten ingestion include celiac disease (CD), wheat allergy (WA), and nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). Although mediated by different pathogenic pathways, these 3 conditions share similar clinical manifestations and can present a difficult differential diagnosis. The gluten challenge (GC) is an important diagnostic tool for GRDs, but there is great variability in regards to deciding which patients should be challenged, what amount of gluten should be used, what the GC duration should be, when and where the GC should occur, and, sometimes, why to conduct a GC. This review summarizes the current knowledge about the desirable characteristics of GCs in the 3 main GRDs following a 5 Ws approach-that is, the 5 main journalistic questions: who, what, when, where, why. The answers will help to determine the correct use of the GC in diagnosing GRDs.
34864760	Growth and development in type 1 diabetes.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to summarize the current literature on the subject of linear growth in children and adolescents with or at risk for type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). RECENT FINDINGS: Poor glycemic control in T1DM is associated with growth hormone resistance, and improving glycemic control can improve linear growth. Newer reports suggest that the increasingly popular very low carbohydrate diets, may reduce linear growth velocity. SUMMARY: Linear growth during childhood is a complex process regulated influenced by genetic, hormonal, nutritional and environmental factors. Linear growth may be impaired in children with T1DM, correlating with poor metabolic control; an extreme example is Mauriac syndrome. This decrement in linear growth appears to be driven in part by a reduction in growth hormone responsiveness, leading to low insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels. Improving glycemic control can lead to improved IGF-1 levels and linear growth. Other factors associated with poor linear growth in T1DM include celiac disease and dietary alterations, with early reports suggesting that very low carbohydrate diets, if not carefully managed, may increase risk of attenuated linear growth. This review examines the latest data regarding the associations between T1DM and linear growth in children.
34041591	Cesarean delivery and risk of hospitalization for autoimmune disorders before 14 years of age.	It is supposed that cesarean birth is implicated in the development of autoimmunity. We evaluated the association between cesarean delivery and the risk of hospitalization for autoimmune disease in children up to 14 years of age. We performed a longitudinal cohort study of 934,873 children born between 2006 and 2019 in Quebec, Canada. The main exposure measure was cesarean delivery versus vaginal delivery (spontaneous or induced). Outcomes included hospitalization for type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, or other autoimmune disorders before 14 years of age. We used Cox regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between cesarean delivery and hospitalization for autoimmune disorders, adjusted for patient characteristics. A total of 248,963 children (27%) were delivered by cesarean. Median length of follow-up was 7.4 years. The hospitalization rate for autoimmune disorders was 69.1 per 100,000 person-years for cesarean and 65.9 per 100,000 person-years for vaginal delivery. Cesarean delivery was not associated with autoimmune disorders overall (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.96-1.10). There was no association with type 1 diabetes (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.85-1.17), celiac disease (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.71-1.04), inflammatory bowel disease (HR 1.15, 95% CI 0.88-1.49), or idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.82-1.25). Cesarean delivery was not associated with autoimmune disorders at different ages.Conclusion: This study suggests that cesarean delivery is not associated with the risk of hospitalization for autoimmune disorders before 14 years of age. Delivery mode does not seem to mediate the risk of autoimmunity in childhood. What is Known:   Children born by cesarean may be at risk of abnormal immune development.   The association between cesarean delivery and risk of pediatric autoimmune disorders is unclear. What is New:   In this cohort study of over 900,000 children, cesarean delivery was not associated with the risk of hospitalization for a range of autoimmune disorders before 14 years of age.   Cesarean delivery may not be related to the development of autoimmunity.
28837103	Activities, Participation and Quality of Life Concepts in Children and Adolescents with Celiac Disease: A Scoping Review.	Celiac disease (CD) is a food-related chronic condition and adherence to a strict gluten-free diet is the only available treatment. Adherence to the restrictive diet is challenging among children, especially adolescents. The aim was to describe existing knowledge about food-related activities, participation, and quality of life in daily life among children and adolescents with CD and to illuminate gaps in knowledge. The scoping review methodology was applied and literature searches were conducted in electronic databases. Twenty-three articles met the inclusion criteria. Food-related activities were identified, classified, and coded under the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health adapted for children and youth (ICF-CY) concepts of activities and participation. A wide variety of study populations, objectives, methods, and tools involving 55 different food-related activities were found. Incorporation of the ICF-CY concepts and quality of life captures new insights into everyday challenges. Reviewing the CD literature using this different lens reveals areas yet to receive sufficient attention. Further research can deepen the understanding of daily functioning of children with CD and the underlying skills required to participate in daily food-related activities while adhering to the diet. This can lead to the development of standardized disease-specific assessment tools and suitable intervention programs.
38777415	Vitamin D and celiac disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated condition affecting the small intestine. Its reported global prevalence falls within the range of 0.7% to 1.4%. Notably, historically, higher rates, reaching 1% in Western Ireland, have been documented. Recent research has even revealed prevalence rates as elevated as 2% in northern Europe. These findings underscore the urgency for swift and cost-effective diagnosis, especially in individuals identified through screening efforts. At present, the diagnosis of CD relies on a multifaceted approach involving positive serological markers such as IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-TTG) and anti-endomysial antibodies (anti-EMA). These serological findings are assessed in conjunction with classical histological alterations, as outlined in the Marsh classification. CD is an inflammatory condition triggered by the consumption of gluten, resulting from intricate interactions between genetic, immunological, and environmental factors. CD is linked to malabsorption, leading to nutritional deficiencies. Individuals with CD are required to adhere to a gluten-free diet, which itself can lead to nutrient deficiencies. One such deficiency includes vitamin D, and there is substantial experimental evidence supporting the notion of a bidirectional relationship between CD and vitamin D status. A low level of vitamin D has a detrimental impact on the clinical course of the disease. Here we summarize the key characteristics of CD and explore the prominent roles of vitamin D in individuals with CD.
35645020	Biomarkers for the diagnosis and monitoring of celiac disease: can you count on me?	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Different markers are available to diagnose and monitor celiac disease (CeD); however, the concordance among them and their efficacy are still controversial. We aim at defining the efficacy of CeD biomarkers, their advantages and limits. RECENT FINDINGS: CeD diagnostic criteria are widely accepted, being a positive serology and duodenal atrophy (according to the Marsh-Oberhuber score) the main hallmarks. Flow cytometry and other molecular biomarkers support the diagnosis of refractory CeD. On the other side, CeD monitoring is less defined, as the biomarkers are not always reliable. To date, the reference standard to detect mucosal healing is represented by duodenal histology, but its timing and significance are debated. Novel scores may better define the trend of mucosal damage and MicroRNAs are among the innovative noninvasive biomarkers. The assessment of a correct gluten-free diet (GFD) is another aspect of CeD monitoring, based upon questionnaires and recently developed tools such as dosage of urinary or faecal gluten immunogenic peptides. SUMMARY: Clinicians lack of a widely acknowledged tools to monitor CeD and GFD. Here, we present the efficacy of the most used markers.
30240477	Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy imitating Crohn's disease: a rare cause of malnutrition.	Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE) is a rare autosomal recessive disease caused by a mutation in the TYMP gene encoding thymidine phosphorylase. MNGIE causes gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms in homozygous individuals and is often misdiagnosed as anorexia nervosa, inflammatory bowel disease, or celiac disease. We present the case of a 26-year-old female with MNGIE, who was initially diagnosed with anorexia nervosa and Crohn's disease. The diagnosis of MNGIE was established by biochemical confirmation of elevated serum and urine thymidine and deoxyuridine levels after multiple examinations and several years of disease progression and ineffective treatment. Subsequent molecular genetic testing demonstrated a homozygous TYMP gene mutation. MNGIE should be considered in patients with unexplained malnutrition, intestinal dysmotility, and atypical neurological symptoms.
29206754	Abdominal Ultrasound Does Not Reveal Significant Alterations in Patients With Nonceliac Wheat Sensitivity.	GOALS: The goal of this study was (A) to evaluate abdominal ultrasound signs in nonceliac wheat sensitivity (NCWS) patients for features useful in diagnosis and (B) to compare these aspects with those of celiac patients to assess whether ultrasound can be useful in the differential diagnosis between NCWS and celiac disease (CD). BACKGROUND: NCWS diagnosis is difficult as no biomarkers of this condition have as yet been identified. In CD ultrasound aspects have been identified that have a good diagnostic accuracy. STUDY: We prospectively recruited 45 NCWS patients (11 males, 34 females; mean age 35.7 y). Three control groups were included: (A) 99 age-matched CD patients; (B) 18 patients with seronegative CD; (C) 50 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) who did not improve on a wheat-free diet. NCWS diagnosis was confirmed on the basis of an elimination diet and double-blind placebo-controlled (DBPC) challenge. Ultrasound sign investigation included: dilatation of the small bowel loops, thickening of the small bowel wall, hyperperistalsis, enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes, ascites, hyposplenism, altered diameter of the portal vein. RESULTS: NCWS patients showed a low frequency of pathologic ultrasound findings. Dilated or thickened loops appeared more often in CD patients than in NCWS patients (88.8% vs. 20%; P<0.0001). These US signs were significantly more frequent in seronegative CD than in NCWS patients (both P<0.0001), whereas no difference was found between NCWS patients and IBS controls. CONCLUSIONS: In NCWS patients' ultrasound does not show a characteristic pattern which could be helpful for diagnosis. However, US can be useful to differentiate between NCWS and CD patients and especially those with seronegative CD. (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03017274).
37879521	Gluten-Related Disorders from Bench to Bedside.	Celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, and wheat allergy comprise three of the main conditions with wheat and gluten-containing foods as the symptom trigger. Distinguishing between these entities can be daunting. In this review we compare and contrast celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, and wheat allergy to allow clinicians to determine which diagnosis fits their patient to facilitate high-quality management and longitudinal care.
33717129	Celiac Disease Causes Epithelial Disruption and Regulatory T Cell Recruitment in the Oral Mucosa.	Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by an immune-triggered enteropathy upon gluten intake. The only current treatment available is lifelong Gluten Free Diet (GFD). Several extraintestinal manifestations have been described in CD, some affecting the oral mucosa. Thus, we hypothesized that oral mucosa could potentially be a target for novel biomarkers and an administration route for CD treatment. Six de novo diagnosed and seven CD patients under GFD for at least 1 year were recruited. Non-celiac subjects (n = 8) were recruited as control group. Two biopsies of the cheek lining were taken from each subject for mRNA analysis and immunohistochemical characterization. We observed a significant decrease in the expression of epithelial junction proteins in all CD patients, indicating that oral mucosa barrier integrity is compromised. FoxP3+ population was greatly increased in CD patients, suggesting that Tregs are recruited to the damaged mucosa, even after avoidance of gluten. Amphiregulin mRNA levels from Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) and epithelial damage in the oral mucosa correlated with Treg infiltration in all the experimental groups, suggesting that recruited Tregs might display a "repair" phenotype. Based on these results, we propose that oral mucosa is altered in CD and, as such, might have diagnostic potential. Furthermore, due to its tolerogenic nature, it could be an important target for oral immunotherapy.
31035487	Gluten Vehicle and Placebo for Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity Assessment.	Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a syndrome characterized by gastrointestinal and extraintestinal manifestations triggered after gluten ingestion in the absence of celiac disease and wheat allergy. Because of the lack of biomarkers for NCGS diagnosis, the cornerstone for its assessment is a single- or double-blind placebo-controlled (DBPC) gluten challenge. However, there are some non-standardized points in the diagnostic approach proposed by the experts. This complicate comparisons among the results published by different research groups. The gluten vehicle and placebo must be indistinguishable from each other, which entails sensory and technological evaluations of the designed gluten vehicle and placebo products. At the moment, there is no standardized method for the preparation of the gluten vehicle and placebo for carrying out DBPC gluten challenges for NCGS assessment. This review focuses on the challenges that researchers have to face, either for the development of an accepted gluten vehicle and placebo or for identifying NCGS cases on the basis of DBPC gluten challenges.
33669442	Multidimensional Disadvantages of a Gluten-Free Diet in Celiac Disease: A Narrative Review.	A gluten-free diet is the mainstay method of treatment and the prevention of celiac disease complications. However, an inadequately balanced gluten-free diet can increase the risk of obesity, negatively affect glucose and lipid metabolism, and increase the risk of the metabolic syndrome. Therefore, an adequate nutritional counselling is necessary for patients diagnosed with celiac disease in order to prevent and treat the components of the metabolic syndrome.

32890754	Functional Abdominal Pain Disorders and Constipation in Children on Gluten-Free Diet.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: We studied the prevalence of functional abdominal pain disorders (FAPDs) and functional constipation (FC) in a large prospective cohort of children with celiac disease on a strict gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study, from 2016 through 2018, in a tertiary care center in Italy, of 417 patients (37% male; mean age, 13.7 y) with a diagnosis of celiac disease (European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology, and Nutrition criteria) who had been on a strict GFD for more than 1 year and had negative results from serologic tests after being on the GFD. Parents and children (>10 y) were asked to fill in a questionnaire on pediatric gastrointestinal symptoms, according to Rome IV criteria. Patients' closest siblings (or cousins) who had negative results from serologic test for celiac disease were used as controls (n = 373; 39% male; mean age, 13.5 y). RESULTS: We found a higher prevalence of FAPDs among patients with celiac disease (11.5%) than controls (6.7%) (P < .05); the relative risk (RR) was 1.8 (95% CI, 1.1-3.0). Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and FC defined by the Rome IV criteria were more prevalent in patients with celiac disease (7.2% for IBS and 19.9% for FC) than controls (3.2% for IBS and 10.5% for FC) (P < .05 and P < .001, respectively); the RR for IBS was 2.3 (95% CI, 1.1-4.6) and the RR for functional constipation was 2.1 (95% CI, 1.4-3.2). We found no differences in the prevalence of other subtypes of FAPDs. A logistic regression showed that younger age (P < .05) and a higher level of anti-transglutaminase IgA at diagnosis (P < .04) were associated with FAPDs (in particular for IBS) irrespective of GFD duration. CONCLUSIONS: Celiac disease is associated with an increased risk of IBS and FC. Strategies are needed to manage IBS and FC in patients with celiac disease.
33847288	Association Between Celiac Disease and Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Systematic Review.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to perform a systematic review assessing the research investigating the association between celiac disease (CD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). METHODS: A literature search of MEDLINE and EMBASE was performed without limits placed on year or language. Observational studies reporting on the occurrence of CD among patients with ASD and/or the occurrence of ASD among patients with CD were included. Study design, characteristics, diagnostic criteria for ASD and CD, and the frequency of positive cases in the studied sample were recorded. Study quality was assessed using an adapted Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Due to substantial heterogeneity between studies, a meta-analysis was not performed. RESULTS: Of the 298 unique citations identified within our search strategy, 17 articles evaluating the association between CD and ASD were included. Of those articles, 13 observed samples of patients with ASD, and 6 observed samples of patients with CD. Overall, most studies had small sample sizes and reported no evidence for an association between the 2 conditions. However, a limited number of population-based studies of higher quality suggested a potential association between CD and ASD. CONCLUSIONS: Most studies assessing an association between CD and ASD are at risk for systematic and/or random error. A potential link has, however, been shown in a handful of high-quality studies, and, therefore, this comorbidity cannot be ruled out. Future studies should recruit larger sample sizes, include precise definitions of CD and ASD, and exclude patients with ASD on a gluten-free diet.
34960046	Factors Associated with Maladaptive Eating Behaviors, Social Anxiety, and Quality of Life in Adults with Celiac Disease.	A gluten-free diet (GFD), which is the only treatment for celiac disease (CeD), is challenging and associated with higher levels of anxiety, disordered eating, and lower quality of life (QOL). We examined various demographic and health factors associated with social anxiety, eating attitudes and behaviors, and QOL. Demographics and health characteristics, QOL, eating attitudes and behaviors, and social anxiety of adults with CeD were acquired using validated measures. The mean scores for QOL, SAQ, and CDFAB were compared across various demographic groups using the Z statistical test. The mean QOL score was 57.8, which is in the moderate range. The social anxiety mean scores were high: 78.82, with 9% meeting the clinical cutoff for social anxiety disorder. Those on a GFD for a short duration had significantly higher SAQ scores (worse anxiety), higher CDFAB scores (worse eating attitudes and behavior), and lower QOL scores. Those aged 23-35 years had lower QOL scores (p < 0.003) and higher SAQ scores (p < 0.003). Being single (p < 0.001) and female (p = 0.026) were associated with higher SAQ scores. These findings suggest that the development of targeted interventions to maximize QOL and healthy eating behaviors as well as to minimize anxiety is imperative for some adults with CeD.
30230372	Cross-Contamination with Gluten by Using Kitchen Utensils: Fact or Fiction?	A risk of cross-contamination exists when preparing a gluten-free (GF) meal in kitchen facilities that usually handle gluten-containing (GC) foods. Cross-contamination with gluten may occur during the preparation or cooking process; however, published data are lacking on gluten cross-contamination from kitchenware. This study was conducted to determine whether cross-contamination occurs through shared domestic kitchenware and, if so, which cleaning method is most reliable for avoiding this cross-contamination. Kitchenware (wooden spoon, colander, ladle, and knife) previously used to cook and/or prepare GC foods was used for the preparation of GF foods (bread and pasta). The gluten concentration of the GF foods was then determined using an established enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A PCR assay was also used to detect the presence of wheat omega-gliadin DNA in the food samples. Three cleaning methods were assessed to determine the concentrations of gluten and wheat DNA in GF foods cooked with utensils cleaned directly after the preparation of GC foods. Contrary to our expectations, gluten was not detected in relevant and quantifiable amounts in our samples (<20 mg/kg). The cleaning method used did not influence gluten concentrations: all samples contained <10 mg/kg. Based on PCR analyses, the only sample with lower cycle threshold ( CT) values (i.e., higher concentration of wheat DNA) was from the contaminated ladle used to serve GF pasta. This outcome led to the hypothesis that shared ladles pose a higher risk for contamination of GF foods than do shared wooden spoons, colanders, or knives. Cross-contamination with gluten in a kitchen environment may occur, but kitchen utensils used for preparing GC pasta and for cutting GC bread should not pose a relevant problem to patients with celiac disease, at least in a domestic environment.
31970587	The Impact of a Gluten-Free Diet on Celiac Disease: A Comprehensive Evaluation of Two Cases Using NIH Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMIS, NTCB, and Neuro-QoL).	The aim of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the gluten-free diet (GFD) for celiac disease (CD) in a multidisciplinary outpatient Gastroenterology clinic with two adult cases using the innovative, paradigm-shifting measurement systems: The NIH Patient reported outcome measures (PROs). CD results in gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction, but is also associated with other inflammatory responses, psychosocial impairment, and cognitive deficits such as "brain fog." Adherence to the GFD for 6 months was associated with improvement in specific GI symptoms in one case (PROMIS-GI; Case 2) and improvement in cognitive functioning (NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery) and psychosocial functioning (Neuro-QOL) in both cases. Notably, improvement in cognitive flexibility occurred in both younger and an older adult patient. This suggests that cognitive decline and the psychosocial deficits associated with CD are reversible with GFD. The NIH PROs were found to be effective, sensitive to change, and minimally disruptive to clinic operations.

35466089	Seronegative Celiac Disease in Patients with Isolated Refractory Dyspepsia and Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease.	Background/Aims: To investigate the presence of seronegative celiac disease in patients with isolated refractory dyspepsia and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)-related complaints. Methods: This was a single-center, prospective study performed at a tertiary care referral hospital. Among 968 consecutive patients, 129 seronegative patients with tissue damage consistent with Marsh IIIa classification or above were included. The patients were divided into two groups: dyspepsia (n=78) and GERD (n=51). Biopsies were taken from the duodenum regardless of endoscopic appearance, and patients with Marsh IIIa or above damage were advised to consume a gluten-free diet. The Glasgow Dyspepsia Severity (GDS) score, Reflux Symptom Index (RSI), and Biagi score were calculated at baseline and every 3 months. Control endoscopy was performed every 6 months during follow-up. Results: The median follow-up time was 19.9 months (range, 6 to 24 months) in the dyspepsia group and 19.2 months (range, 6 to 24 months) in the GERD group. All the patients were positive for the HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 haplotypes. The differences between the mean GDS scores (14.3+-2.1 vs 1.1+-0.2, respectively, p<0.05), RSI scores (6.3+-0.8 vs 0.7+-0.1, respectively, p<0.05), and Biagi scores (3.1+-0.4 vs 0.7+-0.3 in the dyspepsia group and 2.5+-0.4 vs 0.5+-0.2 in GERD group) before and after implementation of the gluten-free diet were statistically significant. The decreases in the scores were consistent with improvements in the histological findings. There was no significant correlation between endoscopic appearance and histological examination results (p=0.487). Conclusions: Seronegative celiac disease may be considered in this group of patients. Even if a patient is seronegative and has normal endoscopic findings, duodenal biopsy should be considered.
34248079	[Celiac disease:a case report detailing clinical and pathological improvement with a gluten-free diet].	Celiac disease has a morbidity of 0.2 to 1% in Europe and the United States (US), but appears to be extremely rare in Japan with only a few case reports. This report details a Japanese woman with celiac disease diagnosed by histopathological findings and the improvement of her clinical symptoms on a gluten-free diet. The woman was in her 60s and presented with diarrhea, abdominal pain, and vomiting which were repeatedly exacerbated over several weeks. Therefore, she was referred to our hospital for a detailed examination and treatment. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a crude granular mucosa with an erythematous color in the duodenum. No special findings were noted on colonoscopy or capsular endoscopy. Histopathological findings of the duodenum noted villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and lymphocytic infiltration within the surface epithelium, which were suspicious for celiac disease. A gluten-free diet was started which resulted in improved clinical symptoms. Repeat endoscopic imaging and histopathological findings after initiation of the gluten-free diet demonstrated improved small bowel villous atrophy. In this case, appropriate testing had ruled out inflammatory bowel disease, amyloidosis, infectious enteritis, parasitic disease, and allergies. Although anti-gliadin antibody (AGA) and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody (ATTGA) were serologically negative, and HLA typing was HLA-DQ6, the patient was ultimately diagnosed as having celiac disease based on the characteristic pathological findings and clinical course. In many cases of celiac disease reported in Japan, serum antibodies such as AGA and ATTGA have not been detected, and HLA testing has been negative for DQ2 or DQ8. Therefore, it is possible that celiac disease in Japan might have different genetic and immunological characteristics than the disease in the US and Europe. In the future, additional cases with histology and molecular biological analysis are necessary to test this hypothesis.
33607573	Immune-mediated enteropathies: From bench to bedside.	Immune-mediated enteropathies are caused by excessive reactions of the intestinal immune system towards non-pathogenic molecules. Enteropathy leads to malabsorption-related symptoms and include (severe) chronic diarrhea, weight loss and vitamin deficiencies. Parenteral feeding and immunosuppressive therapy are needed in severe cases. Celiac disease has long been recognized as the most common immune-mediated enteropathy in adults, but the spectrum of immune-mediated enteropathies has been expanding. Histological and clinical features are sometimes shared among these enteropathies, and therefore it may be challenging to differentiate between them. Here, we provide an overview of immune-mediated enteropathies focused on clinical presentation, establishing diagnosis, immunopathogenesis, and treatment options.

30270716	Celiac Disease Awareness: Unraveling the Secrets of Celiac Disease.	School nurses play a major role in the care of students with food-related diversities balancing responsibilities such as providing a safe environment, encouraging leadership and community outreach, giving guidance to family and peers with care coordination, and providing needed accommodations so that all students may thrive in the school setting. It is essential that school nurses share their understanding of what it is like to live with the serious genetic autoimmune disorder known as celiac disease. With improved knowledge, the school education team, nutritional staff, and guidance counselors will have a better understanding of what the student is facing and the unique challenges it presents, because celiac disease is not a food allergy, but much more.
34339872	Larazotide acetate for treatment of celiac disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.	PURPOSE: The standard of care for treatment of celiac disease (CD) is a stringent lifetime gluten-free diet (GFD). Larazotide acetate (AT-1001) is an anti-zonulin which functions as a gut permeability regulator for treatment of CD. We endeavored to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which studied the efficacy and safety of AT-1001 in patients with CD. METHODS: We examined four databases from inception to 20-August-2020. We pooled continuous outcomes as mean difference and dichotomous outcomes as risk ratio with 95% confidence interval under the fixed-effects meta-analysis model. RESULTS: Four RCTs met our eligibility criteria, comprising 626 patients (AT-1001, n=465, placebo, n=161). Three and two RCTs reported outcomes of patients undergoing gluten challenge (intake of 2.4-2.7 grams of gluten/day) and GFD, respectively. For change in lactulose-to-mannitol ratio, the endpoint did not significantly differ between AT-1001 and placebo groups, irrespective of the gluten status. Subgroup analysis of patients undergoing gluten challenge showed AT-1001 treatment (compared with placebo) significantly correlated with better symptomatic improvement in the two endpoints of change in total gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (total GSRS) and CD-specific GSRS (CD-GSRS). However, no significant difference was noted among patients undergoing GFD for the abovementioned two efficacy endpoints. Compared with placebo, AT-1001 favorably reduced the adverse event (AE) of gluten-related diarrhea in patients who underwent gluten challenge. Other AEs were comparable between both AT-1001 and placebo groups. CONCLUSIONS: AT-1001 is largely well-endured and seems somehow superior to placebo in alleviating gastrointestinal symptoms among CD patients undergoing gluten challenge. Nevertheless, additional RCTs are warranted to validate these findings.
33928388	The Underlying Effects of Celiac Disease and Subsequent Implications on Deployment in the United States Army.	INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the etiology, pathology, and treatments for celiac disease (CD), as well as to provide context as to how CD impacts the U.S. military. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To conduct this review, the authors surveyed recent epidemiology and immunology literature in order to provide a detailed summary of the current understanding of CD, its diagnosis, and the real-world impacts within the Department of Defense (DoD). RESULTS: We described the gluten proteins and both the immune response in CD. We further describe the underlying genetic risk factors and diagnosis and pathogenesis of the disease and conclude the review with a discussion of how current DoD regulations impact U.S. military readiness. CONCLUSION: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder that results in damage to the small intestine. Ingestion of gluten in a CD patient is usually followed by villous atrophy in the small intestine, often along with other gastrointestinal symptoms. Around 1% of patients diagnosed with CD can experience complications if gluten-free diet is not followed, including intestinal lymphoma and hyposplenism. Therefore, a patient showing possible symptoms should discuss the diagnostic process with their healthcare providers to ensure adequate understanding of serological and genetic tests along with the histological examination of intestinal biopsy. Patients should seek consults with registered dietitians to structure their diets appropriately. Considering the prevalence and incidence of CD and gluten intolerances are increasing, the military should consider providing gluten-free Meals Ready-to-Eat as an option for all service members. Given the retention of service members with CD, subsequent admission of personnel with mild CD that does not affect the duties will allow the DoD access to a growing population of fully capable service members with critical technical skills who are eager to serve the USA.
30392830	Murine Norovirus Infection Induces TH1 Inflammatory Responses to Dietary Antigens.	Intestinal reovirus infection can trigger T helper 1 (TH1) immunity to dietary antigen, raising the question of whether other viruses can have a similar impact. Here we show that the acute CW3 strain of murine norovirus, but not the persistent CR6 strain, induces TH1 immunity to dietary antigen. This property of CW3 is dependent on its major capsid protein, a virulence determinant. Transcriptional profiling of mesenteric lymph nodes following infection reveals an immunopathological signature that does not segregate with protective immunity but with loss of oral tolerance, in which interferon regulatory factor 1 is critical. These data show that viral capacity to trigger specific inflammatory pathways at sites where T cell responses to dietary antigens take place interferes with the development of tolerance to an oral antigen. Collectively, these data provide a foundation for the development of therapeutic strategies to prevent TH1-mediated complex immune disorders triggered by viral infections.

34444942	TMPRSS6 rs855791 Polymorphism Status in Children with Celiac Disease and Anemia.	Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune chronic inflammatory disease occurring in genetically predisposed individuals in response to the intake of gluten. Clinical presentation can be heterogeneous. Iron-deficient anemia (IDA) is one of the most common extra-intestinal manifestations of CD. Although IDA usually reverts with a gluten-free diet (GFD), some patients show persistent IDA, the mechanisms of which are poorly understood. Recent studies suggest an association between the rs855791 polymorphism in the TMPRSS6 gene and persistent IDA in adults with CD. The current study aimed to assess the potential link between rs855791 and persistent IDA in pediatric patients with CD. The study included 106 children diagnosed with CD between 2015 and 2019. Clinical and blood parameters (including blood count, serum iron) were collected at diagnosis and after >=12 months of GFD, and the rs855791 genotype was assessed for each patient. IDA was present at diagnosis in 25 patients (23.6%); only three (3%) had persistent IDA after GFD. The prevalence of rs855791 genotypes was 9% (n = 10) for TT, 53% (n = 56) for CT, and 38% (n = 40) for CC. There was a tendency toward a higher proportion of the T allele in patients with IDA and lower hemoglobin in the TT genotype but without statistical significance. An association between rs855791 and persistent IDA was not observed. These findings suggest that persistent IDA is uncommon in pediatric patients with CD. The prevalence of rs855791 in children with CD is reported for the first time.
34391330	Significant improvement of dermatitis herpetiformis with tofacitinib.	Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a rare autoimmune blistering disorder in which patients with celiac disease, a gluten-sensitive enteropathy, present with a severely pruritic papulovesicular eruption over extensor surfaces such as the knees, elbows, lower back, buttocks, and neck. Patients are instructed to adhere to a gluten-free diet for purposes of improving their skin disease and gluten-sensitive enteropathy; this is the only treatment that lowers risk of enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma. Patients who adhere to a strict gluten-free diet often have remission of their skin disease over months to years. Dapsone is a rapid and extremely effective first-line treatment option and often used while transitioning to a gluten-free diet. Aside from gluten-free diet and dapsone, second-line treatment options include sulfapyridine, sulfasalazine, and colchicine. Some patients have difficulty adhering to a gluten-free diet or develop intolerable side effects to systemic therapies. Furthermore, there is limited data on the use of the second-line treatments. Recent studies have shed light on the role of JAK-STAT-dependent pathways in the pathogenesis of dermatitis herpetiformis. We present a patient treated with tofacitinib, 5mg twice daily, an oral JAK1/3 inhibitor, who demonstrated clinical improvement of DH and control of new lesion development.
30153131	The Nutritional and Social Contexts of Celiac Disease in Women: A Qualitative Study.	BACKGROUND: Previous studies have confirmed that women who are diagnosed with celiac disease report a lower quality of life than men who are diagnosed with the same illness. PURPOSE: This article describes the life experiences of women with celiac disease, especially those who adhere to a lifelong gluten-free diet. METHODS: A phenomenological design based on the Giorgi method was used. Twenty-two women who were diagnosed with celiac disease and were between 16 and 75 years old completed the semistructured interviews. RESULTS: The results showed that celiac disease has differing effects on the lives of women sufferers. The general feeling of being a woman with celiac disease was described as an effort toward achieving a normalized life. Four categories emerged from the results: feelings at diagnosis, limitations in daily life, social perceptions of the illness, and personal meanings of celiac disease. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This study shows that celiac disease and its treatment reduce mental and social quality of life in women. Organizations and public institutions should carry out public awareness campaigns targeting celiac disease and promote quality of life in sufferers of celiac disease in general.
32231050	Celiac Disease, Gluten-Free Diet, and Metabolic and Liver Disorders.	Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic autoimmune enteropathy triggered by the ingestion of gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. At the time of diagnosis, the frequency of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in individuals with CD appears to be similar to that of the general population, although a lower body mass index and a lower rate of hypercholesterolemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus are observed at diagnosis in CD patients. The effect of a gluten-free diet (GFD) in individuals with these liver and metabolic disorders is still a matter of debate. The aim of this study was to investigate the links between a GFD and metabolic/liver disorders in CD patients. A systematic electronic search of the literature from January 2009 to December 2019 was performed using Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library. Only papers written in English concerning metabolic and liver disorders in adult patients with CD were included. Out of 1195 citations, 14 eligible studies were identified. Increases in the frequency of NAFLD, weight gain, and alterations of the lipid profile suggest that important changes happen in celiac patients on a GFD, though the physiopathology of these conditions is unclear. Although a GFD is the only effective treatment available for CD, liver function, body weight, and metabolic and nutritional profiles should be monitored in patients on a GFD.
33059041	The Risk of Contracting COVID-19 Is Not Increased in Patients With Celiac Disease.	The World Health Organization declared coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) a global pandemic in March 2020. Since then, there are more than 34 million cases of COVID-19 leading to more than 1 million deaths worldwide. Numerous studies suggest that celiac disease (CeD), a chronic immune-mediated gastrointestinal condition triggered by gluten, is associated with an increased risk of respiratory infections.1-3 However, how it relates to the risk of COVID-19 is unknown. To address this gap, we conducted a cross-sectional study to evaluate whether patients with self-reported CeD are at an increased risk of contracting COVID-19.
35503896	Food Environment and Youth Intake May Influence Uptake of Gluten-Free Food Guide Recommendations in Celiac Disease.	A gluten-free (GF) food guide for children and youth (4-18 years) living with celiac disease (CD) has been developed and extensively evaluated by stakeholders, including registered dietitians. A case study analysis was conducted on data from 16 households of youth with CD to examine how factors related to parental food literacy, the home food environment, and food purchasing patterns may influence food guide uptake by Canadian youth with CD and their families. Households were of higher socioeconomic status, parents had good food literacy, and the home food availability of fruits, vegetables and GF grains was diverse. However, households also had a diverse supply of convenience foods and snack options. Youth reported consuming a larger proportion of these foods (>35% dietary intake) and had suboptimal diet quality. Dietary intake of fruits and vegetables were below GF plate model recommendations by over 30%. Despite limited economical barriers, good parental food literacy, and diverse food availability, meeting fruit and vegetable recommendations based on the pediatric GF food guide remains a major challenge. Findings inform that effective strategies and healthy public policies to support the uptake of GF food guide recommendations are needed to improve the health outcomes of youth with CD.
34633755	Insights from tissue "omics" analysis on intestinal remodeling in celiac disease.	Celiac disease (CeD) is a prevalent intestinal disorder that only develops in genetically susceptible individuals when they mount a harmful CD4+ T-cell response towards gluten peptides. Intake of gluten leads to inflammation and remodeling of the small intestine with symptoms such as nausea and diarrhea. The only current treatment is a lifelong gluten free diet. The immunological basis for CeD is well characterized but the mechanisms that drive intestinal remodeling are still poorly understood. Transcriptome or proteome analysis of intestinal biopsies gives a global snapshot of all processes that occur in the tissue, including alterations in the epithelial cell layer. This paper will introduce concepts of intestinal remodeling, recapitulate the current understanding of CeD pathogenesis and discuss findings from relevant tissue "omics" studies. On the basis of this review, I give perspectives on what tissue "omics" studies can tell us about disease pathogenesis with a particular focus on the gluten induced intestinal remodeling.
31220686	Dietary management of celiac disease: Revisiting the guidelines.	OBJECTIVE: Medical nutrition therapy (MNT), by lifelong compliance with a gluten-free diet, is likely the only treatment for celiac disease (CD). Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) regarding the management of CD emphasize the role of MNT over other treatment options. The aim of the present study was to review and critically appraise CD-specific MNT CPGs and identify areas in need of improvement for better adherence and outcomes. METHODS: A comprehensive search was performed using PubMed, Guidelines International Network (GIN), Google Scholar, gray literature, and websites of CD scientific organizations for CPGs, consensus and practice papers on the dietary management of CD, published in the English language. RESULTS: A total of 12 CPGs were retrieved and critically appraised by three independent reviewers using the Appraisal of Guidelines Research & Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument. All CPGs were of low quality based on AGREE II. Among the 12 CPGs, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines achieved the highest score and were unanimously recommended without modifications by the three reviewers, whereas the American Gastroenterology Association, Alberta Health Services, British Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Clinical Resource Efficiency Support Team, and Federation of International Societies of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition guidelines received the lowest scores. CONCLUSIONS: The present study reveals the low quality of guidelines regarding the MNT of CD patients, indicating the need for updated and improved guidelines taking into consideration the proposed items of AGREE II.
33962344	Celiac Disease in Children: An Association With Drug-Resistant Epilepsy.	BACKGROUND: Neurological manifestations are commonly reported in patients with celiac disease (CD). We aimed to characterize epilepsy features in a pediatric population with CD and the effect of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on seizure burden. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on pediatric patients treated at the University of Utah and Primary Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City, Utah, with both epilepsy and CD and compared with a control group with epilepsy only. RESULTS: We identified 56 patients with epilepsy and biopsy-confirmed CD (n = 36, 64%) or elevated tissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTG-Ab) without biopsy-confirmed CD (n = 20, 36%). Age- and gender-matched controls were selected from patients with epilepsy only (n = 168). Patients with biopsy-proven CD or positive tTG-Ab had high percentage of drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) compared with the control group (P < 0.05). Age at seizure onset preceded the diagnosis of CD on average by 5.9 years for patients with DRE (P < 0.01) compared with 2.2 years for those with drug-responsive epilepsy. Adhering to a GFD reduced seizure frequency or resulted in weaning dosage or weaning off of one or more antiseizure medications in a majority of patients with DRE. CONCLUSIONS: DRE was more prevalent in pediatric patients with biopsy-confirmed CD and positive tTG-Ab compared with the control group (which included childhood epilepsy syndromes), but comparable with the prevalence of DRE in the general population. Adherence to a GFD in combination with antiseizure medications appears to reduce seizure burden for those with CD and DRE.
29909690	Children with untreated coeliac disease have sub-clinical cardiac dysfunction: a longitudinal observational analysis.	INTRODUCTION: We assessed cardiac function (CF) in celiac disease (CD) patients and the effect of gluten-free diet (GFD) on CF. METHODS: Prospective evaluation of CF using conventional and tissue doppler echocardiography in 50 CD patients (age 4.2 +- 1.1 years) at diagnosis and after a year of GFD (group 1), 100 CD children (group 2; 47 compliant and 53 non-compliant) in follow-up and 25 healthy controls. RESULTS: Untreated CD (n = 50) children had larger left ventricle end diastolic dimension (35.33 +- 0.87 vs. 32.90 +- 0.91 mm; p = .04), reduced (<55%) left ventricular ejection fraction (20% vs. 0%; p = .01) and a higher (>0.6) myocardial performance index (MPI, 66% vs. 0%; p <= .01) as compared to controls. Re-evaluation after one year with good dietary compliance showed changes in isovolumic relaxation time (72.5 +- 4.2 vs. 50.62 +- 2.69; p = .0001) and deceleration time (121.05 +- 10.1 vs. 99.87 +- 8.5; p = .02), reflecting improved cardiac diastolic function. GFD compliant patients had lower MPI than non-compliant (0.60 +- .03 vs. 0.66 +- .08; p = .04), reflecting improvement in load-independent echocardiographic parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Subclinical cardiac dysfunction is common in CD children at diagnosis. Improvement in echocardiographic parameters occurs with GFD and non-compliant children continue to have persistent cardiac dysfunction.
36859658	Nutrient intakes in adult and pediatric coeliac disease patients on gluten-free diet: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	Celiac Disease (CD) continues to require a strict lifetime gluten-free diet (GFD) to maintain healthy status. Many studies have assessed the GFD nutritional adequacy in their cohorts, but an overall picture in adults and children would offer a lifetime vision to identify actionable areas of change. We aimed at assessing the nutrient intakes of adult and pediatric CD patients following a GFD diet and identifying potential areas of improvement. Systematic review was carried out across PubMed, Scopus and Scholar up to October 2022, including full-text studies that assessed the nutrient intakes of CD patients on GFD, in terms of macro- and/or micronutrients (absolute or percentage daily average). Random-effect meta-analysis and univariable meta-regression were applied to obtain pooled estimates for proportions and influencing variables on the outcome, respectively. Thirty-eight studies with a total of 2114 patients were included. Overall, the daily energy intake was 1995 (CI 1884-2106) Kcal with 47.8% (CI 45.7-49.8%) from carbohydrates, 15.5% (CI 14.8-16.2%) from proteins, and 35.8% (CI 34.5-37.0%) from fats. Of total fats, 13.2% (CI 12.4-14.0%) were saturated fats. Teenagers had the highest consumption of fats (94.9, CI 54.8-134.9 g/day), and adults presented insufficient dietary fiber intake (18.9 g, CI 16.5-21.4 g). Calcium, magnesium, and iron intakes were particularly insufficient in adolescence, whereas vitamin D was insufficient in all age groups. In conclusion, GFD may expose CD patients to high fat and low essential micronutrient intakes. Given GFD is a lifelong therapy, to prevent the occurrence of diseases (e.g. cardiovascular or bone disorders) dietary intakes need to be assessed on long-term follow-ups.
38199032	Eating competence in caregivers of celiac children: A cross-sectional study performed in Brazil.	OBJECTIVES: Eating competence is an intraindividual approach to eating, behaviors, and attitudes related to eating, with repercussions on the individual and family. In pediatric celiac disease, the family is involved in the gluten-free diet management, the only treatment available. A gluten-free diet might affect eating competence because gluten-free diet compliance requires knowledge about food, meal planning, and attention to food choices. The objective is to access eating competence in caregivers of children with celiac disease and the association between caregivers' eating competence, children's adherence to a gluten-free diet, and sociodemographic data of participants. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used a snowball spread method by applying a questionnaire, including sociodemographic data, data related to health, eating habits, and the Satter Eating Competence Inventory version validated for the Brazilian population. The sample consisted of 220 Brazilian parents or caregivers of celiac disease children. The scores of the Satter Eating Competence Inventory version validated for the Brazilian population were described in terms of means, SDs, medians, and interquartile range. Student's t test and analysis of variance followed by Tukey's post hoc tests were applied, and the association with the variables of interest was analyzed using Pearson chi2 tests. The tests were conducted considering bilateral hypotheses and a 5% significance level. RESULTS: Participants' sex, schooling level, and income did not affect their eating competence. Competent eaters were mostly those with normal weight, following a gluten-free diet, with children complying with a gluten-free diet, and who have meals with family and prepare them at home. Different from vegetable consumption, participants' eating competence did not differ considering the frequency of children's fruit consumption. CONCLUSIONS: The caregivers of children with celiac disease have greater eating competence scores than general Brazilian adults, and caregivers of children with celiac disease who comply with the gluten-free diet have higher eating competence scores.
35603827	Assessment of the social quality of life and the physical activity of adult celiac disease patients following a gluten-free diet in Lebanon.	To date, the primary and only treatment recommended for effective management of celiac disease (CD) is adherence to a strict gluten-free diet (GFD) which entails a new approach to eating that affects the social quality of life (QoL) and physical activity (PA) of patients. This cross-sectional study aimed at assessing the social QoL and PA of adult Lebanese CD patients aged between 18 and 59 years old who are following a GFD. An online CD questionnaire was administered to 136 Lebanese celiac participants on a GFD. The findings of this study show a significant association between celiac patients following a GFD and their social QoL (P-value = 0.0001). The results also showed a significant association between the same population and their PA (p-value = 0.0001). Further awareness-raising and learning activities about gluten-free products are needed to improve the adherence to a strict GFD to facilitate its availability to the Lebanese population.
29941778	Celiac Disease and Glandular Autoimmunity.	Celiac disease is a small intestinal inflammatory disease with autoimmune features that is triggered and maintained by the ingestion of the storage proteins (gluten) of wheat, barley, and rye. Prevalence of celiac disease is increased in patients with mono- and/or polyglandular autoimmunity and their relatives. We have reviewed the current and pertinent literature that addresses the close association between celiac disease and endocrine autoimmunity. The close relationship between celiac disease and glandular autoimmunity can be largely explained by sharing of a common genetic background. Further, between 10 and 30% of patients with celiac disease are thyroid and/or type 1 diabetes antibody positive, while around 5-7% of patients with autoimmune thyroid disease, type 1 diabetes, and/or polyglandular autoimmunity are IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody positive. While a gluten free diet does not reverse glandular autoimmunity, its early institution may delay or even prevent its first manifestation. In conclusion, this brief review highlighting the close association between celiac disease and both monoglandular and polyglandular autoimmunity, aims to underline the need for prospective studies to establish whether an early diagnosis of celiac disease and a prompt gluten-free diet may positively impact the evolution and manifestation of glandular autoimmunity.
35435771	How does a celiac iceberg really float? The relationship between celiac disease and gluten.	Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune intestinal disease caused by intolerance of genetically susceptible individuals after intake of gluten-containing grains (including wheat, barley, etc.) and their products. Currently, CD, with "iceberg" characteristics, affects a large population and is distributed over a wide range of individuals. This present review summarizes the latest research progress on the relationship between CD and gluten. Furthermore, the structure and function of gluten peptides related to CD, gluten detection methods, the effects of processing on gluten and gluten-free diets are emphatically reviewed. In addition, the current limitations in CD research are also discussed. The present work facilitates a comprehensive understanding of CD as well as gluten, which can provide a theoretical reference for future research.
33529351	The effect of gluten-free diet on body mass index in paediatric celiac disease.	AIM: More normal weight and overweight children are currently diagnosed with celiac disease (CD). We aimed to describe the relation between body mass index (BMI) and the clinical characteristics of paediatric CD and to determine the effect of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on BMI. METHODS: Data on all children diagnosed with CD during 7/2010-7/2019 with documented anthropometric data at diagnosis were retrospectively analysed. The children were divided into three groups according to BMI status at diagnosis: underweight, normal weight and overweight (BMIs <5%, 5%-85% and >85%, respectively). RESULTS: Of the 236 children [median age 7.87 (4.91-11) years] included in the study, 24 (10.1%) were underweight at diagnosis and 32 (13.6%) were overweight. Diarrhoea as the presenting symptom was significantly more common in the overweight group (p = 0.012), while short stature was more common in the underweight group (p = 0.002). Following a GFD had no significant effect on the children's BMI during a median follow-up of 15.7 (0-85) months, but there was a significant shift of patients between the BMI categories (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Although a shift of patients between the BMI categories was observed, following a GFD did not significantly affect the overall BMI in children with CD.
29969711	All disease begins in the gut: Influence of gastrointestinal disorders and surgery on oral drug performance.	The term "disease" conjures a plethora of graphic imagery for many, and the use of drugs to combat symptoms and treat underlying pathology is at the core of modern medicine. However, the effects of the various gastrointestinal diseases, infections, co-morbidities and the impact of gastrointestinal surgery on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic behaviour of drugs have been largely overlooked. The better elucidation of disease pathology and the role of underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms have increased our knowledge as far as diagnoses and prognoses are concerned. In addition, the recent advances in our understanding of the intestinal microbiome have linked the composition and function of gut microbiota to disease predisposition and development. This knowledge, however, applies less so in the context of drug absorption and distribution for orally administered dosage forms. Here, we revisit and re-evaluate the influence of a portfolio of gastrointestinal diseases and surgical effects on the functionality of the gastrointestinal tract, their implications for drug delivery and attempt to uncover significant links for clinical practice.
34209138	Challenges of Monitoring the Gluten-Free Diet Adherence in the Management and Follow-Up of Patients with Celiac Disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic gluten-responsive immune mediated enteropathy and is treated with a gluten-free diet (GFD). However, a strict diet for life is not easy due to the ubiquitous nature of gluten. This review aims at examining available evidence on the degree of adherence to a GFD, the methods to assess it, and the barriers to its implementation. The methods for monitoring the adherence to a GFD are comprised of a dietary questionnaire, celiac serology, or clinical symptoms; however, none of these methods generate either a direct or an accurate measure of dietary adherence. A promising advancement is the development of tests that measure gluten immunogenic peptides in stools and urine. Causes of adherence/non-adherence to a GFD are numerous and multifactorial. Inadvertent dietary non-adherence is more frequent than intentional non-adherence. Cross-contamination of gluten-free products with gluten is a major cause of inadvertent non-adherence, while the limited availability, high costs, and poor quality of certified gluten-free products are responsible for intentionally breaking a GFD. Therefore, several studies in the last decade have indicated that many patients with CD who follow a GFD still have difficulty controlling their diet and, therefore, regularly consume enough gluten to trigger symptoms and damage the small intestine.
35029612	Healthy and pro-inflammatory gut ecology plays a crucial role in the digestion and tolerance of a novel Gluten Friendly  bread in celiac subjects: a randomized, double blind, placebo control in vivo study.	Gluten Friendly  (GF) is a new gluten achieved through a physicochemical process applied to wheat kernels. The goal of this research was to assess the in vivo effects of Gluten Friendly  bread on celiac gut mucosa and microbiota. In a double-blind placebo-controlled intervention study, 48 celiac disease (CD) patients were randomized into 3 groups to eat 100 g of bread daily, containing different doses (0; 3 g; 6 g) of GF for 12 weeks. The small-bowel morphology (VH/CrD), intraepithelial densities of CD3+, celiac serology, MUC2, CB1, gut permeability, proinflammatory cytokines, gluten in stools, symptoms, and gut microbial composition were assessed. All 48 CD subjects experienced no symptoms. K-means analysis evidenced celiac subjects clustering around unknown parameters independent of GF dosage: K1 35%; K2 30%; K3 35%. VH/CrD significantly decreased in K1 and K2. VH/CrD did not correlate with IEL increase in K2. 33-mer was not detected in 47% and 73% of patients in both K1 and K2, respectively. VH/CrD and IEL did not change significantly and strongly correlated with the absence of 33-mer in K3. Inflammation and VH/CrD decrease are strongly related with the presence of proinflammatory species at the baseline. A boost in probiotic, butyrate-producing genera, is strongly related with GF tolerance at the end of the trial. Our research suggests that a healthy and proinflammatory ecology could play a crucial role in the digestion and tolerance of the new gluten molecule in celiac subjects. However, GF can be completely digested by gut microbiota of CD subjects and shapes it toward gut homeostasis by boosting healthy butyrate-producing populations. The clinical trial registry number is NCT03137862 (https://clinicaltrials.gov).
30103636	Facial Involvement in Dermatitis Herpetiformis: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.	Dermatitis herpetiformis is a cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease that classically presents as a symmetric pruritic vesicular eruption on extensor surfaces. Typical locations include elbows, knees, and buttocks. Facial involvement has been reported rarely. Here, we report a case of a 44-year-old woman with dermatitis herpetiformis presenting as pruritic vesicles on the face that had previously been misdiagnosed as allergic contact dermatitis. Diagnosis was confirmed with direct immunofluorescence demonstrating granular IgA in the papillary dermis. This eruption cleared with topical dapsone 5% gel and a gluten-free diet. We report this case to raise awareness of facial involvement in dermatitis herpetiformis as well as the possibility of topical dapsone as a therapeutic option.
34319935	Barriers of Adherence to a Gluten-Free Diet in Iranian Adults With Celiac Disease.	This cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate and classify barriers to adherence to the gluten-free diet in 137 Iranian adults with celiac disease. We used a 23-point Likert questionnaire and exploratory factor analysis to identify and classify the barriers. Adherence to gluten-free diet was assessed by measuring the serum level of anti-tTG-IgA. The correlation between the barriers and adherence to gluten-free diet was assessed using logistic regression. A total of 117 subjects completed the study. Seven factors were extracted: "gluten-free diet restrictions," "self-awareness and social awareness," "psychological barriers," "education," "situational barriers and gatherings," "lack of access/labeling," and "cost." There was a significant correlation between the situational barriers and gatherings and nonadherence to the diet in the adjusted model (odds ratio = 1.63; 95% confidence interval [1.03, 2.54], p = .03). Nutritionists and physicians should consider these barriers when consulting patients with celiac disease.
36713361	Intestinal and blood lymphograms as new diagnostic tests for celiac disease.	Accurate celiac disease (CD) diagnosis is still challenging for some specific patients or circumstances. Thus, much effort has been expended last decades focused on seronegative or low grade enteropathy CD and, especially, on enable early diagnosis of individuals on a gluten-free diet (GFD). We discuss here two diagnostic approaches based on immunophenotyping by flow cytometry that we expect to reduce the persistent low diagnostic rates and the common diagnostic delay. The intraepithelial lymphogram is based on determining the percentage of TCRgammadelta+ and surface CD3- lymphocytes in the intestinal epithelium. The concomitant increase in TCRgammadelta+ and decrease in surface CD3- intraepithelial lymphocytes has been termed the celiac lymphogram and has been proved to be discriminative in seronegative, low grade enteropathy and potential CD, as well as in most CD patients on a GFD. A blood lymphogram based on the analysis of activated gut-homing CD8+ T cells combined with a 3-day gluten challenge is also considered, which has shown high sensitivity and specificity to diagnose seropositive Marsh 1 and Marsh 3 CD in individuals following a GFD. In addition, flow cytometry can be extremely useful in cases of refractory CD type II to identify aberrant cells. Those approaches represent highly accurate methods for CD diagnosis, being simple, fast, highly reproducible and of easy implementation in clinical practice.
31324159	Survey of the initial management of celiac disease antibody tests by ordering physicians.	BACKGROUND: Appropriate interpretation of a positive celiac antibody test by an ordering physician is important in order to institute proper management. We evaluated why children with an initial positive celiac serology were not referred for diagnostic biopsy or followed with serial testing by the ordering physician. METHODS: Consecutive celiac serologies in all patients less than 18 years of age were evaluated over 3.5 years and 775 children with a positive tissue transglutaminase antibody (TTG) were identified. If no management of a positive TTG could be identified, a survey was sent to the ordering physician. Responses were categorized as appropriate or inappropriate management. RESULTS: Of the 775 patients with a positive TTG, 193 (24.9%, 95% CI 21.9-28.1%) received no follow-up management. We contacted 173 ordering physicians and 120 (69%) responded. Of the 120 responses, 55 patients (45.8%, 95% CI 36.8-55.1%) were managed appropriately and 46 (38.3%, 95% CI 29.7-47.7%) were considered to be inappropriately managed when no repeat TTG was obtained within 18 months. Reasons for inappropriate management included: screen considered to be false positive (44.7%), patient was not experiencing symptoms of celiac disease (31.6%), symptoms had resolved (15.8%), results were not indicative of celiac disease (26.3%) and patients started a gluten-free diet with no evaluation of response (15.8%). In 19 patients the TTG was not acted upon for technical reasons. CONCLUSIONS: Positive TTGs require appropriate interventions. These include: subspecialist referral for further evaluation and/or repeat testing to evaluate: 1) treatment response or 2) patients with minimal or no symptoms.
30909404	Advances in Molecular Mechanisms of Wheat Allergenicity in Animal Models: A Comprehensive Review.	The prevalence of wheat allergy has reached significant levels in many countries. Therefore, wheat is a major global food safety and public health issue. Animal models serve as critical tools to advance the understanding of the mechanisms of wheat allergenicity to develop preventive and control methods. A comprehensive review on the molecular mechanisms of wheat allergenicity using animal models is unavailable at present. There were two major objectives of this study: To identify the lessons that animal models have taught us regarding the molecular mechanisms of wheat allergenicity and to identify the strengths, challenges, and future prospects of animal models in basic and applied wheat allergy research. Using the PubMed and Google Scholar databases, we retrieved and critically analyzed the relevant articles and excluded celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Our analysis shows that animal models can provide insight into the IgE epitope structure of wheat allergens, effects of detergents and other chemicals on wheat allergenicity, and the role of genetics, microbiome, and food processing in wheat allergy. Although animal models have inherent limitations, they are critical to advance knowledge on the molecular mechanisms of wheat allergenicity. They can also serve as highly useful pre-clinical testing tools to develop safer genetically modified wheat, hypoallergenic wheat products, novel pharmaceuticals, and vaccines.
29202198	Adverse effects of gluten ingestion and advantages of gluten withdrawal in nonceliac autoimmune disease.	In light of the coincident surge in overall gluten intake and the incidence of autoimmune diseases, the possible biological adverse effects of gluten were explored. PubMed, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library databases were screened for reports published between 1964 and 2016 regarding the adverse effects of gluten as well as the effects of a gluten-free diet on autoimmune diseases. In vitro and in vivo studies describing gluten intake in animal models or cell lines and gluten-free diets in human autoimmune diseases were reviewed. Multiple detrimental aspects of gluten affect human health, including gluten-dependent digestive and extradigestive manifestations mediated by potentially immunological or toxic reactions that induce gastrointestinal inadequacy. Gluten affects the microbiome and increases intestinal permeability. It boosts oxidative stress and affects epigenetic behavior. It is also immunogenic, cytotoxic, and proinflammatory. Gluten intake increases apoptosis and decreases cell viability and differentiation. In certain nonceliac autoimmune diseases, gluten-free diets may help curtail the adverse effects of gluten. Additional in vivo studies are needed to unravel the puzzle of gluten effects in humans and to explore the potential beneficial effects of gluten-free diets in autoimmune diseases.
31831931	Novel targets for drug discovery in celiac disease.	Celiac disease is a lifelong, immunological disorder induced by dietary protein-gluten, in a genetically susceptible populations, resulting in different clinical manifestations, the release of antibodies, and damage to the intestinal mucosa. The only recommended therapy for the disease is to strictly follow a gluten-free diet (GFD), which is difficult to comply with. A GFD is found to be ineffective in some active Celiac disease cases. Therefore, there is an unmet need for an alternative nondietary therapeutic approach. The review focuses on the novel drug targets for Celiac disease.
34978241	Gut inflammation in CVID: causes and consequences.	INTRODUCTION: There is a wide spectrum of noninfectious gastrointestinal pathology, causing considerable morbidity and mortality in CVID, where both etiology and effective therapy are under debate. AREAS COVERED: This review will focus on the noninfectious inflammation in the GI tract in CVID patients, covering the both the upper and lower GI tract inflammation, including the liver. The controversy of the CVID enteropathy definition and that of gluten-free diet for celiac-like disease in CVID will be discussed. Furthermore, the review will cover the link between GI inflammation and GI cancer. Finally, the role of gut microbiota, IgA, and genetics and its relationship with CVID enteropathy is scrutinized. The authors reviewed literature from PubMed. EXPERT OPINION: The heterogeneity and the unknown mechanism behind CVID enteropathy, and thereby the lack of effective treatment, is one of the key challenges in the field of CVID. Celiac-like disease in CVID is due to immune dysregulation, and a gluten-free diet is therefore not indicated. Gut microbial dysbiosis and mucosal IgA can initiate systemic and local inflammation and is involved in the immune dysregulation in CVID. Considering the heterogeneity of CVID enteropathy, personalized medicine is probably the future for these patients.
31472694	An association between crypt apoptotic bodies and mucosal flattening in celiac disease patients exposed to dietary gluten.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is characterized histologically by inflammation and villous atrophy. Villous atrophy is thought to result from a disruption of epithelial cellular proliferation and death. Epithelial cells in intestinal mucosa normally proliferate in the crypts and migrate towards the lumen, eventually dying. Apoptotic bodies in crypts are usually abnormal and are associated with certain disease states. The presence of crypt apoptosis in celiac disease has not been thoroughly examined by routine histologic assessment of crypt apoptotic body count (ABC). METHODS: We quantified the ABC in duodenal biopsies from celiac patients before and after initiation of a gluten-free diet (GFD). We examined twenty-three duodenal biopsies from adult patients with celiac disease at diagnosis and following GFD and determined the maximum ABC in 10 consecutive crypts. Fourteen biopsies from heartburn patients served as controls. RESULTS: Mean duration between paired biopsies was 2.9 (0.5-8.5) years. Mean maximum ABC in active celiac disease was 5.44 per crypt and decreased to 2.60 with GFD (p = <.0001). The mean maximum ABC in controls was 1.79, lower than both active celiac disease and GFD (p = <.0001 and p = .019 respectively). Flat lesions with total villous atrophy (mean: 6.44) showed a higher ABC compared to non-flat lesions (mean: 4.87); p = .04. CONCLUSIONS: Crypt ABC is markedly elevated in active celiac disease and decreases significantly with GFD, however it does not achieve normalcy. Total villous atrophy is associated with a higher ABC than all other lesions. Crypt apoptosis is likely a significant contributor to villous atrophy in celiac disease and can be appreciated by routine histologic examination.
34072491	Expanded Role of a Dietitian in Monitoring a Gluten-Free Diet in Patients with Celiac Disease: Implications for Clinical Practice.	Access to a registered dietitian experienced in celiac disease (CD) is still limited, and consultation when available focuses primarily on the elimination of gluten from the diet. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the nutritional value of a gluten-free diet (GFD) in adult CD patients before, and one year after, the standard dietary education. The study included 72 CD patients on a GFD and 30 healthy controls. The dietary intake of both groups was assessed through a 3-day food diary, while adherence to a GFD in celiac subjects was assessed using Standardized Dietician Evaluation (SDE). Subsequently, all CD patients received detailed education on gluten sources, and 48 of them participated in a one-year follow-up. Results: Comparison with the control group showed that consumption of plant protein in CD patients was significantly lower, whereas fat and calories were higher. At baseline, only 62% of CD patients adhered to a GFD, but the standard dietary education successfully improved it. However, the nutritional value of a GFD after one year did not change, except for a reduced sodium intake. The CD subjects still did not consume enough calcium, iron, vitamin D, folic acid or fiber. In conclusion, while the standard dietary education improved GFD adherence, it did not significantly alter its nutritional value. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the role of a dietitian in the treatment of CD.
28780016	What Is Afflicting This Woman With Celiac Disease?	
32544849	Development of the Dietitian Integrated Evaluation Tool for Gluten-free Diets (DIET-GFD).	OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease (CD) treatment involves a gluten-free diet (GFD). There is no standardized tool for dietitians to objectively grade GFD adherence. This study aimed to develop a standardized tool for dietitians to evaluate and communicate GFD adherence. METHODS: Participants were recruited from the Manitoba Celiac Disease Cohort. Using a consensus process, an expert panel of gastroenterologists, dietitians, clinical health psychologists, and persons with CD developed the Dietitian Integrated Evaluation Tool for Gluten-free Diets (DIET-GFD). Two dietitians performed duplicate assessments of 27 newly diagnosed participants who had been advised to follow a GFD. The global adherence scale was further revised after panel discussions of the cases where there was uncertainty or discordance on dietitian ratings. Subsequently, the scoring system was evaluated using duplicate assessments of an additional 37 participants with CD. Interrater agreement was assessed using square-weight Cohen's kappa. RESULTS: The DIET-GFD includes features related to frequency and quantity of gluten ingestion based on self-reporting and food frequency evaluation, shopping and dining habits, how and where food is prepared and consumed, eating behaviors, and label reading skills. The DIET-GFD global assessment is reported using a 10-point ordinal descriptive scale, ranging from 1 (takes few precautions and regularly eats gluten) to 10 (no gluten in kitchen and rarely eats food prepared outside the home). The kappa of DIET-GFD global assessment was 0.845, which indicates excellent agreement. CONCLUSIONS: DIET-GFD is a useful tool for dietitians to evaluate GFD adherence. Further studies are needed to confirm that the score from the DIET-GFD is reliable across various settings.
35324937	Gluten-free diet exposure prohibits pathobiont expansion and gluten sensitive enteropathy in B cell deficient JH-/- mice.	In humans, celiac disease (CeD) is a T-cell-driven gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE) localized to the small bowel (duodenum). The presence of antibodies specific for gluten- and self-antigens are commonly used diagnostic biomarkers of CeD and are considered to play a role in GSE pathogenesis. Previously, we have described an apparent T-cell-mediated GSE in CD19-/- mice, which develop weak and abnormal B cell responses. Here, we expand on this observation and use a mouse model of complete B cell deficiency (JH-/- mice), to show that absence of a humoral immune response also promotes development of a GSE. Furthermore, 16S analysis of microbial communities in the small intestine demonstrates that a gluten-free diet suppresses the expansion of anaerobic bacteria in the small intestine and colonization of the small intestine by a specific pathobiont. Finally, we also observe that SI enteropathy in mice fed a gluten-rich diet is positively correlated with the abundance of several microbial peptidase genes, which supports that bacterial metabolism of gluten may be an important driver of GSE in our model. Collectively, results from our experiments indicate that JH-/- mice will be a useful resource to investigators seeking to empirically delineate the contribution of humoral immunity on GSE pathogenesis, and support the hypothesis that humoral immunity promotes tolerance to gluten.
33767109	Celiac Disease: Fallacies and Facts.	Our understanding of the pathophysiology of celiac disease has progressed greatly over the past 25 years; however, some fallacies about the clinical characteristics and management persist. Worldwide epidemiologic data are now available showing that celiac disease is ubiquitous. An elevated body mass index is common at the time of the diagnosis. The gluten-free diet (GFD) is an imperfect treatment for celiac disease; not all individuals show a response. This diet is widely used by people without celiac disease, and symptomatic improvement on a GFD is not sufficient for diagnosis. Finally, the GFD is burdensome, difficult to achieve, and thus has an incomplete efficacy, opening exciting opportunities for novel, nondietary treatments.
33844694	In vivo assessment of a delayed release formulation of larazotide acetate indicated for celiac disease using a porcine model.	There is no FDA approved therapy for the treatment of celiac disease (CeD), aside from avoidance of dietary gluten. Larazotide acetate (LA) is a first in class oral peptide developed as a tight junction regulator, which is a lead candidate for management of CeD. A delayed release formulation was tested in vitro and predicted release in the mid duodenum and jejunum, the target site of CeD. The aim of this study was to follow the concentration versus time profile of orally administered LA in the small intestine using a porcine model. A sensitive liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method was developed to quantify LA concentrations in porcine intestinal fluid samples. Oral dosing of LA (1 mg total) in overnight fasted pigs resulted in time dependent appearance of LA in the distal duodenum and proximal jejunum. Peak LA concentrations (0.32-1.76 muM) occurred at 1 hour in the duodenum and in proximal jejunum following oral dosing, with the continued presence of LA (0.02-0.47 muM) in the distal duodenum and in proximal jejunum (0.00-0.43 muM) from 2 to 4 hours following oral dosing. The data shows that LA is available in detectable concentrations at the site of CeD.
30920417	Detection of Gluten in Gluten-Free Labeled Restaurant Food: Analysis of Crowd-Sourced Data.	INTRODUCTION: Adherence to a gluten-free (GF) diet is the mainstay of therapy for celiac disease. Until now, those wishing to avoid gluten in restaurants had to rely on menu labels, word of mouth, intuition, and restaurant workers' advice, with a relative dearth of supporting data. We used crowd-sourced data from users of a portable gluten detection device to estimate rates of, and identify risk factors for, gluten contamination of supposed GF restaurant foods. METHODS: We analyzed data from a portable gluten detection device (Nima), collected across the United States during an 18-month period by users who opted to share the results of their point-of-care tests. Data were sorted by region, time of day, median household income in the restaurant's vicinity, restaurant genre, and food items. We used the chi test for bivariate analysis and multiple logistic regression for multivariate analysis to identify predictors of gluten detection in restaurant food. RESULTS: There were 5,624 tests, performed by 804 users, in the examined period. Gluten was detected in 32% of GF labeled foods. Rates of gluten detection differed by meal, with 27.2% at breakfast and 34.0% at dinner (P = 0.0008). GF labeled pizza and pasta were most likely to test positive for gluten, with gluten detected in 53.2% of pizza and 50.8% of pasta samples. On multivariate analysis, GF labeled food was less likely to test positive for gluten in the West than in the Northeast United States (odds ratio 0.80; 95% confidence interval 0.67-0.95). CONCLUSIONS: This study of crowd-sourced data suggests that a substantial fraction of GF labeled restaurant foods contain detectable gluten. Although the highly sensitive Nima device may detect gluten at levels <20 parts per million (ppm), leading to gluten exposure of unknown clinical significance, our findings raise a potential concern. In addition, our findings of higher rates of gluten detection in pizza and pasta provide practical data when providing dining strategies for patients with celiac disease.
35098721	Gluten-free diet in postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS).	OBJECTIVES: Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a chronic disorder of the autonomic nervous system that is associated with orthostatic intolerance (OI) and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. We aimed to determine if a gluten-free diet (GFD) may be an effective treatment in patients with POTS. METHODS: Patients with confirmed POTS and without celiac disease who followed GFD for  4 weeks retrospectively completed pre- and post- GFD COMPASS-31 questionnaires. Paired-samples t-tests were conducted to compare COMPASS-31 scores before and after adopting GFD. RESULTS: All 20 patients (all females, age 16-62 years (mean age 33)), had POTS symptoms for 1-30 years (mean 10.8, SD  =  10.23 years). Eleven patients had co-morbid mast cell activation syndrome, and 8 had hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Pre-GFD COMPASS-31 scores (mean 57.8) were significantly higher than post-GFD scores (mean 38.2, t(19) = -8.92, p < 0.00001), with the largest improvement noted in the OI (p < 0.00001), vasomotor, (p  =  0.0034), and GI (p  =  0.0004) domains and with a mean reduction in total COMPASS-31 score by 33.9% after implementing GFD. All patients reported improved symptoms on GFD with mean self-assessed improvement of 50.5% (range 10-99%). DISCUSSION: GFD may be effective in reducing the symptom burden in patients with POTS, particularly in the OI, vasomotor, and GI symptom domains. Large prospective studies are necessary to confirm whether GFD is an effective long-term treatment option for patients.
34334709	Self-reported nonceliac wheat sensitivity in an outpatient digestive endoscopy center: high frequency but insufficient medical approach.	OBJECTIVE: 'Self-reported wheat sensitivity' (SRWS) is a self-reported condition caused by wheat ingestion in the absence of celiac disease or wheat allergy. The aim of the study was to investigate the frequency and characteristics of SRWS in outpatients referred for digestive endoscopy. METHODS: The study, performed at the University of Palermo, enrolled 496 outpatients. RESULTS: Seven individuals (1.4%) had an already established diagnosis of celiac disease. The questionnaire was administered to the other 489 individuals: 98 subjects (20%) were SRWS, the remaining 391 served as controls (i.e. not-SRWS). SRWS patients were younger (P < 0.001), with a higher percentage of females (P = 0.002) than not-SRWS. 'gastroesophageal reflux disease and ulcer-like dyspepsia' and 'chronic unexplained diarrhea' were more frequently the reasons for the endoscopy study in SRWS than in not-SRWS (P = 0.002, and P = 0.05, respectively). Food allergies/intolerances (P = 0.04), milk allergy/intolerance (P = 0.0001), GERD (P = 0.0001), IBS (0.0001), anxiety (P = 0.005) and depression (P = 0.04) were the previous medical diagnoses reported more frequently in SRWS patients than in not-SRWS. In the SRWS group, 38% of the patients had already undergone previous upper endoscopy and 24% colonoscopy. After these investigations, 58% of SRWS patients received no diagnosis, and the other 42% were informed that they 'were not suffering from celiac disease or wheat allergy'. Finally, 28.6% SRWS patients had followed a gluten-free diet (GFD), and 71.4% of them referred being asymptomatic on GFD. CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed a high frequency of SRWS in outpatients referred to a digestive endoscopy center and a lack of medical accuracy in identifying a possible gluten-related disease. REGISTRATION: The study was registered on Clinicaltrials.gov (registration number: NCT04154137), accessible at: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04154137?term=non+celiac+wheat&draw=2&rank=1.
36574002	Celiac Disease Frequency Is Increased in IgE-Mediated Food Allergy and Could Affect Allergy Severity and Resolution.	OBJECTIVES: An increased frequency of celiac disease (CeD) has been reported in severe Immunoglobulin E (IgE) -mediated food allergy (FA). This observation requires confirmation, and whether CeD affects FA severity and resolution is unknown. The study aims to estimate the prevalence of CeD in patients with FA and to investigate whether CeD affects FA severity and oral tolerance. METHODS: Consecutive patients with FA referred for allergen reintroduction, either to evaluate allergy resolution or to start oral immunotherapy (OIT), were evaluated for CeD and for FA severity. The primary outcome was the prevalence of CeD. Secondary outcomes were the frequency of severe FA and the level of clinical tolerance at study entry and at last follow-up in patients with isolated FA versus patients with FA + CeD. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-eight patients were included. CeD was confirmed in 15 patients (6.6%) of whom, 8 patients had a previously established diagnosis of CeD and were on a gluten-free diet. Severe FA was observed in 12 patients with FA + CeD (80%) versus 88 patients with FA (42%) ( P = 0.006). At baseline, patients with FA + CeD had significantly higher median allergen-specific IgE levels [61.8 kU/L; interquartile range (IQR) 11.6-279.0] compared to patients with FA (20.3 kU/L; IQR 2.9-72.7) ( P < 0.001). Complete clinical tolerance was observed in 1 of 15 patients (7%) with FA + CeD versus 98 of 205 patients (48%) with FA ( P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: CeD is highly prevalent in patients with FA and could affect FA severity and response to OIT. CeD screening should be considered in patients with severe or persistent FA.
30801395	Effects of the Gluten-free Diet on Body Mass Indexes in Pediatric Celiac Patients.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine the effects of the gluten-free diet (GFD) on body mass indexes (BMIs) in children with celiac disease at University of Chicago before and after 2011, when processed gluten-free foods became readily available on the market. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of children seen at University of Chicago Celiac Center from January 2002 to May 2016. BMI was recorded upon GFD initiation in addition to at least 1 other timepoint: 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and 4+ years. We compared the rate of BMI increase in children who were diagnosed before versus after 2011. RESULTS: A total of 147 children (66% girls) with biopsy-confirmed celiac disease were included in the study. The mean BMI at diagnosis was 17.8 (standard deviation 3.9) for those diagnosed before 2011 and 17.1 (standard deviation 2.7) for those diagnosed after 2011. Based on a mixed-effects random-intercept random-slope regression model, there was no evidence for significant difference in BMI change over time between the 2 groups (P value = 0.36). BMI values overall were noted to increase after starting the GFD, even at the first appointment. Serologies were monitored after patients started the GFD and approached normal values, allowing us to conclude that patients were adherent to the GFD. CONCLUSIONS: Although overall we observed no significant changes in BMI before and after 2011, we did notice that in adolescent celiac patients there was a trend toward a higher postdiagnosis BMI in the years after 2011. We speculate that teenagers may be especially vulnerable to choosing quick and easy processed gluten-free options over more healthy, natural alternatives leading to a rise in their BMIs after the 2011 surge in production of processed gluten-free foods on the market. Therefore, special attention must be paid to this population to insure ongoing healthy food choices even after many years on the GFD.
33878915	Celiac disease: Understandings in diagnostic, nutritional, and medicinal aspects.	Celiac disease (CD) is characterized by clinical polymorphism, with classic, asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic, and extra-intestinal forms, which may lead to diagnostic delay and exposure to serious complications. CD is a multidisciplinary health concern involving general medicine, pediatric, and adult gastroenterology, among other disciplines. Immunology and pathology laboratories have a fundamental role in diagnosing and monitoring CD. The diagnosis consists of serological testing based on IgA anti-transglutaminase (TG2) antibodies combined with IgA quantification to rule out IgA deficiency, a potential misleading factor of CD diagnosis. Positive TG2 serology should be corroborated by anti-endomysium antibody testing before considering an intestinal biopsy. Owing to multiple differential diagnoses, celiac disease cannot be confirmed based on serological positivity alone, nor on isolated villous atrophy. In children with classical signs or even when asymptomatic, with high levels of CD-linked markers and positive HLA DQ2 and/or DQ8 molecules, the current trend is to confirm the diagnosis on basis of the non-systematic use of the biopsy, which remains obligatory in adults. The main challenge in managing CD is the implementation and compliance with a gluten-free diet (GFD). This explains the key role of the dietitian and the active participation of patients and their families throughout the disease-management process. The presence of the gluten in several forms of medicine requires the sensitization of physicians when prescribing, and particularly when dispensing gluten-containing formulations by pharmacists. This underlines the importance of the contribution of the pharmacist in the care of patients with CD within the framework of close collaboration with physicians and nutritionists.
29324472	Collagenous Enteritis is Unlikely a Form of Aggressive Celiac Disease Despite Sharing HLA-DQ2/DQ8 Genotypes.	Collagenous enteritis is an uncommon small intestinal injury pattern with unclear pathogenesis. While it has been speculated that collagenous enteritis represents a form of refractory celiac disease, recent clinical studies suggest a potential link to exposure to the antihypertensive medication olmesartan. Here we hypothesized that the pathogenesis of collagenous enteritis involves both genetic and environmental factors. All subjects with biopsy-proven collagenous enteritis diagnosed between 2002 and 2015 were identified from 2 tertiary care medical centers. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction on archived tissue. Celiac disease serology, past medical history, medications, smoking history, demographics, histology, clinical management, and follow-up were recorded. A total of 32 subjects were included. In contrast to celiac disease, subjects with collagenous enteritis were mostly elderly (median age at diagnosis, 69 y; range, 33 to 84 y). Seventy percent of collagenous enteritis subjects harbored celiac disease susceptibility alleles HLA-DQ2/DQ8; however, only 1 subject had elevated serum levels of celiac disease-associated autoantibodies while on a gluten-containing diet. Furthermore, 56% of subjects were taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 36% proton-pump inhibitors, 28% statins, and 32% olmesartan at the time of diagnosis. Discontinuation of olmesartan and treatments with steroids and/or gluten-free diet resulted in symptomatic and histologic improvement. Neither lymphoma nor collagenous enteritis-related death was seen in this cohort. Therefore, while collagenous enteritis shares similar HLA genotypes with celiac disease, the difference in demographics, the lack of celiac disease-associated autoantibodies, and potential link to medications as environmental triggers suggest the 2 entities are likely distinct in pathogenesis.
29991548	Gluten-free diet: a possible treatment for chronic diarrhoea in common variable immunodeficiency.	Gastrointestinal disorders are frequent in common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). Clinical symptoms and histological alterations in CIVD can resemble celiac disease. Usually, patients with chronic diarrhoea associated with CVID do not improve with a gluten-free diet. The authors present a case of a male patient who was diagnosed with CVID at age 33 and had chronic diarrhoea which resolved after initiating a gluten-free diet. Clinical relapse occurred after gluten reintroduction. The main objective of this case report is to alert clinicians to implement a gluten-free diet in patients with CVID with chronic diarrhoea.
34402581	Advances in quantification and analysis of the celiac-related immunogenic potential of gluten.	Gluten-free products have emerged in response to the increasing prevalence of gluten-related disorders, namely celiac disease. Therefore, the quantification of gluten in products intended for consumption by individuals who may suffer from these pathologies must be accurate and reproducible, in a way that allows their proper labeling and protects the health of consumers. Immunochemical methods have been the methods of choice for quantifying gluten, and several kits are commercially available. Nevertheless, they still face problems such as the initial extraction of gluten in complex matrices or the use of a standardized reference material to validate the results. Lately, other methodologies relying mostly on mass spectrometry-based techniques have been explored, and that may allow, in addition to quantitative analysis, the characterizationof gluten proteins. On the other hand, although the level of 20 mg/kg of gluten detected by these methods is sufficient for a product to be considered gluten-free, its immunogenic potential for celiac patients has not been clinically validated. In this sense, in vitro and in vivo models, such as the organoid technology applied in gut-on-chip devices and the transgenic humanized mouse models, respectively, are being developed for investigating both the gluten-induced pathogenesis and the treatment of celiac disease. Due to the ubiquitous nature of gluten in the food industry, as well as the increased prevalence of gluten-related disorders, here we intend to summarize the available methods for gluten quantification in food matrices and for the evaluation of its immunogenic potential concerning the development of novel therapies for celiac disease to highlight active research and discuss knowledge gaps and current challenges in this field.
30384202	The role of gluten in multiple sclerosis: A systematic review.	BACKGROUND: There is an increasing interest in diet as a modifying factor in multiple sclerosis (MS), and gluten has been suggested to affect MS. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review is to qualitatively evaluate the evidence on the role of gluten in MS. METHODS: A review protocol was submitted to PROSPERO. A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, Cab Abstracts, and Google Scholar. Studies on patients with MS, clinically isolated syndrome, or celiac disease presenting with MS-related markers were included, if they investigated effects of diets containing specified amounts of gluten or associations between gluten sensitivities and MS. RESULTS: Forty-nine publications presenting 50 studies/cases met the inclusion criteria. Study designs, methods, and outcomes varied broadly across studies. Two intervention studies found a positive effect of a gluten-free diet on disease-related markers in patients with MS. One prospective cohort study also found a positive effect of a gluten-free diet, while a survey found intake of cereal/bread to be protective against MS. Four observational studies did not find increased comorbidity of MS and celiac disease. Seventeen studies investigated the level of different gluten-sensitivity markers in patients with MS with inconsistent results. Finally, 12 cases and 13 posters/abstracts/master's theses contributed to shed light on the topic. CONCLUSIONS: There is still not sufficient evidence to state whether gluten plays a role in MS, but limitations of current evidence have been identified and directions of future research have been suggested.
34441049	Dermatitis Herpetiformis: An Update on Diagnosis, Disease Monitoring, and Management.	Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), Duhring disease, is caused by gluten sensitivity and affects 11.2 to 75.3 per 100,000 people in the United States and Europe with an incidence of 0.4 to 3.5 per 100,000 people per year. DH is characterized by a symmetrical blistering rash on the extensor surfaces with severe pruritus. The diagnosis continues to be made primarily by pathognomonic findings on histopathology, especially direct immunofluorescence (DIF). Recently, anti-epidermal transglutaminase (TG3) antibodies have shown to be a primary diagnostic serology, while anti-tissue transglutaminase (TG2) and other autoantibodies may be used to support the diagnosis and for disease monitoring. Newly diagnosed patients with DH should be screened and assessed for associated diseases and complications. A gluten-free diet (GFD) and dapsone are still mainstays of treatment, but other medications may be necessary for recalcitrant cases. Well-controlled DH patients, managed by a dermatologist, a gastroenterologist, and a dietician, have an excellent prognosis. Our review comprehensively details the current diagnostic methods, as well as methods used to monitor its disease course. We also describe both the traditional and novel management options reported in the literature.
32833796	Update on celiac disease.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to describe current updates in celiac disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent developments in the understanding of the pathogenesis of celiac disease continue to emerge that may implicate the role of gluten exposure. Several studies have shown that the amount of gluten consumed by the infant may affect the age of onset of celiac disease in genetically predisposed individuals. New guidelines from the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition allow serology-based celiac diagnosis, omitting endoscopic biopsies, in children. Recent data and updated guidelines in adults no longer support biopsies in all patients who are genetically susceptible with celiac disease who have been identified by serology with clinical signs and symptoms of celiac disease. A new assay was identified in the immune response to epitopes of the tissue transglutaminase-deamidated gliadin peptide complex. In addition, a recent study shows that serum IL-2 elevations correlate with timing and severity of symptoms after gluten ingested in celiac disease patients. Measuring gluten immunogenic peptides (GIPs) in the stool of celiac patients may help monitor adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). Of importance, we should be aware that the quality of life is affected in celiac disease patients. During adolescence, the education on the importance of long-term follow-up with an adult gastroenterologist is associated with more successful rates of medical care transition for young adults with celiac disease. Latiglutenase, an orally administered mixture of two gluten-specific recombinant proteases that degrades gluten proteins into small physiologically irrelevant fragments, is currently in a phase 2 trial. Latiglutenase has shown to be safe and effective in reducing symptoms of celiac disease patients upon a GFD with improvement of quality of life. Lastly, a recent study describes a mouse model that is characteristic of celiac disease. SUMMARY: Our knowledge of celiac disease continues to grow with increasing evidence of contributory factors to its pathogenesis. There is some evidence that the quantity ingested of gluten by the infant effects the age of onset of celiac disease in genetically susceptible patients. Changes have been made to the guidelines in the diagnosis of celiac disease proposed by new studies. Recent studies have shown the significant effects on quality of life for celiac patients. As improved laboratory methods continue to be developed, these tests can have utility in both diagnosis of celiac disease and monitoring adherence to the GFD. Current therapeutic trials offer promising nondietary treatment for celiac patients. The development of an animal model can provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis of celiac disease.
31513026	Celiac Disease: Extraintestinal Manifestations and Associated Conditions.	Celiac disease is a common form of enteropathy with frequent extraintestinal manifestations (EIM). Misrecognition of these presentations may lead to significant delays in diagnosis. Any organ may be involved, either through an immune/inflammatory phenomenon, or nutritional deficiencies. Some EIM, such as gluten ataxia, may be irreversible if left untreated, but most will improve with a gluten-free diet. Knowledge of the various EIM, as well as the associated conditions which do not improve on a gluten-free diet, will avoid delays in the diagnosis and management of celiac disease and associated manifestations.
31540014	Impact of FODMAP Content Restrictions on the Quality of Diet for Patients with Celiac Disease on a Gluten-Free Diet.	Restrictive diets as gluten-free (GFD) or reduced in Fermentable, Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, and Polyols (FODMAP) are used to improve gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in sensitive individuals. Aiming at comparing the nutritional quality and effects of a regular GFD regimen (R-GFD) and a low-FODMAP GFD (LF-GFD), in 46 celiac patients with persistent GI symptoms we conducted a randomized, double-blind intervention-controlled study. Patients received a personalized diet, either a strict GFD (n = 21) or a LF-GFD (n = 25) for 21 days. A validated food-frequency questionnaire before intervention and a 7-day weighed-food record after the intervention assessed the diets. Patients were 41.1 +- 10.1 years (mean +- SD), 94% women, with mean BMI 21.8 +- 2.9 kg/m2. On day 21, patients on R-GFD still showed poor nutritional adequacy compared to dietary recommendations, with decreased energy intake, even though an improvement in carbohydrates and folates was observed (all p < 0.025). In both groups, intake of iron, calcium, vitamin D, sodium and folates did not meet daily recommendations. As expected, consumption of legumes and grains was lower and that of fruits was higher in the LF-GFD group than in the R-GFD one (all p < 0.05). The nutritional quality of both diets was not different. When restrictive diets are useful to improve the persistent GI symptoms, careful nutritional surveillance and counseling is mandatory.
31244841	Dermatitis Herpetiformis: Novel Perspectives.	Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an inflammatory disease of the skin, considered the specific cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease (CD). Both DH and CD occur in gluten-sensitive individuals, share the same Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) haplotypes (DQ2 and DQ8), and improve following the administration of a gluten-free diet. Moreover, almost all DH patients show typical CD alterations at the small bowel biopsy, ranging from villous atrophy to augmented presence of intraepithelial lymphocytes, as well as the generation of circulating autoantibodies against tissue transglutaminase (tTG). Clinically, DH presents with polymorphic lesions, including papules, vesicles, and small blisters, symmetrically distributed in typical anatomical sites including the extensor aspects of the limbs, the elbows, the sacral regions, and the buttocks. Intense pruritus is almost the rule. However, many atypical presentations of DH have also been reported. Moreover, recent evidence suggested that DH is changing. Firstly, some studies reported a reduced incidence of DH, probably due to early recognition of CD, so that there is not enough time for DH to develop. Moreover, data from Japanese literature highlighted the absence of intestinal involvement as well as of the typical serological markers of CD (i.e., anti-tTG antibodies) in Japanese patients with DH. Similar cases may also occur in Caucasian patients, complicating DH diagnosis. The latter relies on the combination of clinical, histopathologic, and immunopathologic findings. Detecting granular IgA deposits at the dermal-epidermal junction by direct immunofluorescence (DIF) from perilesional skin represents the most specific diagnostic tool. Further, assessing serum titers of autoantibodies against epidermal transglutaminase (eTG), the supposed autoantigen of DH, may also serve as a clue for the diagnosis. However, a study from our group has recently demonstrated that granular IgA deposits may also occur in celiac patients with non-DH inflammatory skin diseases, raising questions about the effective role of eTG IgA autoantibodies in DH and suggesting the need of revising diagnostic criteria, conceivably emphasizing clinical aspects of the disease along with DIF. DH usually responds to the gluten-free diet. Topical clobetasol ointment or dapsone may be also applied to favor rapid disease control. Our review will focus on novel pathogenic insights, controversies, and management aspects of DH.
33236426	Autoimmune diseases associated with common variable immune deficiency.	Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is the most prevalent primary immune deficiency, affecting roughly 2-4/100 000 individuals in the general population. The etiology is currently unknown, even if several genetic mutations have been described, and no single clinical feature or single laboratory test can establish the diagnosis, which is based on multiple criteria. CVID is characterized by B- and T-cell dysfunction that predisposes to an increased risk of infections, with the typical involvement of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Besides this well-established complication, though the coexistence of immunodeficiency and autoimmunity appears paradoxical, two-thirds of CVID patients present concomitant autoimmune disorders. Of note, autoimmunity can often be the only clinical manifestation of CVID at the time of diagnosis. The most common autoimmune disorders associated with CVID are autoimmune cytopenias, that is, immune thrombocytopenic purpura and autoimmune hemolytic anemia, either as separate entities or as concurrently (Evans syndrome). CVID patients can also manifest rheumatologic diseases (eg, arthritis, Sjogren's disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis, Behcet's syndrome) and gastrointestinal autoimmune disorders (eg, ulcerative colitis, autoimmune atrophic gastritis, celiac disease). This latter may pose a particular diagnostic challenge, as celiac-specific autoantibodies can be absent in CVID patients. Understanding the molecular basis and the clinical impact of autoimmunity in CVID patients might help manage CVID, thus reducing its diagnostic delay and preventing its complications.
29415685	Gluten-free diet may improve obstructive sleep apnea-related symptoms in children with celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: Enlarged tonsils and adenoids are the major etiology of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in children. Lymphatic hyperplasia is common to both OSA and celiac disease. We aimed to investigate the effect of a gluten-free diet on OSA symptoms in children with celiac disease. METHODS: Children with celiac disease aged 2-18 years were prospectively recruited before the initiation of a gluten-free diet. Children with negative celiac serology who underwent gastrointestinal endoscopies for other indications served as controls. All participants completed a validated OSA-related symptoms questionnaire and the pediatric sleep questionnaire (PSQ) at baseline and 6 months later. RESULTS: Thirty-four children with celiac disease (mean age 6.6 +- 3.5 years) and 24 controls (mean age 7.3 +- 4.6 years, P = 0.5) were recruited. There were no significant differences in gender, body mass index or season at recruitment between the two groups. The rate of positive PSQ scores was higher (more OSA-related symptoms) in the control group compared to the celiac group, both at recruitment and at the 6-month follow-up (33.3% vs. 11.8%, P = 0.046, and 16.7% vs. 0, P = 0.014, respectively). PSQ scores improved significantly in both groups at the 6-month follow-up (P < 0.001 for both). Improvement was significantly higher in the celiac group compared to controls (0.1 +- 0.09 vs.0.06 +- 0.06, respectively, P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Children with celiac disease had fewer OSA-related symptoms than controls, but the degree of improvement following the initiation of a gluten-free diet was significantly higher. These findings suggest that a gluten-free diet may improve OSA-related symptoms in children with celiac disease.
36416458	Frequently Asked Questions and Evidence-Based Answers on Medical Nutritional Therapy in Children with Type 1 Diabetes for Health Care Professionals.	Medical nutrition therapy is a cornerstone in type 1 diabetes management and is based on the principles of healthy eating and the recommendations presented are valid for all children and their families. Although carbohydrates are the main nutrient that affects postprandial blood glucose in individuals with type 1 diabetes, intake of carbohydrates (type and amount), protein and fat content of the meal, and glycemic index affect the postprandial glycemic response. In recent years, the relative increase in studies on Ramadan fasting for individuals with type 1 diabetes has required health professionals to be informed about this issue. The difficulties in the nutrition management of preschool children should be solved with a professional approach. The increasing frequency of celiac disease in people with type 1 diabetes and an increasing interest in a gluten-free diet for non-celiac reasons (popular diet trends for weight loss or healthy eating) make diabetes management difficult. This review provides evidence-based approaches to frequently encountered problems on medical nutrition therapy in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.
31057009	Genetic and flow cytometry analysis of seronegative celiac disease: a cohort study.	Background: Seronegative celiac disease (CD) poses a diagnostic challenge. Aims: Characterize and identify differences between seronegative and seropositive CD. Patients and methods: Retrospective cohort study examining adult patients diagnosed with CD (1980-2017). Clinical, analytical, histological, genetic and immunophenotypic data were compiled. Seronegative CD was defined as a anti-tissue transglutaminase type 2 IgA and endomysial antibodies (EMA) negative and HLA-DQ2 and/or DQ8 positive, showing clinical signs of CD plus an abnormal duodenal biopsy, and responding to a gluten-free diet (GFD). Factors associated with seronegative CD were identified through binomial logistic regression. Results: Of 315 CD patients, 289 were seropositive (91.7%) and 26 seronegative (8.3%). Among the seronegative patients, higher prevalence was observed for autoimmune thyroiditis (26.9% vs. 9.7%, p = .016), HLA-DQ8 heterozygosity (23.1% vs. 2.5%, p   .001) and Marsh I lesion (34.6% vs. 3.7%, p   .001). The two groups showed similar flow cytometry-determined duodenal immunophenotypes and rates of refractory CD. Conclusions: Seronegative CD differs mostly in genetic (more HLA-DQ8) and histologic (milder atrophy) features as compared with seropositive. Intestinal intraepithelial immunophenotype by flow cytometry, similar in both modalities, is a useful tool to diagnose seronegative CD.
31701547	Three papers indicate that amount of gluten play a role for celiac disease - But only a minor role.	
30802444	Lactobacilli Degrade Wheat Amylase Trypsin Inhibitors to Reduce Intestinal Dysfunction Induced by Immunogenic Wheat Proteins.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Wheat-related disorders, a spectrum of conditions induced by the ingestion of gluten-containing cereals, have been increasing in prevalence. Patients with celiac disease have gluten-specific immune responses, but the contribution of non-gluten proteins to symptoms in patients with celiac disease or other wheat-related disorders is controversial. METHODS: C57BL/6 (control), Myd88-/-, Ticam1-/-, and Il15-/- mice were placed on diets that lacked wheat or gluten, with or without wheat amylase trypsin inhibitors (ATIs), for 1 week. Small intestine tissues were collected and intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) were measured; we also investigated gut permeability and intestinal transit. Control mice fed ATIs for 1 week were gavaged daily with Lactobacillus strains that had high or low ATI-degrading capacity. Nonobese diabetic/DQ8 mice were sensitized to gluten and fed an ATI diet, a gluten-containing diet or a diet with ATIs and gluten for 2 weeks. Mice were also treated with Lactobacillus strains that had high or low ATI-degrading capacity. Intestinal tissues were collected and IELs, gene expression, gut permeability and intestinal microbiota profiles were measured. RESULTS: In intestinal tissues from control mice, ATIs induced an innate immune response by activation of Toll-like receptor 4 signaling to MD2 and CD14, and caused barrier dysfunction in the absence of mucosal damage. Administration of ATIs to gluten-sensitized mice expressing HLA-DQ8 increased intestinal inflammation in response to gluten in the diet. We found ATIs to be degraded by Lactobacillus, which reduced the inflammatory effects of ATIs. CONCLUSIONS: ATIs mediate wheat-induced intestinal dysfunction in wild-type mice and exacerbate inflammation to gluten in susceptible mice. Microbiome-modulating strategies, such as administration of bacteria with ATI-degrading capacity, may be effective in patients with wheat-sensitive disorders.
31769275	Acquired autoimmune hypothyroidism as a cause of severe growth deficiency in one of the twin sisters.	Acquired autoimmune hypothyroidism is rare in early childhood, however, it must be considered in a 4 year old child with medical his-tory of delayed growth, increased somnolence, difficulty concentrating, and reduced activity. We report on the case of full clinical picture of severe hypothyroidism in one of the twins. Thyroid function deteriorated in one of the sisters, resulting in mental, motor and growth slowdown, remaining undiagnosed for about 2 years, while the other sister developed normally. In the reported case, severe hypothy-roidism and growth deficiency were accompanied by celiac disease. Initiation of L-thyroxine therapy resulted in an immediate response that increased the growth velocity by more than 2.2 times. This confirms the dominant role of thyroid hormones over celiac disease in the growth process, as the catch up effect started before gluten free diet was introduced.
30987472	Pneumococcal vaccination in celiac disease.	INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated disorder associated with gluten exposure in genetically predisposed subjects. Areas covered: Infectious disease is one of the causes of morbidity and mortality in CD patients. Invasive streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is a particularly dangerous morbid condition in both the general population and celiac patients. Pneumococcal vaccination is the most effective means for its prevention. Expert opinion: In CD, evaluation of spleen function should be useful to select patients who may benefit from vaccination to reduce the risk of pneumococcal disease. Different strategies could be employed: physicians could search for signs of hyposplenism on peripheral blood smear or abdominal ultrasound. However, the best strategy to identify which patients will benefit from pneumococcal vaccination has not yet been defined.
35656914	Celiac patient satisfaction with nursing consultations in a gastroenterology department.	The assessment of the personal care received is an indicator of the quality of the health care system. The diagnosis of celiac disease generates concern in the patient and limits the quality of life, and adherence to treatment determines symptomatic improvement. For this reason, a nursing consultation for health and nutritional education for celiac patients has been set up in our hospital. The objectives were to know the degree of patient s satisfaction of this health program regarding technical and communicative aspects, as well as to assess the influence of adherence to the gluten-free diet (GFD) on health through clinical and analytical parameters. This is a descriptive cross-sectional observational study in patients diagnosed of celiac disease from January 2019 to June 2021 according to the Catassi criteria and who have attended the nursing consultation. Subsequently, the satisfaction survey was carried out and the clinical and analytical results were analyzed descriptively and statistically using the Student's t-test. The satisfaction of the nursing consultation was higher than 90%, highlighting aspects such as the clarity of the information, the interest and the kindness of the healthcare professionals. About 94.5% of the patients showed clinical improvement after the health education and the levels of hemoglobin, ferritin and vitamin B12 increased significantly in the analytical control after the GFD.
29084190	Celiac disease on YouTube - a study of the Polish content available on the popular video-sharing website.	Celiac disease affects about 1% of the population. Since most Polish households have a broadband Internet connection, a lot of people use web resources to learn about health and disease. YouTube service (www.youtube.com) offers a lot of videos concerning celiac disease. However, the credibility of the Polish videos available on YouTube and concerning celiac disease has never been analyzed. AIM: The aim of the study was to determine whether the YouTube service offers valuable content for Polish people affected by celiac disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and fifty-four unique videos devoted to celiac disease and available in the Polish language were identified and critically assessed. Each video was categorized due to its topic(s), and evaluated for its credibility by two independent researchers. RESULTS: In general, 127 (82.5%) videos were found to be credible. The most credible categories of content presented organizations and events related to celiac disease/celiac society, followed by culinary recipes (100.0, 100.0, and 95.6% of credible videos, respectively). The least trustworthy categories were devoted to pathobiology and advertisements (55.6 and 54.3% of credible videos, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: YouTube service can serve as a supplementary source of knowledge for people affected by celiac disease, after careful selection of trustworthy content.

36615856	Gluten-Free Diet in Co-Existent Celiac Disease and Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus: Is It Detrimental or Beneficial to Glycemic Control, Vascular Complications, and Quality of Life?	Celiac disease (CeD) is associated with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), and both have the same genetic background. Most patients with T1DM who develop CeD are either asymptomatic or have mild CeD-related gastrointestinal symptoms. Therefore, children affected by T1DM should undergo screening for asymptomatic CeD. The aim of this review is to highlight the influence of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on glycemic control, growth rate, microvascular complications, and quality of life in patients with T1DM and CeD. PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central databases were searched. Reports reviewed were those published from 1969 to 2022 that focused on the interplay of T1DM and CeD and examined the effect of diet on glycemic control, growth rate, and quality of life. The most challenging aspect for a child with T1DM and CeD is that most GFD foods have a high glycemic index, while low glycemic index foods are recommended for T1DM. Interestingly, dietary therapy for CeD could improve the elevated HbA1c levels. Avoiding gluten added to a diabetic dietary regimen in T1DM patients might impose practical limitations and lead to important restrictions in the lifestyle of a young patient. Consequently, non-adherence to GFD in patients with T1DM and CeD is common. GFD in patients with T1DM and CeD seems to lower the incidence of micro- and macrovascular complications, but this requires further investigation. It seems that adherence to GFD in young patients with T1DM and CeD leads to regular growth and a stable body mass index without any negative effect on HbA1c or insulin requirements. Furthermore, the lipid profile and quality of life seem to have improved with the introduction of GFD.
33800620	Gluten-Free Diet: Nutritional Strategies to Improve Eating Habits in Children with Celiac Disease: A Prospective, Single-arm Intervention Study.	BACKGROUND: Elimination of gluten-containing cereals and consumption of ultra-processed gluten-free foods might cause an unbalanced diet, deficient in fiber and rich in sugar and fat, circumstances that may predispose celiac children to chronic constipation. AIM: to evaluate if counseling with a registered dietitian (RD) was capable of improving eating and bowel habits in a celiac pediatric population. METHODS: Dietetic, lipid profile and stool modifications were analyzed, comparing baseline assessments with those twelve months after receiving heathy eating and nutrition education sessions. At both time points, 3-day food records, a bowel habit record and a lipid panel were conducted. Calculated relative intake of macro- and micro-nutrients were compared with current recommendations by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Student's paired t-test, McNemar test, Mandasky test and Pearson correlation tests were used. RESULTS: Seventy-two subjects (58.3% girls) with a mean (standard deviation (SD)) age of 10.2 (3.4) years were included. Baseline diets were imbalanced in macronutrient composition. Significant improvements were observed in their compliance with dietary reference values (DRVs), where 50% of the subjects met fat requirements after the education and 67% and 49% with those of carbohydrates and fiber, respectively (p < 0.001). Celiac children decreased red meat and ultra-processed foods consumption (p < 0.001) and increased fruits and vegetables intake (p < 0.001), leading to a reduction in saturated fat (p < 0.001) and sugar intake (p < 0.001). Furthermore, 92% of the patients achieved a normal bowel habit, including absence of hard stools in 80% of children constipated at baseline (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: RD-led nutrition education is able to improve eating patterns in children with celiac disease (CD).
30934747	A Durum Wheat Variety-Based Product Is Effective in Reducing Symptoms in Patients with Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity: A Double-Blind Randomized Cross-Over Trial.	Patients with non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) do not have celiac disease, but their symptoms improve after a gluten-free diet (GFD). However, to date, it is uncertain if gluten or other components of wheat are responsible for these symptoms. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of an organic durum wheat variety with those of standard commercial wheat in patients with known NCGS. We performed a double-blind randomized cross-over trial of 42 patients (mean age 45 years, 8 men) with NCGS diagnosed according to the Salerno criteria and adherence to GFD for at least 12 weeks from screening. Enrolled subjects were randomly assigned to one the following groups of treatment: (A) a two-week diet with Senatore Cappelli wheat variety pasta; (B) a two-week diet with standard commercial pasta. Then, after a two-week washout period on gluten-free diet, each patient crossed over to the other treatment group. Symptoms were assessed through a modified version of the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS), tailored on NCGS. Between April 2018 and July 2018, 42 patients with NCGS were enrolled in the study (70.6% females), and 34 patients completed the study. Patients reported lower overall symptoms scores after eating Senatore Cappelli pasta than standard pasta (p = 0.03) and also significantly lower scores in several specific gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms after eating Senatore Cappelli pasta than standard pasta, specifically, bloating (p = 0.04), abdominal distention (p = 0.004), eructation (p = 0.01), flatus (p = 0.02), feeling of incomplete evacuation (p = 0.001), dermatitis (p = 0.01), and limb numbness (p = 0.03). In our study, patients with NCGS experienced lower gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal symptom scores after eating the Senatore Cappelli wheat variety than a standard commercial wheat. Should our preliminary results be confirmed by further studies, new dietary alternatives may be available to patients with NCGS, with consequent health, economic, and social benefits.
29228908	Self-reported dietary adherence, disease-specific symptoms, and quality of life are associated with healthcare provider follow-up in celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: The only treatment for celiac disease (CeD) is a lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD). The restrictive nature of the GFD makes adherence a challenge. As an integral part of CeD management, multiple professional organizations recommend regular follow-up with a healthcare provider (HCP). Many CeD patients also participate in patient advocacy groups (PAGs) for education and support. Previous work found that follow-up of CeD patients is highly variable. Here we investigated the self-reported factors associated with HCP follow-up among individuals diagnosed with CeD who participate in a PAG. METHODS: We conducted a survey of members of Beyond Celiac (a PAG), collecting responses from 1832 U.S. adults ages 19-65 who reported having CeD. The survey queried HCP follow-up related to CeD and included validated instruments for dietary adherence (CDAT), disease-specific symptoms (CSI), and quality of life (CD-QOL). RESULTS: Overall, 27% of respondents diagnosed with CeD at least five years ago reported that they had not visited an HCP about CeD in the last five years. The most frequent reason for not visiting an HCP was "doing fine on my own" (47.6%). Using multiple logistic regression, we identified significant associations between whether a respondent reported visiting an HCP about CeD in the last five years and the scores for all three validated instruments. In particular, as disease-specific symptoms and quality of life worsened, the probability of having visited an HCP increased. Conversely, as dietary adherence worsened, the probability decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that many individuals with CeD manage their disease without ongoing support from an HCP. Our results thus emphasize the need for greater access to high quality CeD care, and highlight an opportunity for PAGs to bring together patients and HCPs to improve management of CeD.
30049415	Infertility patients in general and those with celiac disease may be able to breathe a sigh of relief.	
32220373	Can individuals with celiac disease identify gluten-free foods correctly?	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with celiac disease (CD) often report inadvertent gluten exposures and challenges reading labels. The most common cause of non-responsive CD is gluten exposure. We aimed to assess whether recently diagnosed CD patients can determine whether a food is gluten-free based on labeling, and to assess skills over time. A secondary aim was to identify factors associated with label reading proficiency. METHODS: Inception cohort with follow-up at 6, 12, and 24 months after diagnosis. Participants were asked to determine whether 25 food items were gluten-free based on labeling information. Diet adherence was assessed using the Celiac Diet Assessment Tool (CDAT) and the Gluten-Free Eating Assessment Tool (GF-EAT). 144 adults with newly diagnosed celiac disease were enrolled. The initial quiz at 6 months was completed by 83%. Quizzes were completed by 72% at 12 months and 70% at 24 months. RESULTS: Median overall accuracy scores were: 23/25, 24/25 and 21/25 at 6, 12 and 24 months respectively. Gluten-free products with explicit "gluten-free" claims had the fewest errors. Quiz scores were not correlated with tTG IgA levels, or CDAT or GF-EAT scores. Diet adherence was generally good (>85% with CDAT <13 suggesting adequate GFD adherence); however, at 24 months, only 11% reported no gluten exposure. CONCLUSIONS: CD patients may be unable to consistently choose gluten-free foods based on product labeling. Explicit identification of gluten-free products may be helpful. Label reading ability appears stable over time. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether erroneous label reading or misleading labels are associated with persistent villous atrophy.
28929921	Clinical implications of interictal epileptiform discharges in cognitive functioning in CEC syndrome with evolution into epileptic encephalopathy.	In epileptic encephalopathies (EE), interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) contribute to cognitive impairment. The EE process has been studied in a patient affected by epilepsy with occipital calcification and celiac disease (CEC syndrome) by combining the administration of brain area stimulus specific (visual and auditory) reaction times (RT) during continuous EEG monitoring with the off-line reconstruction of auditory and visual evoked potentials (EP). Visual RT and VEP were abnormal only if recorded concomitantly to the IEDs. Auditory RT and EP were normal. When the EE process is going on, IEDs transiently disrupt aspects of cortical functioning, contributing to the cognitive impairment.
32784763	Updated Food Composition Database for Cereal-Based Gluten Free Products in Spain: Is Reformulation Moving on?	We developed a comprehensive composition database of 629 cereal-based gluten free (GF) products available in Spain. Information on ingredients and nutritional composition was retrieved from food package labels. GF products were primarily composed of rice and/or corn flour, and 90% of them included added rice starch. The most common added fat was sunflower oil (present in one third of the products), followed by palm fat, olive oil, and cocoa. Only 24.5% of the products had the nutrition claim "no added sugar". Fifty-six percent of the GF products had sucrose in their formulation. Xanthan gum was the most frequently employed fiber, appearing in 34.2% of the GF products, followed by other commonly used such as hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (23.1%), guar gum (19.7%), and vegetable gums (19.6%). Macronutrient analysis revealed that 25.4% of the products could be labeled as a source of fiber. Many of the considered GF food products showed very high contents of energy (33.5%), fats (28.5%), saturated fatty acids (30.0%), sugars (21.6%), and salt (28.3%). There is a timid reformulation in fat composition and salt reduction, but a lesser usage of alternative flours and pseudocereals.
35151110	Circulating microRNAs as novel non-invasive biomarkers of paediatric celiac disease and adherence to gluten-free diet.	BACKGROUND: Celiac Disease (CD) is a multifactorial autoimmune enteropathy (with a prevalence of approximately 1% worldwide) that exhibits a wide spectrum of clinical, serological and histological manifestations. For the diagnosis of paediatric CD, the gold standard is the combination of serological tests (with high TGA-IgA values greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal) and duodenal biopsy (with a positive TGA-IgA but low titer). Therefore, a diagnostic test that totally excludes an invasive approach has not been discovered so far and the discovery of novel biological markers would represent an undoubted advantage for the diagnosis of CD and prognostic evaluation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNAs (18-22 nucleotides) that regulate gene expression at post-transcriptional level and play important roles in many biological processes, represent a novel class of potential disease biomarkers. Their presence in biological fluids (i.e., serum, plasma, saliva, urine) provides the opportunity to employ circulating miRNAs as novel non-invasive biomarkers. METHODS: In our prospective observational study, we examined the expression of circulating miRNAs in a cohort of CD patients (both at diagnosis and on gluten-free diet, respectively referred as CD and GFD) compared to healthy controls. By small RNA-Seq we discovered a set of circulating miRNAs that were further validated by qPCR with specific assays. FINDINGS: We found that out of the 13 miRNAs able to discriminate the three groups (i.e., CD, GFD and controls), three of them, namely miR-192-5p, miR-215-5p and miR-125b-5p (alone or in combination), were able to discriminate these three groups with high accuracy and specificity. INTERPRETATION: Our conclusions emphasize that these circulating miRNAs can be employed not only for the diagnosis of CD patients with a low TGA-IgA titer but also to monitor the adherence to a gluten-free diet by CD patients. In conclusion, we suggest the use of the circulating miRNAs identified in this work as a novel diagnostic and follow-up tool for paediatric CD. FUNDING: This work was supported by Fondazione Celiachia Onlus (FC) Grant n  018/FC/2013 and by Italian Ministry of Health (Ricerca Corrente).

31408119	Gluten and Celiac Disease Risk: Is It Just a Matter of Quantity?	
32791131	Alterations in Intestinal Microbiota of Children With Celiac Disease at the Time of Diagnosis and on a Gluten-free Diet.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: It is not clear whether alterations in the intestinal microbiota of children with celiac disease (CD) cause the disease or are a result of disease and/or its treatment with a gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: We obtained 167 fecal samples from 141 children (20 with new-onset CD, 45 treated with a GFD, 57 healthy children, and 19 unaffected siblings of children with CD) in Glasgow, Scotland. Samples were analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing, and diet-related metabolites were measured by gas chromatography. We obtained fecal samples from 13 children with new-onset CD after 6 and 12 months on a GFD. Relationships between microbiota with diet composition, gastrointestinal function, and biomarkers of GFD compliance were explored. RESULTS: Microbiota alpha diversity did not differ among groups. Microbial dysbiosis was not observed in children with new-onset CD. In contrast, 2.8% (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index, P = .025) and 2.5% (UniFrac distances, P = .027) of the variation in microbiota composition could be explained by the GFD. Between 3% and 5% of all taxa differed among all group comparisons. Eleven distinctive operational taxonomic units composed a microbe signature specific to CD with high diagnostic probability. Most operational taxonomic units that differed between patients on a GFD with new-onset CD vs healthy children were associated with nutrient and food group intake (from 75% to 94%) and with biomarkers of gluten ingestion. Fecal levels of butyrate and ammonia decreased during the GFD. CONCLUSIONS: Although several alterations in the intestinal microbiota of children with established CD appear to be effects of a GFD, specific bacteria were found to be distinct biomarkers of CD. Studies are needed to determine whether these bacteria contribute to pathogenesis of CD.
30785904	Involvement of gliadin, a component of wheat gluten, in increased intestinal permeability leading to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced small-intestinal damage.	Gliadin, a component of wheat gluten known to be an important factor in the etiology of celiac disease, is related to several other diseases through its enhancing effect on intestinal paracellular permeability. We investigated the significance of gliadin in non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced small-intestinal damage in mice. 7-week-old C57BL/6 male mice were divided into the following groups: standard diet group, in which mice were fed with wheat-containing standard rodent diet (CE-2); gluten-free diet group, in which mice were fed with gluten-free diet (AIN-76A); and gliadin-administered group, in which mice fed with gluten-free diet were administered with gliadin (~250 mg/kg BW). Each group was subdivided into negative, healthy control group and NSAID-treated group. To some mice fed with gluten-free diet and administered with gliadin, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor was administered for clarification of the significance of EGFR in NSAID-induced small intestinal damage and intestinal permeability. In mice fed with a gluten-free diet, indomethacin or diclofenac induced very mild mucosal damage in the small intestine compared with that in mice fed with a wheat-containing standard diet. Gliadin exacerbated the NSAID-induced small-intestinal damage in mice fed with a gluten-free diet. With the administration of indomethacin, MPO activity, a marker of neutrophil infiltration into the mucosa and mRNA expression level of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1beta in the small intestine were higher in the gliadin-administered mice. Gliadin increased the intestinal paracellular permeability without indomethacin administration (4.3-fold) and further increased the permeability after indomethacin administration (2.1-fold). Gliadin induced phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in small-intestinal tissues, and erlotinib (an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor) attenuated the indomethacin-induced intestinal damage and permeability exacerbated by gliadin, accompanied by inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation. These results suggest that gliadin plays an important role in the induction and exacerbation of NSAID-induced small-intestinal damage, and that increase in intestinal permeability via the EGFR signalling pathway is involved in its mechanism.
33213379	How to manage celiac disease and gluten-free diet during the COVID-19 era: proposals from a tertiary referral center in a high-incidence scenario.	The outbreak of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 infection is spreading worldwide as the first coronavirus pandemic. The clinical picture is variable but flu-like symptoms are common with bilateral interstitial pneumonia being the most frightening presentation. No specific therapies nor vaccine have been developed to date and the only way to limit the virus diffusion is by modifying one's lifestyle limiting social life and following strict hygienic precautions. No data is available on the risk of COVID-19 and its outcomes in celiac disease (CeD). The restrictions applied to counter COVID-19 can impact on CeD treatment and gluten-free dieting, the only available therapy for CeD. With the present manuscript, we aim to support gastroenterologists and nutritionists in the management of CeD patients in the new pandemic scenario, being conscious that availability and local situations are extremely various.

30821220	Thymic stromal lymphopoietin levels are increased in patients with celiac disease.	Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a cytokine produced by epithelial cells in the lungs, skin, and intestinal mucosa and is involved in several physiological and pathological processes. In this study, we evaluated serum TSLP levels in patients with celiac disease (CD). The prospective study was conducted at a gastroenterology outpatient clinic between March 2018 and August 2018. Eighty-nine participants aged between 18 and 75 years were classified into following groups: 22 patients with newly diagnosed CD; 20 patients with CD who were compliant with a gluten-free diet (GFD); 32 patients with CD who were not compliant with a GFD; and 15 healthy controls. Demographic characteristics, disease duration, and selected biochemical and hematologic parameters were recorded and compared between groups. Median serum TSLP levels were 1193.65 pg/mL (range: 480.1-1547.1) in newly diagnosed CD patients, 110.25 pg/mL (range: 60.3-216.7) in CD patients who were compliant with a GFD, 113.1 pg/mL (range: 76.3-303.4) in CD patients who were not compliant with a GFD, and 57 pg/mL (range: 49-67.8) in healthy controls. Overall, there was a significant difference in serum TSLP levels between groups (p = 0.001). Patients with newly diagnosed CD had the highest serum TSLP levels. There was no significant difference in serum TSLP levels between patients with CD who were and were not compliant with a GFD. TSLP appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of CD. Further studies are required to determine if the TSLP signaling pathway can be used in the treatment of CD.
34561158	Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin profile in patients with celiac disease living in a high incidence area.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: How symptoms and antibodies related to SARS-CoV-2 infection develop in patients with celiac disease (CD) is unclear. We aimed to investigate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in CD patients. METHODS: CD patients were interviewed about the development of COVID-19 symptoms, compliance with anti-virus measures and adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). The presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA (anti-RBD and N proteins) was compared to that in non-CD subjects. Expression of the duodenal ACE2 receptor was investigated. When available, data on duodenal histology, anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA (tTGA), comorbidities and GFD adherence were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 362 CD patients, 42 (12%) reported COVID-19 symptoms and 21% of these symptomatic patients presented anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ig. Overall, 18% of CD patients showed anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ig versus 25% of controls (p = 0.18). CD patients had significantly lower levels of anti-N IgA. tTGA, duodenal atrophy, GFD adherence or other comorbidities did not influence symptoms and/or antibodies. The ACE2 receptor was detected in the non-atrophic duodenal mucosa of patients; atrophy was associated with lower expression of the ACE2 receptor. CONCLUSION: CD patients have an anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ig profile similar to non-celiac controls, except for anti-N IgA. No risk factors were identified among CD parameters and GFD adherence.
32290294	Possible Role of Vitamin D in Celiac Disease Onset.	Beside skeletal system maintenance and protection, possible extra-calcium roles of vitamin D have been recently described. In particular, studies have investigated possible roles of vitamin D as a key modulator of inflammation and immune mechanisms and of the intestinal mucosa barrier. In this regard, vitamin D has been considered as a factor that affects different conditions such as immune-mediated diseases. The new emerging role of vitamin D and its involvement in immune modulation has led it to be considered as a possible key factor involved in celiac disease (CD) onset. CD is a chronic immune-mediated enteropathy of the small intestine that is triggered by dietary gluten protein exposure in individuals who are genetically predisposed. However, along with gluten, other environmental factors are also involved in CD onset. The renewed interest in a molecule that offers great possibilities for new roles has led to an increase in studies, although there remains a lack of studies aimed at contextualizing the role of vitamin D on CD. This review aims to define the possible role of vitamin D in CD onset as it is presently understood, taking into account potential links among vitamin D, the immune system and CD.
31986568	[Non-celiac Gluten Sensitivity].	Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a term that is used to describe individuals who are not affected by celiac disease or wheat allergy, yet they have intestinal and/or extra-intestinal symptoms related to gluten ingestion with improvement of their symptoms upon withdrawing gluten from their diet. Gluten-related disorder groups are manifested by symptoms of gastrointestinal tract disorders, as well as hematological dermatological endocrinological, gynecological, rheumatological and nervous system symptoms. It is believed that NCGS represents heterogeneous groups with different subgroups characterized by different etiologies, clinical histories and clinical courses. There also appears to be an overlap between NCGS and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). There is a need for establishing strict criteria for diagnosing NCGS. The absence of validated biomarkers remains a significant limitation for research studies on NCGS. New evidence shows that a gluten-free diet may be beneficial for some patients with gastrointestinal symptoms, such as those symptoms commonly found in patients with IBS. Further studies about NCGS are needed.
34962314	Evaluation of the Relationship Between Carotid Intima Media Thickness and Dietary Compliance in Pediatric Celiac Patients: A Single-Center Pilot Study.	OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to show the relationship between gluten-free diet (GFD) compliance in Celiac Disease (CD) and early atherosclerotic findings in pediatric patients and to test the effectiveness of carotid-intima-media-thickness (cIMT) to possibly predict long-term compliance to the GFD. METHODS: Patients from 6 to 18 years of age with a diagnosis of CD confirmed by endoscopic duodenal biopsy who were followed at our hospital's pediatric gastroenterology outpatient clinic between November 2020 and May 2021 were evaluated in this single-center, prospective study. The study patients were divided into two groups according to GFD compliance. Serologic and biochemical tests were conducted routinely during the follow-up period. cIMT was measured using ultrasound for both groups. RESULTS: A total of 80 patients (GFD-non-compliant: n = 35, GFD-compliant: n = 45) were evaluated. No significant differences were observed between the groups in terms of demographic data and pathology results. The mean cIMT value was 0.44 +- 0.028 mm for the GFD-compliant group and 0.54 +- 0.036 mm for the GFD-non-compliant group, with a statistically significant between-group difference (P < .001). The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed an area under the curve of 0.992 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.978-1, P < .001) for discrimination of the groups. In addition, a cutoff value of 0.486 mm for cIMT showed 96% (95% CI: 0.83-0.99) sensitivity and 94% (95% CI: 0.79-0.99) specificity for distinguishing GFD-compliant patients from non-GFD-compliant patients. CONCLUSION: In this study, the relationship between long-term GFD compliance and cIMT was demonstrated in CD. Currently used by some authors for the assessment of preclinical atherosclerosis, cIMT can also be used as a long-term indicator of dietary compliance as well as cardiovascular risk.
32260408	Prevalence of Adverse Reactions to Gluten and People Going on a Gluten-Free Diet: A Survey Study Conducted in Brazil.	BACKGROUND: The prevalence of gluten-related disorders (GRD) and adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) remains unknown in Brazilian population and there is no published information on the scientific literature about the proportion of Brazilians that were diagnosed with a gluten-related disorder. Thus, the aim of this work was to estimate the prevalence of GRDs and adherence to a GFD by self-report in adult Brazilian population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was conducted in two Brazilian cities. RESULTS: The response rate was 93.2% (1630/1749). The self-reported prevalence rates were (95% CI): adverse reactions to gluten 10.06% (8.64-11.62); gluten sensitivity 2.33% (1.65-3.18); physician-diagnosed celiac disease 0.3% (0.09-0.71); non-celiac gluten sensitivity 1.71% (1.14-2.47); wheat allergy 0.79% (0.42-1.36); adherence to gluten-free diet 7.48% (6.25-8.87); gluten avoiders 15.21% (13.5-17.05). Among those who were following a GFD (n = 122), 65.6% (n = 80) of them reported that they did not develop symptoms after wheat/gluten ingestion and 50% (n = 61) were following the diet without medical/dietitian advice. The main motivation for following a GFD in the self-reported and non-self-reported gluten sensitivity groups were the symptoms triggered after wheat/gluten ingestion (86.8%) and weight control (57.1%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of programs to increase awareness about GRDs among healthcare professionals and giving scientifically sound information to the general population about the risks and benefits for following a GFD are desirable actions in Brazil. The results also add to the growing body of evidence for highlighting the under-diagnosis of GRD and the trend for following a GFD in Latin America.
29113007	[Gluten-free diet - Update 2017].	Since sixty years, the gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only therapeutic option for patients with celiac disease or dermatitis herpetitormis to normalize symptoms and prevent complications. In recent years, the use of a gluten-free diet is rapidly growing because of presumed effects on well-being and control of body weight. GFD is becoming a popular health choice for everybody.In the present review, evidence-based indications for a gluten-free diet are stressed, the need for profound dietary counselling and education of the patient is underlined, problems and pitfalls of the implementation of a gluten-free diet in daily practice and possible side effects of long-term gluten-free diets are mentioned. New methods to control adherence to a gluten-free diet and aspects of nutritional quality of commercial gluten-free products are discussed in detail.
29565145	Blood iron levels in accordance with adherence to a gluten-free diet in celiac school aged children.	INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease (CD) causes intestinal damage, inability to absorb nutrients, and progressive malnutrition. Iron deficiency is one of the predominant nutritional problems. A strict gluten-free diet (GF) allows for an optimal quality of life. OBJECTIVE: To assess the nutritional situation of iron in school-aged celiac children by determining biochemical parameters, their relation to the consumption of the mineral and adherence to gluten-free diets in San Luis. METHODS: Observational, analytical and cross-sectional study. We included 44 children with CD, from 6-10 years of age, with diagnosis of celiac disease and registered in public and private entities of San Luis (Argentina) during 2011-2012. A qualitative-quantitative survey was used to determine dietary habits and sociodemographic characteristics. Iron levels and adherence to a GF diet were evaluated. Generalized linear regression models were constructed to verify the association of ferritin with iron consumption and adherence to diet. RESULTS: Most families had low socioeconomic status and were large families. Current feeding did not prevent iron deficiency anemia. Most children had normal immune system, and normal antiendomysial and antitransglutaminase antibodies; 7% of the children showed low levels of iron. Under adequate iron consumption conditions, ferritin was associated to predictor antibodies and the presence of both parents in the home. CONCLUSION: Under adequate conditions of iron consumption, the levels of iron in blood were related to adherence to gluten-free diets.

32083828	[Modern approaches to the development of gluten-free bakery formulations].	According to WHO, currently about 1% of the world's population suffers from celiac disease, a disease associated with a deficiency of enzymes that break down gluten and proteins close to it. In celiac disease, there is a malabsorption of disaccharides, fats, vitamins and amino acids, which imposes restrictions on food formulations that can be used in the diet of people with celiac disease. Analysis of the market of gluten-free bakery products showed a lack in this segment of products, including the complete absence of products with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), the total deficit of which is noted in the diet of Russians and around the world. The aim of the study was to develop recipes for gluten-free bakery products enriched with omega-3 PUFAs, dietary fibers and protein. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The quality of the resulting bread was evaluated by conventional methods including the determination of the content of protein, dietary fiber, fat and its fatty acid composition. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: To achieve this goal, we used approaches that combined both traditional and non-traditional food raw materials, namely gluten-free flour of chia seeds (a source of PUFA and dietary fiber), lupin flour (a source of protein), as well as enzyme transesterificated milk fat substitute containing omega-3 PUFAs. A protein-polysaccharide mixture was used as a thickener and structure-forming agent. The developed formulations allowed to obtain finished products characterized by the content of omega-3 fatty acids - 0.4-0.6 g/100 g, while maintaining a balance between essential omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids at the level (2.5-3.5):1, recommended for therapeutic nutrition, dietary fiber - 11.1-12.4 g/100 g, and protein content - 5.2-6.7 g/100 g, while maintaining good organoleptic properties. The achieved level of enrichment in accordance with the current legislation allows labeling the resulting products as <<high in omega-3 fatty acids and dietary fibers>>. According to the available data on the biological effect of the components of the developed product, it can affect lipid metabolism, contributing to the reduction of atherogenic lipids in the blood. CONCLUSION: The implementation of the results of this work in the industry will expand the range of gluten-free products through the production of specialized bakery products with the strengthening of their dietary therapeutic and preventive orientation due to the high content of omega-3 fatty PUFAs and dietary fibers.
36768398	Celiac Disease Genetics, Pathogenesis, and Standard Therapy for Japanese Patients.	Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease primarily affecting the small intestine that is caused by the ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. The development of celiac disease is based on a complex immune response to gluten proteins. The global average prevalence in the general population is about 1%. In recent years, it has become clear that celiac disease is not less common in Asian countries than in Western countries but often remains undiagnosed. Although the number of patients with celiac disease in Asia is expected to increase with improving disease recognition and advances in diagnostic techniques, there remain few reports of celiac disease in the Far East region of Asia, especially in Japan. In this paper, we outline the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of celiac disease. In addition, we summarize the reported Japanese cases of celiac disease with an overview in Japan.
29634666	Concurrent extrahepatic autoimmune disorders: unexplored dimension of autoimmune liver disease in children.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: No comprehensive and prospective data are available for concurrent extrahepatic autoimmune disorders (CEAIDs) in children with autoimmune liver disease (AILD). The aim of this study was to evaluate CEAIDs in AILD and their effect on AILD outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Enrolled AILD and CEAIDs children were diagnosed on the basis of simplified and standard diagnostic criteria, respectively. The clinicopathological profile, treatment response, and outcome were compared between AILD with CEAIDs (group A) and AILD without CEAIDs (group B). RESULTS: In 62 AILD children, CEAIDs were found in 42% (n=26) [vitiligo (42%), celiac disease (CD) (15%), potential CD (15%), autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) (15%)]. CEAIDs were asymptomatic in 75%. Single CEAID was found in 81% (21/26) and multiple CEAID was found in 19% (5/26). Significantly less biochemical remission (46.1 vs. 74.2%, P=0.03), more treatment failure (23 vs. 3.2%, P=0.04), and higher mortality (15.3 vs. 3.2%, P=0.04) were encountered in group A compared with group B. On multivariate analysis (n=57), less biochemical remission in vitiligo (P=0.04); more treatment failure in AIHA (P=0.004) and vitiligo (P=0.04); and high mortality in AIHA (P=0.02) subgroups were reported. CD treatment has good impact on AILD outcome. All cases of diabetes mellitus in AILD were steroid-induced rather than because of autoimmunity (absence of antibody against tyrosine phosphatase and glutamic acid decarboxylase and elevated C-peptide). CONCLUSION: All AILD children should be screened for CEAIDs as the majority are asymptomatic. The AILD outcome was favorable in CD, but poor in vitiligo and AIHA. We suggest the incorporation of CEAIDs in a pediatric AILD scoring system.
35279730	Does contrast-enhanced computed tomography raise awareness in the diagnosis of the invisible side of celiac disease in adults?	PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the diagnosis and determine major and minor criteria of celiac disease (CD) with the malabsorption patterns (MABP) in the small intestine and colon on computed tomography (CT) and additional CT findings. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted with 116 patients diagnosed with CD, 14 CD patients recovering with treatment, and 35 control patients with non-CD. All patients had CT examinations and histopathological diagnoses. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy values of each CT finding defined in the literature were statistically evaluated. According to the patient and control groups, the numerical values of the findings and the sensitivity and specificity values were measured according to this cut-off value. The distribution of CT findings according to pathological Marsh data was evaluated in CD patients. RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity were found to be higher in small bowel MABP findings, mesenteric hypervascularity, and increased SMV/aorta diameter. There was a numerically significant difference in MDCT findings between the control and pathological Marsh groups. In the ROC analysis performed in terms of the total numerical values of each MDCT finding observed between the groups, it was found that there were more than 7 MDCT findings, 100% sensitivity, and 92% specificity. The presence of four major and three minor criteria or three major and four minor criteria were considered significant. CONCLUSIONS: Being aware of CT findings below the iceberg that may suggest CD in abdominal CT examinations performed in patients with atypical clinical and malabsorption findings or other nonspecific findings may prevent diagnostic delay and unnecessary procedures.
31599818	Trend of Antitissue Transglutaminase Antibody Normalization in Children With Celiac Disease Started on Gluten-free Diet: A Comparative Study Between Chemiluminescence and ELISA Serum Assays.	BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to compare the performance of antitissue transglutaminase (atTG) chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) with the standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods in monitoring celiac children after the start of gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: Celiac children diagnosed between 2005 and 2016 at our centre were classified into 2 groups based on serum assay (ELISA vs CLIA) used for atTG monitoring, and were compared on percentage of decrease and time to normalization of atTG on GFD. RESULTS: Among 260 included children, the rate of normalization of atTG levels at 30 months' follow-up was 86% and 70% in ELISA and CLIA group, respectively (P < 0.01). Median time to normalization was 11.7 and 14.7 months in ELISA and CLIA group respectively (P = 0.003). Marsh score at diagnosis was not associated with time to atTG normalization (P = 0.770), whereas older age at diagnosis and higher baseline atTG predicted longer time to atTG normalization (P = 0.01, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The percentage and the time of the atTG normalization in celiac children on GFD should be interpreted according to the utilized assay: at 30 months' follow-up children tested by CLIA are less likely to normalize atTG levels compared to those tested by ELISA. Younger age at diagnosis and lower baseline atTG are predictors of earlier atTG normalization, regardless of the adopted assay.
30081576	A Low FODMAP Gluten-Free Diet Improves Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders and Overall Mental Health of Celiac Disease Patients: A Randomized Controlled Trial.	A subset of patients with celiac disease (CD) on a gluten-free diet (GFD) reported the persistence of functional gastrointestinal disorders. Foods containing fermentable, oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) can trigger a broad range of gastrointestinal symptoms in sensitive individuals. We evaluated the effects of a low FODMAP diet (LFD) on gastrointestinal and psychological symptomatology in CD patients. A total of 50 celiac patients on GFDs and with persistence of gastrointestinal symptoms were included. The patients were randomly allocated to one of two dietary groups-one on a low FODMAP GFD (LF-GFD, n = 25) and the other on a regular GFD (R-GFD, n = 25)-for 21 days. Psychological symptomatology and quality of life were evaluated by the Symptom Checklist-90-R (SCL-90) and the Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaires, respectively. Gastrointestinal symptomatology and general well-being were evaluated by visual analogue scale (VAS) scores. After 21 days, 21 and 23 patients completed the dietary treatment on LF-GFD and R-GFD, respectively. A reduced global SCL-90 index (p < 0.0003) was found in the LF-GFD group but not in the R-GFD one. However, the SF-36 scores did not differ between groups after treatment. The VAS for abdominal pain was much lower, and the VAS for fecal consistency enhanced after treatment in the LF-GFD group. General well-being increased in both groups but with a much higher improvement in the LF-GFD (p = 0.03). A short-term LFD regimen helps to improve the psychological health and gastrointestinal symptomatology with enhanced well-being of CD patients with persisting functional gastrointestinal symptomatology. The long-term clinical effects of LFD in particular subgroups of CD patients need further evaluation.
29785564	Helicobacter pylori Infection in Pediatric Patients: Update on Diagnosis and Eradication Strategies.	Helicobacter pylori infection is acquired mainly in childhood and remains an essential cause of peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. This article provides commentary on the last ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN guidelines and on publications made after the consensus conference of 2015. The majority of infected children are asymptomatic and pediatric studies do not support a role for H. pylori in functional disorders such as recurrent abdominal pain. The role of H. pylori infection in failure to thrive, children's growth, type I diabetes mellitus (T1DM), and celiac disease remains controversial. The diagnosis of infection should be based on upper-digestive endoscopy with biopsy-based methods. Eradication control after treatment should be based on validated non-invasive tests. Nodular gastritis is the main endoscopic finding of childhood H. pylori infection, but gastroduodenal erosions/ulcers are seen in some children, especially after 10 years of age. When indicated, eradication treatment should be given when good compliance is expected and based on the antimicrobial susceptibility profile.

33670760	A Cumulative Effect of Food and Viruses to Trigger Celiac Disease (CD): A Commentary on the Recent Literature.	Celiac disease (CD) is a type of inflammatory chronic disease caused by nutrients such as gliadin that induce a TC (T cell)-mediated response in a partially known genetical background in an environment predisposed to inflammation, including viruses and food. Various experimental and clinical observations suggest that multiple agents such as viruses and bacteria have some common, inflammatory pathways predisposing individuals to chronic inflammatory diseases including celiac disease (CD). More recently, a Western diet and lifestyle have been linked to tissue inflammation and increase in chronic inflammatory diseases. In CD, the gliadin protein itself has been shown to be able to induce inflammation. A cooperation between viruses and gliadin is present in vitro and in vivo with common mechanisms to induce inflammation. Nutrients could have also a protective effect on CD, and in fact the anti-inflammatory Mediterranean diet has a protective effect on the development of CD in children. The possible impact of these observations on clinical practice is discussed.
30582343	Gluten contamination in food services and industry: A systematic review.	Gluten-related disorders (GRD) affects approximately 10% of the general population. The only treatment for GRD is still so far is the lifelong complete exclusion of gluten from the daily diet. The correct information about the presence/absence of gluten in food is very important to this group. The present study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of gluten contamination in gluten-free industrial and non-industrial products. In this systematic review, 24 cross-sectional studies were analyzed. The authors developed specific search strategies for Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global. The authors evaluated the methodological quality of the included studies using criteria from Meta-analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (MASTARI). We performed the statistical meta-analysis by metafor package of R program. 95.83% (n = 23) of the studies presented positive results for contamination (over 20 ppm). In industrial food products, studies showed a contamination prevalence of 13.2% (95% CI: 10.8%-15.7%). In non-industrial food products, studies showed a contamination prevalence of 41.5% (95% CI: 16.6%-66.4%). Despite the non-industrial products presented higher contamination prevalence than the industrial products, the difference was not significant (p = 0.072). The findings indicate cross-contamination in industrialized and non-industrialized products. As expected, industrial products labeled as gluten-free showed a lower percentage of gluten-contamination than non-industrialized. Despite that, any contaminated sample found in this group present greater relevance than non-labeled foods. It indicates that foods labeled as "gluten-free" should not be considered safe for patients with GRD since information on the label regarding the presence/absence of gluten is unreliable. Therefore, any gluten-contamination in products labeled as gluten-free is a serious problem to whom present GRD. Further studies are needed to estimate gluten cross-contamination in food service meals and industry better.
33908739	Age-Dependent Trends in the Celiac Disease: A Tertiary Center Experience.	OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease (CD) is a common intestinal autoimmune disorder with diverse presenting features. We aimed to determine age-dependent patterns in CD presentation, diagnosis and management at a large tertiary referral center. METHODS: A retrospective review of electronic medical records of pediatric patients diagnosed with CD between January 1999 and December 2018 at Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel. We compared demographics, clinical and laboratory parameters between four age groups at CD presentation. RESULTS: A cohort of 932 children was divided into four groups by age (in years) at diagnosis: 0-3 (17.9%), 3-6 (31.8%), 6-12 (34.5%), 12-18 (15.8%). The youngest age group presented more frequently with diarrhea, weight loss, abdominal distention, vomiting and lower weight z scores, P < 0.01. Hypoalbuminemia and zinc deficiency were also more frequent in this age group, compared to older patients (P < 0.05, each). Rates of anemia were higher in younger age groups (0-3 and 3-6 years), compared to older age groups, P < 0.05. Patients in the younger age groups (0-3 and 3-6 years) presented more frequently with tissue transglutaminase (TTG) levels above 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN; P < 0.05), and more often normalized their CD serologies by 24 months of gluten-free diets (GFD) compared to older age groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: There is an age-dependent variation in CD presentation during childhood. Younger patients present more often with malabsorptive features, and higher TTG levels, yet normalize TTG while on GFD more rapidly than older patients. Clinicians should be aware of the diversity in CD presentation and course at the various presentation age.
34993643	Individual variability in patterns and dynamics of fecal gluten immunogenic peptides excretion after low gluten intake.	PURPOSE: Determination of Gluten Immunogenic Peptides (GIP) in feces is a direct tool for gluten exposure detection. The sensitivity of GIP detection methods for cases of unintentional low gluten intakes is unknown. We studied the interindividual variability in the kinetic of excretion under homogeneously controlled dietary conditions, and the sensitivity of fecal GIP tests after low amounts of punctual gluten ingestions. METHODS: Participants (n = 20) followed the same gluten-free menu for 12 days in which two separated doses of gluten (50 mg and 2 g) were ingested and all the depositions were collected. GIP from stool samples were analyzed by ELISA and lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) tests. RESULTS: Most participants had detectable GIP after 50 mg and 2 g gluten ingestions using ELISA test (72.2% and 95%, respectively), whereas the LFIA test showed less sensitivity (22.2% and 80%, respectively). GIP were detected at higher either frequency or concentration in the range of 12-36 h after 50 mg intake, and 12-84 h after 2 g consumption. Considering this period, diagnostic sensitivity of GIP detection after a single 50 mg ingestion may be significatively increased analyzing three stool samples per individual. High variability among participants was found in the time and amount of GIP excretion; however, some individuals showed common patterns for both gluten intakes. CONCLUSION: Sporadic gluten exposure detection may require several fecal samples to achieve level of sensitivity above 90%. Interindividual variability in the dynamic of GIP excretion may suggest patterns of gluten metabolism.
30918433	Gluten immunogenic peptide excretion detects dietary transgressions in treated celiac disease patients.	BACKGROUND: Life-long removal of gluten from the diet is currently the only way to manage celiac disease (CeD). Until now, no objective test has proven useful to objectively detect ingested gluten in clinical practice. Recently, tests that determine consumption of gluten by assessing excretion of gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) in stool and urine have been developed. Their utility, in comparison with conventional dietary and analytical follow-up strategies, has not been fully established. AIM: To assess the performance of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and point-of-care tests (PoCTs) for GIP excretion in CeD patients on gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: We conducted an observational, prospective, cross-sectional study in patients following a GFD for at least two years. Using the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale questionnaire, patients were classified at enrollment as asymptomatic or symptomatic. Gluten consumption was assessed twice by 3-d dietary recall and GIP excretion (by ELISA in stool and PoCTs (commercial kits for stool and urine) in two consecutive samples. These samples and dietary reports were obtained 10 day apart one from the other. Patients were encouraged to follow their usual GFD during the study period. RESULTS: Forty-four patients were enrolled, of which 19 (43.2%) were symptomatic despite being on a GFD. Overall, 83 sets of stool and/or urine samples were collected. Eleven out of 44 patients (25.0%) had at least one positive GIP test. The occurrence of at least one positive test was 32% in asymptomatic patients compared with 15.8% in symptomatic patients. GIP was concordant with dietary reports in 65.9% of cases (Cohen s kappa: 0.317). PoCT detected dietary indiscretions. Both ELISA and PoCT in stool were concordant (concomitantly positive or negative) in 67 out of 74 (90.5%) samples. Excretion of GIP was detected in 7 (8.4%) stool and/or urine samples from patients considered to be strictly compliant with the GFD by dietary reports. CONCLUSION: GIP detects dietary transgressions in patients on long-term GFD, irrespective of the presence of symptoms. PoCT for GIP detection constitutes a simple home-based method for self-assessment of dietary indiscretions.
34091620	The impact of a gluten-free diet on the growth pattern of Saudi children with coeliac disease.	OBJECTIVE: To assess the growth pattern of children with coeliac disease after the introduction of a gluten-free diet. METHOD: The retrospective study was conducted at King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and comprised data from January 2015 to December 2018 of children aged 2-16 years with biopsy-proven coeliac disease. Serial measurements of height-for-age and weight-for-age z-scores were recorded at 0, 4, 8, 12 and 16 months. Data on insulin-like growth factor-1 and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 obtained at diagnosis and during follow-up was retrieved. Clinical, demographic, and laboratory data was extracted from the patients' medical files. Data was analysed using SPSS 22. RESULTS: Of the 47 patients, 25(53.2%) were boys and 22(46.8%) were girls. The overall mean age was 8.7+-3.4 years. There was a significant time effect for weight-for-age and height-for-age z-scores (p<0.001). There was significant increase in the secretion of insulin-like growth factor-1 and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (p<0.05) during the first 8 months of a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of gluten-free diet for Saudi children with coeliac disease normalized growth parameters and improved the endogenous secretion of growth factors.

30561392	Peripheral neuropathy and gastroenterologic disorders: an overview on an underrecognized association.	BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE WORK: Although peripheral neuropathies in children are often of genetic origin, acquired causes should be carefully looked for and ruled out also in the pediatric age. Gastroenterological disorders can be complicated by peripheral neuropathy as a result of micronutrients deficiency, drug toxicity or because of shared pathophysiological mechanisms. METHODS: In this descriptive review we sought to give an overview on the most relevant clinical conditions in which peripheral neuropathies are associated with gastro-intestinal disorders or symptoms. RESULTS: We describe the clinical, demographic, and electrophysiological features of peripheral neuropathy in three main clinical scenarios: in the context of common gastroenterological disorders (inflammatory bowel and celiac disease), in the context of micronutrients deficiencies arising from malabsorption irrespective of etiology, and in a rare degenerative mitochondrial disorder, mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE) disorder. CONCLUSIONS: The association between gastrointestinal and peripheral nervous system symptoms is probably still underrecognized but has to be actively sought, in order to provide prompt diagnosis resulting in optimal care and long-term management with the aim to improve quality of life and, at least in some conditions, try to impact on prognosis.
35916816	The prevalence of celiac disease and the appropriateness of the diagnosis in family medicine setting could be lower than expected.	OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of celiac disease (CD) and the appropriateness of this diagnosis in the family medicine setting in Italy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The electronic databases of 16 general practitioners working in Rome (Italy) were analyzed. The prevalence of CD according to the Italian pathology identification code issued by the Italian National Health System was assessed. In addition, patients registered as having celiac disease without being assigned a pathology identification code were interviewed. RESULTS: Overall, a population of 22,064 patients was analyzed. 91 patients had a diagnosis of CD (0.41%), 60 of whom had a pathology identification code (0.27%), and 31 did not (0.14%). 29 of these patients were interviewed, 16 (17.58% of the CD recorded patients) of whom reported being on a gluten-free or gluten restricted diet, with reported improvement in their clinical symptoms. Half of them further stated that they would not agree to resume a restriction free diet in order to make a definitive CD diagnosis, due to the risk of symptom recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: In a family medicine setting, the prevalence of CD seems to be lower than expected, and one third of patients diagnosed with CD do not fulfill all diagnostic criteria. Any effort to improve the diagnostic work-up for CD should also be made in this setting.
32711513	Health-related quality of life using specific and generic questionnaires in Spanish coeliac children.	BACKGROUND: We aimed to compare the perception of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and related factors in Spanish coeliac children and their parents, using two questionnaires, the generic KIDSCREEN-52 and the specific the Celiac Disease DUX (CDDUX), and to assess the correlation between them. METHODS: Coeliac children, aged 8-18, who are members of the Madrid Coeliac Association (MCA) and their parents, answered the Spanish version of the CDDUX and KIDSCREEN-52 questionnaires via e-mail. CDDUX was answered by 266 children and 428 parents and KIDSCREEN-52 by 255 children and 387 parents. Linear regression models were fitted to evaluate the association of demographic and clinical factors with HRQOL scores. CDDUX scores were compared with the subjective perception of health status assessed by the first question of KIDSCREEN-52. The correlation between the questionnaires was analysed. RESULTS: We found that the main factors that negatively affected HRQOL were having social or economic difficulties associated with following the diet and having transgression-related symptoms. The maximum correlation between the questionnaires was 0.309 and - 0.254 in parents and children respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is a poor correlation between the two questionnaires, both agreed that the main concerns of the respondents were related to the social and economic difficulties of following the diet. It would be interesting to use both types of questionnaires in order to perform a more complete assessment of HRQOL in coeliac children. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Not applicable.
31619632	Gluten-Free Rice Breading Using Composited Rice Flour and Pre-Germinated Brown Rice Flour for Health Benefits.	Gluten-free rice breading (RB) is generally prepared by shredding of gluten-free rice bread. It is an alternative product for Celiac patients, who are gluten allergic. The aim of this research was to formulate gluten-free rice bread formula by using composited rice flour (RF) and pre-germinated brown rice flour (PGBRF) from two Thai rice cultivars, Pathum-Thani1 (15% amylose) and Phitsanulok2 (27% amylose) at the ratio of 1:1, by considering the structural properties of bread, health benefit of breading, and the properties of breading as coating material of fried frozen croquette (C-) and compared to those of samples prepared from wheat flour. Increasing PGBRF from 0% to 50% in gluten-free rice bread formula increased the puffed cell wall of air cell in gluten-free rice bread. Antioxidative activity of RB containing 50% PGBRF (RB-50%) was 4 and 9 times higher than RB without PGBRF (RB-0%) and wheat breading (WB), respectively. WB contained 356,289 mg/kg of gluten, while RB contained less than 2 mg/kg of gluten, which could be labeled "gluten-free". When compared all breading samples as coating material of C-, oil absorption of C-RB-50% (14.32%) was 3 times lower than that of WB (44.36%). Therefore, the RB-50% had health benefits for consumers who are suffered from Celiac disease and also other health-conscious consumers considering the higher antioxidative properties and lower oil uptake than the consumption of WB.

30043079	Plasma profile and urine excretion of amino acids in children with celiac disease on gluten-free diet after oligofructose-enriched inulin intervention: results of a randomised placebo-controlled pilot study.	The circulating amino acid (AAs) concentrations are indicators of dietary protein intake and metabolic status. In celiac disease (CD), the AA imbalance is frequently observed. Prebiotics are found to alleviate nutrient deficiencies. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyse the impact of oligrofructose-enriched inulin (Synergy 1), administered for 3 months as a gluten-free diet (GFD) supplement to children with CD, on the plasma and urine concentrations of AAs. CD children (N = 34) were randomised into two groups, receiving Synergy 1 (10 g/day) or placebo (maltodextrin) for 3 months. The AA profile and concentration was determined in plasma and urine before and after the dietary intervention by gas chromatography. 22 and 28 AAs were determined in plasma and urine samples, respectively. After the intervention, the plasma concentrations of several AAs (Ala, Pro, Asn, Glu, Tyr, Lys, His, Orn) increased significantly in both experimental groups, while Gln increased only in the Synergy 1 group. The urinary excretion of Asn, Lys and Aaa increased significantly in the Synergy 1 group, and the excretion of Asp and Met decreased (p < 0.05) in the placebo group. The Gln:Glu ratio in urine increased in both groups after the intervention. An increased urinary excretion of AAs observed in Synergy 1 group with a simultaneous increase in the content of circulating AAs could be attributed to higher absorption or intensified metabolism of AAs, and on the other hand further healing of the intestinal mucosa being the result of continuous treatment with GFD. Moreover, the observed changes in Glu concentration suggest that oligofructose-enriched inulin could improve the intestinal condition and permeability. To conclude, a prebiotic-supplemented GFD influences beneficially the overall AAs metabolism in CD children; however, further prospective cohort studies are needed to confirm the results obtained.
32314256	Celiac Disease and Obesity: Is Bariatric Surgery an Option?	Celiac disease is an immune-mediated enteropathy associated with malabsorptive syndrome and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies. Celiac disease affects 1% of individuals but is largely underdiagnosed, as its multifaceted clinical presentations create challenging diagnostic scenarios. With the rise of the obesity epidemic, doctors are increasingly seeing celiac disease patients with overweight or obesity, which raises the question of bariatric surgery. However, few studies so far have investigated bariatric surgery in this patient population. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the literature on celiac disease, its nutritional consequences and complications, and we discuss the possible impact of bariatric surgery on weight loss, nutritional deficiencies, response to gluten-free diet, and long-term post-operative complications. We also review the effect of bariatric surgery on the incidence of celiac disease.
38674808	Intraepithelial Lymphogram in the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease in Adult Patients: A Validation Cohort.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is a gluten-related pathology, highly prevalent and heterogeneous in its clinical presentation, which leads to delays in diagnosis and misdiagnosis. The analysis of duodenal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) by flow cytometry (lymphogram) is emerging as a discriminative tool in the diagnosis of various forms of celiac disease (CD). AIMS: The aim of this study was to validate IEL lymphogram performance in the largest adult series to our knowledge, in support of its use as a diagnostic tool and as a biomarker of the dynamic celiac process. METHODS: This was a retrospective study including 768 adult patients (217 with active CD, 195 on a gluten-free diet, 15 potential CD patients, and 411 non-celiac controls). The IEL subset cut-off values were established to calculate the diagnostic accuracy of the lymphogram. RESULTS: A complete celiac lymphogram profile (>=14% increase in T cell receptor [TCR]gammadelta IELs and simultaneous <=4% decrease in surface-negative CD3 [sCD3-] IELs) was strongly associated with active and potential forms in over 80% of the confirmed patients with CD, whereas the remaining patients with CD had partial lymphogram profiles (>=14% increase in TCRgammadelta or <=4% decrease in sCD3- IELs), with lower diagnostic certainty. None of these patients had a non-celiac lymphogram. Quantifying the TCRgammadelta versus sCD3- imbalance as a ratio (>=5) is a discriminative index to discard or suspect CD at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: We have validated the IEL lymphogram's diagnostic efficiency (79% sensitivity, 98% specificity), with an LR+ accuracy of 36.2. As expected, the increase in TCRgammadelta IELs is a reliable marker for celiac enteropathy, while changes in sCD3- IEL levels throughout the dynamic CD process are useful biomarkers of mucosal lesions.
32157915	Serum IL-21 levels from celiac disease patients correlates with anti-tTG IgA autoantibodies and mucosal damage.	Objectives: Coeliac disease is a multifactorial disorder influenced by environmental, genetic and immunological factors. Interleukin (IL)-21 has been linked to an increase disease risk and the serum level of IL-21 seems to be increased in CD compared to a healthy control population.Methods: Sera were collected from 160 CD patients, 120 untreated and 40 following a gluten-free diet, and form 45 healthy subjects. Serum IL-21 was evaluated by specific ELISA tests.Results: Our data show that patients with untreated CD display IL-21 concentrations significantly higher than both treated-CD patients (following a gluten-free diet) and controls. In addition, serum IL-21 correlates with serum titres of anti-tTG IgA autoantibodies. Finally, our results show a correlation of this cytokine with duodenal mucosal damage.Conclusions: A role of gluten, as antigen with stimulatory function on IL-21 production, seems to be confirmed by the longitudinal analyses showing that the gluten-free diet decreases to a nearly undetectable amount this cytokine. In addition, the finding of a positive correlation between the serum amount of IL-21 and the grade of duodenal mucosa damage suggests a strong immunomodulatory effect of this cytokine on cytotoxic T lymphocyte functions. This study provides an extra evidence to emerging data on the potential role IL-21 in CD pathogenesis, suggesting its involvement in the development and progression of CD. Significance statement: In untreated CD, serum IL-21 shows higher levels compared with treated CD and healthy subjects. Serum amounts of IL-21 correlate with anti-tTG IgA autoantibodies and with duodenal mucosa damage.
33923097	Mycotoxin Occurrence and Risk Assessment in Gluten-Free Pasta through UHPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap MS.	Celiac disease (CD) is a genetic-based autoimmune disorder which is characterized by inflammation in the small intestinal mucosa due to the intolerance to gluten. Celiac people should consume products without gluten, which are elaborated mainly with maize or other cereals. Contamination of cereals with mycotoxins, such as fumonisins (FBs) and aflatoxins (AFs) is frequently reported worldwide. Therefore, food ingestion is the main source of mycotoxin exposure. A new analytical method was developed and validated for simultaneous analysis of 21 mycotoxins in gluten-free pasta, commonly consumed by celiac population as an alternative to conventional pasta. Ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap MS) was used for analyte separation and detection. The mycotoxins included in this work were those widely reported to occur in cereal samples, namely, ochratoxin-A (OTA), aflatoxins (AFB1, AFB2, AFG1 and AFG2), zearalenone (ZON), deoxynivalenol (DON), 3-acetyl-deoxynivalenol and 15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (3-AcDON and 15-AcDON, respectively), nivalenol (NIV), neosolaniol (NEO), fusarenone-X, (FUS-X), T-2 toxin (T-2) and HT-2 toxin (HT-2), fumonisin B1 and B2 (FB1 and FB2, respectively), enniatins (ENN A, ENN A1, ENN B and ENN B1) and beauvericin (BEA). The validated method was successfully applied to 84 gluten-free pasta samples collected from several local markets of Campania region (Italy) during September to November 2020 to monitor the occurrence of mycotoxins and to assess the exposure to these food contaminants. A significant number of samples (95%) showed mycotoxin contamination, being Fusarium mycotoxins (FB1, ZON and DON) the most commonly detected ones. Regarding the risk assessment, the higher exposures were obtained for NIV, DON and FB1 for children and teenagers age group which can be explained due to their lower body weight.
36943204	Sorghum (Sorghum vulgare): an ancient grain, a novel choice for a healthy gluten-free diet.	Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease related to gluten consumption. To date, the only effective therapy that can reverse symptoms and prevent complications is the gluten-free diet (GFD), which is challenging to maintain and has potential health risks. Identifying foods that can help diversify the GFD and that best match the nutritional needs of people with CD may improve the health and quality of life of celiac patients. This review, conducted through a non-systematic search of the available literature, aims to gather the most recent research on nutritional issues in CD and GFD. Moreover, it highlights how sorghum characteristics could provide health benefits to CD patients that counteract the nutritional problems due to CD and the nutritional consequences of GFD acceptance. Sorghum contains a wide variety of bioactive compounds, such as flavones and tannins, that have shown anti-inflammatory activity in preclinical studies. They can also regulate blood sugar levels and lower cholesterol to reduce the effects of common chronic diseases such as metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Because it is gluten-free, its use in making foods for celiac patients is increasing, especially in the United States. In conclusion, sorghum is a fascinating grain with nutritional properties and health benefits for supplementing GFD. However, only one study confirms the short-term safety of sorghum inclusion in the GFD, and further long-term studies with a large sample are needed.
31912484	Small bowel adenocarcinoma: Results from a nationwide prospective ARCAD-NADEGE cohort study of 347 patients.	Small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA) is a rare tumour. We conducted a prospective cohort to describe the prevalence, survival and prognostic factors in unselected SBA patients. The study enrolled patients with all stages of newly diagnosed or recurrent SBA at 74 French centres between January 2009 and December 2012. In total, 347 patients were analysed; the median age was 63 years (range 23-90). The primary tumour was in the duodenum (60.6%), jejunum (20.7%) and ileum (18.7%). The prevalence of predisposing disease was 8.7%, 6.9%, 1.7%, 1.7% and 0.6% for Crohn disease, Lynch syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, celiac disease and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, respectively. At diagnosis, 58.9%, 5.5% and 35.6% of patients had localised and resectable, locally advanced unresectable and metastatic disease, respectively. Crohn disease was significantly associated with younger age, poor differentiation and ileum location, whereas Lynch syndrome with younger age, poor differentiation, early stage and duodenum location. Adjuvant chemotherapy (oxaliplatin-based in 89.9%) was performed in 61.5% of patients with locally resected tumours. With a 54-months median follow-up, the 5-year overall survival (OS) was 87.9%, 78.2% and 55.5% in Stages I, II and III, respectively. The median OS of patients with Stage IV was 12.7 months. In patients with resected tumours, poor differentiation (p = 0.047) and T4 stage (p = 0.001) were associated with a higher risk of death. In conclusion, our study showed that the prognosis of advanced SBA remains poor. Tumour characteristics differed according to predisposing disease. In SBA-resected tumours, the prognostic factors for OS were grade and T stage.
35635630	Impact of Celiac Disease on Dating.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: When seeking a romantic partner, individuals with celiac disease (CD) must navigate challenging social situations. We aimed to investigate dating-related behaviors in adults with CD. METHODS: A total of 11,884 affiliates of the Celiac Disease Center at Columbia University were invited to participate in an online survey. Adults (>= 18 years) with biopsy-diagnosed CD were included. Among the 5,249 who opened the email, 538 fully completed the survey (10.2%). The survey included a CD-specific dating attitudes/behaviors questionnaire, a Social Anxiety Questionnaire (SAQ), a CD-specific quality of life instrument (CD-QOL), and a CD Food Attitudes and Behaviors scale (CD-FAB). RESULTS: Respondents were primarily female (86.8%) and the plurality (24.4%) was in the 23-35 year age range. 44.3% had dated with CD, and among them, 68.4% reported that CD had a major/moderate impact on their dating life. A major/moderate impact was more commonly reported among females (69.3%, p  < 0.001), 23-35-year-olds (77.7%, p = 0.015), those with a household income < $50 K (81.7%, p = 0.019), and those with a lower CD-QOL score (50.5 vs. 73.4, p = 0.002). While on dates, 39.3% were uncomfortable explaining precautions to waiters, 28.2% engaged in riskier eating behaviors, and 7.5% intentionally consumed gluten. 39.0% of all participants were hesitant to kiss their partner because of CD; females more so than males (41.1% vs. 22.7%, p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of participants felt that CD had a major/moderate impact on their dating life. This impact may result in hesitation toward dating and kissing, decreased QOL, greater social anxiety, and less adaptive eating attitudes and behaviors. CD and the need to adhere to a gluten free diet have a major impact on dating and intimacy.
31599434	Celiac disease in the context of airborne allergen-associated chronic vulvo-vaginitis.	We present a woman with a three-year history of severe chronic urticaria and recurrent vulvo-vaginal Candidiasis in the setting of seasonal allergic rhinitis. Her past medical history was significant only for Bell's palsy in her childhood. Her review of systems was otherwise negative (specifically: no history of diarrhea, weight loss, malabsorption, anemia, nor eczema). Extensive testing revealed seasonal sensitivities to outdoor allergens and celiac disease. Repeating the evaluation six months after initiating a wheat-free diet, her vulvo-vaginal symptoms resolved.
30021413	Celiac disease in children.	Celiac disease is a common immune-mediated disease, that may present, after gluten ingestion, with various and heterogeneous symptoms that can vary according to patients' age. The diagnostic screening test is serum anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA level. In doubt cases, antiendomysium IgA and the antideamidated gliadin peptides IgG could be useful to confirm the suspicion, before a biopsy will be perform. Since 2012, guidelines have made it possible to avoid the biopsy in symptomatic pediatric patients with high levels of antitransglutaminase IgA, positivity to antiendomysium IgA, and with HLA DQ2 or DQ8. In all other cases duodenal biopsy is still mandatory to confirm the diagnosis. The therapy of celiac disease is a lifelong gluten free diet. In children prognosis of celiac disease is good, without complications. Here we review and discuss the present literature about celiac disease in childhood.
32295433	Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and Celiac disease - coincidence or causation?	
36806628	Increased Risk of Hospitalization in Celiac Disease With COVID-19 Infection Is Mitigated by Vaccination.	BACKGROUND: We sought to describe clinical characteristics of celiac disease (CD) patients infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and estimate hospitalization risk, intensive care unit (ICU) requirement, mortality, and thrombosis, and the impact of vaccination on these outcomes. METHODS: We performed a single-center, retrospective cohort study comparing biopsy-proven CD patients with a matched sample of non-CD (referent) patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 2020 and January 2022. Matching ensured 2 referent patients for every 1 CD patient by age, sex, ethnicity, and COVID-19 diagnosis date. We also adjusted for general and celiac-specific comorbidity. The primary outcome was hospitalization. Secondary outcomes included ICU requirement, mortality, and thrombosis. We also compared these outcomes between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. RESULTS: We included 330 patients: 110 with CD (mean age 47 years, 83% female) and 220 matched referents. Hospitalization occurred in 27 CD patients (24%) and 25 referent patients (11%) (hazard ratio, 2.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.21-3.65; P = .009). Vaccination was associated with significantly decreased risk of hospitalization (hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.31-0.93; P = .026). Four unvaccinated CD patients and 2 unvaccinated referent patients required ICU. No mortality occurred among CD patients, and 2 referent patients died. No thrombosis occurred in either group. CONCLUSIONS: CD patients with COVID-19 have a higher risk of hospitalization compared with non-CD referents. This risk is mitigated by vaccination in CD patients as it is in non-CD referents. ICU requirement occurred only in unvaccinated CD patients, and no CD patient died. Vaccination against COVID-19 should be strongly recommended in patients with CD as it is for non-CD patients in the general population.
32011187	Progress in the serology-based diagnosis and management of adult celiac disease.	Introduction: This article provides a comprehensive overview of the development and application of serological tests used routinely in clinical practice for the diagnosis and management of adult celiac disease.Areas covered: We summarize existing scientific literature related to anti-endomyseal, anti-tissue transglutaminase, and anti-deamidated gliadin peptide antibodies and detail the current and potential future applications of these tests in celiac disease.Expert commentary: Current serological tests in celiac disease have some of the best performance characteristics among disease-specific tests. However, in adult celiac disease, current diagnostic algorithms still rely on duodenal biopsies to confirm the diagnosis. A 'biopsy avoidance strategy' has been implemented in pediatric celiac disease. Future high-quality studies will help inform on whether this approach can be implemented into adult gastroenterology services. It is envisaged that the next 5 years will see an increasing reliance on serology in the diagnosis of adult celiac disease.
29847393	The Experience of Living With a Gluten-Free Diet: An Integrative Review.	Celiac disease represents a problem in our society, not only because of its interest in terms of healthcare, but also because of its increasing prevalence in recent years and the impact it has on sufferers and their families. This integrative review investigated current knowledge about the experience of living with a gluten-free diet, as well as social support and the role played by nurses and/or associations in the process. A total of 18 articles were selected. Results revealed greater family support is needed to deal with the day-to-day issues of a gluten-free diet. Furthermore, women diagnosed with celiac disease have more psychological distress than men according to some studies. Sufferers of celiac disease report that more information is needed at all levels (hotel and catering, healthcare, social), which would help generate coping strategies. The few studies retrieved that talk about this topic show that following a gluten-free diet affects the personal, family, emotional, social, and financial dimensions of sufferers of celiac disease. The nurse tends to be the person whom those coping with the illness go to for support, although celiac disease associations are also a fundamental pillar in this support. Policy makers need to adapt health services to the needs of individuals with celiac disease.
34622826	Manipulation of the gut microbiome in gluten-intolerance.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Gluten is a complex mixture of highly immunogenic glutamine- and proline-rich proteins found in some cereals. In celiac disease (CeD), gluten triggers an autoimmune response due to its interaction with the human leukocyte antigen heterodimers that confer the genetic risk. The involvement of gluten in other disorders has also been investigated, but its role beyond CeD is still unclear. Here, we review the most recent evidence of the involvement of gluten in diseases and the opportunities of manipulating the gut microbiota to treat or prevent gluten-related conditions. RECENT FINDINGS: Most of the new studies have been conducted in the context of CeD, where important evidence has been gained on associations between the gut microbiota, genotype, and environmental factors such as breastfeeding and antibiotics. The role of the microbiota has been investigated in several prospective, observational and interventional studies with probiotics, which together showed that the gut microbiota could be targeted to ameliorate and aid in the prevention of CeD development. SUMMARY: Several studies have evidenced how genetic and environmental factors influence the gut microbiome with consequences in CeD. These findings could inspire the development of microbiota modulation strategies to support the prevention or treatment of CeD.
30540725	[Anti-transglutaminase antibody in adults with celiac disease and their relation to the presence and duration of gluten-free diet].	IgA anti-transglutaminase 2 (tTG2) antibody is a relevant marker in celiac disease. The utility of IgA anti-tTG2 determination is well established for the diagnosis, however their use in the follow-up of patients with gluten free diet (GFD) it is not fully established. OBJECTIVE: To determine IgA anti-tTG2 antibody levels in adult Paraguayan celiac disease patients and its relation to the presence and duration of the GFD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult celiac disease patients without (n=23) or with (n=49) GFD were included in this observational, descriptive, cross-sectional study with analytical component. IgA anti-tTG2 antibody serum levels were analyzed by ELISA. RESULTS: All (100%) celiac disease patients without GFD had positive anti-tTG2 IgA. Serum levels of IgA anti-tTG2 were significantly elevated in celiac disease patients without GFD compared to levels in patients with GFD. 35% of patients treated with GFD (diet average duration = 5.7 years) had positive (29%) or indeterminate (6%) levels of IgA anti-tTG2. In terms of GFD duration we observed that while the GFD period increased, antibody levels decreased (r=- 0.2963; p=0.0387). CONCLUSION: IgA anti-tTG2 antibody levels correlated inversely with the GFD duration. However, positive levels of these antibodies persisted in some patients, even several years after the onset of GFD.
34375376	Probiotic Use in Celiac Disease: Results from a National Survey.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Patients with celiac disease (CD) commonly use supplements for perceived health benefits despite scant evidence. We aimed to characterize the prevalence and predictors of probiotic use among CD patients. METHODS: We analyzed data from iCureCeliac ; a patient-powered research network questionnaire distributed by the Celiac Disease Foundation. We included adults with self-reported CD who answered questions regarding demographics, diagnosis, symptoms, and treatment. We compared probiotic users versus probiotic non-users and subsequently performed multivariable logistic regression, assessing for independent predictors of probiotic use. RESULTS: 4,909 patients met the criteria for inclusion in the study. Of these, 1,160 (23.6%) responded to a question regarding probiotic use. The mean age of participants was 38.8 years and 82% were female. 381 patients (33%) reported using probiotics. More probiotic users sought nutritional counseling at time of diagnosis (36% vs. 30%, p=0.05) and remained symptomatic despite a gluten-free diet (40% vs. 25%, p <0.001). Probiotic users had lower scores on the pain subscale of the SF36 (63.7+-21.6 vs. 69.5+-22.1, p=0.006). On multivariable analysis, patients diagnosed after age 50 (OR=2.04, 95%CI: 1.37-3.04), and those with persistent symptoms despite a gluten-free diet (OR=1.94, 95%CI: 1.44-2.63) were more likely to use probiotics. CONCLUSION: In this large study of a national CD registry, roughly one-third of CD patients reported using probiotics. Patients diagnosed later in life were more likely to use probiotics and those who remained symptomatic despite a gluten-free diet were twice as likely to take probiotics. Patients may be seeking additional means of treatment for persistent symptoms.
34274255	Antitissue transglutaminase antibodies' normalization after starting a gluten-free diet in a large population of celiac children-a real-life experience.	INTRODUCTION: Few data are available regarding the trend of IgA anti-transglutaminase antibodies (TGA-IgA) in children with celiac disease (CD) on a gluten-free diet (GFD). Our aim is to examine the normalization time of CD serology in a large pediatric population, and its predictors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the normalization time of TGA-IgA and its predictive factors (age, sex, ethnicity, symptoms, associated diabetes/thyroiditis, Marsh stage, TGA-IgA and endomysial antibody levels at diagnosis, diet adherence), in 1024 children diagnosed from 2000 to 2019 in three pediatric Italian centers, on a GFD. RESULTS: TGA-IgA remission was reached in 67,3%, 80,7%, 89,8% and 94,9% after 12, 18, 24 and 36 months from starting a GFD, respectively (median time = 9 months). TGA-IgA >10 upper limit of normal at diagnosis (HR = 0.56), age 7-12 years old (HR = 0.83), poor compliance to diet (HR = 0.69), female sex (HR = 0.82), non-Caucasian ethnicity (HR = 0.75), and comorbidities (HR = 0.72) were independent factors significantly associated with longer time to normalization. CONCLUSIONS: Our population is the largest in the literature, with the majority of patients normalizing CD serology within 24 months from starting a GFD. We suggest a special attention to patients with comorbidities, language barriers or age 7-12 years for a proper management and follow-up.
34510390	"The Gluten-Free Diet and Its Relationship with Metabolic Syndrome: Dietary Friend or Foe?"	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Celiac disease (CD) is a prevalent digestive illness as well as a budding area of research in the field of gastroenterology. While investigations are underway to find new and improved pharmacological therapies for CD, the gluten-free diet (GFD) remains the only option to effectively manage the condition. RECENT FINDINGS: While the GFD is recommended for patients diagnosed with CD and other gluten-related conditions, studies show the number of individuals on the GFD surpasses the projected number of patients with these medical indications (1). The implications of widespread adoption of this dietary approach are still being determined, with many patients believing this diet will improve overall health and cardiovascular risk. This review analyzes the relationship between a GFD and metabolic syndrome in both non-celiac and celiac patients, concluding that although the diet may slightly improve overall cardiac risk factors, weight, and/or insulin resistance, its use in the absence of a gluten-related disorder is controversial.
31581546	Nutritional Status in Spanish Children and Adolescents with Celiac Disease on a Gluten Free Diet Compared to Non-Celiac Disease Controls.	Patients who follow a gluten-free diet (GFD) may be prone to nutritional deficiencies, due to food restriction and consumption of gluten-free products. The aim was to assess nutritional status in celiac children and adolescents on a long-term GFD. A cross-sectional age and gender-matched study in 70 celiac and 67 non-celiac volunteers was conducted, using dietary, anthropometric, biochemical parameters, and assessing bone mineral density and physical activity. Adequacy of vitamin D intake to recommendations was very low, in both groups, and intakes for calcium and magnesium were significantly lower in celiac volunteers. Celiac children and adolescents may have a higher risk of iron and folate deficiencies. Both groups followed a high-lipid, high-protein, low fiber diet. Median vitamin D plasma levels fell below reference values, in celiac and non-celiac participants, and were significantly lower in celiac girls. Other biochemical parameters were within normal ranges. Anthropometry and bone mineral density were similar within groups. With the exception of some slightly lower intakes, children and adolescents following a GFD appear to follow the same trends as healthy individuals on a normal diet. No effect of food restriction or gluten-free product consumption was observed.
37764795	The Gluten-Free Diet for Celiac Disease: Critical Insights to Better Understand Clinical Outcomes.	The gluten-free diet (GFD) remains a complex paradigm in managing celiac disease (CeD) in children and adults, and there are many reasons why GFD adherence should be strict to improve outcomes. However, this is a challenging task for patients, since they need to have access to quality healthcare resources that facilitate optimal GFD adherence. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the GFD, tackling coexisting nutritional deficiencies, and dealing with complex situations, such as seronegative CeD or non-responsive CeD, all require the involvement of a multidisciplinary team. The short- and long-term follow-up of CeD patients should preferably be performed by a combined Gastroenterology and Nutrition service with well-defined quality standards and the multidisciplinary involvement of physicians, nurses, dietitians, and psychologists. Nutritional advice and counseling by an experienced dietitian can reduce the costs associated with long-term follow-up of CeD patients. Likewise, psychological interventions may be essential in specific scenarios where implementing and sustaining a lifelong GFD can cause a significant psychological burden for patients. This manuscript aims to provide guidelines to improve clinical practice in the follow-up and monitoring of CeD patients and provide information on the nutritional risks of an ill-advised GFD. Clinicians, biochemists, food technologists, dietitians, and psychologists with a global view of the disease have been involved in its writing.
33743925	Indications, Contraindications, and Considerations for Video Capsule Endoscopy.	Video capsule endoscopy is indicated in a broad range of clinical settings, most commonly in evaluating suspected small bowel bleeding. It is also useful in diagnosing Crohn's disease and monitoring patients with known Crohn's. Video capsule endoscopy has a role in evaluating patients with refractory celiac disease symptoms and in surveying patients with polyposis syndromes. The only absolute contraindication to video capsule endoscopy is luminal gastrointestinal tract obstruction. Despite manufacturer statement, video capsule endoscopy can be used safely in patients with implantable cardiac devices including pacemakers, defibrillators, and ventricular assist devices.
29782665	Dietitian visits were a safe and cost-effective form of follow-up care for children with celiac disease.	AIM: This study compared follow-up protocols for paediatric celiac disease (CD) led by either paediatricians or dietitians at Swedish university hospitals. METHODS: We followed 363 CD patients under 18 years at the university hospitals in Malmo (n = 140) and Lund (n = 79) between 2011 and 2013 and after they merged to become Skane (n = 144) between 2014 and 2016. Both Lund and Malmo provided regular paediatrician follow-up visits, whereas Skane provided mainly dietitian-led visits. RESULTS: Children at Lund were followed for a mean of 1.0 +- 0.5 visits per year, compared to 0.7 +- 0.6 at Malmo (p < 0.0001) and 0.9 +- 0.6 at Skane (p = 0.11). The ratio of annual paediatrician to dietitian annual visits was 1.4:1.0 at Lund, which was higher than Malmo (0.9:1.0; p = 0.0017) and Skane (0.6:1.0; p < 0.0001). There was no difference in the prevalence of non-compliant patients between the clinics (p = 0.26, Malmo 13.6%, Lund 10.1%, Skane 7.6%). Tissue transglutaminase autoantibody levels reversed equally over time at all three clinics after the subjects started a gluten-free diet (r = -0.55, p < 0.0001). The total mean annual cost per patient was lowest at Malmo and highest at Lund (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Dietary compliance was similar regardless of whether care was provided by a dietitian or paediatrician. Dietitian-led follow-up visits may provide lower long-term costs.
30897589	Identifying True Celiac Disease and Wheat Allergy in the Era of Fashion Driven Gluten-Free Diets.	BACKGROUND: Diagnosing both celiac disease (CD) and wheat allergy (WA) might be challenging due to the increasingly popular gluten-free diets. OBJECTIVES: This study investigates the value of anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA (tTGIgA) and wheat-specific IgE (WIgE), and identifies clinical and serological features associated with CD and WA. METHOD: Serological markers of autoimmunity and allergy along with medical charts of patients assessed for tTGIgA and WIgE between 2010 and 2016 were evaluated. RESULTS: During the last years, an increasing number of patients have been tested for tTGIgA, while the number of positive results decreased linearly. Among the 2,965 patients included, 128 patients showed at least once a positive tTGIgA. All patients with tTGIgA levels higher than the 12-fold upper normal limit had CD. The ratio of tTGIgA/total IgA did not perform better as a diagnostic test for CD compared to tTGIgA. tTGIgA and anti-nuclear antibodies were significantly associated. WA was only rarely investigated, particularly in adults. However, positive WIgE were found in nearly 50% of the cases. WIgE and tTGIgA values were negatively correlated. CONCLUSIONS: tTGIgA were increasingly tested, while the rate of positive results decreased in recent years, possibly reflecting the impact of current alimentary trends on clinical practice. Associated autoimmune disease was frequently found in CD. High levels of tTGIgA accurately predicted CD diagnosis. WA was rarely investigated and deserves more attention, in particular in children with atopic background. WA does not seem to be associated with CD.
31905394	Celiac Disease.	Gluten-related disorders, including celiac disease, wheat allergy, and nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), are increasingly reported worldwide. Celiac disease is caused by an immune-mediated reaction to ingested gluten in genetically susceptible persons. NCGS is largely a diagnosis of exclusion when other causes of symptoms have been ruled out. All patients with celiac disease should be referred to a registered dietitian nutritionist with expertise in celiac disease and a gastroenterologist who specializes in celiac disease and malabsorptive disorders, and they should remain on a strict gluten-free diet indefinitely. This article provides an overview of gluten- and wheat-related disorders.
33767095	Persisting Villous Atrophy and Adherence in Celiac Disease: What Does the Patient Want? What Should a Clinician Advise?	ABSTRACT: Adherence to a gluten-free diet in celiac disease remains challenging. Clinicians may view mucosal healing as crucial. From the patient's perspective, avoidance of an invasive upper endoscopy may be desirable. A fundamental misconception is that noninvasive tools including symptoms, serology, dietary adherence questionnaires, and novel gluten immunogenic peptides may detect ongoing villous atrophy rather than assess adherence. Duodenal biopsies are the only reliable method for assessment of mucosal healing-however, we as clinicians should provide patients with the uncertainties of this approach allowing them to make an informed decision on an individual basis.
31094177	Celiac disease associated with ulcerative colitis.	The article provides clinical observation of a patient who was diagnosed with celiac disease when he was 52 years (Marsh stage IIIB). Following gluten-free diet (GFD) clinical remission and restoration of small intestinal mucosa (SIM) structure occurred, however in 6 years ulcerative colitis developed and an impairment of SIM morphological structure was identified (Marsh stage IIIA). Ulcerative colitis and celiac disease remission is supported by GFD, anti-cytokine therapy (adalimumab) in combination with mesalazine.
31422546	The evolution of celiac disease publications: a holistic approach with bibliometric analysis.	BACKGROUND: Despite the increasing number of publications on celiac disease, there is a lack of studies that made a holistic bibliometric evaluation of the studies on this topic. AIMS: The purpose of this study is to analyze the publications about celiac disease by using bibliometric methods and this way to demonstrate the celiac disease-related trends, top effective articles, journals, and international collaborations between the countries and institutions. METHODS: All articles published between 1980 and 2018 on celiac disease were downloaded from Web of Science and analyzed with bibliometric methods. The correlations between economic development and publication productivity of the countries were investigated with Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Linear regression analysis was used to estimate the number of publications and citations. RESULTS: The literature review showed that there were 6545 articles about celiac disease published between the years 1980 and 2018. The top productive country that produced most publications about celiac disease was the Italy. The most prolific journals were the Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition and Scandinavian Journal of Gastroenterology. There was a moderate positive significant correlation between the number of publications and gross domestic product (r = 0.639, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the advanced research on the diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment of celiac disease, the global research level about the disease is low. Therefore, the international collaboration about the disease should not remain at only regional contexts; the exchange of knowledge and common studies especially in developing or underdeveloped countries should be supported in terms of prevalence and clinic studies.
34712034	Determination of gluten immunogenic peptides for the management of the treatment adherence of celiac disease: A systematic review.	BACKGROUND: Gluten is a complex mixture of proteins with immunogenic peptide sequences triggering the autoimmune activity in patients with celiac disease (CeD). Gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) are resistant to gastrointestinal digestion and are then excreted via the stool and urine. Most common detection methods applied in the follow-up visits for CeD patients such as serology tests, dietetic interviews, questionnaires, and duodenal biopsy have been proved to be inefficient, invasive, or inaccurate for evaluating gluten-free diet (GFD) compliance. Determination of excreted GIP in stool and urine has been developed as a non-invasive, direct, and specific test for GFD monitoring. AIM: To summarize published literature about the clinical utility of GIP determination in comparison to the tools employed for GFD monitoring. METHODS: PubMed and Web of Science searches were performed using the keywords "gluten immunogenic peptides" or "gluten immunogenic peptide" and a combination of the previous terms with "feces", "stools", "urine", "celiac disease", "gluten-free diet", and "adherence" to identify relevant clinical studies published in English and Spanish between 2012 to January 2021. Reference lists from the articles were reviewed to identify additional pertinent articles. Published articles and abstracts reporting the clinical use of GIP determination in stool and/or urine for the follow-up of patients with CeD in comparison with other tools in use were included. Case reports, commentaries, reviews, conference papers, letters, and publications that did not focus on the aims of this review were excluded. RESULTS: Total of 15 publications were found that involved the use of GIP determination in stool and/or urine to monitor the adherence to the GFD in comparison to other tools. Studies included both children and adults diagnosed with CeD and healthy volunteers. Overall, these preliminary studies indicated that this novel technique was highly sensitive for the detection of GFD transgressions and therefore could facilitate the follow-up of patients with CeD. Tools identified in this work included the CeD-specific serology, dietetic questionnaires, symptomatology, and the duodenal biopsy. Review of the literature revealed that the rates of GFD adherence may vary between 30%-93% using either stool or urine GIP determination, 49%-96% by the serology, 59%-94% using the dietetic questionnaires, 56%-95% by the reported symptoms and 44%-76% with the duodenal biopsy. In addition, the association between the different methods and histological abnormalities (Marsh II-III) was found to be 33%-100% for GIP determination (stool and urine), 25%-39% for CeD-specific serology, 3%-50% for dietetic questionnaires, and 22%-28% for the symptomatology. CONCLUSION: Excreted GIP detection is the precise approach for determining voluntary or involuntary gluten consumption in CeD patients preventing future complications arising from gluten exposure.
33426098	Large-Scale Screening in General Population Children for Celiac Disease with a Multiplex Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) Assay.	BACKGROUND: Autoimmunity Screening for Kids (ASK) study was launched to screen general population children for type 1 diabetes (T1D) and celiac disease (CD). METHODS: A total of 23,319 children from general population were screened. A high throughput multiplex electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assay to screen multiautoantibodies in a single well was applied, parallel with a standard radiobinding assay (RBA). All children with any positive autoantibodies in screening were revisited within one month for confirmation and followed every 6 months. RESULTS: Among 23,319 children, 2.6% (606/23,319) of children were tested positive for TGA. Multiplex ECL assay detected more TGA (584/23,319) in the initial screening than RBA (490/23,319, p = 0.004) and was able to detect TGA earlier than RBA in a subset of children by 0.8 to 34.8 months. Prevalence of TGA by either ECL or RBA in children with islet autoantibodies was found significantly higher than overall prevalence in general population screened. CONCLUSIONS: A multiplex ECL assay was more sensitive than standard RBA by identifying more TGA positivity and detecting TGA earlier in general population screening. It also provides a high efficient tool with its unique advantage of multiplexing measurements to screen for multiple autoimmune diseases simultaneously in general population.
31755642	Cost of chronic inflammatory disease: The impact of eosinophilic esophagitis in Nevada.	OBJECTIVES: The cost of treating the rare eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) disease and its impact on patients' quality of life have not been well documented in the literature. This study seeks to fill this gap by comparing the cost of EoE with other well-known inflammatory diseases, including Crohn's disease (CD) and celiac disease (CeD). METHODS: A Mann-Whitney U test and multiple logistic regression were used to examine the cost of EoE in the state of Nevada across all hospital settings and its impact on quality of life compared with CD and CeD. RESULTS: Several factors were associated with the overall cost of EoE in Nevada, including patients' age, sex and region (P < 0.001). EoE was significantly more expensive to treat in the pediatric group ($4001 EoE; $985 CD; $856 CeD), among men ($2532 EoE; $1500 CD; $1724 CeD), among those residing in the southern region of Nevada ($4501 EoE; $2538 CD; $1888 CeD), and among patients seeking medical care from outpatient clinics ($3298 EoE; $741 CD; $1686 CeD) (P < 0.001). Age, sex, region and hospital setting were all associated with having a positive EoE record compared with CeD or CD (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Data from this study indicate that the EoE burden is significantly higher in cost for certain demographics and regions compared with CD and CeD in the state of Nevada, specifically among pediatric and male patients. These differences suggest that clinicians may encounter similar issues when treating EoE.
30469383	The Relationship between Body Composition and a Gluten Free Diet in Children with Celiac Disease.	The primary and proven therapy, in cases of celiac disease (CD), is a rigorous gluten-free diet (GFD). However, there are reports of its negative effects in the form of nutritional deficiencies, obesity, and adverse changes in body composition. The study aimed to assess the impact of a GFD on the body composition of children with CD. In a case-controlled study (n = 41; mean age 10.81 y; SD = 3.96) children with CD, in various stages of treatment, underwent medical assessment. The control group consisted of healthy children and adolescents, strictly matched for gender and age in a 1:1 case-control manner. More than half of the examined children (n = 26) followed a GFD. CD children had significantly higher mean values of the fat free mass (FFM% = 80.68 vs. 76.66, p = 0.015), and total body water (TBW% = 65.22 vs. 60.47, p = 0.012), and lower mean values of the fat mass (FM% = 19.32 vs. 23.34, p = 0.015). Children who were on a GFD presented slightly higher, but not statistically significant, mean values of FM and FFM, than children who did not follow dietary recommendations (FM [kg] = 7.48 vs. 5.24, p = 0.064; FM% = 20.81 vs. 16.73, p = 0.087; FFM [kg] = 28.19 vs. 22.62, p = 0.110). After minimum one year of a GFD, CD children showed significantly higher values of FFM [kg] (p = 0.001), muscle mass (MM) [kg] (p < 0.001), TBW [L] (p < 0.001) and body cell mass (BCM) [kg] (p < 0.001). Furthermore, CD children who were on a GFD presented a significantly higher increase in weight (p = 0.034) and body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.021). The children adhering to a GFD demonstrate a tendency towards higher indices of selected body composition components.
32230847	25-Hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D, and Peripheral Bone Densitometry in Adults with Celiac Disease.	Background: Adults with celiac disease (CeD) show low bone mineral density (BMD) and high fracture risk. CeD guidelines suggest measurements of serum minerals and vitamin D. However, studies on vitamin levels in CeD patients are contradictory. Aim: To investigate in CeD, 25-hydroxy-vitamin D [25(OH)D], 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D [1,25(OH)2D], and related analytes and to evaluate their relationships to peripheral BMD as assessed by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT). Methods: Gluten-free diet (GFD)-treated, and untreated adult CeD patients naive to vitamin D and calcium supplementation underwent measurements of serum 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)2D, parathyroid hormone (PTH), total calcium, phosphate, and of radius BMD by pQCT. Results: Complete data were collected in 105 patients for lab tests and 87 patients for BMD. For lab tests, untreated CeD differed from treated CeD for 22.0% lower serum 25(OH)D (p = 0.023), 42.5% higher serum PTH (p < 0.001), and 13.0% higher serum 1,25(OH)2D (p = 0.029) in the presence of similar serum calcium and phosphorus (p > 0.35). For BMD, untreated CeD differed from treated CeD for lower diaphyseal cortical BMD (1133 and 1157 mg/cm3, p = 0.004) but not for distal BMD (total, trabecular, and subcortical, p > 0.13). Independent correlates of diaphyseal cortical BMD were GFD treatment and body mass index (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Data indicated that, compared to CeD patients on a gluten-free diet, untreated adult CeD patients at diagnosis had lower 25(OH)D, higher PTH, and higher 1,25(OH)2D in the absence of difference in serum calcium and phosphorus. 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D, even below the normal range, were not associated with BMD. Our findings do not support the use of vitamin D supplementation for all CeD adults.
30119098	Contribution of Oral Hygiene and Cosmetics on Contamination of Gluten-free Diet: Do Celiac Customers Need to Worry About?	OBJECTIVES: The only available treatment for celiac disease (CD) is the gluten-free diet. It is unclear whether the presence of gluten in oral hygiene products and cosmetics that are applied on the mouth is a reason of concern for CD patients. The aim of this study was to test the level of gluten contamination in oral hygiene and cosmetic products available in the Italian market. METHODS: A total of 66 products (toothpastes = 37; dental tablets = 2; mouthwashes = 5; lip-balms = 10; lipsticks = 12) labelled gluten-free or with unknown gluten content were randomly collected from different supermarkets and pharmacies. The gluten quantification was determined by the R5 ELISA method approved by EU regulations. RESULTS: Out of 66 oral hygiene and cosmetics, 62 products (94%) were found to be gluten-free (gluten level <20 ppm), while 4 (6%) (toothpastes = 3; lipsticks = 1) showed a gluten level >20 ppm (toothpastes: 20.7, 31.4, and 35 ppm; lipstick: 27.4 ppm). None of the selected products had ingredient derived from wheat, barley, or rye. CONCLUSIONS: Gluten contamination is currently not an issue in a wide array of cosmetic and oral hygiene products that are commonly in the market.
37678180	Population level screening for celiac disease: is now the time?	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: As incidence and prevalence of celiac disease is increasing, subclinical and asymptomatic presentations are more commonly identified through celiac disease screening. However, the United States Preventive Services Task Force released a statement in 2017 maintaining that there is insufficient evidence to recommend general population screening for celiac disease for asymptomatic individuals. This review summarizes the current available evidence on celiac disease screening. RECENT FINDINGS: Literature demonstrates that by limiting screening to individuals with recognized symptoms, celiac disease diagnosis is frequently delayed or missed entirely. Most individuals with screening-identified celiac disease have previously unrecognized symptoms that improve through treatment with a gluten-free diet. Screening-identified individuals also demonstrate signs of impaired nutrition, growth, bone health, and quality of life which improve with treatment. Overall, celiac disease screening is viewed favorably by those identified through celiac disease screening programs. SUMMARY: Individuals with screening-identified celiac disease may still incur complications from untreated disease and receive benefit from treatment with a gluten-free diet. More data is needed to determine the cost effectiveness of different mass screening approaches that incorporate the societal perspective towards screening.
37630710	Body Mass Index during Gluten-Free Diet in Patients with Celiac Disease.	The association of clinical variables with body mass index (BMI) and changes experienced during a gluten-free diet (GFD) in celiac disease (CD) is not well established. In this retrospective cohort study, we aimed to investigate factors aligned with baseline and a follow-up regarding BMI in CD cases diagnosed at the University of Pecs (Hungary). Data were collected regarding gender, age, clinical presentation, histology, serology, extraintestinal manifestations, and BMI upon diagnosis and during follow-up. To compare variables with baseline BMI and BMI changes in short-, intermediate-, and long-term periods, we applied univariate analyses. A total of 192 CD patients were included. Males had significantly higher mean BMI when compared with females at diagnosis (22.9 +- 4.1 vs. 21.4 +- 4.3 kg/m2, p = 0.041) and during follow-up (p = 0.031, p = 0.029, and p = 0.033 for short-, intermediate-, and long-term follow-ups, respectively). Non-classical CD patients experienced higher mean BMI at diagnosis (22.9 +- 4.0 vs. 20.7 +- 4.4 kg/m2, p < 0.001) and following long-term follow-up (24.5 +- 3.2 vs. 22.6 +- 3.4 kg/m2, p = 0.039) than classical patients. In conclusion, although the mean BMI remained in the normal range, it increased significantly during follow-up, even at the short-term follow-up. This change was characteristic for non-classical cases and males on the long-term follow-ups.
29211629	Report of the 5th European expert meeting on rotavirus vaccination (EEROVAC).	The Fifth European Expert Meeting on Rotavirus Vaccination was convened in Utrecht, The Netherlands, in March 2017. The 2-day meeting included invited lectures as well as original oral and poster presentations and brought together experts from 21 countries. Summary findings of the meeting include: Rotavirus vaccination programmes in Europe have resulted in reductions of 60-90% in rotavirus outpatient visits and hospitalizations. Long term trends indicate this impact is sustained over the years. Herd effects, protecting unvaccinated children and neonates too young to be vaccinated have been observed in many European countries. Early evidence now also suggests that rotavirus vaccination may be instrumental in the prevention of celiac disease. Special attention should be given to preterm infants, who may age out of the vaccination window before hospital discharge and to HIV infected children who are at increased risk of severe rotavirus AGE. There is a small but increased risk of IS following rotavirus vaccination and parents should therefore be informed about possible signs and symptoms of IS. New insights in rotavirus genetic susceptibility and interactions with microbiome may open opportunities for interventions to improve protection by vaccination, in particular in LMIC. The development of several novel rotavirus vaccines discussed at the meeting is also promising in this respect.
36165066	"Long-term follow-up and prognosis of celiac hepatitis".	INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease has been associated with abnormal liver function tests at diagnosis that usually resolve with a gluten-free diet (GFD). The aim of this study was to assess the evolution of liver involvement and possible long-term complications in patients on a GFD. METHODS: Retrospective and single-center study, which included all individuals with Celiac disease followed in specialized consultation in a tertiary referral hospital. RESULTS: A total of 162 patients were included, most of them female (77.8%) with a median age of 24 years (IQR, 7-39). Seventy-four (45.7%) patients had abnormal liver function tests at diagnosis. These individuals had higher anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA (tTG-IgA) antibody titers (126 vs. 29 IU/L; P  = 0.003). There were no significant differences in the Marsh classification ( P  = 0.599). During follow-up, most celiac hepatitis patients had normalization of liver function tests and tTG-IgA antibodies. At the last follow-up, all the patients had fibrosis-4 index <2.4 and an aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index score <0.6. Vibration-controlled transient elastography showed values <6.4 kPa in all cases. On the other hand, it was found that 42.9% of the individuals had a controlled attenuation parameter >206.5 db/m. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, liver function tests normalized in the vast majority of celiac hepatitis patients on a GFD, with no progression to chronic liver disease. It should be noted the high number of individuals who present hepatic steatosis during follow-up, which may be related to a diet that tends to be hyperlipidemic and hypercaloric.
35935971	Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte Antigen 4 Haploinsufficiency Presenting As Refractory Celiac-Like Disease: Case Report.	Primary immunodeficiency may present with treatment-refractory enteropathy. We present two patients with celiac/celiac-like disease diagnosed in early childhood and refractory to the gluten-free diet. One patient had features of multi-system autoimmunity, whereas the other had celiac-like disease as an isolated clinical finding. Both patients underwent genetic testing given disease refractoriness and were ultimately diagnosed with cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) haploinsufficiency. They are both now in complete clinical and endoscopic remission on abatacept. CTLA4 haploinsufficiency has incomplete penetrance and significant phenotypic heterogeneity but should be considered in the differential diagnosis of refractory celiac/celiac-like disease, as treatment implications are significant.
32708973	Efficacy of a High-Iron Dietary Intervention in Women with Celiac Disease and Iron Deficiency without Anemia: A Clinical Trial.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: Iron deficiency without anemia (IDWA) is a common finding in celiac disease (CD) and can also persist in case of good compliance and clinical response to a strict gluten-free diet (GFD). This scenario usually presents in CD women of child-bearing age in whom the imbalance between menstrual iron loss and inadequate iron intake from their diet plays the major role. A recommended approach to this condition is yet to be established. This study aimed to compare, in this subset of patients, the efficacy of a dietary approach consisting of an iron-rich diet against the traditional pharmacological oral-replacement therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between February and December 2016, consecutive CD female patients of child-bearing age as referred to our outpatient center with evidence of IDWA (ferritin <15 ng/mL or 15-20 ng/L with transferrin saturation <15%) were enrolled. After the completion of a 7-day weighed food intake recording to assess the usual iron dietary intake, the patients were randomized in two arms to receive a 12-week iron-rich diet (iron intake >20 mg/die) versus oral iron supplementation with ferrous sulfate (FS) (105 mg/day). Blood tests and dietary assessments were repeated at the end of treatment. The degree of compliance and tolerability to the treatments were assessed every month by means of specific questionnaires and symptoms evaluation. RESULTS: A total of 22 women were enrolled and divided in the diet group (n = 10, age 37 +- 8 years) and in the FS group (n = 12, age 38 +- 10 years). The food intake records demonstrated an inadequate daily intake of iron in all the enrolled subjects. At the end of the treatments, ferritin levels were higher in the FS group (8.5 (5) versus 34 (30.8), p = 0.002). Compliance and tolerability were similar in both treatment groups (89% versus 87%, p = ns). CONCLUSIONS: These findings did not support any equivalent efficacy of an iron-rich diet compared to a FS supplementation in non-anemic iron-deficient women affected by CD. However, the diet appeared a well-tolerated approach, and adequate dietary instructions could effectively increase the daily iron consumption, suggesting a role in the long-term management of IDWA, especially in patients who do not tolerate pharmacological supplementation.
32156283	The Yin and Yang of dietary gluten transgressions in real-life scenarios of celiac patients.	
38380914	Evaluating the Effects of Chronic Oral Exposure to the Food Additive Silicon Dioxide on Oral Tolerance Induction and Food Sensitivities in Mice.	BACKGROUND: The increasing prevalence of food sensitivities has been attributed to changes in gut microenvironment; however, ubiquitous environmental triggers such as inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) used as food additives have not been thoroughly investigated. OBJECTIVES: We explored the impact of the NP-structured food-grade silicon dioxide (fg-SiO2) on intestinal immune response involved in oral tolerance (OT) induction and evaluated the consequences of oral chronic exposure to this food-additive using a mouse model of OT to ovalbumin (OVA) and on gluten immunopathology in mice expressing the celiac disease risk gene, HLA-DQ8. METHODS: Viability, proliferation, and cytokine production of mesenteric lymph node (MLN) cells were evaluated after exposure to fg-SiO2. C57BL/6J mice and a mouse model of OT to OVA were orally exposed to fg-SiO2 or vehicle for 60 d. Fecal lipocalin-2 (Lcn-2), anti-OVA IgG, cytokine production, and immune cell populations were analyzed. Nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice expressing HLA-DQ8 (NOD/DQ8), exposed to fg-SiO2 or vehicle, were immunized with gluten and immunopathology was investigated. RESULTS: MLN cells exposed to fg-SiO2 presented less proliferative T cells and lower secretion of interleukin 10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) by T regulatory and CD45+ CD11b+ CD103+ cells compared to control, two factors mediating OT. Mice given fg-SiO2 exhibited intestinal Lcn-2 level and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) secretion, showing inflammation and less production of IL-10 and TGF-beta. These effects were also observed in OVA-tolerized mice exposed to fg-SiO2, in addition to a breakdown of OT and a lower intestinal frequency of T cells. In NOD/DQ8 mice immunized with gluten, the villus-to-crypt ratio was decreased while the CD3+ intraepithelial lymphocyte counts and the Th1 inflammatory response were aggravated after fg-SiO2 treatment. DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that chronic oral exposure to fg-SiO2 blocked oral tolerance induction to OVA, and worsened gluten-induced immunopathology in NOD/DQ8 mice. The results should prompt investigation on the link between SiO2 exposure and food sensitivities in humans. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP12758.
33156101	Healthcare Resource Utilization and Costs in Celiac Disease: A US Claims Analysis.	INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease (CeD) is a lifelong immune-mediated enteropathy in which dietary gluten triggers an inflammatory reaction in the small intestine. This retrospective cohort study examines healthcare resource utilization (HRU) and costs between patients with CeD and matched controls. METHODS: Patients with CeD (cases) with an endoscopic biopsy and >=2 medical encounters with a CeD diagnosis between January 1, 2010, and October 1, 2015, were identified in the MarketScan databases. The date of the first claim with a CeD diagnosis on or after the endoscopic biopsy was the index date. Cases were matched 1:1 to patients without CeD (controls) on demographic characteristics and Deyo-Charlson Comorbidity Index score. Clinical characteristics, all-cause, and CeD-related HRU and costs (adjusted to 2017 US dollars) were compared between cases and controls during the 12 months before (baseline) and 24 months after (follow-up) the index date. RESULTS: A total of 11,008 cases (mean age 40.6 years, 71.3% women) were matched to 11,008 controls. During the follow-up, a higher proportion of cases had all-cause and CeD-related HRU including inpatient admissions, emergency department visits, gastroenterologist visits, dietician visits, endoscopic biopsies, and gastroenterology imaging (all P <= 0.002). Incremental all-cause and CeD-related costs were in the first ($7,921 and $2,894) and second ($3,777 and $935) year of follow-up, driven by outpatient services costs. DISCUSSION: In this US national claims database analysis, there was evidence of an increase in both all-cause and CeD-related HRU and related costs in patients with CeD compared with matched patients without CeD, suggesting a significant economic burden associated with CeD.
30018339	P31-43, an undigested gliadin peptide, mimics and enhances the innate immune response to viruses and interferes with endocytic trafficking: a role in celiac disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation of the intestinal mucosa due to an immune response to wheat gliadins. Some gliadin peptides are resistant to intestinal digestion (e.g., A-gliadin P31-43) and induce a stress/innate immune response, but the reason why they are dangerous in the intestines of patients with CD is unknown. In the present study, P31-43 activated IFN-alpha, a mediator of the innate immune response in CD, in the intestine of subjects with CD and an enterocyte cell line, CaCo-2. P31-43 cooperated with a viral ligand to activate the TLR7 pathway by interfering with endocytic trafficking. Based on these results, the vesicular pathway regulates the innate/inflammatory response to viral ligands and bioactive dietary peptides. Suggesting that together with viral infections, alimentary proteins able to mimic and potentiate the innate immune response to viruses, can trigger an autoimmune disease such as CD.
34736585	Celiac Disease in Children.	Celiac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy triggered by the ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. In patients with suspected celiac disease, measurement of serum IgA antibodies to tissue transglutaminase-2 has a high sensitivity and specificity and is the first screening test that should be ordered. The diagnosis of celiac disease is based on the presence of mucosal damage in small intestinal biopsies in patients having circulating celiac disease-specific antibodies. Celiac disease management includes lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet and continuous long-term follow-up.
37499866	Celiac Disease: An Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Evidence-Based Practice Guideline.	Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system of genetically susceptible individuals elicits a reaction to gluten causing small intestine damage. If left undiagnosed and untreated, the resulting nutritional malabsorption can lead to anemia, bone disease, growth faltering or other consequences. The condition is lifelong and lacks a cure; the only treatment is lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). This diet is challenging to follow and adversely impacts quality of life; however, it is essential to ensure intestinal recovery and prevent future negative health consequences. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics convened an expert panel complemented by a celiac disease patient advocate to evaluate evidence for six topics including Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT), the GFD, oat consumption, micronutrients, pro-/prebiotics and the low FODMAP (Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides and Polyols) diet. This publication outlines the Academy's Evidence Analysis Library methods used to complete the systematic review and guideline development, and summarizes the recommendations and supporting evidence. The guidelines affirm that all individuals with celiac disease should follow a GFD (1C, Imperative) that may include gluten-free oats in adults (2D, Conditional). Children should follow a nutritionally adequate GFD that supports healthy growth and development (Consensus, Imperative) and does not unnecessarily restrict gluten-free oats (Consensus, Conditional). The guidelines indicate nutritional care should include routine nutritional assessment (Consensus, Imperative) and MNT (Consensus, Imperative). At this time, the guidelines do not support a recommendation for the addition of the low-FODMAP diet (2C, Conditional), prebiotic or probiotic supplementation (2D, Conditional) or micronutrient supplementation (in the absence of nutritional deficiency) (Consensus, Conditional). The 2021 Celiac Disease Evidence-Based Nutrition Guideline will assist Registered Dietitian Nutritionists in providing appropriate evidence-based MNT to support people with celiac disease in achieving and maintaining nutritional health and avoiding adverse celiac disease consequences throughout their lives.
29105146	Effect of the gluten-free diet on cardiovascular risk factors in patients with coeliac disease: A systematic review.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A gluten-free diet (GFD), the mainstay of treatment for celiac disease, is being increasingly adopted by people without this condition. The long-term health effects of this diet, apart from its beneficial effect on enteropathy in celiac disease, are unclear. Concerns exist that the GFD may result in micronutrient deficiencies, increased exposure to toxins such as arsenic, and an increased cardiovascular risk. This systematic review addresses the effect of the GFD on several modifiable cardiovascular risk factors. METHODS: A systematic search of the literature addressing the GFD and blood pressure, glycaemia, body mass index, waist circumference, and serum lipids in patients before and after adoption of a GFD was conducted using the MEDLINE, EMBASE, PSYCInfo, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases. Two authors performed abstract and full text screening, and quality assessment. RESULTS: A total of 5372 articles were identified, from which 27 were included. Lack of control groups in all but one study prevented meta-analysis of results. Overall study quality was low and restricted to patients with celiac disease. Consistent findings across studies included an increase in total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein, fasting glycaemia, and body mass index (while remaining within the healthy weight range). Significant changes in low density lipoprotein, triglycerides, and blood pressure were not consistently reported. CONCLUSIONS: A GFD alters certain cardiovascular risk factors in patients with celiac disease, but the overall effect on cardiovascular risk is unclear. Further studies are warranted.
33982998	Early Introduction of Dietary Gluten Delays the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease in Breastfed Infants.	
38542796	Persistent Barriers of the Gluten-Free Basic Food Basket: Availability, Cost, and Nutritional Composition Assessment.	Gluten-related disorders are treated with a gluten-free diet. The "basic food basket" (BFB) consists of a list of basic foods consumed by low-income groups in society, including those lowest-cost versions within each food category. To evaluate the cost, availability, and nutritional quality of the BFB and gluten-free BFB (GF-BFB), foods were photographed, registering their cost, availability, and nutritional characteristics, in high quality and mid-range supermarkets, wholesalers, health shops, and corner shops, matching each regular BFB product with a gluten-free equivalent. Of the 1177 potential products, the selection of lowest-cost foods yielded 55 and 47 products (BFB and GF-BFB, respectively). Breads/cereals and drinks showed the highest differences (279% and 146%, respectively) while meats and sausages showed the lowest ones (18.6%). The GF-BFB cost represents 30.1% of the minimum wage, which covers the cost of 5.2 and 3.3 of the BFB and GF-BFB per month, respectively. Availability ranged between 22.7 and 42.4%. Lower availability was associated with poorer nutritional quality in the GF-BFB, which provides 5% less energy, 26% more fat, and 25% less protein than the BFB. Only 47% of gluten-free products declared their "gluten-free" condition. The results strongly suggest that the GF-BFB must be redesigned to be both gluten-free and nutritionally adequate.
33880901	Nutri-epigenetics: the effect of maternal diet and early nutrition on the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.	Autoimmune diseases comprise a wide group of diseases involving a self-response of the immune system against the host. The etiopathogenesis is very complex involving disease-specific factors but also environmental factors, among which the diet. Maternal diet during pregnancy as well as early nutrition recently attracted the interest of the scientists as contributing to the immune programming. In this paper, we reviewed the most recent literature on the effect of maternal diet and early nutrition in modulating the immune system in a selected subset of autoimmune diseases: type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Particularly, we focused our narrative on the role of maternal and perinatal nutrition in the epigenetic mechanisms underlying the auto-immune response. Maternal diet during pregnancy as well as breastfeeding and early nutrition play a big role in many epigenetic mechanisms. Most of the nutrients consumed by the mother and the infant are known exerting epigenetic functions, such as folate, methionine, zinc, vitamins B12 and D, fibers, casein and gliadin, and they were linked to gene expression changes in the immune pathways. Despite the common role of maternal diet, breastfeeding and early nutrition in almost all the autoimmune diseases, each disease seems to have specific diet-driver epigenetic mechanisms that require further investigations. The research in this field is opening new routes to establishing a precision nutrition approach to the auto-immune diseases.
36533746	A short update on new approaches to celiac disease.	Celiac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy of the small intestine, related to gluten intolerance occurring in genetically predisposed patients. Currently, the only available treatment is a lifelong gluten-free diet. However, the total avoidance of gluten is difficult and poses a challenge to patients, nutritionists and treating physicians. For this reason, scientists have developed in recent years new therapeutic approaches complementary to dietary treatment, such as modification of gluten to make gliadin non-toxic, reduction of the inflammatory response with elafin and Lactococcus Lactis, degradation of gluten by endoproteolytic enzymes, and correction of nutritional deficiencies by adding pseudo-cereals to the diet of celiac patients. This literature review focuses on the different treatment strategies for celiac disease previously studied and summarizes the latest advances in this field.
28814219	Coeliac disease: review of diagnosis and management.	Coeliac disease is an immune-mediated systemic disease triggered by exposure to gluten, and manifested by small intestinal enteropathy and gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms. Recent guidelines recommend a concerted use of clear definitions of the disease. In Australia, the most recent estimated prevalence is 1.2% in adult men (1:86) and 1.9% in adult women (1:52). Active case finding is appropriate to diagnose coeliac disease in high risk groups. Diagnosis of coeliac disease is important to prevent nutritional deficiency and long term risk of gastrointestinal malignancy. The diagnosis of coeliac disease depends on clinico-pathological correlation: history, presence of antitransglutaminase antibodies, and characteristic histological features on duodenal biopsy (when the patient is on a gluten-containing diet). Human leucocyte antigen class II haplotypes DQ2 or DQ8 are found in nearly all patients with coeliac disease, but are highly prevalent in the general population at large (56% in Australia) and testing can only exclude coeliac disease for individuals with non-permissive haplotypes. Adhering to a gluten free diet allows duodenal mucosal healing and alleviates symptoms. Patients should be followed up with a yearly review of dietary adherence and a health check. Non-coeliac gluten or wheat protein sensitivity is a syndrome characterised by both gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms related to the ingestion of gluten and possibly other wheat proteins in people who do not have coeliac disease or wheat allergy recognised by diagnostic tests.
30597204	Lack of Follow-up of Pediatric Patients With Celiac Disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is often diagnosed in childhood, and the treatment is a lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD).1,2 It may take several years to gain competence in the skills required to follow a GFD successfully. Inadequately treated CD is associated with bone fractures, nutritional deficiencies, and lymphoma.3,4 Healthcare providers are key resources for patients with CD. Consultation with a dietitian with GFD expertise at diagnosis and annual disease-specific follow-up care are recommended.2,5 The primary objective of this study was to evaluate adherence to guidelines for dietitian consultation and follow-up for children with CD. A secondary objective was to identify factors associated with loss to follow-up.
30363819	Recent advances in understanding non-celiac gluten sensitivity.	Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a condition characterized by intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms related to the ingestion of gluten-containing foods in the absence of celiac disease and wheat allergy. The diagnosis is cumbersome and currently confirmed only by gluten withdrawal and double-blind placebo challenge protocols. There is great overlap in symptoms between NCGS and other functional gastrointestinal disorders, making a differential diagnosis difficult. The pathophysiology of NCGS is largely unclear, and there are contrasting data on the trigger of this condition. This review will highlight the state-of-the-art knowledge on NCGS and the key open questions.
29160841	The Overlapping Area of Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity (NCGS) and Wheat-Sensitive Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS): An Update.	Gluten-related disorders have recently been reclassified with an emerging scientific literature supporting the concept of non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). New research has specifically addressed prevalence, immune mechanisms, the recognition of non-immunoglobulin E (non-IgE) wheat allergy and overlap of NCGS with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-type symptoms. This review article will provide clinicians with an update that directly impacts on the management of a subgroup of their IBS patients whose symptoms are triggered by wheat ingestion.
38337623	Study Protocol for a Controlled Trial of Nutrition Education Intervention about Celiac Disease in Primary School: ZELIAKIDE Project.	The only treatment for celiac disease (CD) is a strict and lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD), which must be safe and nutritionally balanced. Avoiding gluten brings difficulties with following the diet and can affect the social life of people with CD. The Zeliakide Project is a nutrition education program aimed at increasing the knowledge of the general population about healthy diets, CD and GFD, and, therefore, to improve the social inclusion and quality of life of people with CD. It is a one-month intervention program, two-armed cluster, non-randomised and controlled trial, conducted among 10-12-year-old children. Pre- and post-intervention evaluation and 1 month follow-up will be carried out to assess the effectiveness of the program. It is based on competencies and their respective learning outcomes. The teaching methodology chosen is a STEAM methodology: inquiry-based learning (IBL). A teaching unit has been created to develop the project, which, in the future, will be useful for the self-application of the program. This study will provide a valid and useful tool to achieve changes in the diet at the school level and will help to promote the social inclusion of people with CD. Moreover, it will enforce the STEAM competences of children.
30868254	[Dermatitis herpetiformis].	Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a genetically determined, gluten sensitive autoimmune bullous dermatosis related to celiac disease in which granular, insoluble aggregates in the papillary dermis of epidermal transglutaminase (TG3), immunoglobulin A (IgA), and fibrinogen are present. Detection of the dermal IgA-TG3 immune complex is the gold standard of diagnosis. DH develops in a subpopulation of patients with gluten sensitive enteropathy, characterized by itching, erythematous, excoriated papules showing characteristic distribution over the knees, elbows and buttocks; vesicles are rarely seen. The primary therapy of DH is a strict, lifelong gluten-free diet, and it may be necessary to temporarily give dapsone in case of severe symptoms.
35282714	Adherence to the Mediterranean diet is linked to reduced psychopathology in female celiac disease patients.	Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic enteropathy, affecting approximately 1% of the population worldwide with a higher prevalence in women. Recent studies demonstrate that CD is associated with an increased prevalence of psychopathology. The present study was undertaken to investigate the relationship between adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (MD) and psychopathological symptoms among CD patients, since the MD is a physical and mental health protective dietary regimen, which can easily be rendered gluten-free. A total of 134 CD patients (28 males and 106 females) were included in the study. Psychopathology was evaluated with the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R), and MD adherence was calculated using the Mediterranean Dietary Serving Score (MDSS). As regards psychopathological symptoms, female patients presented with statistically significant higher depression and anxiety than males. The majority of patients (64.9%) had low adherence to the MD (MDSS <14) with a mean score of 9.44 +- 3.26 and 9.14 +- 3.07 for men and women, respectively, out of a total of 24 points. High MD adherence was observed in 35.7% of the male and 34.9% of the female patients, with a mean score of 16.40 +- 2.63 and 16.35 +- 2.12, respectively. Interestingly, MD adherence was inversely associated with the intensity of several psychopathological symptoms in female patients, which represented the majority of the sample. The results of the study underline the need to encourage CD patients to adapt to a Mediterranean-style GFD.
35807762	An Evaluation of Nutritional Status and Problems with Dietary Compliance in Polish Patients with Celiac Disease.	Celiac disease (CD, enteropathy) is a genetic autoimmune disease (abnormal immune response that attacks healthy tissues) associated with gluten intolerance. The aim of this study was to evaluate and monitor the nutritional status of CD patients, explore the problems associated with diet planning and dietary adherence among children and adults, and assess the impact of these factors on the persistence of CD symptoms. This study was carried out as part of the project entitled "A gluten-free diet without obstacles-eating well and healthy" (POWR 03.01.00-00-T153/18), conducted in Lublin Voivodeship. The study involved 87 persons, including 23 children younger than 18. At the beginning of the study and after nine months, all adult participants (older than 18) were subjected to a body composition analysis with the SECA mBCA 515 analyzer. During the project, the participants attended three consultations with a dietician. During each visit, the subjects' body weight, nutritional status and diets were evaluated; their diets were modified, and problems relating to dietary adherence were resolved. The initial body composition analysis revealed a risk of sarcopenic obesity in 30% of adult participants, in particular in women (p = 0.003) older than 45 (p = 0.001). The risk of being underweight was diagnosed in 25% of the subjects, in particular, in women younger than 35 (p = 0.0023) and in participants who had been affected by short stature and underweight in childhood, i.e., before CD diagnosis (p = 0.0024). The analysis demonstrated that patients with gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting) of CD were significantly more likely to avoid even accidental exposure to gluten and were more likely to strictly follow GFD recommendations (1.97; 95CI:1.56-2.12, p = 0.0001) and safety guidelines when preparing meals at home (1.76; 95CI: 1.34-192, p = 0.0023). Parents, in particular, parents of toddlers and preschoolers who are at significantly higher risk of CD, adhered strictly to dietary guidelines and did not allow for any exceptions when preparing meals (1.88; 95CI: 1.53-2.09, p = 0.001). Persons at risk of malnutrition were also far less likely to deliberately choose gluten-containing foods (0.74; 95CI: 0.53-0.91, p = 0.021), in particular, patients with Marsh type 3a and 3b classification (p = 0.01) and persons whose intestinal histology scores did not fully improve after switching to a GFD. An assessment of the effectiveness of diet therapy based on the phase angle revealed that dietary recommendations had a positive impact on patients who had been recently diagnosed with CD. In all age groups, the main problem was accidental exposure to gluten, in particular in foods that were not labeled with the crossed grain symbol. A comparative analysis of CDAT questionnaires revealed that dietary advice on eating out significantly improved adherence to a GFD and reduced the frequency of unintentional gluten exposure in all age groups.
33572226	Gluten and Autism Spectrum Disorder.	An expanding body of literature is examining connections between Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and dietary interventions. While a number of specialist diets have been suggested as beneficial in ASD, gluten has received particularly close attention as a potentially exacerbating factor. Reports exist suggesting a beneficial effect of the gluten-free diet (GFD) in ameliorating behavioural and intellectual problems associated with ASD, while epidemiological research has also shown a comorbidity between ASD and coeliac disease. However, both caregivers and clinicians have expressed an uncertainty of the value of people with ASD going gluten-free, and as the GFD otherwise receives considerable public attention a discussion which focuses specifically on the interaction between ASD and gluten is warranted. In this review we discuss the historical context of ASD and gluten-related studies, and expand this to include an overview of epidemiological links, hypotheses of shared pathological mechanisms, and ultimately the evidence around the use and adoption of the GFD in people with ASD.
32716701	Celiac Disease Remission With Tofacitinib: A Case Report.	
35572547	NLRX1 Deficiency Alters the Gut Microbiome and Is Further Exacerbated by Adherence to a Gluten-Free Diet.	Patients with gluten sensitivities present with dysbiosis of the gut microbiome that is further exacerbated by a strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). A subtype of patients genetically susceptible to gluten sensitivities are Celiac Disease (CeD) patients, who are carriers of the HLA DR3/DQ2 or HLA DR4/DQ8 haplotypes. Although 85-95% of all CeD patients carry HLA DQ2, up to 25-50% of the world population carry this haplotype with only a minority developing CeD. This suggests that CeD and other gluten sensitivities are mediated by factors beyond genetics. The contribution of innate immune system signaling has been generally understudied in the context of gluten sensitivities. Thus, here we examined the role of NOD-like receptors (NLRs), a subtype of pattern recognition receptors, in maintaining the composition of the gut microbiome in animals maintained on a GFD. Human transcriptomics data revealed significant increases in the gene expression of multiple NLR family members, across functional groups, in patients with active CeD compared to control specimens. However, NLRX1 was uniquely down-regulated during active disease. NLRX1 is a negative regulatory NLR that functions to suppress inflammatory signaling and has been postulate to prevent inflammation-induced dysbiosis. Using Nlrx1-/- mice maintained on either a normal or gluten-free diet, we show that loss of NLRX1 alters the microbiome composition, and a distinctive shift further ensues following adherence to a GFD, including a reciprocal loss of beneficial microbes and increase in opportunistic bacterial populations. Finally, we evaluated the functional impact of an altered gut microbiome by assessing short- and medium-chain fatty acid production. These studies revealed significant differences in a selection of metabolic markers that when paired with 16S rRNA sequencing data could reflect an overall imbalance and loss of immune system homeostasis in the gastrointestinal system.
31837981	Infertility in women with systemic autoimmune diseases.	Infertility consists by definition in" failure to achieve a clinical pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected intercourse" while the term subfertility means a delay to achieve pregnancy. Several factors can contribute to infertility or subfertility in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases. The association of systemic autoimmune conditions with endometriosis, celiac disease and thyroid autoimmunity that are well known causes of infertility and/or subfertility need to be taken in consideration when difficulties in the onset of pregnancy is reported. The majority of the used antirheumatic drugs do not interfere with fertility. However, the use of cyclophosphamide, limited to severe disease, can provoke premature ovarian failure; to preserve fertility a preventive treatment is available. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can cause temporary infertility and corticosteroids are associated to a prolonged time to pregnancy in some rheumatic diseases. Data on the association of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) with infertility are still debated but in general an increased rate of aPL is described patients undergoing medically assisted reproductive techniques. In systemic lupus erythematosus aPL and other autoantibodies (i.e. anti-oocytes) can contribute to the infertility of some patients. Subfertility, rather than infertility, is observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis; the particular physical conditions of these women can also account for this. Physicians should not forget the patients' age, that is mandatory in order to preserve their chance to have children.
29209126	Intestinal parameters of oxidative imbalance in celiac adults with extraintestinal manifestations.	AIM: To evaluate selected intestinal parameters of oxidative stress, and antioxidant capacity in adult celiac disease patients with extraintestinal manifestations. METHODS: The study involved 85 adult patients divided into the following subgroups: (1) patients with newly diagnosed celiac disease (CD) (n = 7); (2) celiac patients not adhering to a gluten-free diet (GFD) (n = 22); (3) patients with CD on the GFD (n = 31); and (4) patients with functional disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, serving as controls (n = 25). Celiac patients presented with non-classic symptoms or extraintestinal manifestations. Standard blood tests including serum antioxidant levels (uric acid, bilirubin, and vitamin D), celiac antibody levels, and histopathological status of duodenal biopsy specimens have been determined. The expression of mRNA for tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), interleukin 10 (IL-10), superoxide dismutase (SOD), heat-shock protein 70 (HSP-70), hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1alpha), and BAX in the duodenal mucosa of patients was analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The mean plasma uric acid level in patients with active CD (newly diagnosed and nonadherent patients) and treated celiac patients was significantly higher than in controls (260.17 +- 53.65 vs 190.8 +- 22.98, P < 0.001, and 261.7 +- 51.79 vs 190.8 +- 22.98, P < 0.001, respectively). The mean bilirubin concentration in active and treated celiac patients was significantly lower than in controls (8.23 +- 5.04 vs 10.48 +- 4.08, P < 0.05 and 8.06 +- 3.31 vs 10.48 +- 4.08, P < 0.05, respectively). The mean plasma vitamin D level was significantly lower in active celiac patients than in treated celiac patients and controls (19.37 +- 9.03 vs 25.15 +- 11.2, P < 0.05 and 19.37 +- 9.03 vs 29.67 +- 5.12, P < 0.001, respectively). The expression of TNF-alpha, IL-10, and HSP-70 mRNAs was significantly elevated in the celiac groups regardless of the diet when compared with controls. Patients on the GFD presented a significantly lower mRNA expression of TNF-alpha and IL-10 than in newly diagnosed and nonadherent patients (P < 0.05). The expression of SOD mRNA was significantly elevated in celiac patients compared with controls (P < 0.05), with a significant difference between treated and untreated patients (P < 0.05). The expression of HIF-1alpha mRNA and BAX mRNA was significantly higher in patients with active CD compared with controls and patients on GFD, while no difference was observed between the latter two groups. CONCLUSION: Increased intestinal expression of HSP-70 despite GFD indicates that GFD only partially reduced oxidative stress. CD patients exhibited an oxidative imbalance and inflammatory response despite GFD. Uric acid may act as an important antioxidant in CD.
35918825	Intravenous route for folate supplementation in a patient with celiac disease treated by pemetrexed-based chemotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer.	INTRODUCTION: Oral folic acid supplementation is essential for patients treated with pemetrexed, to prevent the risk of severe hematologic toxicity. In case of intestinal absorption disorder, no recommendations exist for intravenous folic acid supplementation. CASE REPORT: We describe a 74-year-old patient with multimetastatic non-small-cell lung adenocarcinoma, receiving first-line chemotherapy with carboplatin AUC5, pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 and pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks. The patient presented neglected celiac disease, resulting in malabsorption syndrome with iron and folic acid deficiency. The question was how to administer folic acid supplementation during the pemetrexed-based chemotherapy. MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOMES: Intravenous injection of 200 mg levoleucovorin on day 1 of cycle 1 of pemetrexed-based chemotherapy was administered and well tolerated. During the second cycle, the levoleucovorin perfusion was not renewed by omission. The patient was hospitalized for 7 days because of febrile aplasia. Piperacillin-tazobactam was started, and then switched to amoxicillin-clavulanate plus ciprofloxacin. After this episode of post-chemotherapy febrile aplasia, it was decided to systematically supplement the patient with intravenous levoleucovorin, with blood folate concentration monitoring at each cycle. At 16 months after start of treatment, the patient was in complete remission, indicating that the immune-chemotherapy was effective, with no further febrile neutropenia. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: This case report highlights intravenous levoleucovorin supplementation as an alternative to oral folic acid if needed during pemetrexed-antifolate-based chemotherapy.
34209932	Transamidation Down-Regulates Intestinal Immunity of Recombinant alpha-Gliadin in HLA-DQ8 Transgenic Mice.	Enzymatic transamidation of gliadins by microbial transglutaminase (mTG) inhibits interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) secretion by intestinal T cell lines in patients with celiac disease (CD). To gain insight into the cellular mechanisms underlying the down-regulatory effects of transamidation, we tested a single recombinant alpha-gliadin (r-gliadin) harbouring two immunodominant peptides, p13 (aa. 120-139) and p23 (aa. 220-239), in HLA-DQ8 transgenic mice, a model of gluten sensitivity. Mice were intranasally immunised with r-gliadin or r-gliadin transamidated by mTG (K-r-gliadin) along with cholera toxin, and the response of mesenteric lymph node cells was analysed by cytokine multiplex assay. An in vitro challenge with r-gliadin was characterised by secretion of specific cytokines featuring both innate immunity and the Th1/Th2/Th17 pattern of the adaptive response. Notably, transamidation specifically down-regulated the Th1 response. Structural studies performed on K-r-gliadin confirmed that specific glutamine residues in p13 and p23, previously found to be deamidated by tissue transglutaminase, were also transamidated by mTG. In silico analysis, simulating p13 and p23 peptide binding to HLA-DQ8 showed that these glutamines, in the form of glutamate, could interact by means of salt bridges with peculiar amino acids of the alpha chain of HLA-DQ8, suggesting that their transamidation may influence the HLA-restricted recognition of these peptides. Thus, the structural findings provided a rationale to explain the down-regulation of the r-gliadin-specific Th1 response following transamidation.
29933630	Cutaneous and Mucosal Manifestations Associated with Celiac Disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated, gluten-induced enteropathy that affects predisposed individuals of all ages. Many patients with CD do not report gastrointestinal symptoms making it difficult to reach an early diagnosis. On the other hand, CD is related to a wide spectrum of extra-intestinal manifestations, with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) being the best characterized. These associated conditions may be the clue to reaching the diagnosis of CD. Over the last few years, there have been multiple reports of the association between CD and several cutaneous manifestations that may improve with a gluten-free diet (GFD). The presence of some of these skin diseases, even in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms, should give rise to an appropriate screening method for CD. The aim of this paper is to describe the different cutaneous manifestations that have been associated with CD and the possible mechanisms involved.
34364399	Gluten in pharmaceutical products: a scoping review.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is one of the most common gluten-related disorders. Although the only effective treatment is a strict gluten-free diet, doubts remain as to whether healthcare professionals take this restriction into consideration when prescribing and dispensing medicines to susceptible patients. This scoping review aimed to find out the current evidence for initiatives that either describe the gluten content of medicines or intend to raise awareness about the risk of prescribing and dispensing gluten-containing medicines in patients with CD and other gluten-related disorders. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted using three search strategies in PubMed/MEDLINE, TripDatabase and Web of Science in April 2021, following the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR). References from included articles were also examined. Two researchers screened the articles and results were classified according to their main characteristics and outcomes, which were grouped according to the PCC (Population, Concept and Context) framework. The initiatives described were classified into three targeted processes related to gluten-containing medicines: prescription, dispensation and both prescription and dispensation. RESULTS: We identified a total of 3146 records. After the elimination of duplicates, 3062 articles remained and ultimately 13 full texts were included in the narrative synthesis. Most studies were conducted in the US, followed by Canada and Australia, which each published one article. Most strategies were focused on increasing health professional's knowledge of gluten-containing/gluten-free medications (n = 8), which were basically based on database development from manufacturer data. A wide variability between countries on provided information and labelling of gluten-containing medicines was found. CONCLUSION: Initiatives regarding the presence of gluten in medicines, including, among others, support for prescribers, the definition of the role of pharmacists, and patients' adherence problems due to incomplete labelling of the medicines, have been continuously developed and adapted to the different needs of patients. However, information is still scarce, and some aspects have not yet been considered, such as effectiveness for the practical use of solutions to support healthcare professionals.
37400855	Awareness of celiac disease among the public in Kuwait: a cross-sectional survey.	OBJECTIVE: Health literacy levels among the general population predict better health outcomes and uptake of health services. Inequities in health literacy and uptake of health services are often observed in deprived neighborhoods. There is a paucity of data on literacy regarding celiac disease in Kuwait. Therefore, the present survey aims to address this paucity of data. RESULTS: We conducted a survey of 350 respondents in six governates of Kuwait. Although around 51% of respondents were aware of peanut allergy and gluten sensitivity, less than 15% were aware of celiac disease. More than 40% of respondents reported that a gluten-free diet should be promoted for everyone. Better awareness regarding CD was associated with Kuwaiti nationality, higher education levels and higher age. Among different governates, residents of Al-Asimah reported the highest awareness levels, while the rest of the governates did not differ significantly. While eating behavior did not significantly predict awareness regarding CD.
29912751	Diagnostic Accuracy of Point of Care Tests for Diagnosing Celiac Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	GOALS: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the overall diagnostic accuracy of point of care tests (POCTs) for diagnosing celiac disease (CD). BACKGROUND: Recently, POCTs for CD have been developed and are commercially available. Studies have reported significant variability in their sensitivity (70% to 100%) and specificity (85% to 100%). STUDY: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE databases, and the Cochrane library through June 2017. Positive reference test was defined as villous atrophy along with positive celiac-specific serology and/or clinical improvement after gluten-free diet. Normal duodenal biopsy was defined as negative reference test. Bivariate random-effect model was used to present the summary estimates of sensitivities and specificities along with 95% confidence regions We assessed methodologic quality using the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies-2 tool. RESULTS: The pooled sensitivity and specificity of all POCTs (based on tTG or DGP or tTG+Anti-gliadin antibodies) for diagnosing CD were 94.0% [95% confidence interval (CI), 89.9-96.5] and 94.4% (95% CI, 90.9-96.5), respectively. The pooled positive and negative likelihood ratios for POCTs were 16.7 and 0.06, respectively. The pooled sensitivity and specificity for IgA-tTG-based POCTs were 90.5% (95% CI, 82.3-95.1) and 94.8% (95% CI, 92.5-96.4), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The pooled sensitivity and specificity of POCTs in diagnosing CD are high. POCTs may be used to screen for CD, especially in areas with limited access to laboratory-based testing. Further research assessing the diagnostic accuracy of individual POCTs and comparing it with other available POCTs is needed.
29413009	Nutritional Consideration in Celiac Disease and Nonceliac Gluten Sensitivity.	Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder due to the inflammatory response to gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. It causes an enteropathy associated with several nutritional complications. Strict compliance to a gluten-free diet (GFD) is the current primary therapy. Nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a condition in which gluten ingestion leads to systemic symptoms but is not associated with small bowel atrophy or abnormal celiac serologies. A GFD heals celiac disease enteropathy and improves symptoms in NCGS. However, a long-term GFD can be associated with nutritional deficiencies and requires monitoring and guidance.
36609792	The effects of probiotics on gastrointestinal symptoms and microbiota in patients with celiac disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis on clinical trials.	Gluten-free diet (GFD) is the most effective method to manage celiac disease (CD). Many patients do not reach the complete symptom alleviation, even by strict GFD. Recent studies have reported inconsistent results regarding the beneficial benefits of taking probiotics. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the effects of probiotics on gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and the possible underlying causes in CD and celiac disease autoimmunity (CDA) patients. Databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science and Google Scholar, were searched for clinical trials published until July 2022 about assessing the effects of probiotics or synbiotics on CD or CDA patients. We collected data on GI symptoms, CD markers, inflammatory and immune responses, adverse events, and gut microbiota. A random effect meta-analysis was used to estimate the pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) and confidence interval (CI). We screened 7234 articles, of which 14 were included in the qualitative analysis and 5 in the quantitative analysis. Probiotics might alleviate GI symptoms, especially in the highly symptomatic patients, and improve immune response in CD and CDA patients. Results of the meta-analysis showed that probiotics increased the abundance of Bifidobacterium (SMD: 0.72, 95%CI (0.13, 1.30) and Lactobacillus (SMD: 0.49, 95%CI (0.18, 0.80) as compared with placebo. Probiotics did not increase the adverse events compared to the placebo. Probiotics might alleviate GI symptoms and immune response and improve dysbiosis in CD and CDA patients. However, high-quality clinical trials are needed to increase the level of evidence. Also, the most suitable combination of probiotics is yet to find.
34877633	Impact of Corona Virus Disease 2019 pandemic on adherence to gluten-free diet in Indian patients with celiac disease.	AIMS: Lockdown and restricted mobility due to the pandemic of corona virus disease  2019 (COVID-19) has severely affected the continuity of healthcare of patients with acute and chronic diseases. We evaluated the impact of COVID-19 on the adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD), symptom control, and quality of life (QOL) in patients with celiac disease (CeD). METHODS: A questionnaire, consisting of both ad-hoc and validated questions, was created after review of literature, group discussions, and expert meetings. Standardized questionnaires namely CeD adherence test (CDAT), celiac symptom index score, and CeD-related QOL were used. The web-based questionnaire was sent to 3130 patients via social media and 452 responses (14.4%) were received. Also, additional 68 patients (not available on any social media application) were interviewed telephonically by a trained dietitian. RESULTS: Overall, 505 patients (females: 318; mean age: 24.1+-14.2 years) were included. While only 6.7% (n = 34) had poor compliance to GFD (CDAT > 17) before COVID-19 pandemic, it almost doubled to 12.6% (n = 64) during the COVID-19 pandemic times (p = 0.02). Furthermore, 4.9% (n = 25) of patients were diagnosed contacting  COVID-19. Interestingly, 73.2% (n = 370) patients preferred online appointment than physical appointment. Most common difficulties faced during lockdown period were high delivery charges for getting gluten-free (GF) food at home (54.4%), increased prices of regular GF food (43.1%), and travelling long distance to arrange GF food (44.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has substantially affected the adherence, symptom control, and QOL in patients with CeD, attributable to unavailability, shortage of money, and heightened cost of GF food. The pandemic has offered an opportunity to practice teleconsultation approach for patients with CeD.
32942892	Celiac disease in adults.	Celiac disease is a lifelong autoimmune disorder that occurs in genetically predisposed people when consuming gluten. Its prevalence is around 1% of the population with about twice higher proportion of women. Celiac disease is one of the most common causes of malabsorption, however, its manifestations can be quite diverse - from completely asymptomatic to fully developed malabsorption syndrome. Extraintestinal manifestations are a common finding in adults. The gold standard of diagnosis is the serological detection of specific antibodies (the serum tissue transglutaminase IgA antibodies) in combination with a typical histological finding from a duodenal biopsy. Causal treatment is a lifelong gluten-free diet. Strict adherence to gluten-free diet will reduce the risk of serious complications (intestinal T-cell lymphoma). In the following case report we present a case of a 58-year-old patient, who have been diagnosed with celiac disease at this age based on non-classical symptoms. Specifically, these were multiple pathological fractures from metabolic bone disease due to malabsorption of calcium and vitamin D and subsequent secondary hyperparathyroidism.
38397615	Celiac Disease: Risks of Cross-Contamination and Strategies for Gluten Removal in Food Environments.	Celiac disease (CD) is the chronic immune-mediated enteropathy of the small bowel, manifesting when exposure to gluten occurs in genetically predisposed individuals. Nowadays, the only treatment considered safe for CD is a gluten-free diet (GFD). However, one of the problems faced by celiac patients is the cross-contamination of gluten-free food when preparing meals, in addition to utensils, surfaces and equipment. This study aimed to evaluate cross-contamination in gluten-free products and strategies for removing gluten from cross-contamination in cooking environments. The selection of papers for this integrative review was carried out by searching different databases. Gluten cross-contamination is a global concern for celiac patients in food environments. Although some practices are positive, such as gluten labeling on processed food in several countries, it is crucial to promote good practices in food services around the world. Only a few studies showed effective results in removing gluten from surfaces and utensils; furthermore, sampling was limited, making it difficult to identify appropriate procedures to reduce cross-contamination. The variation in contamination in different kitchen environments also highlighted that celiac patients must continue paying attention to the methods used to prepare gluten-free food. More research is needed, especially into methods of removing gluten from surfaces and utensils, to ensure food safety for celiac patients in many food environments.
29052687	Association Between Early-Life Antibiotic Use and the Risk of Islet or Celiac Disease Autoimmunity.	Importance: Evidence is lacking regarding the consequences of antibiotic use in early life and the risk of certain autoimmune diseases. Objective: To test the association between early-life antibiotic use and islet or celiac disease (CD) autoimmunity in genetically at-risk children prospectively followed up for type 1 diabetes (T1D) or CD. Design, Setting, and Participants: HLA-genotyped newborns from Finland, Germany, Sweden, and the United States were enrolled in the prospective birth cohort of The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study between November 20, 2004, and July 8, 2010. The dates of analysis were November 20, 2004, to August 31, 2014. Individuals from the general population and those having a first-degree relative with T1D were enrolled if they had 1 of 9 HLA genotypes associated with a risk for T1D. Exposures: Parental reports of the most common antibiotics (cephalosporins, penicillins, and macrolides) used between age 3 months and age 4 years were recorded prospectively. Main Outcomes and Measures: Islet autoimmunity and CD autoimmunity were defined as being positive for islet or tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies at 2 consecutive clinic visits at least 3 months apart. Hazard ratios and 95% CIs calculated from Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess the relationship between antibiotic use in early life before seroconversion and the development of autoimmunity. Results: Participants were 8495 children (49.0% female) and 6558 children (48.7% female) enrolled in the TEDDY study who were tested for islet and tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies, respectively. Exposure to and frequency of use of any antibiotic assessed in this study in early life or before seroconversion did not influence the risk of developing islet autoimmunity or CD autoimmunity. Cumulative use of any antibiotic during the first 4 years of life was not associated with the appearance of any autoantibody (hazard ratio [HR], 0.98; 95% CI, 0.95-1.01), multiple islet autoantibodies (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.95-1.03), or the transglutaminase autoantibody (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.98-1.02). Conclusions and Relevance: The use of the most prescribed antibiotics during the first 4 years of life, regardless of geographic region, was not associated with the development of autoimmunity for T1D or CD. These results suggest that a risk of islet or tissue transglutaminase autoimmunity need not influence the recommendations for clinical use of antibiotics in young children at risk for T1D or CD.
34231664	SERONEGATIVE CELIAC DISEASE IN BRAZILIAN PATIENTS: A SERIES OF CASES.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease characterized by immune reaction mostly to wheat gluten. The diagnosis is based on clinical, serological and histological findings in patients ingesting gluten. Cases that the clinical profile indicates CD and the autoantibodies are negative bring so a dilemma for the professional, as the risk of missed the diagnosis or a delay at the same. OBJECTIVE: To show the importance of correct diagnosis of cases with seronegative celiac disease (SNCD). METHODS: Ten cases of SNCD Brazilian patients were retrospectively studied (2013 to 2019). Data of clinical complaints, autoantibodies, IgA serum levels, histological findings and HLA-DQ2/DQ-8 were compiled. Dual-X densitometry, delay at diagnosis, previous autoimmune diseases and family history of CD were also checked. RESULTS: All SNCD patients presented clinical symptoms of CD, with confirmed diagnosis by histological findings of the duodenal mucosa and HLA-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8 positivity. All patients had normal IgA levels and negative autoantibodies (IgA-anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysial). Dual-X densitometry detected osteopenia in two women and osteoporosis in two males, all with low levels of vitamin D. Delay diagnostic ranged from 1 to 19 years. Familiar occurrence of CD was reported in 40% of the cases. After one year of gluten-free diet, eight patients refer improve of symptoms, while duodenal biopsies, done in five cases, showed histological improvement. CONCLUSION: Patients who demonstrate the clinical profile of celiac disease with negative serology and normal levels of IgA, especially those who have family members with celiac disease, should be submitted to duodenal biopsies to look for histological findings.
33346575	The Knowledge About Celiac Disease Among Healthcare Professionals and Patients in Central Europe.	OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease (CD) remains undiagnosed for a long time in many adult and pediatric patients. We assessed the knowledge about CD among healthcare professionals (HCPs) and CD patients in Central Europe (CE). METHODS: HCPs and CD patients from 5 CE countries were asked to complete the web-based questionnaire about CD. The questions were divided into subsections on epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnostics, treatment, and follow-up. Achieved scores of different specialists managing patients with CD were compared and regional differences in patients' knowledge were analyzed. RESULTS: Questionnaire was completed by 1381 HCPs and 2262 CD patients or their caregivers from Croatia, Hungary, Germany, Italy, and Slovenia. Mean score achieved by HCPs was 50.9%, and by CD patients 56.4%. Pediatric gastroenterologists scored the highest (69.4%; P < 0.001). There were significant differences in knowledge of patients from different CE regions with German participants scoring the highest (58.3%). Members of CD societies scored higher compared with nonmembers (mean score 58% vs 53.2%; P < 0.001) and patients diagnosed less than 5 years ago scored higher compared with those diagnosed more than 10 years ago (mean score 57.3% vs 54.6%; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The knowledge about CD among HCPs and CD patients is not satisfactory. Further awareness-raising and learning activities are needed to improve HCPs' knowledge and to minimize the number of unrecognized patients and unnecessary diagnostic delays. Patients should be better informed about their disease to reach higher compliance with the gluten-free diet.
38142746	Maintaining the gluten-free diet: The key to improve glycemic metrics in youths with type 1 diabetes and celiac disease.	AIMS: Gluten-free diets (GFD) were considered as high glycemic index and/or high content of saturated fats; this could affect keeping good metabolic control in individuals with both type 1 diabetes (T1D) and celiac disease (CD). Our objective was to analyze time in range and other continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) metrics with real-time CGM systems, in youths with T1D and CD, compared to those with T1D only. METHODS: An observational case-control study, comparing youths aged 8-18 years with T1D and CD, with people with T1D only was performed. The degree of maintaining GFD was assessed through anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies and dietary interview, and maintaining Mediterranean diet through the KIDMED questionnaire. RESULTS: 86 youths with T1D and CD, 167 controls with T1D only, were included in the study and the two groups reported similar real-time CGM metrics. Among the first group, 29 % were not completely maintaining GFD and compared to people with T1D only they showed higher hyperglycemia rates (% time above range: 38.72 +- 20.94 vs 34.34 +- 20.94; P = 0.039). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with T1D and CD who maintain GFD presented similar glucose metrics compared to youths with T1D only. Individuals not strictly maintaining GFD presented higher hyperglycemia rates.
35758521	ESPGHAN Position Paper on Management and Follow-up of Children and Adolescents With Celiac Disease.	OBJECTIVES: To gather the current evidence and to offer recommendations for follow-up and management. METHODS: The Special Interest Group on Celiac Diseases of the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition formulated ten questions considered to be essential for follow-up care. A literature search (January 2010-March 2020) was performed in PubMed or Medline. Relevant publications were identified and potentially eligible studies were assessed. Statements and recommendations were developed and discussed by all coauthors. Recommendations were voted upon: joint agreement was set as at least 85%. RESULTS: Publications (n = 2775) were identified and 164 were included. Using evidence or expert opinion, 37 recommendations were formulated on: The need to perform follow-up, its frequency and what should be assessed, how to assess adherence to the gluten-free diet, when to expect catch-up growth, how to treat anemia, how to approach persistent high serum levels of antibodies against tissue-transglutaminase, the indication to perform biopsies, assessment of quality of life, management of children with unclear diagnosis for which a gluten-challenge is indicated, children with associated type 1 diabetes or IgA deficiency, cases of potential celiac disease, which professionals should perform follow-up, how to improve the communication to patients and their parents/caregivers and transition from pediatric to adult health care. CONCLUSIONS: We offer recommendations to improve follow-up of children and adolescents with celiac disease and highlight gaps that should be investigated to further improve management.
32441135	Examining core self-management skills among adolescents with celiac disease.	A strict gluten-free diet is the only treatment for celiac disease, and it is especially challenging among adolescents. Participation in food-related activities and self-managing the chronic health condition involve use of cognitive skills. This cross-sectional study examined how executive functions might be associated with participation in food-related activities. Adolescents aged 12-18 years (N = 65; Mage = 14.67) with celiac were interviewed about participation, and their parents completed an executive function questionnaire. Poorer participation significantly correlated with poorer executive abilities. Identifying executive function profiles may contribute to understanding and advancing resourceful daily functioning and participation in daily food-related activities.
34431805	Sustained Remission of Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy Associated With Celiac Disease After Immunotherapy and Gluten-Free Diet.	
36262236	Food security of people with celiac disease in the Republic of Moldova through prism of public policies.	Food security is an important lever for the implementation of rights-based legislation, policies, and programs, while being a public health and socio-economic priority. Foodborne illnesses have a major impact on public health, and nutritional interventions are essential therapeutic strategies to combat them. Gluten ingestion has been linked to several clinical disorders, collectively called gluten-related disorders. The most serious of these is celiac disease. The only way to treat celiac disease is to stick to a gluten-free diet for life. Following a strict diet is also the only way to prevent the long-term consequences of the disease. Public policies are essential to ensure the food security of people with gluten-related disorders. The aim of the research is to assess the level of care for people with celiac disease in the Republic of Moldova, in terms of public policies, to ensure a sustainable sector that effectively satisfies the food security of people with disorders associated with gluten consumption. To assess the level of care for people with gluten-related disorders, the working algorithm was taken, with reference to global public policies in support of people with celiac disease, developed and validated by Falcomer et al., Focused on 6 items. The results of the study showed that the Republic of Moldova does not have adequate policy support to ensure food security for people with gluten-related disorders, which poses major challenges and, as a result, may increase the complications of these problems.
32333077	A compact SPR biosensor device for the rapid and efficient monitoring of gluten-free diet directly in human urine.	Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic autoimmune disorder induced in genetically susceptible individuals by the ingestion of gluten from wheat, rye, barley, or certain varieties of oats. A careful diet follow-up is necessary to avoid health complications associated with long-term gluten intake by the celiac patients. Small peptides (GIP, gluten immunogenic peptides) derived from gluten digestion, which are excreted in the urine and feces, have emerged as promising biomarkers to monitor gluten intake. We have implemented a simple and sensitive label-free point-of-care (POC) device based on surface plasmon resonance for the direct detection of these biomarkers in urine. The assay employs specific monoclonal antibodies and has been optimized for the detection of the 33-mer alpha2-gliadin, known as the main immunogenic peptide of wheat gluten, and for the detection of GIP. Direct detection in undiluted urine has been accomplished by using biosensing chips containing a robust and stable biorecognition layer, obtained after carefully optimizing the biofunctionalization protocol. Excellent limits of detection have been reached (1.6-4.0 ng mL-1 using mAb G12 and A1, respectively), which ensures the detection of gluten peptides even when the gluten intake is around the maximum tolerable amount in the digestive tract (< 50 mg) for celiac individuals. No sample pretreatment, extraction, or dilution is required, and the analysis takes less than 15 min. The assays have excellent reproducibility' as demonstrated by measuring spiked urine samples containing the same target concentration using different biofunctionalized chips prepared and stored at different periods of time (i.e., CV% of 3.58% and 11.30%, for G12- and A1-based assays, respectively). The assay has been validated with real samples. These features pave the way towards an end-user easy-to-handle biosensor device for the rapid monitoring of gluten-free diet (GFD) and follow-up of the health status in celiac patients.
30087270	Rebuilding the Gut Microbiota Ecosystem.	A microbial ecosystem in which bacteria no longer live in a mutualistic association is called dysbiotic. Gut microbiota dysbiosis is a condition related with the pathogenesis of intestinal illnesses (irritable bowel syndrome, celiac disease, and inflammatory bowel disease) and extra-intestinal illnesses (obesity, metabolic disorder, cardiovascular syndrome, allergy, and asthma). Dysbiosis status has been related to various important pathologies, and many therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring the balance of the intestinal ecosystem have been implemented. These strategies include the administration of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics; phage therapy; fecal transplantation; bacterial consortium transplantation; and a still poorly investigated approach based on predatory bacteria. This review discusses the various aspects of these strategies to counteract intestinal dysbiosis.
32374905	In Celiac Disease Patients the In Vivo Challenge with the Diploid Triticum monococcum Elicits a Reduced Immune Response Compared to Hexaploid Wheat.	SCOPE: Gluten from the diploid wheat Triticum monococcum (TM) has low content of immunostimulatory sequences and a high gastro-intestinal digestibility. Gluten-reactive T cells elicited by diploid and hexaploid (Triticum aestivum-TA) wheat in celiac disease (CD) patients upon a brief oral challenge are analyzed. METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventeen patients with CD (median age 13 years) consumed for 3 days sandwiches made with TM (cultivar Norberto-ID331, N=11), or TA (cultivar Sagittario, N=11) flours, corresponding to 12 gr of gluten/die. Immunostimulatory properties are assessed in blood by measuring the IFN-gamma-secreting T cells by EliSpot and the expression of inflammatory cytokines/receptors (IL-12A, IL-15, IL-18RAP, IFN-gamma) by qPCR. TA mobilizes a remarkable number of gliadin-specific, IFN-gamma-secreting T cells (p<0.05), while no significant cell mobilization is induced by TM (p=ns). Similar results are obtained in response to five immunogenic peptides from alpha-, omega-, and gamma-gliadins, although with a large individual variability. An increased mRNA expression for IL-12A and IFN-gamma is detected in the group eating TA compared to those consuming TM (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Although T. monococcum is a cereal not suitable for the diet of celiacs, this diploid wheat elicits a reduced in vivo T-cell response compared to T. aestivum in celiac patients.
31952665	Concepts and Instruments for Patient-Reported Outcome Assessment in Celiac Disease: Literature Review and Experts' Perspectives.	BACKGROUND: In diseases where there is a large subjective component, such as celiac disease (CD), patient reported-outcomes (PRO) endpoints are highly relevant. However, there is a gap in knowledge about which PRO endpoints and instruments should be used for clinical trials for treatment of celiac disease. OBJECTIVES: To identify patient-centered symptom, impact, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) concepts in CD and relevant PRO instruments, and to gather expert input on concepts and instruments to inform selection of PRO endpoints for use in clinical trials of new CD treatments. METHODS: A targeted literature review was conducted to identify symptom, impact, and HRQoL concepts, including those captured in PROs further reviewed against U.S. Food and Drug Administration standards for development and validation as endpoints. US and European clinicians, payers, and a patient advocate (n = 21) were interviewed to assess the identified concepts' relative importance in measuring treatment benefit and to gauge the value of potential PROs as endpoints for market access/reimbursement. RESULTS: Thirty-four published studies were identified: 27 elucidated patient-centered concepts and 7 detailed the development or validation of PRO instruments. The Celiac Disease Symptom Diary and Celiac Disease Patient Reported Outcome instrument were deemed most appropriate for use as endpoints; however, each had limitations related to conceptual coverage, evidence for measurement properties, and feasibility for use in clinical trials. Experts reported gastrointestinal symptoms as most important to treat, with extra-intestinal symptoms burdensome from the patient perspective as well. Payers emphasized measuring both frequency and severity of symptoms and targeting patients nonresponsive to the gluten-free diet for treatment. CONCLUSIONS: With emerging treatment options for CD, further work is needed to operationalize PRO symptom endpoints that are meaningful to patients, valued by payers, and acceptable to regulators in demonstrating efficacy.
36251239	Novel Drug Therapeutics in Celiac Disease: A Pipeline Review.	Celiac disease (CeD) is a chronic, autoimmune systemic disorder triggered by the ingestion of gluten, a protein found in foods such as wheat, rye, and barley. The only effective treatment for CeD is complete removal of gluten from the diet. A strict gluten-free diet (GFD) results in symptomatic, serologic, and histologic remission in most patients. However, GFD may fail to induce clinical or histologic improvement and some patients may alternatively have difficulty strictly adhering to the GFD for other reasons. Despite this, there are currently no FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of CeD. The complex pathogenic process of CeD is becoming increasingly studied and better understood, enabling the identification of various targets for future therapies. Mechanisms under evaluation include probiotics, digestion of peptides, gluten sensitization, tight junction modulation, deamidation, and immune targets. Multiple investigational drugs are in the pipeline, and several drug candidates have entered late-phase clinical trials. Indeed, current and future studies are needed to target specific etiological mechanisms and provide an alternative to GFD alone. This review provides a broad overview of the various investigative treatment approaches for CeD, summarizing the latest progress in the pipeline.
36839296	Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet and Ultra-Processed Foods Consumption in a Group of Italian Patients with Celiac Disease.	Evidence on the consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPF) in adults with celiac disease (CD) and its impact on Mediterranean Diet (MD) adherence is still limited. Our aim was to determine UPF consumption and its relationship with MD adherence in a group of adults, according to the presence of CD. This case-control study included 103 adults with CD and 312 without CD. UPF intake was assessed using the NOVA Food Frequency Questionnaire (NFFQ), while MD adherence was assessed using the Medi-Lite score. UPF represented 14.5% of the diet of participants with CD (246 g/day) and came mainly from cereals-based products (29%) and sweets (24.2%). UPF consumption did not differ with the presence of CD, but participants with CD had significantly (p < 0.05) higher consumption of precooked pasta and pre-packaged breads. Participants with CD also reported a significantly lower MD adherence than participants without CD (9.4 vs. 10.4), with higher intake of meat and dairy products, and lower consumption of vegetables and fish. An inverse trend was found between UPF consumption and MD adherence in adults with CD, although not statistically significant. These findings highlight the importance of improving nutrition education for subjects with CD, which should not only focus on gluten exclusion.
32404753	Child and Parent Mental Health Problems in Pediatric Celiac Disease: A Prospective Study.	OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to estimate the levels of mental health problems in children with celiac disease (CD) along with their parents' mental health status, to compare these levels with those of healthy controls and to investigate how these problems are affected by a gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: Our study constituted 50 patients with CD at diagnosis before the initiation of a GFD (age 8.6 +- 3.7 years, group A), 39 patients with CD on a GFD for at least 12 months (age 10.4 +- 3.4 years, group B) and 38 healthy controls (age 7.7 +- 3.8 years, group C), as well as their parents. One of the parents of each child completed the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) and the Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90-R) to evaluate the children's and parents' mental health problems, respectively. Twenty patients in group A were reevaluated at least 12 months after initiation of a GFD (group D). RESULTS: At diagnosis, CD patients had higher scores in the CBCL for internalizing problems than healthy controls (55.7 +- 10.3 vs 47.9 +- 15.4, P = 0.007) and their parents demonstrated increased severity of mental health problems, including anxiety and depression, than the parents of healthy controls (0.72 +- 0.49 vs 0.54 +- 0.58, P = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: CD patients at diagnosis and their parents, had more mental health problems, including anxiety and depression, than healthy controls.
29094324	A Caucasian American patient with celiac disease diagnosed in Japan and successfully treated with a gluten-free diet.	We report the case of a 33-year-old Caucasian American man diagnosed with celiac disease in Japan. He presented to a community hospital because of chronic watery diarrhea and weight loss for 6 months. The laboratory data showed low serum albumin and serum cholesterol. A colonoscopy was normal. He was referred to our hospital for further work-up. Serum tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin A (IgA) and endomysial antibody were positive. The HLA type was DQ2. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed nodular and mosaic-patterned mucosa from the bulb to the second part of the duodenum. The histopathological findings were consistent with Marsh type 3c of the modified Marsh classification for celiac disease. The patient was instructed to follow a gluten-free diet (GFD). Six months after the initiation of the GFD, his symptom and the levels of serum albumin and cholesterol were improved, and the serum tissue transglutaminase IgA and endomysial antibody became negative. However, EGD showed little improvement. Capsule endoscopy also revealed mosaic-patterned mucosa, nodular mucosa, and scalloping of the folds of the duodenum and proximal small intestine. There was no definite improvement in histopathological findings. Collectively, the GFD was effective in this patient with celiac disease, but it should be maintained to achieve endoscopic and histopathologic healing.
35947766	Risk of obesity during a gluten-free diet in pediatric and adult patients with celiac disease: a systematic review with meta-analysis.	CONTEXT: Obesity is a significant risk factor for many pathological conditions. Whether a gluten-free diet (GFD) is a risk factor for overweight or obesity remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of body mass index (BMI) categories at disease presentation and the variation in BMI category from underweight/normal to overweight/obese and vice versa during a GFD. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched through February 2021 for retrospective, cross-sectional, and prospective studies reporting BMI categories at disease diagnosis and during a GFD. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted by 2 reviewers independently. Disagreements were resolved by consensus; a third reviewer was consulted, if necessary. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane ROBINS-I tool. DATA ANALYSIS: Subgroup analysis based on age (pediatric/adult patients), study design (prospective, cross-sectional, retrospective), and duration of GFD was performed.. Forty-five studies were selected (7959 patients with celiac disease and 20 524 healthy controls). The mean BMI of celiac patients at presentation was significantly lower than that of controls (P < 0.001). During a GFD, the mean BMI increased significantly (mean difference = 1.14 kg/m2 [95%CI, 0.68-1.60 kg/m2]; I2 = 82.8%; P < 0.001), but only 9% of patients (95%CI, 7%-12%; I2 = 80.0%) changed from the underweight/normal BMI category to the overweight/obese category, while 20% (95%CI, 11%-29%; I2 = 85.8%) moved into a lower BMI category. CONCLUSION: Most celiac patients had a normal BMI at presentation, although the mean BMI was significantly lower than that of controls. A GFD does not increase the risk of becoming overweight/obese, especially in children. The quality of several studies was suboptimal, with moderate or high overall risk of bias and heterogeneity.
30105887	The influence of treatment, age at onset, and metabolic control on height in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes-A SWEET collaborative study.	OBJECTIVE: To describe the association between height, demographics, and treatment in youths with type 1 diabetes participating in an international network for pediatric diabetes centers (SWEET). METHODS: Data were collected from 55 centers with documented patients' height. All subjects below 20 years of age, diabetes duration >1 year, and without celiac disease were included. World Health Organization growth charts were used to calculate height and body mass index z-scores. Multiple hierarchic regression models adjusting for known confounders were applied. RESULTS: Data on 22 941 subjects (51.8% male) were analyzed with a median and interquartile range for age 14.8 years (11.2, 17.6), diabetes duration 5.6 years (3.1, 8.9), and height z-score 0.34 (-0.37, 1.03). Children were taller in the youngest age groups: adjusted height z-scores of 0.31 (+-0.06) and 0.39 (+-0.06), respectively; with shorter diabetes duration (<2 years: 0.36 [+-0.06]; 2-<5 years: 0.34 [+-0.06]; >=5 years: 0.21 [+-0.06]) and if they were pump users: 0.35 +- 0.05 vs 0.25 +- 0.05 (>three injections/day and 0.19 +- 0.06 [0-3 injections daily]), respectively. High hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and low to normal weight were associated with a lower height z-score. Trends were identical in all models except for gender. No gender differences were found except in the final height model where females exhibited higher z-score than males. CONCLUSION: For youths treated at centers offering modern diabetes management, major growth disturbances are virtually eliminated. For children with a young age at onset, high HbA1c, injections, and/or non-intensive diabetes, treatment still requires attention in order to attain normal growth.
30701867	Is it necessary to use capsular endoscopy to diagnose celiac disease?	AIM: To clarify the indications for capsular endoscopy (CE) in patients with celiac disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 10 patients with celiac disease (6 women, 4 men) aged 22 to 69 years. The median age was 42.4+-17.5 years. The diagnosis of celiac disease established on the basis of histological examination of the mucous membrane (MM) of the duodenum and detection of antibodies to diaminononane peptide gliadin and to tissue transglutaminase. In three patients celiac disease was diagnosed for the first time, in others - in terms of 3 months to 2 years. CE was performed using a Given Imaging systems (Yokneam, Israel), Olympus (Japan), the obtained data were analyzed using Rapidr  Reade (version 7.0). The results of the endoscopy were compared with the data of 78 patients examined by us, in which the indicators conformed to the normal CE criteria. RESULTS: All patients with celiac disease showed characteristic endoscopic markers of atrophy from the small intestine: scallop, nodularity, decrease in height and number of folds. Paid attention to the mosaic of defeat in the form of &quot;atrophy fields&quot; against a background of slightly modified MM. Erosive-ulcerative lesions of the small intestine were found in 4 patients. CONCLUSION: Indications for the appointment of CE in patients with celiac disease is the lack of response to treatment, which is based on strict adherence to gluten-free diet, the assumption of erosive and ulcerative lesions MM of the small intestine and refractory form of the disease. CE makes it possible to establish the extent of atrophy from the small intestine, which allows you to use it to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment.
35010876	Nutrition in Patients with Lactose Malabsorption, Celiac Disease, and Related Disorders.	Lactose malabsorption (LM), celiac disease (CD), non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are conditions associated with food triggers, improvement after withdrawal, treatment with dietary restriction, and subsequent nutritional detriments. LM occurs when there is incomplete hydrolysis of lactose due to lactase deficiency and frequently produces abdominal symptoms; therefore, it can cause lactose intolerance (LI). A lactose-restricted diet is frequently recommended, although it can potentially lead to nutrient deficiencies. Furthermore, lactose is an essential component of fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) and is subsequently associated with intolerance to these compounds, especially in IBS. LM commonly presents in CD. Nutritional deficits are common in CD and can continue even on a gluten-free diet (GFD). Conditions triggered by gluten are known as gluten-related disorders (GRDs), including CD, wheat allergy, and NCGS. IBS can also be associated with a gluten sensitivity. A GFD is the treatment for CD, GRDs, and gluten sensitive IBS, although compliance with this restricted diet can be difficult. Strict dietary therapies can have a negative effect on quality of life. This review aims to provide an overview of the difficult nutritional elements of these disorders, which are critical for medical providers to recognize when managing these patients.
37960188	Celiac Disease Dietary Adherence on the Rural-Urban Continuum.	Poor adherence to a gluten-free diet for those with celiac disease is a well-established risk factor, leading to gastrointestinal symptoms, malabsorption of nutrients, and psychiatric complications. Previous studies have shown that those outside urban areas encounter unique barriers to dietary adherence and are less likely to engage in health management behaviors than those in urban regions. This study aimed to examine the relationship between gluten-free dietary adherence and individual, relationship, and community factors, including the geographic location of residence on the rural-urban continuum, for 253 adults with celiac disease living in the United States. Those with celiac disease residing in urban regions had significantly better dietary adherence than those residing in nonurban areas (p < 0.05). Those living in nonurban communities had, on average, poor enough adherence scores to suggest ongoing intestinal damage from gluten consumption. Geographic location, age, years since diagnosis, and annual income significantly predicted compliance with a gluten-free diet for those with celiac disease, accounting for nearly 20% of the variance. Those living outside urban areas with a lower income, younger age, and more recent diagnosis of celiac disease had the worst dietary adherence, placing them at the most risk for ongoing disease progression and complications.
32902326	Teaching Families of Children with Celiac Disease about Gluten-Free Diet Using Distributed Education: a Pilot Study.	Introduction: Treatment of celiac disease is a strict life-long gluten-free diet (GFD). The GFD is complex, and counseling by a dietitian is essential. The number of new referrals for GFD education has increased. We studied the feasibility of GFD teaching using distributed education.Methods: The IWK Health Center in Halifax is the only tertiary-care pediatric hospital in the 3 Maritime provinces with GFD experienced dietitians. Families travel long distances to attend teaching sessions. Families outside the Halifax area were offered to participate in the 2.5-hour education sessions held once a month via live videoconference link at their regional hospitals. All participants were surveyed with a 10-item questionnaire assessing the content and delivery and usefulness of information.Results: Over a 6-month period, 39 families attended the sessions, 21 locally and 18 at distributed sites across the Maritimes. The survey was completed by 26 participants (67%). All participants at both sites strongly agreed or agreed that their setting was good for learning and the information provided was easy to understand. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups on any individual questions in the 2 domains assessed (all P > 0.06).Conclusions: Distributed education on GFD is feasible and as effective as in person education. It affords convenience and savings to families by reducing travel costs.
29093615	Less common etiologies of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.	Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), an important cause of maldigestion and malabsorption, results from primary pancreatic diseases or secondarily impaired exocrine pancreatic function. Besides cystic fibrosis and chronic pancreatitis, the most common etiologies of EPI, other causes of EPI include unresectable pancreatic cancer, metabolic diseases (diabetes); impaired hormonal stimulation of exocrine pancreatic secretion by cholecystokinin (CCK); celiac or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) due to loss of intestinal brush border proteins; and gastrointestinal surgery (asynchrony between motor and secretory functions, impaired enteropancreatic feedback, and inadequate mixing of pancreatic secretions with food). This paper reviews such conditions that have less straightforward associations with EPI and examines the role of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT). Relevant literature was identified by database searches. Most patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer develop EPI (66%-92%). EPI occurs in patients with type 1 (26%-57%) or type 2 diabetes (20%-36%) and is typically mild to moderate; by definition, all patients with type 3c (pancreatogenic) diabetes have EPI. EPI occurs in untreated celiac disease (4%-80%), but typically resolves on a gluten-free diet. EPI manifests in patients with IBD (14%-74%) and up to 100% of gastrointestinal surgery patients (47%-100%; dependent on surgical site). With the paucity of published studies on PERT use for these conditions, recommendations for or against PERT use remain ambiguous. The authors conclude that there is an urgent need to conduct robust clinical studies to understand the validity and nature of associations between EPI and medical conditions beyond those with proven mechanisms, and examine the potential role for PERT.
32097372	Adherence to Gluten-free Diet in a Celiac Pediatric Population Referred to the General Pediatrician After Remission.	OBJECTIVES: Assessment of adherence to gluten-free diet in celiac disease (CD) is generally recommended. Few data are available about consequences of transition from the referral center to the general pediatrician (GP) once remission is achieved. METHODS: Adherence was assessed in patients referred to the GP for an annual basis follow-up, called back for re-evaluation. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) antitissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) antibodies and the Biagi score (BS) were determined at last follow-up at the referral center (V1), and at re-evaluation (V2). Patients were classified as adherent (BS 3-4, IgA anti-tTG <7 U/mL) and nonadherent (BS 0-2, IgA anti-tTG >=7). Scores of adherence were correlated with personal and clinical data. RESULTS: We evaluated 200 patients. Overall, we found good adherence rates in 94.95% of patients at V1 and 83.5% at V2. IgA anti-tTG were negative in 100% at V1 and 96.97% at V2. BS is 3 to 4 in 94.5% at V1 and 84% at V2. Adherence at V2 was significantly worse than V1 (P < 0.001). No significant associations were found between scores of adherence and sex, symptoms and age at diagnosis, family history of CD, comorbidity, and diagnosis by endoscopy. Age 13 years or older represents a risk factor for lack of compliance at V1 (P = 0.02) and V2 (P = 0.04), and foreign nationality at V2 (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The BS, serology, and a clinical interview, integrated, are reliable tools for assessing pediatric adherence to gluten-free diet. We argue that referring patients to the GP after remission of CD is important, but the process must be improved and recommendations are required.
29315154	Characteristics and comorbidities of inpatients without celiac disease on a gluten-free diet.	OBJECTIVES: Despite the increasing popularity of gluten-free diet (GFD), the demographic characteristics and medical features of patients without celiac disease on this diet have not been extensively investigated.We aimed to characterize the medical conditions and demographic backgrounds of hospitalized patients without celiac disease who adhere to a GFD, to further understand their reasons for gluten avoidance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed an observational cohort study on all inpatients at Columbia University Medical Center on a GFD in 2011-2016, excluding those with celiac disease, compared with age-matched and sex-matched inpatients on a regular diet. We determined the odds ratio (OR) of being on a GFD for various comorbidities using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 769 inpatients on a GFD, most (63.6%) did not have celiac disease. Gluten-avoiding patients were more likely to be non-Hispanic Whites [OR: 2.92; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.31-3.70]. They had a lower prevalence of hypertension (OR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.27-0.52) and diabetes (OR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.32-0.75) and higher prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (OR: 1.56; 95% CI: 1.02-2.41), irritable bowel syndrome (OR: 6.16; 95% CI: 2.11-10.23), hyperthyroidism (OR: 2.73; 95% CI: 1.22-6.10), hypothyroidism (OR: 2.06; 95% CI: 1.39-3.06), lupus (OR: 2.87; 95% CI: 1.13-7.29), and autism spectrum disorder (OR: 23.42; 95% CI: 5.29-103.73). CONCLUSION: Nonceliac gluten-avoiding patients have higher prevalences of inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, thyroid disease, lupus, and autism spectrum disorder, suggesting patients with these disorders have turned to a GFD for perceived benefit, despite a scant evidence basis.
30545212	Gluten-free diet in non-celiac patients: beliefs, truths, advantages and disadvantages.	A gluten-free diet is the safest treatment for the treatment of patient with celiac disease (CD) and other gluten-related disorders. However, in the last years, gluten-free diet is one of the most popular diet followed by the general population and by patients affected from others clinical conditions, such as non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), autism, neurological, psychiatric and rheumatologic diseases and for improving sports practice. This review highlights some questions about the appropriateness of following this trend answering to some questions such as how safe are the current gluten-free products, what are the benefits and side effects of gluten-free diet and what are clinical conditions that might benefit from gluten avoidance.
29560673	An unusual cause of severe, persistent diarrhoea.	We present two cases of patients with severe persistent diarrhoea, in whom duodenal biopsies revealed villous atrophy that could be attributed to the use of olmesartan. The differential diagnosis of villous atrophy without serological markers of celiac disease should include drugs as possible cause, with olmesartan as a recently discovered culprit. Gastroenterologist should be aware of this entity.
34065154	Health-Related Quality of Life and Experiences of Brazilian Celiac Individuals over the Course of the Sars-Cov-2 Pandemic.	Since the end of 2019, the world has been facing an unpredicted COVID-19 pandemic with consequences for the economy, environment, society, and health. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk of death, bringing unbearable psychological pressure upon people worldwide. For celiac patients, the pandemic may represent an additional burden concerning the inherent aspects of celiac disease (CD) that compromise these individuals' quality of life (QoL). Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate Brazilian celiac patients' QoL during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by its outbreak and rapid spread and subsequent restrictive measures in addition to the dietary restrictions and other burdens caused by CD. This country-wide cross-sectional study was conducted using a self-administered instrument previously validated in Brazilian-Portuguese to investigate the QoL of individuals with CD. Data collected through the online self-administration of the Brazilian version of the celiac disease quality of life questionnaire (CDQ) comprised 674 CD individuals' responses. Although pandemics have historically posed a challenge for Brazilian population, this period was not associated with a negative impact on Brazilian CD individuals' QoL. During the pandemic, the QoL of Brazilian's with CD was more affected by gastrointestinal aspects than emotions and social aspects and worries. Gender, age, marital status, having (or not) children, occupation, and a positive test for COVID-19 did not affect CD individuals' QoL. However, the study revealed a larger burden and diminished QoL for individuals not following a gluten-free diet and those using antidepressants. Additional research is necessary to verify how the length of the pandemic will affect celiac individuals and then compare those outcomes compare to the COVID-19 period and after.
35839368	Celiac Disease: Common Questions and Answers.	Celiac disease is an immune-mediated, multisystem disorder that affects genetically susceptible individuals who are exposed to gluten-containing grains such as wheat, barley, and rye. The condition can develop at any age. Celiac disease presents with a variety of manifestations such as diarrhea, weight loss, abdominal pain, bloating, malabsorption, and failure to thrive. Most adult patients will present with nonclassic symptoms, including less specific gastrointestinal symptoms or extraintestinal manifestations such as anemia, osteoporosis, transaminitis, and recurrent miscarriage. Immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase serologic testing is the recommended initial screening for all age groups. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with small bowel biopsy is recommended to confirm the diagnosis in most patients, including those with a negative serologic test for whom clinical suspicion of celiac disease persists. Biopsies may be avoided in children with high immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase (i.e., 10 times the upper limit of normal or more) and a positive test for immunoglobulin A endomysial antibodies in a second serum sample. Genetic testing for human leukocyte antigen alleles DQ2 or DQ8 may be performed in select cases. A gluten-free diet for life is the primary treatment, and patients may benefit from support groups and education on common and hidden sources of gluten, gluten-free substitutes, food labeling, balanced meal planning, dining out, dining during travel, and avoiding cross-contamination. Patients with celiac disease who do not respond to a gluten-free diet should have the accuracy of the diagnosis confirmed, have their diet reassessed, and be evaluated for coexisting conditions. Patients with refractory celiac disease should be treated by a gastroenterologist.
32762724	An updated overview of spectrum of gluten-related disorders: clinical and diagnostic aspects.	The incidence of gluten-related disorders (GRDs) continues to increase and its global prevalence is estimated at approximately 5% of the population. Celiac disease (CD), dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), gluten ataxia (GA), wheat allergy (WA), and non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) are the five major GRDs that present with a wide range of clinical manifestations. The diagnosis of GRDs can be challenging because the typical and atypical clinical manifestations of the GRDs overlap. In this review, the current definitions of gluten-related disorders, focusing on their clinical features, diagnostic and therapeutic approaches are presented. We concluded that GRDs are usually diagnosed using a combination of clinical features, serological tests, and histopathological findings. Treatment usually involves dietary modification.
35216089	Inflammation Is Present, Persistent and More Sensitive to Proinflammatory Triggers in Celiac Disease Enterocytes.	Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by a genetic predisposition to an abnormal T cell-mediated immune response to the gluten in the diet. Different environmental proinflammatory factors can influence and amplify the T cell-mediated response to gluten. The aim of this manuscript was to study the role of enterocytes in CD intestinal inflammation and their response to different proinflammatory factors, such as gliadin and viruses. Intestinal biopsies from CD patients on a gluten-containing (GCD-CD) or a gluten-free diet (GFD-CD) as well as biopsies from potential CD patients (Pot-CD) before the onset of intestinal lesions and controls (CTR) were used to investigate IL-1beta and IL-6 mRNA levels in situ. Organoids from CD patients were used to test the levels of NF-kappaB, ERK, IL-6, and IL-1beta by Western blot (WB), ELISA, and quantitative PCR. The Toll-like receptor ligand loxoribine (Lox) and gliadin peptide P31-43 were used as proinflammatory stimuli. In CD biopsies inflammation markers IL-1beta and IL-6 were increased in the enterocytes, and also in Pot-CD before the onset of the intestinal lesion and in GFD-CD. The inflammatory markers pNF-kappaB, pERK, IL-1beta, and IL-6 were increased and persistent in CD organoids; these organoids were more sensitive to P31-43 and Lox stimuli compared with CTR organoids. Taken together, these observations point to constitutive inflammation in CD enterocytes, which are more sensitive to inflammatory stimuli such as food components and viruses.

29235012	Implications of Celiac Disease Among Patients Undergoing Gastric Bypass.	INTRODUCTION: Bariatric surgery is generally safe and effective, but co-existing malabsorptive processes may increase the risk of complications or nutritional deficiencies. Bariatric surgery has not been well studied in the setting of pre-existing celiac disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) from January 2002 to December 2015 were retrospectively reviewed for either diagnosis of or serum testing for celiac disease. Identified patients were re-reviewed for adherence to American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) diagnostic criteria. Patient demographics, operative data, and post-operative weight loss and nutritional parameters were collected. RESULTS: Of the > 12,000 patients who underwent bariatric surgery during this study period, there were 342 patients that had abnormal serology or pathology results. Expert review confirmed three patients (0.8%) with celiac disease diagnosed before RYGB procedure. All were female, with an average age of 33 years and a mean BMI of 44.07 kg/m2. At the time of surgery, two of the three patients were following a gluten-free diet. At 6 months follow-up, mean % excess weight loss was 76.5%. The patients following a gluten-free diet preoperatively continued post-operatively. No patients were anemic nor had vitamin B12 or iron deficiencies at 12-month follow-up. Two patients had vitamin D insufficiencies and responded to daily oral supplementation. CONCLUSION: Though many bariatric patients may carry a presumptive diagnosis of celiac disease, a small percentage of these meet AGA diagnostic criteria. RYGB appears safe in this population with comparable weight loss in non-celiac counterparts. Increased attention to vitamin D levels may be warranted post-operatively.
32217152	Real-World Gluten Exposure in Patients With Celiac Disease on Gluten-Free Diets, Determined From Gliadin Immunogenic Peptides in Urine and Fecal Samples.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: It is not clear how often patients who are on gluten-free diets (GFDs) for treatment of celiac disease still are exposed to gluten. We studied levels of gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) in fecal and urine samples, collected over 4 weeks, from patients with celiac disease on a long-term GFD. METHODS: We performed a prospective study of 53 adults with celiac disease who had been on a GFD for more than 2 years (median duration, 8 y; interquartile range, 5-12 y) in Argentina. At baseline, symptoms were assessed by the celiac symptom index questionnaire. Patients collected stool each Friday and Saturday and urine samples each Sunday for 4 weeks. We used a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure GIP in stool and point-of-care tests to measure GIP in urine samples. RESULTS: Overall, 159 of 420 stool and urine samples (37.9%) were positive for GIP; 88.7% of patients had at least 1 fecal or urine sample that was positive for GIP (median, 3 excretions). On weekends (urine samples), 69.8% of patients excreted GIP at least once, compared with 62.3% during weekdays (stool). The number of patients with a sample that was positive for GIP increased over the 4-week study period (urine samples in week 1 vs week 4: P < .05). Patients with symptoms had more weeks in which GIP was detected in stool than patients without symptoms (P < .05). The number of samples that were positive for GIP correlated with titers of deamidated gliadin peptide IgA in patients' blood samples, but not with levels of tissue transglutaminase. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with celiac disease on a long-term GFD still frequently are exposed to gluten. Assays to detect GIP in stool and urine might be used to assist dietitians in assessment of GFD compliance.
31201676	Effect of gluten diet on blood innate immune gene expressions and stool consistency in Spix's Saddleback Tamarin (Leontocebus fuscicollis) raised in captivity.	The callitrichids are non-human primates that feed on insects and plant matter in nature, but in captivity, they are fed mostly an artificial diet containing amounts of gluten, in their toxic forms in items such as wheat, barley and rye. The aim of this research was to estimate the blood beta-defensin and Toll like receptor 5 (TLR5) gene expressions and to analyze the stool consistency (firm, soft, diarrheic) in Leontocebus fuscicollis raised in captivity. Blood samples of animals under gluten-free and gluten diets were collected and their fecal output quality was periodically monitored and classified during the course of the study. Gene expression was evaluated using real-time PCR. The stool consistencies of individuals fed a gluten diet were most frequently soft or diarrheic, while it was mostly normal in individuals fed a gluten-free diet. beta-Defensin expression increased in individuals fed a gluten diet, but decreased after 15 days. Expression normalized between 30 and 45 days on a gluten-free diet. However, expression of the TLR5 gene did not change under a gluten diet. A gluten diet affects stool quality, and brings about an immediate increase in blood beta-defensin expression in the beginning but decreases after 15 days.
34767744	Emergence of an adaptive immune paradigm to explain celiac disease: a perspective on new evidence and implications for future interventions and diagnosis.	INTRODUCTION: Recent patient studies have shown that gluten-free diet is less effective in treating celiac disease than previously believed, and additionally patients remain vulnerable to gluten-induced acute symptoms and systemic cytokine release. Safe and effective pharmacological adjuncts to gluten-free diet are in preclinical and clinical development. Clear understanding of the pathogenesis of celiac disease is critical for drug target identification, establishing efficacy endpoints and to develop noninvasive biomarkers suitable to monitor and potentially diagnose celiac disease. AREAS COVERED: The role and clinical effects of CD4+ T cells directed against deamidated gluten in the context of an 'adaptive immune paradigm' are reviewed. Alternative hypotheses of gluten toxicity are discussed and contrasted. In the context of recent patient studies, implications of the adaptive immune paradigm for future strategies to prevent, diagnose, and treat celiac disease are outlined. EXPERT OPINION: Effective therapeutics for celiac disease are likely to be approved and necessitate a variety of new clinical instruments and tests to stratify patient need, monitor remission, and confirm diagnosis in uncertain cases. Sensitive assessments of CD4+ T cells specific for deamidated gluten are likely to play a central role in clinical management, and to facilitate research and pharmaceutical development.
32186586	Health related quality of life in celiac children and adolescents.	INTRODUCTION: The lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD) is the treatment of celiac disease (CD). Being a restrictive diet, it limits daily life and can impact on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Our objective was to assess HRQoL of celiac patients on a GFD, the concordance between patients - caregivers, and to compare the local results with international data. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Patients aged 8-18 years on a GFD for >6months (37 dyads) were evaluated. The "Celiac Disease Dutch Questionnaire" (CDDUX) was applied, which evaluates in two questionnaires (one applied to the child and another one to the caregiver/parent), three areas: i) having CD, ii) communication with others, and iii) the diet. Reliability, dimensionality, and internal consistency were assessed using the Cronbach coefficient. RESULTS: More than 50% of patients and caregivers reported "well/very well" on sub-scales "having CD" and "GFD"; "communication" showed high percentages of "bad/very bad". Although there were no significant differences in HRQoL (global and subscale) perceived by patients and caregivers, there were when analyzing the answers of caregivers, who assigned better scores to boys (p=0.022) and to patients maintaining a non-strict GFD (p=0.049). Concordance between patients and caregivers was 39.2%. DISCUSSION: HRQoL of the assessed celiac children was satisfactory, among the best repor ted in Latin America. "Having CD" and the need for a "GFD" have less influence on HRQoL than "communication" with others about the disease. The concordance found suggests that the caregivers' perception does not necessarily reflect what patients perceive.
37191782	Celiac Disease on the Rise in the US Military Population: A 22 Year Retrospective Epidemiologic Study.	INTRODUCTION: We describe celiac disease epidemiology in the US military population. METHODS: This is a population-based study from data collected between 2000 and 2021. Incidence and prevalence rates and descriptive statistics for demographics are presented. RESULTS: Overall, 2248 incident cases of celiac disease were identified. The incidence rate increased from 1.2 to 14.0 per 100,000 person-years and the overall lifetime prevalence increased from 3.1 to 57.4 per 100,000 service members. In gastroenterology clinics, the incidence rate increased from 1.4 to 8.2 per 100,000 person-years, while prevalence increased from 3.3 to 33.4 per 100,000 service members. DISCUSSION: In this study, celiac disease incidence and prevalence increased significantly.
33515069	Adherence to gluten-free diet and follow-up of pediatric celiac disease patients, during childhood and after transition to adult care.	Long-term data on pediatric celiac disease (CD) patients after transition to adult care is scarce. We aimed to evaluate patients' adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD), the normalization of celiac serology and the frequency of follow-up before age 18, and to study changes in adherence and follow-up frequency after transition to adult care. Presenting symptoms, serology and biopsy results, patients' reported GFD adherence, frequency of follow-up visits, and complications before and after 18 years were collected for CD patients diagnosed between 1998 and 2017. Of 441 CD patients diagnosed and followed in childhood, a quarter (108/441) were over 18 y (years) at data collection. Median age at diagnosis 7.1 y (9 months-18 y), at data collection 23 y (18-38 y), disease duration 11.3 y (2-36 y). Below the age of 18 y, most patients 386/436 (88.5%) reported adherence to GFD, and most 372/425 (85.7%) normalized serology. Of the 441 patients, only 3 failed to attend any follow-up visit, and 338/441 (76.6%) attended yearly visits. Over the age 18 y, serology testing was done in 78/108 (72.2%), every 1-3 y in 46/78 (59%). Serology normalized in 61/78 (78.2%). Most adult patients 77/108 (71.5%) never attended a gastroenterology clinic. CD-related complications were rare. Younger age at diagnosis, regular follow-up visits in childhood, resolution of symptoms, and normalization of serology before age 18 were identified as predictors of negative serology after the age of 18 y.Conclusions: Children who have regular follow-up and normalize serology before age 18 years are likely to maintain a GFD and have negative serology as adults. What is Known:   The rate of adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD) is higher among children compared to adults.   Data on long-term follow-up after transition to adult care is scarce. What is New:   Patients diagnosed with CD at a younger age (<12 y), who have yearly follow-up visits, resolution of symptoms, and negative serology in childhood are very likely to maintain GFD and have negative serology as adults.   Even though most patients do not attend GI clinics after transition to adulthood, most adhere to GFD, and complications are rare.
31960667	Quantitative assessment of nutrition and nutritional status of patients with celiac disease aged 13-18	Background: Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease that affects about 1% of the European population and 0.3-1.3% of the world's population. The only method of treatment is introduction of a gluten-free diet. Objective: The aim of the study was to assess the nutrition of adolescents with celiac disease and to assess their nutritional status. Materials and methods: The study group comprised 24 patients with diagnosed celiac disease. The diagnosis was based on biopsy, serological tests and, in some cases, genetic tests. Anthropometric measurements included height, which was respectively 161.9 +-12.43 cm in boys and 163.6 +-9.03 cm in girls, and body weight oscillating between 56.55 +-16.24 kg for boys and 52.62 +-10.92 kg for girls. To assess the way of nutrition used an individually prepared questionnaire including an interview from the last 24 h. The menus were analyzed using the Dieta 5d program. The statistical analysis of the data was made using Statistica 12 program. Results: Gluten-free diet contributes to the occurrence of caloric deficiencies up to 36%. It was found inadequate intake of dietary fiber, for girls 15.45 +-9.84 g and 14.41 +-4.73 g for boys. It has been observed too low intake of ingredients such as calcium (565.65 +-347.41 mg), magnesium (223.41 +-73.84 mg), vitamin D (1.34 +-1.28 mug) and E (5.05 +-2.32 mg) as well as potassium (2848.67 +-1132.07 mg), iron (7.62 +-2.05 mg), zinc (7.11 +-2.41 mg) and thiamine (0.87 +-0.38 mg). The ingredients such as riboflavin, niacin, pyridoxine, cobalamin, and vitamins C and A were consumed in the right amount. Conclusions: Incorrectly used gluten-free diet may contribute to the recurrence of the disease. Chronic inadequate intake of fiber can lead to constipation. A deficiency of many nutrients can result in impaired development of the young organism such as anemia, growth retardation or osteoporosis.
36615729	Circulating Extracellular Vesicles Are Increased in Newly Diagnosed Celiac Disease Patients.	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are a class of circulating entities that are involved in intercellular crosstalk mechanisms, participating in homeostasis maintenance, and diseases. Celiac disease is a gluten-triggered immune-mediated disorder, characterized by the inflammatory insult of the enteric mucosa following local lymphocytic infiltration, resulting in villous atrophy. The goal of this research was the assessment and characterization of circulating EVs in celiac disease patients, as well as in patients already on an adequate gluten-free regimen (GFD). For this purpose, a novel and validated technique based on polychromatic flow cytometry that allowed the identification and enumeration of different EV sub-phenotypes was applied. The analysis evidenced that the total, annexin V+, leukocyte (CD45+), and platelet (CD41a+) EV counts were significantly higher in both newly diagnosed celiac disease patients and patients under GFD compared with the healthy controls. Endothelial-derived (CD31+) and epithelial-derived (EpCAM+) EV counts were significantly lower in subjects under gluten exclusion than in celiac disease patients, although EpCAM+ EVs maintained higher counts than healthy subjects. The numbers of EpCAM+ EVs were a statistically significant predictor of intraepithelial leukocytes (IEL). These data demonstrate that EVs could represent novel and potentially powerful disease-specific biomarkers in the context of celiac disease.

Gluten intolerance or celiac disease is a relatively common pathology that is still underdiagnosed in pediatrics due to its heterogeneous presentation. Apart from the classic form of malabsorption with diarrhea and growth retardation, pathology should be sought in the event of a family history of celiac disease, autoimmunity and in the context of certain syndromes. Other clinical or laboratory signs should also suggest the diagnosis. Any suspicion should lead to assays for total IgA and anti- transglutaminase IgA. If the child is symptomatic or not, the absence of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with biopsies is possible to make the diagnosis after agreement of the family, if the levels of anti-transglutaminase IgA are greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal, and if the anti-endomysium IgA, assayed on a second sample, are also positive. Management is based on a strict gluten-free diet.
32505703	Celiac Disease: A Subtle Clue for a Common Disease.	
29578652	Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity: How Its Gut Immune Activation and Potential Dietary Management Differ from Celiac Disease.	Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a clinical entity triggered by the ingestion of gluten-containing grains leading to intestinal and/or extraintestinal symptoms that resolve once the gluten-containing foodstuff is eliminated from the diet, and it is diagnosed when celiac disease (CD) and wheat allergy (WA) have been ruled out. The limited knowledge about the pathophysiology of NCGS and the lack of validated biomarkers are still major limitations for clinical studies, making it difficult to differentiate NCGS from other gluten-related disorders (GRD). In the absence of clear-cut diagnostic criteria, NCGS is still mainly a diagnosis of exclusion. Several studies suggest that NCGS is an immune-mediated disease that likely activates an innate immune response. Moreover, it has recently been hypothesized that in addition to gluten, other components of wheat may be responsible for the symptoms observed in individuals without CD. This review aims at discussing available evidence related to the histological and immunological features in the gut mucosa of patients with NCGS and at outlining new dietary opportunities for these patients.
29654912	Antibody Concentrations Decrease 14-Fold in Children With Celiac Disease on a Gluten-Free Diet but Remain High at 3 Months.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease can be identified by a serologic test for IgA against tissue transglutaminase (IgA-TTG) in a large proportion of children. However, the increased concentrations of antibody rarely normalize within the months after children are placed on a gluten-free diet (GFD). Early serologic predictors of sufficient adherence to GFD are required for optimal treatment. METHODS: In a prospective study, we observed the response to a GFD in 345 pediatric patients (67% girls; mean age, 8.4 y) who underwent duodenal biopsy to confirm or refute celiac disease from October 2012 through December 2015. Baseline serum samples were tested centrally for IgA-TTG and IgG against deamidated gliadin. Follow-up serologic analyses of children on a GFD were performed about 3 months later. RESULTS: The geometric mean concentration of IgA-TTG decreased from 72.4-fold to 5.2-fold the upper limit of normal (ULN), or by a factor of 14.0 (95% CI, 12.0-16.4). A substantial response (defined as a larger change than the typical variation in patients not on a GFD) was observed in 80.6% of the children. Only 28.1% of patients had a substantial response in the concentration of IgG against deamidated gliadin. Concentration of IgA-TTG remained above 1-fold the ULN in 83.8% of patients, and above 10-fold the ULN in 26.6% of patients with a substantial response. CONCLUSIONS: Serum concentration of IgA-TTG decreases substantially in most children with celiac disease within 3 months after they are placed on a GFD, but does not normalize in most. This information on changes in antibody concentrations can be used to assess patient response to the diet at short-term follow-up evaluations. Patients with a substantial response to a GFD often still have high antibody levels after 3 months. German Clinical Trials Registry no. DRKS00003854.
29210921	Celiac Disease by the Age of 13 Years Is Not Associated With Probiotics Administration in Infancy.	Probiotics are theoretically promising in primary prevention of celiac disease (CD), but research evidence on the topic is scarce. We used the data and material of a clinical double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial on primary allergy prevention (n = 1223) to investigate in an exploratory study whether administration of a mix of pro- and prebiotics during late pregnancy and first 6 months of life was associated with prevalence of CD during 13-year follow-up. Children who fulfilled diagnostic criteria for CD (n = 11) and subjects with a serum sample available for analyzing CD antibodies (n = 867) were included. CD or elevated tissue transglutaminase IgA antibodies were not associated with probiotics or placebo. Nor were there any associations with the mode of delivery, the duration of exclusive or total breast-feeding, or respiratory infections during the first 2 years of life. Allergic diseases or sensitization by the age of 2 or 5 years were not clearly associated with the development of CD.
30769836	Persistent Economic Burden of the Gluten Free Diet.	Gluten free (GF) products have been reported to be more expensive and less available than their gluten containing counterparts. We examined the current U.S. cost and availability of GF products and made comparisons to the marketplace over a decade ago. Cost, determined by price per ounce and availability of a "market basket" of regular and GF products across four venues and five geographic regions was compared using a student's t test. GF products were more expensive (overall 183%), and in all regions and venues (p < 0.001). GF products from mass-market producers were 139% more expensive than the wheat-based version of the same product. Availability of GF products was greatest (66%) in the health food and upscale venues. In contrast to the results of the 2006 study, the cost of GF products has declined from 240% to 183% (adjusted for inflation). The introduction of mass-market production of GF products may have influenced the increase in availability and overall reduction of cost since 2006. The extent to which the cost of GF products impacts dietary adherence and quality of life for those on a GFD warrants exploration.
32583650	[THE INFLUENCE OF GLUTEN ON THE SHARPNESS OF VISION].	INTRODUCTION: An eighty five old male was diagnosed with celiac disease. Six months before the diagnosis he complained of difficulties in his sight. In an optimetrical examination a decline in sharpness of sight was found: Right (R) - 6/19, Left (L) - 6/12. Following a few months of a gluten-free diet his situation improved and the signs of celiac disease disappeared. The sharpness of sight was re-examined and good improvement was found: L - 6/9, R - 6/12. This means that gluten might influence the sharpness of sight.
36049123	Immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in celiac disease.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: SARS-CoV-2 infection and development of the disease COVID-19 is a serious threat to our society. Effective vaccines have now entered the market, but most patient populations were not included in the registration clinical trials. There is evidence that patients with celiac disease (CeD) have reduced effect of vaccines such as the hepatitis B vaccine. Hence, we investigated the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (Chadox1, Comirnaty and Spikevax) in CeD patients and healthy controls. METHODS: CeD patients from a patient registry at Oslo University Hospital were invited to donate serum samples before and after vaccination. We sent out 1537 invitations and received paired samples from 85 individuals. These were compared with similar samples from 238 healthy controls. Sera were analyzed for antibodies to the Spike protein from SARS-CoV2 and the receptor-binding domain. The results where then converted into binding antibody units (BAU)/ml to compare. RESULTS: Prevaccination samples showed that very few patients had been earlier exposed to Sars-CoV2 and the antibody levels were low. Postvaccination analysis showed overlap of antibody levels between CeD and healthy controls. On average, the CeD patient group had 5555.0 BAU/ml (330.1 SD) while the average in healthy controls was 5419 (184.7 SD). CONCLUSION: The humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in CeD patients is similar to that observed in healthy controls.
37895160	Unraveling the Immunopathological Landscape of Celiac Disease: A Comprehensive Review.	Celiac disease (CD) presents a complex interplay of both innate and adaptive immune responses that drive a variety of pathological manifestations. Recent studies highlight the role of immune-mediated pathogenesis, pinpointing the involvement of antibodies against tissue transglutaminases (TG2, TG3, TG6), specific HLA molecules (DQ2/8), and the regulatory role of interleukin-15, among other cellular and molecular pathways. These aspects illuminate the systemic nature of CD, reflecting its wide-reaching impact that extends beyond gastrointestinal symptoms to affect other physiological systems and giving rise to a range of pathological landscapes, including refractory CD (RCD) and, in severe cases, enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma. The existing primary therapeutic strategy, a gluten-free diet (GFD), poses significant challenges, such as low adherence rates, necessitating alternative treatments. Emerging therapies target various stages of the disease pathology, from preventing immunogenic gluten peptide absorption to enhancing intestinal epithelial integrity and modulating the immune response, heralding potential breakthroughs in CD management. As the understanding of CD deepens, novel therapeutic avenues are emerging, paving the way for more effective and sophisticated treatment strategies with the aim of enhancing the quality of life of CD patients. This review aims to delineate the immunopathology of CD and exploring its implications on other systems, its complications and the development of novel treatments.
32345653	Screening and Treatment Outcomes in Adults and Children With Type 1 Diabetes and Asymptomatic Celiac Disease: The CD-DIET Study.	OBJECTIVE: To describe celiac disease (CD) screening rates and glycemic outcomes of a gluten-free diet (GFD) in patients with type 1 diabetes who are asymptomatic for CD. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Asymptomatic patients (8-45 years) were screened for CD. Biopsy-confirmed CD participants were randomized to GFD or gluten-containing diet (GCD) to assess changes in HbA1c and continuous glucose monitoring over 12 months. RESULTS: Adults had higher CD-seropositivity rates than children (6.8% [95% CI 4.9-8.2%, N = 1,298] vs. 4.7% [95% CI 3.4-5.9%, N = 1,089], P = 0.035) with lower rates of prior CD screening (6.9% vs. 44.2%, P < 0.0001). Fifty-one participants were randomized to a GFD (N = 27) or GCD (N = 24). No HbA1c differences were seen between the groups (+0.14%, 1.5 mmol/mol; 95% CI -0.79 to 1.08; P = 0.76), although greater postprandial glucose increases (4-h +1.5 mmol/L; 95% CI 0.4-2.7; P = 0.014) emerged with a GFD. CONCLUSIONS: CD is frequently observed in asymptomatic patients with type 1 diabetes, and clinical vigilance is warranted with initiation of a GFD.
30322070	Gluten and Functional Abdominal Pain Disorders in Children.	In children, functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are common at all ages. Consumption of certain foods, particularly gluten, is frequently associated with the development and persistence of FGIDs and functional abdominal pain disorders (FAPDs) in adults and children. However, this association is not well defined. Even without a diagnosis of celiac disease (CD), some people avoid gluten or wheat in their diet since it has been shown to trigger mostly gastrointestinal symptoms in certain individuals, especially in children. The incidence of conditions such as non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is increasing, particularly in children. On the other hand, CD is a chronic, autoimmune small intestinal enteropathy with symptoms that can sometimes be mimicked by FAPD. It is still unclear if pediatric patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are more likely to have CD. Abdominal, pain-associated FGID in children with CD does not seem to improve on a gluten-free diet. The threshold for gluten tolerance in patients with NCGS is unknown and varies among subjects. Thus, it is challenging to clearly distinguish between gluten exclusion and improvement of symptoms related solely to functional disorders.
28950706	Efficacy of a point-of-care test based on deamidated gliadin peptides for the detection of celiac disease in pediatric patients.	OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to assess the effectiveness of a point-of-care test (POCT) based on deamidated gliadin peptides (DGP) compared to the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) criteria diagnosis in the early detection of celiac disease (CD) in pediatric patients. METHODS: One hundred children (<= 18 years) with suspected CD were selected, including siblings of celiac children that underwent gastroscopy for other gastrointestinal conditions. Patients with severe disease, following a gluten-free diet (GFD), with gastrointestinal bleeding, coagulopathy and infections in the last month were excluded. All children were evaluated with a POCT that detects immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to DGP and total IgA. The POCT results were compared to CD diagnosis according to current ESPGHAN criteria. This involved the detection of IgA tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies, the results of an intestinal biopsy and genetic testing. RESULTS: The prevalence of CD found in the present study was 48% (95% confidence interval in parenthesis 37.9-58.2%). The results of the POCT were concordant with the CD diagnosis made according to ESPGHAN criteria: 95.8% (85.7-99.4%) sensitivity, 98.1% (89.7-99.7%) specificity, 97.9% (88.7-99.6%) positive predictive value and 96.2% (87.0-99.4%) negative predictive value. Positive and negative likelihood ratios were 49.8 (7.2-347.5) and 0.04 (0.01-0.17), respectively. The POCT showed a 100% diagnostic accuracy in children younger than ten years of age. In total, three discordant results were found. CONCLUSION: Due to the high diagnostic accuracy in the pediatric population, the POCT can be considered as an effective tool for the early diagnosis of CD, especially in patients younger than ten years of age.
33321805	Is Gluten the Only Culprit for Non-Celiac Gluten/Wheat Sensitivity?	The gluten-free diet (GFD) has gained increasing popularity in recent years, supported by marketing campaigns, media messages and social networks. Nevertheless, real knowledge of gluten and GF-related implications for health is still poor among the general population. The GFD has also been suggested for non-celiac gluten/wheat sensitivity (NCG/WS), a clinical entity characterized by intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms induced by gluten ingestion in the absence of celiac disease (CD) or wheat allergy (WA). NCG/WS should be regarded as an "umbrella term" including a variety of different conditions where gluten is likely not the only factor responsible for triggering symptoms. Other compounds aside from gluten may be involved in the pathogenesis of NCG/WS. These include fructans, which are part of fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs), amylase trypsin inhibitors (ATIs), wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and glyphosate. The GFD might be an appropriate dietary approach for patients with self-reported gluten/wheat-dependent symptoms. A low-FODMAP diet (LFD) should be the first dietary option for patients referring symptoms more related to FODMAPs than gluten/wheat and the second-line treatment for those with self-reported gluten/wheat-related symptoms not responding to the GFD. A personalized approach, regular follow-up and the help of a skilled dietician are mandatory.
37614445	Potential determinants of vaccine hesitancy among celiac disease patients: a single cohort analysis.	Introduction: Though researchers and scholars have greatly emphasized addressing the influencing factors of vaccination hesitancy, little attention has been paid to patients with celiac disease. Addressing the variables hampering attitudes might help direct appropriate patient advocacy and doctor-patient communication endeavors to encourage vaccination among celiac disease patients. The present investigation seeks to explore the coverage against vaccine-preventable diseases, vaccination attitudes, and related possible factors among celiac disease patients in the Pakistani setting. Methods: A self-reported online survey was conducted in Islamabad, Pakistan, for celiac disease patients aged 18 and above. The questionnaire was completed by 226 participants, with a response rate of 43.8%. The influencing variables for vaccination hesitancy were examined, and 95% confidence intervals for the crude and adjusted odds ratios were computed. Results: Among the study population, the majority were females, with a ratio of 75.66%. A prominent proportion of 69.03% was observed for influenza vaccination, while 39.82% were unable to recall all of the vaccinations they had previously received. Only 7% of the patients were considered to have a negative attitude toward vaccination, compared to an estimated 76% who were in favor of it. The significantly positive influencing factors observed toward vaccination were being well-educated (graduate, master, or above), possible recurrence of vaccine-preventable diseases with declining vaccination coverage (adjusted OR: 13.36), and increased confidence in vaccines from health care experts compared to electronic media (adjusted OR: 8.41). Contrarily, practicing complementary and alternative medicines (adjusted OR: 5.59), willingness to get vaccinated again in the future (adjusted OR: 15.59), and prior negative perspectives (adjusted OR: 1.01) were the determinants with a significant negative association. Discussion: In conclusion, the outcomes of the current work raise the possibility that health practitioners may be accountable for inappropriately prescribing vaccines to this demographic since 77% of the participants had a favorable attitude toward vaccination. These findings could serve as a springboard for creating targeted immunization efforts to raise vaccination coverage against vaccine-preventive diseases among celiac disease patients.
32751300	Beneficial Effects of a Low-Nickel Diet on Relapsing IBS-Like and Extraintestinal Symptoms of Celiac Patients during a Proper Gluten-Free Diet: Nickel Allergic Contact Mucositis in Suspected Non-Responsive Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: Nickel (Ni)-rich foods can induce allergic contact mucositis (ACM) with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like symptoms in predisposed subjects. Ni ACM has a high prevalence (>30%) in the general population and can be diagnosed by a Ni oral mucosa patch test (omPT). Many celiac disease (CD) patients on a gluten-free diet (GFD) often show a recrudescence of gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms, although serological and histological remission has been achieved. Since a GFD often results in higher loads of ingested alimentary Ni (e.g., corn), we hypothesized that it would lead to a consequent intestinal sensitization to Ni in predisposed subjects. We wanted to (1) study Ni ACM prevalence in still symptomatic CD patients on a GFD and (2) study the effects of a low-Ni diet (LNiD) on their recurrent symptoms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We recruited 102 consecutive CD patients (74 female, 28 male; age range 18-65 years, mean age 42.3 +- 7.4) on a GFD since at least 12 months, in current serological and histological remission (Marsh-Oberhuber type 0-I) who complained of relapsing gastrointestinal and/or extraintestinal symptoms. INCLUSION CRITERIA: presence of at least three gastrointestinal symptoms with a score >=5 on the modified Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) questionnaire. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: IgE-mediated food allergy; history of past or current cancer; inflammatory bowel diseases; infectious diseases including Helicobacter pylori; lactose intolerance. All patients enrolled underwent Ni omPT and followed a LNiD for 3 months. A 24 symptoms questionnaire (GSRS modified according to the Salerno Experts' Criteria, with 15 gastrointestinal and 9 extraintestinal symptoms) was administered at T0 (free diet), T1 (GFD, CD remission), T2 (recurrence of symptoms despite GFD), and T3 (GFD + LNiD) for comparisons. Comparisons were performed using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. RESULTS: Twenty patients (all female, age range 23-65 years, mean age 39.1 +- 2.9) out of 102 (19.6%) were finally included. All 20 patients enrolled (100%) showed positive Ni omPT, confirming an Ni ACM diagnosis. A correct GFD (T0 vs. T1) induced the improvement of 19 out of the total 24 (79.2%) symptoms, and 14 out of 24 (58.3%) were statistically significant (p-value < 0.0083 according to Bonferroni correction). Prolonged GFD (T1 vs. T2) revealed the worsening of 20 out of the total 24 (83.3%) symptoms, and 10 out of 24 (41.7%) were statistically significant. LNiD (T2 vs. T3) determined an improvement of 20 out of the total 24 (83.4%) symptoms, and in 10 out of 24 (41.7%) symptoms the improvement was statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the recrudescence of gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms observed in CD subjects during GFD may be due to the increase in alimentary Ni intake, once gluten contamination and persisting villous atrophy are excluded. Ni overload can induce Ni ACM, which can be diagnosed by a specific Ni omPT. Improvement of symptoms occurs after a proper LNiD. These encouraging data should be confirmed with larger studies.
29076383	Influenza and risk of later celiac disease: a cohort study of 2.6 million people.	OBJECTIVES: Influenza has been linked to autoimmune conditions, but its relationship to subsequent celiac disease (CD) is unknown. Our primary aim was to determine the risk of CD after influenza. A secondary analysis examined the risk of CD following pandemic influenza vaccination. METHODS: This nationwide register-based cohort study included 2,637,746 Norwegians (born between 1967-2013) followed during 2006-2014 with information on influenza diagnosed in primary or non-primary care, pandemic vaccination (Pandemrix), and subsequent CD. Cox regression yielded hazard ratios adjusted (HR) for socio-demographic characteristics and earlier healthcare use. RESULTS: During 13,011,323 person-years of follow-up 7321 individuals were diagnosed with CD (56/100,000 person-years). There were 351,666 individuals diagnosed with influenza, including 82,980 during the 2009-2010 pandemic, and 969,968 individuals were vaccinated. Compared with participants without influenza, who had a CD incidence of 55/100,000 person-years, those diagnosed with seasonal and pandemic influenza had a rate of 68 and 78, per 100,000 person-years, respectively. The HR for CD was 1.29 (95%CI, 1.21-1.38) after seasonal influenza and 1.29 (95%CI, 1.15-1.44) after pandemic influenza; HRs remained significantly increased one year after exposure, when restricted to laboratory-confirmed influenza, and after multivariate adjustments. The reverse association, i.e., risk of influenza after CD, was not significant (HR 1.05; 95%CI, 0.98-1.12). The HR for CD after pandemic vaccination was 1.08 (95%CI, 1.03-1.14). CONCLUSION: A positive association with influenza diagnosis is consistent with the hypothesis that infections may play a role in CD development. We could neither confirm a causal association with pandemic vaccination, nor refute entirely a small excess risk.
29451364	Prevalence of celiac disease in adult Chinese patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome: A prospective, controlled, cohort study.	OBJECTIVE: Celiac disease is a chronic inflammatory enteropathy with a symptom spectrum similar to that of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It is a common but largely undiagnosed condition in the Western countries. However, it is extremely rare among Chinese individuals, and few studies have investigated its prevalence in China. The aim was to determine the prevalence of celiac disease in patients with IBS who were diagnosed using the Rome III criteria in a single center of northern China. METHODS: This was a single-center, prospective, controlled cohort study performed in Qilu Hospital involving 246 patients with IBS and 246 healthy controls. Blood samples were drawn to assess serum tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin A (tTg-IgA). Patients with a positive or equivocal tTg-IgA (>=15 U/mL) were subjected to probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) and duodenal biopsy to confirm celiac disease. RESULTS: Altogether 12 (4.9%) patients with IBS and two (0.8%) healthy controls were positive or equivocal for serum tTg-IgA. Of these, five patients with IBS underwent pCLE and a targeted biopsy; all were histopathologically found to have celiac disease, although one was eventually diagnosed with lymphoma. After implementation of a gluten-free diet, seven patients serologically positive for IBS showed clinical improvement, thus our study illustrated a minimum prevalence of 2.85% of celiac disease among patients with IBS in our center. CONCLUSIONS: Celiac disease is not rare in Chinese individuals, particularly among those with IBS. Therefore, it should receive higher attention in clinical practice in China.
38166645	Celiac disease symptom profiles and their relationship to gluten-free diet adherence, mental health, and quality of life.	BACKGROUND: A subgroup of adults with celiac disease experience persistent gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms, which vary between individuals and the cause(s) for which are often unclear. METHODS: The present observational study sought to elucidate patterns of persistent symptoms and the relationship between those patterns and gluten-free diet adherence, psychiatric symptoms, and various aspects of quality of life (QOL) in an online sample of adults with celiac disease. U.S. adults with self-reported, biopsy-confirmed celiac disease (N = 523; Mage = 40.3 years; 88% women; 93.5% White) voluntarily completed questionnaires as part of the iCureCeliac  research network: (a) Celiac Symptoms Index (CSI) for physical symptoms and subjective health; (b) Celiac Dietary Adherence Test for gluten-free diet adherence; (c) PROMIS-29, SF-36, and Celiac Disease Quality of Life Survey for psychiatric symptoms and QOL. Symptom profiles were derived using latent profile analysis and profile differences were examined using auxiliary analyses. RESULTS: Latent profile analysis of CSI items determined a four-profile solution fit best. Profiles were characterized by: (1) little to no symptoms and excellent subjective health (37% of sample); (2) infrequent symptoms and good subjective health (33%); (3) occasional symptoms and fair to poor subjective health (24%); (4) frequent to constant symptoms and fair to poor subjective health (6%). Profiles 2 and 3 reported moderate overall symptomology though Profile 2 reported relatively greater extraintestinal symptoms and Profile 3 reported relatively greater gastrointestinal symptoms, physical pain, and worse subjective health. Profiles differed on anxiety and depression symptoms, limitations due to physical and emotional health, social functioning, and sleep, but not clinical characteristics, gluten-free diet adherence, or QOL. Despite Profile 3's moderate symptom burden and low subjective health as reported on the CSI, Profile 3 reported the lowest psychiatric symptoms and highest quality of life on standardized measures. CONCLUSIONS: Adults with celiac disease reported variable patterns of persistent symptoms, symptom severity, and subjective health. Lack of profile differences in gluten-free diet adherence suggests that adjunctive dietary or medical assessment and intervention may be warranted. Lower persistent symptom burden did not necessarily translate to better mental health and QOL, suggesting that behavioral intervention may be helpful even for those with lower celiac symptom burden.
34610833	Activated gut-homing CD8+ T cells for coeliac disease diagnosis on a gluten-free diet.	BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of coeliac disease (CD) in individuals that have started a gluten-free diet (GFD) without an adequate previous diagnostic work-out is a challenge. Several immunological assays such as IFN-gamma ELISPOT have been developed to avoid the need of prolonged gluten challenge to induce the intestinal damage. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of activated gut-homing CD8+ and TCRgammadelta+ T cells in blood after a 3-day gluten challenge and to compare it with the performance of IFN-gamma ELISPOT in a HLA-DQ2.5 subsample. METHODS: A total of 22 CD patients and 48 non-CD subjects, all of them following a GFD, underwent a 3-day 10-g gluten challenge. The percentage of two T cell subsets (CD8+ CD103+ beta7hi CD38+/total CD8+ and TCRgammadelta+ CD103+ beta7hi CD38+/total TCRgammadelta+) in fresh peripheral blood drawn baseline and 6 days after the challenge was determined by flow cytometry. IFN-gamma ELISPOT assays were also performed in HLA-DQ2.5 participants. ROC curve analysis was used to assess the diagnostic performance of the CD8+ T cell response and IFN-gamma ELISPOT. RESULTS: Significant differences between the percentage of the two studied subsets of CD8+ and TCRgammadelta+ cells at days 0 and 6 were found only when considering CD patients (p < 10-3 vs. non-CD subjects). Measuring activated CD8+ T cells provided accurate CD diagnosis with 95% specificity and 97% sensitivity, offering similar results than IFN-gamma ELISPOT. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide a highly accurate blood test for CD diagnosis in patients on a GFD of easy implementation in daily clinical practice.
31434299	Gluten and FODMAPS-Sense of a Restriction/When Is Restriction Necessary?	Gluten-free diet (GFD) is enjoying increasingly popularity, although gluten-free products are considerably more expensive. GFD is absolutely necessary for patients with celiac disease, as in this case even minor amounts of gluten can lead to the destruction of the intestinal mucosa. In addition, GFD is currently the best therapy to improve clinical symptoms of patients with non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), although the diet may not be as strict as that for patients with celiac disease. Beside gluten, other wheat components such as oligosaccharides and amylase trypsin inhibitors are discussed as triggers of NCGS in this review. An overlap between gastrointestinal symptoms in NCGS and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is described. Patients with NCGS attribute their symptoms to the consumption of gluten, while patients with IBS rarely describe gluten as a trigger. Recently, several studies have demonstrated that the introduction of a low FODMAP (fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides, and polyols) diet reduced gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with IBS and this diet is suggested as the first choice of therapy in IBS. However, a low FODMAP diet also eliminates prebiotica and may negatively influence the gut microbiota. For this reason, the diet should be liberalized after symptom improvement. There is no evidence that a GFD is healthier than the standard diet. In contrast, GFD often is accompanied by nutritional deficiencies, mainly minerals and vitamins. Therefore, GFD and low FODMAP diets are not recommended for healthy subjects. Since wheat contains fructans belonging to FODMAPs), a GFD is not only gluten-free but also has less FODMAPs. Thus, symptom improvement cannot be correctly correlated with the reduction of either one or the other.
30561389	Growth changes after gluteen free diet in pediatric celiac patients: a literature-review.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is an auto-immune disorder characterized by clinical manifestations that appear in genetically predisposed subjects after gluten ingestion. In the last years, there has been a progressive change in clinical manifestations. Our aim was to evaluate the nutritional status of children with celiac disease at diagnosis and how the gluten-free diet (GFD) influences their growth. METHODS: A search on PubMed/Medline was performed using "celiac disease", "body mass index" and "children" as key words.  Medline, Scopus, PubMed publisher and Google Scholar were searched as well.  We selected clinical studies describing the nutritional status of patients before and after GFD using indicators like height, weight, BMI, skeletal age.  We excluded papers referred to adult population or in which other diseases were related to celiac disease. Also literature-reviews were excluded. RESULTS: From 1999 to 2018, 10 studies were found. Overall, 1383 patients in pediatric age were evaluated for their nutritional status at diagnosis of celiac disease and after a variable period from 1 to 17 years of GFD. Indicators considered were height, weight, BMI and skeletal age. CONCLUSIONS: the nutritional status of celiac patients at diagnosis is variable including an increasing number of overweight and obese. GFD has a beneficial impact on growth changes determining a correction of BMI distribution towards a Gaussian shape.
33919430	Mobile Application for Promoting Gluten-Free Diet Self-Management in Adolescents with Celiac Disease: Proof-of-Concept Study.	Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic disease treated by maintaining and managing a lifelong restrictive gluten-free diet. The purpose of this study was to develop a mobile application, Plan My C-Day, to promote self-management skills among youth with CD during adolescence-a time when decreased adherence often occurs-and examine its usability among adolescents with CD. Plan My C-Day contains three simulations of activities involving eating out and actions to take when preparing for these events. It was developed and pilot tested by 13 adolescents with CD. Application use and user perception data were collected and analyzed. Participants chose 160 actions within the simulations. For over 75% of participants, the time to complete the simulation decreased from the first to the third (last) simulation by an average of 50%. The average reported usability perception was 3.71 on a scale of 1 to 5, with system ease of use and ease of learning obtaining the highest scores. This study demonstrated that the Plan My C-Day mobile application's self-management content, features, and functions operated well and that the simulations were easy to understand and complete. Further development will include the option to add self-created activities and adaptation to different languages and cultures.
36510401	The Investigation of Nutritional Status, Intestinal Permeability, and Quality of Life in People with Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is associated with impaired intestinal epithelial barrier integrity. Its consequences affect the nutritional status and quality of life of patients. This study aimed to determine nutritional status, intestinal permeability, and quality of life in people with celiac disease. It was researched whether patients who are non-compliant to gluten-free diet have higher serum zonulin levels and intestinal permeability. METHODS: The study was completed with 44 celiac patients. Dietary records and a questionnaire were used to evaluate patients' compli ance to the gluten-free diet. Dietary records were analyzed by using a nutrition analysis program. Anthropometric measurements were taken. Body compositions were analyzed to assess the nutritional status of patients. Blood samples were collected and then zonulin levels and total serum proteins were measured to evaluate intestinal permeability. Celiac Disease Questionnaire was used to assess the quality of life scores. RESULTS: Patients were divided into 2 groups considering compliance to the gluten-free diet and it was found that 17 patients were com pliant to the gluten-free diet, and 27 patients were non-compliant to the gluten-free diet. Serum zonulin, zonulin/total protein ratio, and intestinal permeability were higher in non-compliant to the gluten-free diet group (P < .05). There was no significant difference between anthropometric measurements, Celiac Disease Questionnaire scores, daily energy, and nutrient intakes of groups (P > .05). CONCLUSION: The content of a gluten-free diet has a decisive role in the nutritional status and quality of life of celiac patients. Additionally, zonulin levels and intestinal permeability were higher in people with celiac disease who are non-compliant to gluten-free diet.
34959858	Changes in Diet and Anthropometric Parameters in Children and Adolescents with Celiac Disease-One Year of Follow-Up.	Celiac disease (CD) may cause numerous nutrient deficiencies that a proper gluten-free diet (GFD) should compensate for. The study group consists of 40 children, aged 8.43 years (SD 3.5), on average, in whom CD was diagnosed on the basis of clinical symptoms, immunological and histopathological results. The patients' height, weight, diet and biochemical tests were assessed three times: before diagnosis, after six months, and following one year of GFD. After one year, the patients' weight and height increased but nutritional status (body mass index, BMI percentile) did not change significantly. The children's diet before diagnosis was similar to that of the general Polish population: insufficient implementation of the dietary norm for energy, fiber, calcium, iodine, iron as well as folic acid, vitamins D, K, and E was observed. Over the year, the GFD of the children with CD did not change significantly for most of the above nutrients, or the changes were not significant for the overall assessment of the diet. Celiac patients following GFD may have a higher risk of iron, calcium and folate deficiencies. These results confirm the need for personalized nutritional education aimed at excluding gluten from the diet, as well as balancing the diet properly, in patients with CD.
31709662	Exploring undiagnosed celiac disease in women with recurrent reproductive failure: The gluten-free diet could improve reproductive outcomes.	PROBLEM: Which is the prevalence and seroprevalence of celiac disease (CD) in women with recurrent reproductive failure? METHOD OF STUDY: Retrospective study performed in a single infertility clinic from September 2016 to December 2017. A total of 690 women with unexplained history of recurrent miscarriage and/or recurrent implantation failure were consecutively recruited. IgA anti-transglutaminase 2 (TG2) antibody data were collected, as well as IgG anti-TG2 and IgA/IgG anti-deamidated gluten peptide (DGP) data in most cases, and IgG anti-gliadin antibodies occasionally. In selected women, HLA-DQ genotyping was requested. Biopsy was suggested to all women with positive serological results or belonging to CD risk groups. Reproductive outcomes were recorded from women with high suspicion of CD and a control group comprised of 49 women. RESULTS: Anti-TG2-positive women comprised 1% of the sample. An additional 4% was observed considering less-specific antibodies (31 women). Only 39% of sero-positive women accepted duodenal biopsy. HLA and biopsy data discarded CD in 14 sero-positive cases (37%), only one with anti-TG2 antibodies. CD was suggested in 10 sero-positive and three sero-negative women (1.9%). Compared with controls, the live birthrate of the studied women with probable CD was significantly decreased before gluten removal of the diet (P = .015), but significantly increased after that (P = .020). CONCLUSION: One percent CD prevalence should be expected after anti-TG2 serological screening. However, more sensitive approaches should be explored, especially considering the potential beneficial effect of the gluten-free diet on the reproductive outcomes of women with CD.
36535870	Anemia in non-celiac wheat sensitivity: Prevalence and associated clinical and laboratory features.	BACKGROUND: Patients suffering from non-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCWS) frequently report extra-intestinal symptoms, such as anemia. AIMS: We investigated the prevalence and associated clinical features of anemia in NCWS patients. METHODS: Data from 244 NCWS patients, diagnosed by double-blind placebo-controlled wheat challenge, were retrospectively reviewed and compared with 2 control groups (celiac disease (CD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)). Furthermore, 31 NCWS anemic patients were prospectively re-evaluated after at least 12 months on the "strict" wheat-free diet (WFD). RESULTS: Anemia prevalence in NCWS patients was 34.8% (mean hemoglobin 10.4 +- 1.4 g/dl), significantly higher than in IBS (17.4%, P = 0.03), but not in CD ones. The NCWS group, on the whole, had sideropenic-like features with low serum iron and altered iron deposits. Both anemia prevalence and sideropenic-like features were more evident in CD than in NCWS patients, whereas only a few IBS subjects showed such features. Significant differences were found in anemic vs non-anemic NCWS patients as regards to female sex, diagnostic delay, poly/hypermenorrhea, iron deficiency, and higher TSH values. A long-term WFD significantly reduced anemia and improved iron metabolism. CONCLUSION: Microcytic/hypochromic anemia and altered iron metabolism occur frequently in NCWS and can be treated with a long-term strict WFD. NCWS should be included in differential diagnosis of anemic patients with "functional gastrointestinal troubles".
33781226	Evaluation of malnutrition status and clinical indications in children with celiac disease: a cross-sectional study.	BACKGROUND: Celiac Disease (CD) is an autoimmune systemic disorder triggered by gluten in genetically susceptible individuals, which can lead to chronic malabsorption. Considering the changes in the manifestations of CD, this study aimed to determine anthropometric indices and clinical indications in children with CD. METHODS: This cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate the children with CD who had referred to Imam Reza Celiac Clinic between 2016 and 2019. Totally, 361 children were eligible and their anti-tissue transglutaminase (TGA-IgA) level, weight, height, and Body Mass Index (BMI) were extracted from their records. The anthropometric indices were presented based on the criteria of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO). The prevalent symptoms were assessed, as well. RESULTS: Based on the CDC's criteria, 18.3, 28.8, and 25.8% of the children had short stature, low body weight, and low BMI, respectively. These measures were obtained as 10, 22.4, and 13.9% according to the WHO's categorization respectively. Furthermore, the most common symptoms among the children were abdominal pain (56.5%), skeletal pain (28%), constipation (27.4%), and anemia (23.8%). CONCLUSION: To sum up, the results clearly indicated that growth failure and low height, weight, and BMI were prevalent among the children with CD. Moreover, in addition to gastrointestinal symptoms, a considerable number of patients had skeletal pain and anemia.
38040116	Experiences of Health-Related Stigma and Challenges Faced by Men Living with Celiac Disease: A Qualitative Analysis.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune condition, managed by strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). Dietary choice has gendered connotations, and men with CD may face judgment from others when following a GFD. However, little is known about health-related stigma in men with CD. OBJECTIVES: The study aim was to explore the health-related stigma and challenges faced by men with CD, and the impact of CD on their lives. DESIGN: Qualitative semi-structured online interviews were conducted with men living with CD. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty adults (>=18 years old) identifying as men living in the United Kingdom, with self-reported CD, were recruited using social media and opportunistic sampling. ANALYSES: Participants provided rich, detailed discussions about aspects of their experience of living with CD. Reflexive thematic analysis was used, with a critical-realist lens which enabled researchers to connect men's experiences within wider socio-cultural constructs such as masculinity and social identity. RESULTS: Three themes were identified: (1) CD threatens social inclusion; (2) Others' assumptions about CD and microaggressions have a psychological impact, and (3) Masculine norms, health-related stigma, and power dynamics impact men's health behaviors and everyday experience. Health-related stigma was found to be interconnected with these men's gendered social environment, suggesting that gender may be an important social and structural determinant of dietary, health-related, and health support-seeking behaviors in men diagnosed with CD. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to prior assumptions, health-related stigma affects men with CD of all ages, particularly in social settings. The study unveils the complex interplay of individual beliefs, social norms, and power dynamics, in particular with other men, that affect individual beliefs, and emphasize the performative aspect of food consumption. Internalized stigma and microaggressions impact men's wellbeing. To better support men with CD, health providers, charitable organizations, and the food industry should address the social impact of adherence to a gluten-free diet, in particular perceived threats to social status and inclusion, which may cause concern, influence food choice, and impact dietary adherence.
29150741	Prevalence of Micronutrient Deficiency in Patients with Morbid Obesity Before Bariatric Surgery: What About Celiac Disease?	
38396767	Bacteria: Potential Make-or-Break Determinants of Celiac Disease.	Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease triggered by dietary gluten in genetically susceptible individuals that primarily affects the small intestinal mucosa. The sole treatment is a gluten-free diet that places a social and economic burden on patients and fails, in some, to lead to symptomatic or mucosal healing. Thus, an alternative treatment has long been sought after. Clinical studies on celiac disease have shown an association between the presence of certain microbes and disease outcomes. However, the mechanisms that underlie the effects of microbes in celiac disease remain unclear. Recent studies have employed disease models that have provided insights into disease mechanisms possibly mediated by bacteria in celiac disease. Here, we have reviewed the bacteria and related mechanisms identified so far that might protect from or incite the development of celiac disease. Evidence indicates bacteria play a role in celiac disease and it is worth continuing to explore this, particularly since few studies, to the best of our knowledge, have focused on establishing a mechanistic link between bacteria and celiac disease. Uncovering host-microbe interactions and their influence on host responses to gluten may enable the discovery of pathogenic targets and development of new therapeutic or preventive approaches.
33512796	Randomized, Placebo Controlled Trial of Experimental Hookworm Infection for Improving Gluten Tolerance in Celiac Disease.	INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder where intestinal immunopathology arises after gluten consumption. Previous studies suggested that hookworm infection restores gluten tolerance; however, these studies were small (n = 12) and not placebo controlled. METHODS: We undertook a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of hookworm infection in 54 people with celiac disease. The 94-week study involved treatment with either 20 or 40 Necator americanus third-stage larvae (L3-20 or L3-40) or placebo, followed by escalating gluten consumption (50 mg/d for 12 weeks, 1 g intermittent twice weekly for 12 weeks, 2 g/d sustained for 6 weeks, liberal diet for 1 year). RESULTS: Successful study completion rates at week 42 (primary outcome) were similar in each group (placebo: 57%, L3-20: 37%, and L3-40: 44%; P = 0.61), however gluten-related adverse events were significantly reduced in hookworm-treated participants: Median (range) adverse events/participant were as follows: placebo, 4 (1-9); L3-20, 1 (0-9); and L3-40, 0 (0-3) (P = 0.019). Duodenal villous height:crypt depth deteriorated similarly compared with their enrolment values in each group (mean change [95% confidence interval]: placebo, -0.6 [-1.3 to 0.2]; L3-20, -0.5 [-0.8 to 0.2]; and L3-40, -1.1 [-1.8 to 0.4]; P = 0.12). A retrospective analysis revealed that 9 of the 40 L3-treated participants failed to establish hookworm infections. Although week 42 completion rates were similar in hookworm-positive vs hookworm-negative participants (48% vs 44%, P = 0.43), quality of life symptom scores were lower in hookworm-positive participants after intermittent gluten challenge (mean [95% confidence interval]: 38.9 [33.9-44] vs 45.9 [39.2-52.6]). DISCUSSION: Hookworm infection does not restore tolerance to sustained moderate consumption of gluten (2 g/d) but was associated with improved symptom scores after intermittent consumption of lower, intermittent gluten doses.
37341328	Neurologic Manifestations of Gastrointestinal and Nutritional Disorders.	OBJECTIVE: A tie between nutritional or gastrointestinal and neurologic disease has been recognized for centuries. Many gastrointestinal disorders are associated with neurologic disease through nutritional, immune-mediated, or degenerative pathophysiologies. This article reviews neurologic disorders in patients with gastrointestinal disease and gastrointestinal manifestations in their own neurologic patients. LATEST DEVELOPMENTS: Development of new gastric and bariatric surgical procedures and the widespread use of over-the-counter gastric acid-reducing medications continue to create vitamin and nutritional deficiencies despite modern diet and supplementation. Some supplements, such as vitamin A, vitamin B6, and selenium, themselves are now found to cause disease. Recent work has shown extraintestinal and neurologic manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease. Chronic brain damage in liver disease has been recognized, and the opportunity to intervene may exist in the covert beginning stages. The characterization of gluten-related neurologic symptoms and differentiation from those of celiac disease is an evolving body of work. ESSENTIAL POINTS: Gastrointestinal and neurologic diseases related to common immune-mediated, degenerative, or infectious mechanisms are common and can coexist in the same patient. Furthermore, gastrointestinal disease may cause neurologic complications because of nutritional inadequacies, malabsorption, and hepatic dysfunction. In many cases, the complications are treatable but have subtle or protean presentations. Therefore, the consulting neurologist must be current in knowledge of the growing ties between gastrointestinal and neurologic disease.
37246625	Celiac Disease and Disorders of Gut-Brain Interaction: What School Nurses Need to Know.	Abdominal pain and discomfort are common reasons students visit the school health office. Abdominal pain, in children, may be related to gastrointestinal conditions such as celiac disease (CD) or disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBIs). Both CD and DGBIs, formerly known as functional abdominal pain disorders, are both prevalent in the pediatric population. Manifestations, presentation, and management of these disorders overlap and will be reviewed in this article. Due to their chronic nature, school nurses should be aware of both the management and complications associated with CD and DGBIs. Dietary recommendations, including the gluten-free and low-fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPS) diet, will be presented as part of the management of the disorders.
34057009	High disease burden in treated celiac patients - a web-based survey.	BACKGROUND: Strict adherence to a gluten-free diet usually leads to clinical and histological remission in celiac disease. Few studies have investigated the prevalence of persistent symptoms in a celiac population. We aimed to study the impact of gastrointestinal symptoms on general health in a large number of treated celiac patients, and describe the prevalence of persistent gastrointestinal symptoms and investigate associated factors. METHODS: Adults with celiac disease filled out background questions, the Celiac Symptom Index (CSI) and the celiac disease adherence test (CDAT) in a web-based national survey. Participants who reported gastrointestinal symptoms during the previous week also recorded the gastrointestinal symptom rating scale-irritable bowel syndrome version (GSRS-IBS). Statistical analysis included chi-squared test, t-test, correlation, and linear regression. RESULTS: Of 3834 participants (82% women; mean age 47 years), 54% reported gastrointestinal symptoms the previous week, and 30% of these had CSI score >=45, indicative of the relatively poor quality of life (vs. 5% among those without gastrointestinal symptoms). The prevalence of persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (GSRS-IBS >=30) was 40% and the most prominent symptoms were bloating (44%) and pain (37%). Age, sex, symptoms at the time of diagnosis, comorbidity, dietary adherence and CeD-specific health were significantly associated with gastrointestinal symptoms (p < .001). CONCLUSION: In this national cross-sectional study among participants with celiac disease, persistent gastrointestinal symptoms were frequent, and were associated with a high symptom burden and reduced CeD-specific health. Several factors were associated with gastrointestinal symptoms, but more research is needed to find the cause of persistent symptoms in patients with celiac disease.
28858941	Regional and National Variations in Reasons for Gluten Avoidance.	BACKGROUND: Although studies have assessed the prevalence of celiac disease (CD), less is known about the prevalence of gluten avoidance because of nonceliac gluten sensitivity (GS). The avoidance of foods other than gluten is also understudied in these 2 groups. METHODS: Participants visiting a web site for information about a newly developed portable gluten detection device (Nima) were instructed to complete questions about food and gluten avoidance patterns. We assessed the relative proportion of CD and GS across world regions and United States (US) regions and determined the distribution of food avoidance patterns. RESULTS: CD was reported in 6474 respondents and GS in 2597 respondents. Within the United States, the majority of avoiders of gluten reported having CD (69.8%), with the highest ratio of CD to GS in the Northeast (CD: 74.3%; GS: 25.7%) and the lowest in the West (CD: 67.1%; GS: 32.9%) (P<0.0001). Compared with the United States, all other countries had lower proportions of GS, with the lowest in Argentina (CD: 94.7%; GS: 5.3%; P<0.0001). Food avoidances other than gluten were reported by 25% of respondents, with avoidance in all categories more common in GS than CD (P<0.0001). CONCLUSION: There is a significant difference in the relative rates of CD and GS within the United States and worldwide. Food avoidance other than gluten seems to be a more common component of GS than CD. Future research should focus on the causes of these international and US regional differences and the significance of other food avoidances.
37242236	New Insights and Evidence on "Food Intolerances": Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity and Nickel Allergic Contact Mucositis.	The clinical examination of patients often includes the observation of the existence of a close relationship between the ingestion of certain foods and the appearance of various symptoms. Until now, the occurrence of these events has been loosely defined as food intolerance. Instead, these conditions should be more properly defined as adverse food reactions (AFRs), which can consist of the presentation of a wide variety of symptoms which are commonly identified as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In addition, systemic manifestations such as neurological, dermatological, joint, and respiratory disorders may also occur in affected patients. Although the etiology and pathogenesis of some of them are already known, others, such as non-celiac gluten sensitivity and adverse reactions to nickel-containing foods, are not yet fully defined. The study aimed to evaluate the relationship between the ingestion of some foods and the appearance of some symptoms and clinical improvements and detectable immunohistochemical alterations after a specific exclusion diet. One hundred and six consecutive patients suffering from meteorism, dyspepsia, and nausea following the ingestion of foods containing gluten or nickel were subjected to the GSRS questionnaire which was modified according to the "Salerno experts' criteria". All patients underwent detection of IgA antibodies to tissue transglutaminase, oral mucosal patch tests with gluten and nickel (OMPT), and EGDS, including biopsies. Our data show that GSRS and OMPT, the use of APERIO CS2 software, and the endothelial marker CD34 could be suggested as useful tools in the diagnostic procedure of these new pathologies. Larger, multi-center clinical trials could be helpful in defining these emerging clinical problems.
29620596	Celiac Disease 30 Years After Diagnosis: Struggling With Gluten-free Adherence or Gaining Gluten Tolerance?	OBJECTIVES: Studies investigating patients with coeliac disease (CD) on very long-term follow-up are limited. We aimed to evaluate the characteristics of patients with CD diagnosed more than 30 years ago. METHODS: Clinical, histologic, genetic, and demographic data of patients with CD diagnosis made before 1985 were collected and their standardised mortality ratio calculated. According to the gluten-free diet (GFD) status, CD patients were divided into 3 groups and a specific questionnaire on GFD awareness and gluten-free products was administered to patients and caregivers. RESULTS: A total of 337 CD patients were included in the study. The standardised mortality ratio was 0.37 (confidence interval 0.10 to 0.94) compared with a matched population. A total of 197 patients were grouped according to GFD compliance, with 35 CD patients reporting chronic voluntary gluten ingestion. No significant differences were found between groups regarding family history of CD, symptoms and histology at diagnosis, autoimmune disorders. Follow-up histology was performed in 63 patients. Twenty patients had normal histology on gluten-containing diet (GCD). Questionnaire scores were lower in patients on GCD. Caregivers scores were not correlated with patients' gluten consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Although poor adherence to GFD is the major predictor of persistence of mucosal lesions at follow-up histology, a proportion of patients did not show a relapse of villous atrophy in spite chronic voluntary gluten ingestion, nor increase in mortality. Moreover, GFD knowledge and adherence could be partly lost during the transition between childhood and adulthood.
29688915	Clinical and Microbiological Effect of a Multispecies Probiotic Supplementation in Celiac Patients With Persistent IBS-type Symptoms: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-controlled, Multicenter Trial.	GOALS: The goals of this study were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a probiotic mixture in patients with celiac disease (CD) with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-type symptoms despite a strict gluten-free diet (GFD). BACKGROUND: About 30% of patients with CD adherent to a GFD suffer from IBS-type symptoms; a possible cause resides in the imbalances of the intestinal microbiota in CD. Probiotics may represent a potential treatment. STUDY: CD patients with IBS-type symptoms entered a prospective, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled study. A 6-week treatment period was preceded by a 2-week run-in and followed by a 6-week follow-up phase. Clinical data were monitored throughout the study by validated questionnaires: IBS Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS); Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS); Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS); and IBS Quality of Life Questionnaire (IBS-QOL). The fecal microbiota were assayed using plate counts and 16S rRNA gene-based analysis. RESULTS: In total, 109 patients were randomized to probiotics (n=54) or placebo (n=55). IBS-SSS and GSRS decreased significantly in probiotics, as compared with placebo [(-15.9%+-14.8% vs. 8.2%+-25.9%; P<0.001) and (-19.8%+-16.6% vs. 12.9%+-31.6%; P<0.001)], respectively. Treatment success was significantly higher in patients receiving probiotics, as compared with placebo (15.3% vs. 3.8%; P<0.04). Presumptive lactic acid bacteria, Staphylococcus and Bifidobacterium, increased in patients receiving probiotic treatment. No adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: A 6-week probiotic treatment is effective in improving the severity of IBS-type symptoms, in CD patients on strict GFD, and is associated with a modification of gut microbiota, characterized by an increase of bifidobacteria.
32558690	The Role of Bile Acids in Chronic Diarrhea.	Bile acids (BAs) are the central signals in enterohepatic communication, and they also integrate microbiota-derived signals into enterohepatic signaling. The tissue distribution and signaling pathways activated by BAs through natural receptors, farsenoid X receptor and G protein-coupled BA receptor 1 (GPBAR1, also known as Takeda G-coupled receptor 5), have led to a greater understanding of the mechanisms and potential therapeutic agents. BA diarrhea is most commonly encountered in ileal resection or disease, in idiopathic disorders (with presentation similar to functional diarrhea or irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea), and in association with malabsorption such as chronic pancreatitis or celiac disease. Diagnosis of BA diarrhea is based on Se-homocholic acid taurine retention, 48-hour fecal BA excretion, or serum 7alphaC4; the latter being a marker of hepatic BA synthesis. BA diarrhea tends to be associated with higher body mass index, increased stool weight and stool fat, and acceleration of colonic transit. Biochemical markers of increased BA synthesis or excretion are available through reference laboratories. Current treatment of BA diarrhea is based on BA sequestrants, and, in the future, it is anticipated that farsenoid X receptor agonists may also be effective. The optimal conditions for an empiric trial with BA sequestrants as a diagnostic test are still unclear. However, such therapeutic trials are widely used in clinical practice. Some national guidelines recommend definitive diagnosis of BA diarrhea over empirical trial.
35092656	Systematic approach to celiac disease: a comprehensive review for primary providers.	Celiac disease is an immune-mediated illness to gluten exposure in genetically susceptible patients. It is characterized by chronic lymphocytic inflammation of the small bowel leading to villous atrophy and its associated complications. The global prevalence of celiac disease is increasing, due in part to improved screening tests and simplified diagnostic criteria. Novel therapies are being developed and include proteolytic enzymes, sequestering agents, and immunotherapies. A strict gluten-free diet, however, remains the mainstay of treatment. In this comprehensive review, we discuss the epidemiology, definitions, diagnosis, and treatment of celiac disease.
37204091	Liver disorders and celiac disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic autoimmune enteropathy triggered by gluten intake. Celiac hepatitis is the most common hepatic manifestation of CD, it usually responds to a gluten-free diet (GFD) and is sometimes the only manifestation in paucisymptomatic CD. Through this descriptive observational study, we determined the prevalence of liver abnormalities upon diagnosis of CD. A total of 140 patients were included. The prevalence of alterations in liver markers at diagnosis of CD was 47%. In 2.9% of patients, liver abnormalities were the only manifestation at diagnosis. A higher prevalence of liver alterations was found in those patients who presented a more severe histological alteration (MARSH 3c).
36382765	Celiac disease and bone.	Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by small intestinal inflammation triggered by gluten ingestion in genetically-predisposed individuals. A frequent extra-intestinal manifestation of CD is metabolic bone disease which contributes to an increased risk of fracture. The mechanisms underlying bone disease in CD remain incompletely understood, but multiple processes have been proposed including (1) malabsorption of calcium and vitamin D leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism and increased skeletal resorption, (2) pro-inflammatory cytokines altering the osteoprotegerin and receptor activator of nuclear kappa-B ligand ratio favoring osteoclastogenesis, (3) hypogonadism, and (4) low weight and malnutrition. Most studies show reduced bone mineral density in patients with CD. Bone microarchitecture is also deteriorated leading to reduced whole bone stiffness. Many, but not all investigations, have shown an increased risk of fracture associated with CD. The main stay of therapy for CD is maintaining a gluten-free diet. Improvement in bone mineral density with adherence to a gluten-free diet has been well-established. Bone mineral density remains lower, however, compared to controls and increased fracture risk can persist. There is no consensus on the timing of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry for bone mineral density assessment in patients with CD. Routine screening for CD in patients with osteoporosis is not recommended. Little data are available on the use or efficacy of prescription osteoporosis therapeutics in patients with CD. Studies are needed to develop standardized guidelines for screening and treatment of metabolic bone disease in patients with CD to identify those who may need early intervention with prescription osteoporosis therapy.
28841165	A Research Communication Brief: Gluten Analysis in Beef Samples Collected Using a Rigorous, Nationally Representative Sampling Protocol Confirms That Grain-Finished Beef Is Naturally Gluten-Free.	Knowing whether or not a food contains gluten is vital for the growing number of individuals with celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Questions have recently been raised about whether beef from conventionally-raised, grain-finished cattle may contain gluten. To date, basic principles of ruminant digestion have been cited in support of the prevailing expert opinion that beef is inherently gluten-free. For this study, gluten analysis was conducted in beef samples collected using a rigorous nationally representative sampling protocol to determine whether gluten was present. The findings of our research uphold the understanding of the principles of gluten digestion in beef cattle and corroborate recommendations that recognize beef as a naturally gluten-free food.

34108093	Clinical features and psychological impact of celiac disease at diagnosis.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: We aimed to describe the socio-demographic, behavioral and clinical profiles of adult patients with newly diagnosed celiac disease (CeD) and their possible association with QoL and psychological symptoms. METHODS: Adults newly diagnosed with CeD and residents in the Veneto region were included. Their sociodemographic characteristics, clinical presentation, mode of diagnosis, duration of symptoms before diagnosis and comorbidities were recorded. All patients completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaires. RESULTS: Between 2016 and 2019, 110 CeD patients (81% females, mean age 37.5) were recruited. At diagnosis, patients were categorized into classical (n = 56), nonclassical CeD (n = 49) and asymptomatic (n = 5) groups. Patients with classical presentation had a lower QoL than nonclassical patients, who were found to be more depressed. We observed a diagnosis delay of more than 7 months in more than 60% of patients with both classical and nonclassical presentations and we found that a longer duration of GI symptoms decreased the self-reported SF36 scores in the physical health (p = 0.002), social functioning (p = 0.03) and general health (p = 0.009) domains. Women had an overall lower self-perceived QoL. CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic presentation at CeD diagnosis, diagnostic delay and sex may affect QoL and psychological disorders.
29858750	A Comprehensive Review of Celiac Disease/Gluten-Sensitive Enteropathies.	Celiac disease is a complex immune-mediated gluten-sensitive enteropathy with protean clinical manifestations. It is manifest in genetically predisposed individuals who ingest gluten in varying amounts. In broad terms, it is thought to affect 1% of the population in the USA. More specifically, the prevalence increases drastically from 1:133 in patients not-at-risk, to 1:56 in symptomatic patients, to 1:39 in patients with a second-degree relative with the diagnosis, and to 1:22 in patients with a first-degree relative with the diagnosis. It may be associated with several immune-mediated phenomena, autoimmune diseases, and complicated by vitamin and other trace element deficiencies, bone disease, and malignancy. Our understanding of celiac disease has evolved rapidly over the past two decades. This has led to several lines of enquiry on the condition and potential treatment options. More recently, several entities including gluten intolerance, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, and seronegative celiac disease have been described. These conditions are distinct from allergies or intolerance to wheat or wheat products. There are challenges in defining some of these entities since a large number of patients self-report these conditions. The absence of confirmatory diagnostic tests poses an added dilemma in distinguishing these entities. The differences in spectrum of symptoms and highlights of the variability between the pediatric and adult populations have been studied in some detail. The role of screening for celiac disease is examined in both the general population and "at risk" populations. Diagnostic strategies including the best available serologic testing, utility of HLA haplotypes DQ2 and DQ8 which are seen in over 90% of patients with celiac disease as compared with approximately 40% of the general population, and endoscopic evaluation are also reviewed. Comprehensive nutritional management after diagnosis is key to sustained health in patients with celiac disease. Simple algorithms for care based on a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach are proposed. Refractory and non-responsive celiac diseases in the setting of a gluten-free diet are examined as are novel non-dietary therapies. Finally, the association of other disease states including psychiatric illness, infertility, lymphoproliferative malignancy, and mortality is explored with special attention paid to autoimmune and atopic disease.
34298190	Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders and Associated Health Impairment in Individuals with Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Individuals with celiac disease (CD) can experience persisting gastrointestinal symptoms despite adhering to a gluten-free diet (GFD). This may be due to functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), although there is little data on its prevalence and associated factors. METHODS: An online health questionnaire was completed by adult members of Celiac UK in October 2018. The survey included validated questions on Rome IV FGIDs, nongastrointestinal somatic symptoms, anxiety, depression, quality of life, health care use, GFD duration, and its adherence using the celiac dietary adherence test score (with a value <= 13 indicating optimal adherence). The prevalence of FGIDs and associated health impairment in the celiac cohort was compared against an age- and sex-matched population-based control group. RESULTS: Of the 863 individuals with CD (73% female; mean age, 61 years), all were taking a GFD for at least 1 year, with 96% declaring that they have been on the diet for 2 or more years (2-4 years, 20%; >=5 years, 76%). The adherence to a GFD was deemed optimal in 61% (n = 523), with the remaining 39% (n = 340) nonadherent. Those adhering to a GFD fulfilled criteria for a FGID in approximately one-half of cases, although this was significantly lower than nonadherent subjects (51% vs 75%; odds ratio [OR], 2.0; P < .001). However, the prevalence of FGIDs in GFD-adherent subjects was significantly higher than in matched population-based controls (35%; OR, 2.0; P < .001). This was accounted for by functional bowel (46% vs 31%; OR, 1.9; P < .0001) and anorectal disorders (14.5% vs 9.3%; OR, 1.7; P = .02) but not functional esophageal (7.6% vs 6.1%; P = .36) or gastroduodenal disorders (8.7% vs 7.4%; P = .47). Finally, GFD-adherent subjects with FGIDs were significantly more likely than their counterparts without FGIDs to have abnormal levels of anxiety (5% vs 2%; OR, 2.8; P = .04), depression (7% vs 2%; OR, 3.6; P = .01), somatization (31% vs 8%; OR, 5.1; P < .0001), and reduced quality of life (P < .0001). CONCLUSION: One in 2 people with CD, despite having been on a GFD for a number of years and demonstrating optimal adherence, have ongoing symptoms compatible with a Rome IV FGID. This is 2-fold the odds of FGIDs seen in age- and sex-matched controls. The presence of FGIDs is associated with significant health impairment, including psychological comorbidity. Addressing disorders of gut-brain interaction might improve outcomes in this specific group of patients.
36585541	Children With Celiac Disease Consume Specific Food Additives More Frequently Compared to Children Without Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND: Gluten-free foods often contain food additives to improve palatability, but the long-term effects on the human gastrointestinal tract are not well known. AIMS: This study aimed to quantify frequency of food additive exposure in children with and without celiac disease (CD). METHODS: Children with and without CD were enrolled and demographic data and three-day diet records were obtained. Foods were classified as gluten-free products (GFP) and "processed food", and were evaluated for presence of select food additives: polysorbate 80, carboxymethylcellulose, xanthan gum, guar gum, soy lecithin, titanium dioxide, carrageenan, maltodextrin, and aluminosilicates. The frequency of exposure was described. RESULTS: Twenty-eight participants were included in final analysis. Children with CD had a higher number of daily exposures to xanthan gum (5.3 +- 3.1 vs 2.3 +- 2.4; p = 0.009), but similar exposures to the other additives. GFP contributed 29% of total calories in the GF diet. Both groups had similar intake of processed foods. Comparing GFP and gluten-containing processed foods, 68% vs. 25% contained at least one food additive of interest (p < 0.0001); in the celiac group, those with higher consumption of GFP tended to have a higher frequency of exposure to food additives (p = 0.09). CONCLUSION: A gluten-free diet and consumption of GFP may contribute to differences in food additive intake; quantifying food additive exposures and their effect on humans requires further study.
38617446	Effect of Aspergillus niger prolyl endopeptidase in patients with celiac disease on a long-term gluten-free diet.	BACKGROUND: The gluten-free diet (GFD) has limitations, and there is intense research in the development of adjuvant therapies. AIM: To examine the effects of orally administered Aspergillus niger prolyl endopeptidase protease (AN-PEP) on inadvertent gluten exposure and symptom prevention in adult celiac disease (CeD) patients following their usual GFD. METHODS: This was an exploratory, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled CeD patients on a long-term GFD. After a 4-wk run-in period, patients were randomized to 4 wk of two AN-PEP capsules (GliadinX; AVI Research, LLC, United States) at each of three meals per day or placebo. Outcome endpoints were: (1) Average weekly stool gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) between the run-in and end of treatments and between AN-PEP and placebo; (2) celiac symptom index (CSI); (3) CeD-specific serology; and (4) quality of life. Stool samples were collected for GIP testing by ELISA every Tuesday and Friday during run-ins and treatments. RESULTS: Forty patients were randomized for the intention-to-treat analysis, and three were excluded from the per-protocol assessment. Overall, 628/640 (98.1%) stool samples were collected. GIP was undetectable (< 0.08 mug/g) in 65.6% of samples, and no differences between treatment arms were detected. Only 0.5% of samples had GIP concentrations sufficiently high (> 0.32 mug/g) to potentially cause mucosal damage. Median GIP concentration in the AN-PEP arm was 44.7% lower than in the run-in period. One-third of patients exhibiting GIP > 0.08 mug/g during run-in had lower or undetectable GIP after AN-PEP treatment. Compared with the run- in period, the proportion of symptomatic patients (CSI > 38) in the AN-PEP arm was significantly lower (P < 0.03). AN-PEP did not result in changes in specific serologies. CONCLUSION: This exploratory study conducted in a real-life setting revealed high adherence to the GFD. The AN-PEP treatment did not significantly reduce the overall GIP stool concentration. However, given the observation of a significantly lower prevalence of patients with severe symptoms in the AN-PEP arm, further clinical research is warranted.
36330715	Gluten-free wafer formulation: Development, characterisation and addition of flavourings with antioxidant capacity.	The incidence of celiac disease is increasing, therefore the demand for gluten-free products that also satisfy the nutritional requirements of celiac individuals is rising. Thus, the objective of the present work was to develop a gluten-free nutritionally balanced wafer formulation with a high content of antioxidants. First, the animal fat used in the traditional formulation was successfully replaced by high oleic sunflower. Second, the antioxidant content of several flavourings (cinnamon/honey/anise/vanilla) was measured and their addition to a gluten-free wafer formulation was evaluated. Third, multivariate statistical tools were used to select the formulation that properly mimicked the characteristics of a gluten-containing wafer. According to the results, anise and cinnamon were the most suitable flavourings to prepare gluten-free wafers, and the sensory analysis concluded that these formulations were highly acceptable (means>6.7 on the hedonic scale). Finally, the storage time analysis indicated that the texture of the gluten-free wafers was more susceptible to water absorption than gluten-containing wafers. Besides, cinnamon wafers presented a higher bioaccessible antioxidant capacity than anise wafers (43.5 +- 0.1 mg Trolox/g and 18.8 +- 0.9 mg Trolox/g respectively) (p < 0.05), which remained stable for four months. This indicates that during its shelf life, the product could be consumed with its beneficial effects intact.
38205645	The association of gluten-free diet with thyroid autoimmunity in patients with celiac disease: a meta-analysis.	Background: Thyroid autoimmunity is an immune response to thyroid antigens that causes varying degrees of thyroid dysfunction. The sole effective treatment for Celiac Disease (CD) is a gluten-free diet (GFD). However, the association between GFD and thyroid autoimmunity in patients with CD has not been confirmed. Methods: A comprehensive search of several databases, involving PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Medline, and Cochrane databases, was conducted to identify studies that primarily addressed the effects of GFD on thyroid autoimmunity in CD subjects. The meta-analysis involved studies that compared the risk of ATPO and ATG antibody positivity in CD patients with GFD, the risk of developing AITD, and the risk of developing thyroid dysfunction. Fixed-effects models or random-effects models were used to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Results: A total of 10 observational studies met the inclusion criteria and included 6423 subjects. The results indicated that GFD is positively associated with thyroid autoimmunity in the children subgroup of CD patients (OR = 1.61, 95%CI 1.06-2.43, P = 0.02). However, there was no significant difference in thyroid autoimmunity between the group adhering to GFD and the control group in the total CD population. Conclusion: The results seem to indicate that subjects with a more pronounced autoimmunity (such as to have an early onset of CD) appear to have a greater risk of thyroid autoimmunity.
36904257	Evaluation of a Single Determination of Gluten Immunogenic Peptides in Urine from Unaware Celiac Patients to Monitor Gluten-Free Diet Adherence.	INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Usually, adherence to the gluten-free diet (GFD) in celiac patients is indirectly assessed through serological analysis, questionnaires, or invasive methods such as intestinal biopsy. The detection of gluten immunogenic peptides in urine (urinary gluten immunogenic peptides-uGIP) is a novel technique that directly evaluates the ingestion of gluten. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of uGIP in the follow-up of celiac disease (CD). METHODS: From April 2019 to February 2020, CD patients reporting complete adherence to the GFD were prospectively enrolled but were unaware of the reason for the tests. Urinary GIP, the celiac dietary adherence test (CDAT), symptomatic visual analog scales (VAS), and tissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTGA) titres were evaluated. Duodenal histology and capsule endoscopy (CE) were performed when indicated. RESULTS: A total of 280 patients were enrolled. Thirty-two (11.4%) had a positive uGIP test (uGIP+). uGIP+ patients did not show significant differences in demographic parameters, CDAT, or VAS scores. The tTGA+ titre was not related to the positivity of uGIP (14.4% vs. 10.9% in patients with tTGA+ and tTGA-). Regarding histology, 66.7% of the GIP+ patients had atrophy compared to 32.7% of the GIP patients (p-value 0.01). However, the presence of atrophy did not correlate with tTGA. Mucosal atrophy was detected in 29 (47.5%) out of 61 patients by CE. With this method, no noticeable dependence on uGIP results (24 GIP- vs. 5 GIP+) was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The single uGIP test was positive in 11% of CD cases referring a correct GFD adherence. Furthermore, uGIP results significantly correlated with the duodenal biopsy, formerly considered the gold standard for assessing CD activity.
32887325	Probiotics, Prebiotics and Other Dietary Supplements for Gut Microbiota Modulation in Celiac Disease Patients.	To date, the only available treatment for celiac disease (CD) patients is a life-lasting gluten-free diet (GFD). Lack of adherence to the GFD leads to a significant risk of adverse health consequences. Food cross-contamination, nutritional imbalances, and persistent gastrointestinal symptoms are the main concerns related to GFD. Moreover, despite rigid compliance to GFD, patients struggle in achieving a full restoring of the gut microbiota, which plays a role in the nutritive compounds processing, and absorption. Pivotal studies on the supplementation of GFD with probiotics, such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacilli, reported a potential to restore gut microbiota composition and to pre-digest gluten in the intestinal lumen, reducing the inflammation associated with gluten intake, the intestinal permeability, and the cytokine and antibody production. These findings could explain an improvement in symptoms and quality of life in patients treated with GFD and probiotics. On the other hand, the inclusion of prebiotics in GFD could also be easy to administer and cost-effective as an adjunctive treatment for CD, having the power to stimulate the growth of potentially health-promoting bacteria strains. However, evidence regarding the use of prebiotics and probiotics in patients with CD is still insufficient to justify their use in clinical practice.
34237639	High consumption of Nickel-containing foods and IBS-like disorders: late events in a gluten-free diet.	As reported in the recent literature, Nickel has become an important part of our daily life since the last decades. We can find it in skincare products, occupational exposures and foods. Only recently, research has started to show a link between Nickel and many health disorders, including adverse reactions to food containing nickel. Nowadays, the relationship between nickel-containing foods and well-being is becoming a topic of growing interest in clinical practice and will play an even larger role in the future. The use of foods with a high nickel content, largely present in a gluten free diet, could explain the lack of clinical remission in celiac patients and dispel a diagnosis of refractory celiac disease.
35652406	Dietary Management of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus with Celiac Disease.	Celiac disease is diagnosed more commonly with type 1 diabetes, and the most problematic aspect for a child with type 1 diabetes and celiac disease is that most GFD foods have a high glycemic index, while low glycemic index foods are recommended for type 1 diabetes mellitus. As a result, dietary controls become more difficult. Diet management could improve the elevated HbA1c levels. The aim of this review is to illustrate the clinical features and diagnostic considerations, as well as current knowledge of common pathogenic features such as genetics, environmental risk factors, and the gut microbiome of type 1 diabtes and celiac disease. Also, the importance of diet management on glycemic control and growth rate in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and celiac disease has been discussed. PubMed and Google Scholar databases were searched. Reports published from the years 1969 to 2021 focused on the role of type 1 diabetes mellitus and celiac disease, and examined the types of diet on glycemic control, growth rate, and quality of life. Only a few studies on the effects of a carbohydrate count gluten-free diet on glycemic control, growth rate, and quality of life in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and celiac disease have been conducted. There have been few studies showing that dietary intervention helps to achieve and maintain normal blood glucose and blood pressure levels, a healthy lipid profile, and a healthy body weight. Studies stated that a low-carbohydrate diet had the greatest effect on improving glycemic control and insulin parameters.
29760697	Hookworm Secreted Extracellular Vesicles Interact With Host Cells and Prevent Inducible Colitis in Mice.	Gastrointestinal (GI) parasites, hookworms in particular, have evolved to cause minimal harm to their hosts, allowing them to establish chronic infections. This is mediated by creating an immunoregulatory environment. Indeed, hookworms are such potent suppressors of inflammation that they have been used in clinical trials to treat inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and celiac disease. Since the recent description of helminths (worms) secreting extracellular vesicles (EVs), exosome-like EVs from different helminths have been characterized and their salient roles in parasite-host interactions have been highlighted. Here, we analyze EVs from the rodent parasite Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, which has been used as a model for human hookworm infection. N. brasiliensis EVs (Nb-EVs) are actively internalized by mouse gut organoids, indicating a role in driving parasitism. We used proteomics and RNA-Seq to profile the molecular composition of Nb-EVs. We identified 81 proteins, including proteins frequently present in exosomes (like tetraspanin, enolase, 14-3-3 protein, and heat shock proteins), and 27 sperm-coating protein-like extracellular proteins. RNA-Seq analysis revealed 52 miRNA species, many of which putatively map to mouse genes involved in regulation of inflammation. To determine whether GI nematode EVs had immunomodulatory properties, we assessed their potential to suppress GI inflammation in a mouse model of inducible chemical colitis. EVs from N. brasiliensis but not those from the whipworm Trichuris muris or control vesicles from grapes protected against colitic inflammation in the gut of mice that received a single intraperitoneal injection of EVs. Key cytokines associated with colitic pathology (IL-6, IL-1beta, IFNgamma, and IL-17a) were significantly suppressed in colon tissues from EV-treated mice. By contrast, high levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were detected in Nb-EV-treated mice. Proteins and miRNAs contained within helminth EVs hold great potential application in development of drugs to treat helminth infections as well as chronic non-infectious diseases resulting from a dysregulated immune system, such as IBD.
34168104	Multiple allelic associations from genes involved in energy metabolism were identified in celiac disease.	Energy metabolism is a critical factor that influences disease pathogenesis. Recent high-throughput genomic studies have enabled us to look into disease biology with greater details. Celiac disease (CD) is an inflammatory autoimmune disease where ~60 non-HLA genes were identified which in conjunction with HLA genes explain ~55% of the disease heritability. In this study we aimed to identify susceptibility energy metabolism genes and investigate their role in CD. We re-analysed published Immunochip genotyping data, which were originally analysed for CD association studies in north Indian and Dutch population. 269 energy metabolism genes were tested. Meta-analysis was done for the identified SNPs. To validate the functional implications of identified markers and/or genes, in silico functional annotation was performed. Six SNPs were identified in north Indians, of which three markers from two loci were replicated in Dutch. rs2071592 (PMeta=5.01e-75) and rs2251824 (PMeta=1.87e-14) from ATP6V1G2-NFKBIL1-DDX39B locus and rs4947331 (PMeta= 9.85e-13) from NEU1 locus were found significantly associated. Identified genes are key regulators of cellular energy metabolism and associated with several immune mediated diseases. In silico functional annotation showed significant biological relevance of these novel markers and genes. FDI approved therapeutics against ATP6V1G2 and NEU1 are currently in use to treat chronic and inflammatory diseases. This study identified two pathogenic loci, originally involved in energy metabolism. Extensive investigation showed their synergistic role in CD pathogenesis by promoting immune mediated enteric inflammation. Proposed CD pathogenesis model in this study needs to be tested through tissue-on-chip and in vivo methods to ensure its translational application.
30368309	Celiac Disease in the Pediatric Population.	Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder in which the lining of the gastrointestinal tract is damaged by an immune-mediated response to gluten proteins (Allen, 2015). It is a polygenetic disease that only appears in genetically susceptible individuals (Newton & Singer, 2012). It is a worldwide concern, with North America having a high prevalence rate (Liu et al., 2017). Celiac disease can present in a spectrum of manifestations, making it difficult to identify and diagnosis (Reilly & Green, 2012). High-risk populations include those with a positive family history as well as individuals with other autoimmune disorders (Newton & Singer, 2012). Screening and diagnosis are completed with a blood test followed by a biopsy of the small intestinal lining (Zevit & Shamir, 2014). Currently, the only treatment for celiac disease is a strict, gluten-free diet. Further research is warranted in areas of environmental risk factors and treatments (Allen, 2015; Newton & Singer, 2012).
32854216	Diet, Perceived Intestinal Well-Being and Compositions of Fecal Microbiota and Short Chain Fatty Acids in Oat-Using Subjects with Celiac Disease or Gluten Sensitivity.	A gluten-free diet may result in high fat and low fiber intake and thus lead to unbalanced microbiota. This study characterized fecal microbiota profiles by 16S MiSeq sequencing among oat-using healthy adult subjects (n = 14) or adult subjects with celiac disease (CeD) (n = 19) or non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) (n = 10). Selected microbial metabolites, self-reported 4d food diaries and perceived gut symptoms were compared. Subjects with NCGS experienced the highest amount of gut symptoms and received more energy from fat and less from carbohydrates than healthy and CeD subjects. Oat consumption resulted in reaching the lower limit of the recommended fiber intake. Frequent consumption of gluten-free pure oats did not result in microbiota dysbiosis in subjects with CeD or NCGS. Thus, the high number of gut symptoms in NCGS subjects was not linked to the microbiota. The proportion of fecal acetate was higher in healthy when compared to NCGS subjects, which may be linked to a higher abundance of Bifidobacterium in the control group compared to NCGS and CeD subjects. Propionate, butyrate and ammonia production and beta-glucuronidase activity were comparable among the study groups. The results suggest that pure oats have great potential as the basis of a gluten-free diet and warrant further studies in minor microbiota disorders.
31710883	Paroxismal non-kinesigenic dyskinesia and hemidystonia associated with silent celiac disease.	Paroxismal non-kinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD) is a rare movement disorder manifesting as choreatic/dystonic movements, usually lasting from minutes to up to 4 h, with perserved consciousness during attacks. Primary PNKD are idiopathic or genetic disorders while secondary PNKD are associated with various neurologic and medical conditions. We present a case with PNKD and right sided hemidystonia in association with celiac disease, responsive to gluten-free diet, not previously reported in available literature. In conclusion, diagnostic tests for celiac disease should be a part of etiological investigations in patients with otherwise unexplained movement disorders including PKND. Gluten free diet could produce a favorable clinical response in those patients.
29426626	Antituberculosis Treatment in a Patient with Celiac Disease.	
33291590	Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity in the Context of Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders.	Gluten-free diets are increasingly chosen in the Western world, even in the absence of a diagnosis of celiac disease. Around 10% of people worldwide self-report gluten-related complaints, including intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms. In most cases, these subjects would be labeled as patients suffering from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) who place themselves on a gluten-free diet even in the absence of celiac disease. In some instances, patients report a clear benefit by avoiding gluten from their diet and/or symptom worsening upon gluten reintroduction. This clinical entity has been termed non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). The symptoms referred by these patients are both intestinal and extra-intestinal, suggesting that similarly to functional gastrointestinal disorders, NCGS is a disorder of gut-brain interaction. It remains unclear if gluten is the only wheat component involved in NCGS. The mechanisms underlying symptom generation in NCGS remain to be fully clarified, although in the past few years, the research has significantly moved forward with new data linking NCGS to changes in gut motility, permeability and innate immunity. The diagnosis is largely based on the self-reported reaction to gluten by the patient, as there are no available biomarkers, and confirmatory double-blind challenge protocols are unfeasible in daily clinical practice. Some studies suggest that a small proportion of patients with IBS have an intolerance to gluten. However, the benefits of gluten-free or low-gluten diets in non-celiac disease-related conditions are limited, and the long-term consequences of this practice may include nutritional and gut microbiota unbalance. Here, we summarize the role of gluten in the clinical features, pathophysiology, and management of NCGS and disorders of gut-brain interaction.
33722583	TAK-101 Nanoparticles Induce Gluten-Specific Tolerance in Celiac Disease: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: In celiac disease (CeD), gluten induces immune activation, leading to enteropathy. TAK-101, gluten protein (gliadin) encapsulated in negatively charged poly(dl-lactide-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles, is designed to induce gluten-specific tolerance. METHODS: TAK-101 was evaluated in phase 1 dose escalation safety and phase 2a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies. Primary endpoints included pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of TAK-101 (phase 1) and change from baseline in circulating gliadin-specific interferon-gamma-producing cells at day 6 of gluten challenge, in patients with CeD (phase 2a). Secondary endpoints in the phase 2a study included changes from baseline in enteropathy (villus height to crypt depth ratio [Vh:Cd]), and frequency of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes and peripheral gut-homing T cells. RESULTS: In phase 2a, 33 randomized patients completed the 14-day gluten challenge. TAK-101 induced an 88% reduction in change from baseline in interferon-gamma spot-forming units vs placebo (2.01 vs 17.58, P = .006). Vh:Cd deteriorated in the placebo group (-0.63, P = .002), but not in the TAK-101 group (-0.18, P = .110), although the intergroup change from baseline was not significant (P = .08). Intraepithelial lymphocyte numbers remained equal. TAK-101 reduced changes in circulating alpha4beta7+CD4+ (0.26 vs 1.05, P = .032), alphaEbeta7+CD8+ (0.69 vs 3.64, P = .003), and gammadelta (0.15 vs 1.59, P = .010) effector memory T cells. TAK-101 (up to 8 mg/kg) induced no clinically meaningful changes in vital signs or routine clinical laboratory evaluations. No serious adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: TAK-101 was well tolerated and prevented gluten-induced immune activation in CeD. The findings from the present clinical trial suggest that antigen-specific tolerance was induced and represent a novel approach translatable to other immune-mediated diseases. ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT03486990 and NCT03738475.
32218420	Fecal gluten immunogenic peptides as indicators of dietary compliance in celiac patients.	BACKGROUND: It is important to have methods for evaluating dietary compliance in patients with celiac disease (CD). Determination of fecal gluten immunogenic peptides (GIPs) was recently proposed as a method of detecting gluten intake. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether determination of GIPs can be used as an indicator of compliance with a gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: Twenty-five persons with CD on a gluten-free diet for at least one year were enrolled in the study. Compliance with the diet was assessed by the Biagi questionnaire, evaluation of symptoms and assay of IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (IgA anti-tTG). GIPs were determined by iVYLISA GIP-S test (Biomedal S.L., Seville, Spain) on an automated Chorus analyzer (DIESSE Diagnostica Senese, Siena, Italy), after extraction of fecal samples by the method developed by DIESSE. RESULTS: Four patients tested positive for GIPs (GIP+), two of whom complied strictly with the gluten-free diet according to the Biagi questionnaire. None of the four GIP-positive patients manifested symptoms. IgA anti-tTG was significantly higher in GIP+ than in GIP- subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Assay of fecal GIPs identified more patients who were not complying with the diet than the Biagi questionnaire or evaluation of symptoms. The anti-tTG and GIP results agreed perfectly; however, since anti-tTG antibodies remain high for longer and are not a completely reliable marker of GFD intake, detection of fecal GIPs offers a direct, objective, quantitative assessment of exposure, even occasional, to gluten and could be used to check dietary compliance.
29039796	Development and Validation of the Celiac Disease-Children's Activities Report (CD-Chart) for Promoting Self-Management among Children and Adolescents.	Adherence to a restrictive gluten-free diet is the only known treatment for celiac disease (CD). Children and adolescents with CD encounter challenges while managing the diet in daily activities. Understanding their participation characteristics is lacking. The aim was to describe the development and validation process of the Celiac Disease-Children's Activities Report (CD-Chart). The final CD-Chart includes nine food-related activities that are measured by six core dimensions: frequency, preference, preparation, involvement, help, and self-determination. Participants were 126 children (8-11 years) and adolescents (12-18 years) with CD, and 30 healthy matched controls. Factor analysis was performed and psychometric properties were measured. Content and face validity was established and the CD-Chart showed adequate internal consistency as measured by the preference dimension (alpha = 0.81). Factor analysis revealed two distinct factors, social environment and close family environment. Construct validity demonstrated that the group with CD required significantly more pre-preparation for food-related activities than controls, (t(38) = 76.25, p < 0.001) and further differences as well as similarities were found between groups. Primary results indicate that the CD-Chart may serve as a practical tool for acquiring information about participation characteristics in food-related activities, strengths and challenges of children and adolescents with CD, to promote self-management, diet adherence, and well-being.
30779970	Fibre-enriched buckwheat pasta modifies blood glucose response compared to corn pasta in individuals with type 1 diabetes and celiac disease: Acute randomized controlled trial.	AIM: People with type 1 diabetes and celiac disease (T1D&CD) have high blood glucose variability. Processed gluten-free foods have shown to induce a worse metabolic profile whereas naturally gluten-free foods may represent healthier options. On the other hand, dietary fibre has shown to reduce postprandial glycemic excursions in individuals with diabetes. Thus, we evaluated the acute effect of fibre-enriched buckwheat (FBP) and corn pasta (CP) on postprandial blood glucose response (PP-BGR). METHODS: Ten adult patients with T1D&CD consumed two meals with the same amount of carbohydrate while differing only for pasta type (FBP or CP) preceded by the same insulin bolus. Participants utilized continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and data over 6 h after meal were analyzed. RESULTS: PP-BGR differed between the two meals, being significantly lower in the first period (0-3 h) after the CP than the FBP meal (iAUC: -38 +- 158 vs. 305 +- 209 mmol/L   180 min, p = 0.040), whereas significantly higher in the second period (3-6 h) after the CP than the FBP meal (iAUC: 432 +- 153 vs. 308 +- 252 mmol/L   180 min, p = 0.030). Overall, a less variable postprandial profile was observed after FBP than CP consumption. CONCLUSIONS: In individuals with T1D&CD, the acute consumption of FBP induces significant differences in PP-BGR compared with CP that may be clinically relevant.
33200613	Villous atrophy persistence in celiac disease despite following a gluten-free diet must be clarified.	We read with great interest the article recently published in REED by Shadegi et al. Villous atrophy (VA) persists in 35 % and 23.7 % of celiac disease (CD) patients for six and 24 months, respectively, after following a gluten-free diet (GFD). The authors think that the time following a GFD must be longer than two years in some patients to achieve mucosal healing and we agree with this. Our experience comes from a short series of ten females and three males with CD, diagnosed at an average age of 36 years (15-72) based on serology (anti-TG2 > 10 IU/ml or anti-Em positive) and a duodenal biopsy showing VA. All cases followed a GFD, according to the anamnesis and underwent a second duodenal biopsy and anti-TG2 determination after 42 (10-202) months. Immunogenic peptides of gluten (IPG) in feces were determined in four patients.
34504037	IgA Nephropathy as the Initial Presentation of Celiac Disease in an Adolescent.	Immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy (Berger's disease) is the most common glomerulonephritis worldwide. The disease typically is chronic and lifelong and eventually progresses to impaired renal function in a substantial proportion of cases. It has been known for some time that there is a correlation between IgA nephropathy and celiac disease, but until now it has remained unclear whether treatment of the underlying celiac disease has any meaningful impact on the progression of the renal disease. Therefore, until now, screening for celiac disease in patients presenting with IgA nephropathy has not been universally recommended in the absence of suggestive gastrointestinal symptoms. This report describes a case of IgA nephropathy in an adolescent boy that turned out to be the initial presentation of celiac disease. More importantly, it documents the complete laboratory normalization of his renal anomalies at 5-year follow-up after treatment of his celiac disease with implementation of a gluten-free diet. This case highlights the importance of awareness that suspected IgA nephropathy, even in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms, should prompt screening for underlying celiac disease as a potential, and possibly treatable, cause.
29633011	Gluten-free-rendered products contribute to imbalanced diets in children and adolescents with celiac disease.	PURPOSE: As well as adhering to the safe limit for gluten intake, a suitable gluten-free (GF) diet must also be nutritionally balanced. However, malnutrition has been observed in the population with celiac disease (CD). This is even more important in the case of children and adolescents, whose GF diet must also ensure their proper growth. The aim of the present study was to assess the diet quality of children and adolescents with CD to attain optimal nutritional status, determining the most relevant factors that affect a balanced diet. METHODS: Eighty-three children and adolescents with CD (9.2 +- 3.8 years) took part in the study. Height, weight and body composition were measured. An analysis of energy consumption and of the macronutrient distribution of their diet was carried out. Adherence to Mediterranean diet by KIDMED index was analyzed, and energy and nutrients intake. RESULTS: The diet of participants was not balanced, containing more fat and less carbohydrate than recommended. Most children and adolescents revealed adequate body mass index and suitable body fat percentage. Two-thirds of them showed moderate or poor KIDMED index, the case of girls being remarkable. When the GF diet, containing GF-rendered foodstuffs, was compared to a similar type of diet but substituting GF products with their analogs containing gluten, important nutritional differences were revealed. CONCLUSIONS: Even though celiac children and adolescents' diet is unhealthy due to its inappropriate dietary pattern, following a diet based on GF products raises extra difficulty in complying with the nutritional recommendations.
32692806	Negative predictive value of the repeated absence of gluten immunogenic peptides in the urine of treated celiac patients in predicting mucosal healing: new proposals for follow-up in celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: The treatment of celiac disease (CD) is a lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD). The current methods for monitoring GFD conformance, such as a dietary questionnaire or serology tests, may be inaccurate in detecting dietary transgressions, and duodenal biopsies are invasive, expensive, and not a routine monitoring technique. OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to determine the clinical usefulness of urine gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) as a biomarker monitoring GFD adherence in celiac patients and to evaluate the concordance of the results with the degree of mucosal damage. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted involving 22 de novo CD patients, 77 celiac patients consuming a GFD, and 13 nonceliac subjects. On 3 d of the week, urine samples were collected and the GIP concentrations were tested. Simultaneously, anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies, questionnaire results, clinical manifestations, and histological findings were analyzed. RESULTS: Approximately 24% (18 of 76) of the celiac patients consuming a GFD exhibited Marsh II-III mucosal damage. Among this population, 94% (17 of 18) had detectable urine GIP; however, between 60% and 80% were asymptomatic and exhibited negative serology and appropriate GFD adherence based on the questionnaire. In contrast, 97% (31 of 32) of the celiac patients without duodenal damage had no detectable GIP. These results demonstrated the high sensitivity (94%) and negative predictive value (97%) of GIP measurements in relation to duodenal biopsy findings. In the de novo CD-diagnosed cohort, 82% (18 of 22) of patients had measurable amounts of GIP in the urine. CONCLUSIONS: Determining GIP concentrations in several urine samples may be an especially convenient approach to assess recent gluten exposure in celiac patients and appears to accurately predict the absence of histological lesions. The introduction of GIP testing as an assessment technique for GFD adherence may help in ascertaining dietary compliance and to target the most suitable intervention during follow-up.
31611125	Familial Celiac Disease Remission as a Result of a Full Donor Immunologic Recovery After Sibling Cord Blood Transplantation for Chronic Granulomatous Disease: A Case Report.	We present a case report of a boy diagnosed with both chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) and familial celiac disease (CD) who underwent cord blood transplantation from a partially matched sibling donor. The presentation of CD resembled Crohn-like enteropathy, which is a canonical manifestation of CGD. Nearly 1 year post-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), a gluten-containing diet was reintroduced, and no reappearance of clinical, serologic, or histologic markers of CD was observed. The relatively high incidence of rare genetic diseases in pediatric patients suggests the need for additional caution in the interpretation of symptoms mimicking already known hallmarks of more common conditions. In addition, the presented data confirm the previous rare observations that allogeneic HSCT leads to durable induction of gluten tolerance in patients with CD, which can warrant its use in patients with refractory subtypes of CD.
38453268	A Low-Protein, Plant-Dominant Gluten-Free Diet for Immunoglobulin A Nephropathy and Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis.	Immunoglobulin A nephropathy is the most common glomerulonephritis syndrome in the world, yet there is currently no cure. While blood pressure control, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition, and immunosuppression may slow disease progression, low-protein diets, defined as a daily dietary protein intake of 0.6 to 0.8 g/kg body weight, may also decrease immune complex deposition and disease severity, as evidenced in animal models. The link between secondary immunoglobulin A nephropathy and celiac disease has also led to the rise of gluten-free diets and zinc supplementation as potential lifestyle modifications to help manage common immunoglobulin A nephropathy symptoms such as proteinuria and hematuria. In addition, case reports and prospective studies suggest that patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, which manifests as steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome may also benefit from a gluten-free diet. We highlight the example of a gluten-free, plant-dominant low-protein diet (a different type of low-protein diet that addresses both protein quantity and quality) for patients with immunoglobulin A nephropathy or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.
33999573	The effect of gluten on skin and hair: a systematic review.	Non-celiac gluten sensitivity is often clinically indistinguishable from celiac disease, and patients show improvement or resolution of their symptoms with a gluten-free diet. In contrast to celiac disease, the effects of gluten on the skin and hair in the context of non-celiac gluten sensitivity are not as clear. This review aims to describe the impact of gluten on the skin and hair in patients with non-celiac gluten sensitivity and those without a definitive celiac disease diagnosis. A literature search was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) reporting guidelines for systematic reviews. Forty-two publications met inclusion criteria with five studies describing the skin manifestations of non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Trials identifying the impact of a gluten-free diet on skin disease, as well as dermatologic conditions and their associations with antigliadin antibodies were also identified. Dermatologic manifestations in patients with non-celiac gluten sensitivity vary and may be non-specific. It may be appropriate for some of these patients with skin manifestations to trial a gluten-free diet. Dermatologic conditions that may respond positively to a gluten-free diet include psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, vitiligo, and palmoplantar pustulosis, while linear IgA disease does not appear to improve with this dietary change.
37473709	The emerging paradigm of Unconventional T cells as a novel therapeutic target for celiac disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is an organ-specific autoimmune disorder that occurs in genetically predisposed individuals when exposed to exogenous dietary gluten. This exposure to wheat gluten and related proteins from rye and barley triggers an immune response which leads to the development of enteropathy associated with symptoms of bloating, diarrhea, or malabsorption. The sole current treatment is to follow a gluten-free diet for the rest of one's life. Intestinal barriers are enriched with Unconventional T cells such as iNKT, MAIT, and gammadelta T cells, which lack or express only a limited range of rearranged antigen receptors. Unconventional T cells play a crucial role in regulating mucosal barrier function and microbial colonization. Unconventional T cell populations are widely represented in diseased conditions, where changes in disease activity related to iNKT and MAIT cell reduction, as well as gammadelta T cell expansion, are demonstrated. In this review, we discuss the role and potential employment of Unconventional T cells as a therapeutic target in the pathophysiology of celiac disease.
30711203	Celiac Disease in Asia.	Celiac disease, once thought to be very uncommon in Asia, is now emerging in many Asian countries. Although the absolute number of patients with celiac disease at present is not very high, this number is expected to increase markedly over the next few years/decades owing to increasing awareness. It is now that the medical community across the Asia should define the extent of the problem and prepare to handle the impending epidemic of celiac disease in Asia.
34495279	The role of probiotics in the immune response and intestinal microbiota of children with celiac disease: a systematic review.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate changes in peripheral immunological response (decrease in blood proinflammatory cytokines) and fecal microbiota (especially Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes) after administration of probiotics in children with celiac disease on a gluten-free diet. DATA SOURCE: The databases MEDLINE, LILACS, Springer and SciELO were used for this review, with the descriptors "celiac disease AND probiotics". At the end of the search, 168 articles were retrieved, four of which were included in the final qualitative synthesis, having as inclusion criteria randomized clinical trials and pediatric population (1-19 years) and, as exclusion criteria, interventions other than probiotics, studies with patients with other diseases associated with celiac disease, or patients who did not meet the diagnostic criteria. All elected studies were published until September 2020, without language restriction, with patients receiving strains of Bifidobacterium breve or B. longum and on a gluten-free diet. DATA SYNTHESIS: The studies show that the administration of probiotics along with a gluten-free diet, can approximate the fecal microbiota of celiac patients to typical conditions of healthy individuals, by restoring the abundance of some microbial communities that characterize the typical physiological condition. In addition, the administration of probiotics can reduce serum proinflammatory cytokines (mainly TNF-alpha). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the positive correlation between probiotics and fecal microbiota/serological markers in pediatric patients with celiac disease, we emphasize the need for future multicentric studies that should include a larger number of patients and a longer follow up period.
33418957	Influence of Ultra-Processed Foods Consumption on Redox Status and Inflammatory Signaling in Young Celiac Patients.	The current study was designed to assess the influence of consumption of ultra-processed (UPF) on oxidative/antioxidant balance and evoked inflammatory signaling in young patients with celiac disease (CD). The study included 85 children. The celiac group (n = 53) included children with CD with a long (>18 months, n = 17) or recent (<18 months, n = 36) adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). The control group (n = 32) included healthy children with a significantly higher consumption of UPF compared to the control group, both expressed as kcal/day (p = 0.043) and as percentage of daily energy intake (p = 0.023). Among children with CD, the group with the lowest consumption of UPF (below the 50% of daily energy intake) had a greater Mediterranean diet (MD) adherence and higher moderate physical activity levels. In addition, CD children with the lowest consumption of UPF had healthier redox (lower soluble superoxide dismutase-1 and 15-F2t-isoprostanes) and inflammatory profiles (lower macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha) compared to the group with the highest consumption of UPF (all, p < 0.05) regardless of the time on a GFD. These findings highlight the importance of a correct monitoring of the GFD. An unbalanced GFD with high consumption of UPF and an unhealthy pattern with less physical activity and worse adherence to MD results in a worse inflammatory profile, which could act as a parallel pathway that could have important consequences on the pathophysiology of the disease.
36300634	Liver abnormalities in celiac disease and response to gluten free diet: A systematic review and meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: Liver involvement in celiac disease (CeD) is known but its various etiologies and the effect of gluten free diet (GFD) on it is understudied. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Medline and Embase databases from date of inception to March 7, 2022, to look for studies reporting on CeD and liver abnormalities. Pooled proportion of CeD patients with deranged transaminases, etiologies of various other liver diseases with CeD and the response to GFD were estimated. Subgroup analyses based on the age group, geographic distribution and duration of GFD were also carried out. RESULTS: Total 42 studies (8976 patients) reported hyper-transaminasemia in patients with celiac disease. The pooled proportion of patients with elevated transaminases was 21.42% (95% CI: 17.02-26.59, I2  = 94%) overall, with similar prevalence among adults (21.20%) and children (21.51%). The commonest etiology was celiac hepatitis at 49.23% (95% CI: 30.09-68.59, I2  = 87%). Compliance with GFD was noted in 90.27%. The proportion of CeD patients with liver abnormalities who showed response to GFD was 86.39% (95% CI: 80.04-90.95, I2  = 74%) overall. CONCLUSION: Liver involvement was noted in 21.42% of CeD patients. Celiac hepatitis was reported in nearly half of them. Good compliance and response were noted with GFD.
28891139	Helicobacter pylori infection in children.	Helicobacter pylori infection in children differs from that in adults, from the point of view of epidemiology, host response, clinical features, related diseases, and diagnosis, as well as treatment strategies. The prevalence of H. pylori infection, in both children and adults, is decreasing in the Western World as well as in some developing countries, which contrasts with the increase in childhood asthma and allergic diseases. Recurrent abdominal pain is not specific during H. pylori infection in children. The role of H. pylori infection and failure to thrive, children's growth, type I diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and celiac disease remains controversial. The main initial diagnosis is based on upper digestive endoscopy with biopsy-based methods. Nodular gastritis may be a pathognomonic endoscopic finding of childhood H. pylori infection. The infection eradication control is based on validated noninvasive tests. The main cause of treatment failure of H. pylori infection is its clarithromycin resistance. We recommend standard antibiotic susceptibility testing of H. pylori in pediatric patients prior to the initiation of eradication therapy. H. pylori treatment in children should be based on an evaluation of the rate of eradication in the local population, a systematic use of a treatment adapted to the susceptibility profile and a treatment compliance greater than 90%. The last meta-analysis in children did not show an advantage for sequential therapy when compared to a 14-day triple therapy. Finally, the high rate of antibiotic resistance responsible for therapy failure in recent years justifies the necessity of a novel vaccine to prevent H. pylori infection in children.
30445688	A Retrospective Study on Dietary FODMAP Intake in Celiac Patients Following a Gluten-Free Diet.	Our aim was to evaluate the intake of foods containing fermentable oligo/di/mono-saccharides and polyols (FODMAP) as a possible factor that induces gastrointestinal symptoms in treated celiac disease (CD) patients. We collected seven-day weighed food records for 104 CD patients and 91 healthy volunteers. All evaluated food items were from sources with high and low content of FODMAP, which were divided into cereals and sweets, sweeteners and soft drinks, fruits, dried fruits, and vegetables. Nutrient intake was calculated using the food database of the European Institute of Oncology. The symptoms reported were assessed by a Rome IV Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) diagnostic questionnaire and by specific questions for the evaluation of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). The 12% of CD patients met IBS symptoms criteria as opposed to 6% of controls (p = 0.09) and 27% of patients reported FGIDs symptoms vs. 22% of healthy controls (p = 0.42). The intake by CD patients was significantly higher than healthy volunteers for: sweeteners and sugars with low content of FODMAP (p = 0.0007), fruits, dried fruits, and vegetables high in FODMAP (p = 0.003) and low in FODMAP (p = 0.04) when compared to controls. CD patients had a lower intake of cereals and sweets with a high content of FODMAP (p = 0.00001). Healthy volunteers consumed significantly higher alcoholic beverages and fats high in FODMAP (both p < 0.044). The mean daily intake of other food categories did not differ between both groups. Even though CD patients had a low intake of gluten-free cereals high in FODMAP, they still consumed a significant amount of fruits and vegetables high in FODMAP. The clinical effect of a concomitant gluten-free diet and low-FODMAP diet should be prospectively evaluated as a supportive therapy in CD patients.
34481955	Patients' Risk Tolerance for Non-Dietary Therapies in Celiac Disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder mediated by an immune response to dietary gluten that affects the small intestine and leads to inflammation, malabsorption, and systemic consequences.1 The only established therapy is strict adherence to a gluten-free diet.2,3 Recently there has been growth in the development of novel non-dietary therapies for patients with CD,4 which are driven by dissatisfaction with the burden of the gluten-free diet.5,6.
35796297	Elevated interleukin-17A levels despite reduced microRNA-326 gene expression in celiac disease patients under gluten-free diet.	Introduction: The microRNA-326 (miR-326) gene, by targeting ETS Proto-Oncogene 1 (ETS1), regulates the differentiation and interleukin-17A production of T helper 17 (Th17) cells. Celiac disease (CD) is an intestinal autoimmune disorder, in which the cascade of Th17 cells plays an important role in its pathogenicity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression changes of miR-326 and its two target genes ETS1 and IL-17A in celiac disease patients under a gluten-free diet (GFD). We expected the expression of miR-326 and IL-17A gene to decrease, and the expression of the ETS1 gene to increase, following the adherence to GFD. Methods: Peripheral blood samples of 40 CD patients under GFD (for more than 1 year) and 40 healthy individuals were collected. RNA was extracted, cDNA was synthesized and the miR-326, ETS1 and IL-17A gene expressions were evaluated by the quantitative polymerase real-time qPCR method. P-value   0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Although miR-326 mRNA expression was significantly lower in CD patients (P = 0.001), no significant difference was observed in ETS1 mRNA level between the two groups (P = 0.54), but IL-17A was significantly overexpressed in CD patients (P=0.002). No significant correlation was observed between the expression of the studied genes and the patients' symptoms and Marsh classification. Conclusion:Adherence to the GFD for one to two years did not have the expected effect on the expression of genes in this panel. The most important finding that contradicted our hypothesis was the observation of high IL-17A levels in CD patients despite dieting, which may be related to the protective effect of this cytokine on intestinal tight junctions, which needs to be confirmed in further studies.
33346700	Circulating PV-1 as a marker of celiac disease-associated liver injury.	Aim: To investigate the role of endothelial PV-1 in patients with untreated celiac disease (CD)-associated liver injury. Materials & methods: PV-1 and PV-1 mRNA were measured in intestinal biopsies from untreated CD patients with elevated or normal alanine transaminase levels, controls, patients with inflammatory bowel disease and patients with toxic liver injury. Circulating PV-1 levels were also evaluated. Results: Circulating PV-1 levels were significantly increased in the serum of patients with CD-associated liver injury and reverted to normal following a gluten-free diet. Mucosal PV-1 and PV-1 mRNA were no different in patients with CD-associated liver injury. Conclusion: Serum but not mucosal PV-1 represents a marker of gluten-dependent liver injury and response to a gluten-free diet in patients with untreated CD.

36771334	Gluten-Free Diet and Metabolic Syndrome: Could Be a Not Benevolent Encounter?	Celiac disease is a rising disorder and is becoming frequently diagnosed in recent years. To date, the only available treatment is the gluten-free diet (GFD). The role of gluten on components of metabolic syndrome and on related inflammatory response is still unclear due to controversial results. In recent years, scientific focus on this topic has been growing up, in particular regarding the role of the GFD on glycometabolic parameters and diabetes. In addition, studies on the remaining components showed discordant results, which was likely due to heterogeneous and large celiac disease populations and to the lack of prospective studies. Furthermore, knowledge about the role of the GFD on inflammatory cytokines and the relationship among vitamin D and celiac disease, metabolic syndrome (MS) and GFD is needed. In this narrative review, we provided evidence regarding the role of the GFD on glycometabolic parameters, cholesterol, triglycerides, waist circumference, blood pressure and inflammatory cascade, also evaluating the role of vitamin D, trying to summarize whether this nutritional pattern may be a value-added for subjects with dysmetabolic conditions. Finally, due to the limited findings and very low-certainty evidence, predominantly based on observational studies, the real effects of a GFD on different components of MS, however, are unclear; nevertheless, an improvement in HDL levels has been reported, although data on glycemic levels are discordant.
32898005	Acute Pancreatitis in Celiac Disease: Has the Inpatient Prevalence Changed and Is It Associated With Worse Outcomes?	OBJECTIVES: Studies suggest that adults diagnosed with celiac disease (CD) are at higher risk of developing acute pancreatitis (AP). The aim of this study is to explore the relationship between CD and AP in terms of inpatient prevalence, mortality, morbidity, and resource utilization in the past decade. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2007-2016). The primary outcome was the occurrence of AP in CD patients. Secondary outcomes were the trend in AP cases in CD patients, and mortality, morbidity, length of stay, and total hospital charges and costs. RESULTS: Of 337,201 CD patients identified, 7372 also had AP. The mean age was 53 years, 71% were women. The inpatient prevalence of AP in CD was 2.2% versus 1.2% in non-CD cohort (P < 0.01). Patients with CD displayed increased odds of having AP (adjusted odds ratio, 1.92; P < 0.01). Patients with AP and CD displayed lower odds of morbidity and mortality than non-CD patients with AP. CONCLUSIONS: The inpatient prevalence of AP is higher in CD patients, and increased from 2007 to 2016. Patients with CD and AP displayed lower morbidity and mortality, which may suggest that they have a less severe form of AP or lower baseline comorbidity.
33524131	Impact of a Gluten-Free Diet on Quality of Life and Health Perception in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes and Asymptomatic Celiac Disease.	CONTEXT: Celiac disease (CD) is a common comorbidity seen in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and is frequently asymptomatic. As chronic conditions requiring significant lifestyle changes, there are limited reports assessing changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) during transition to a gluten-free diet (GFD) in patients with T1D who are asymptomatic for CD. OBJECTIVE: This work aims to prospectively assess HRQoL and health perception in children and adults with T1D and asymptomatic CD after random assignment to GFD vs usual diet. METHODS: Patients with T1D aged 8 to 45 years without CD symptoms were serologically screened for CD, with positive results confirmed with intestinal biopsy. Participants were randomly assigned in an open-label fashion to a GFD or gluten-containing diet (GCD) for 12 months. Generic and diabetes-specific HRQoL and self-perceived wellness (SPW) were assessed longitudinally. RESULTS: A total of 2387 T1D patients were serologically screened. CD was biopsy-confirmed in 82 patients and 51 participants were randomly assigned to a GFD (N = 27) or GCD (N = 24). Excellent adherence to the assigned diets was observed. Overall, no changes in generic (P = .73) or diabetes-specific HRQoL (P = .30), or SPW (P = .41) were observed between groups over 12 months. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and gastrointestinal symptoms were consistent predictors of HRQoL and SPW. CONCLUSION: HRQoL and SPW were not significantly affected by the adoption of a GFD over 12 months, but worsened with symptom onset and increased HbA1c. Our findings indicate that transition to a GFD can be made successfully in this population without adversely affecting quality of life.
36235823	The Update of the Italian Food Composition Database of Gluten-Free Products and Its Application in Food-Based Dietary Guidelines Menus.	Complete food composition databases (FCDBs) on gluten-free (GF) foods are needed to assess the nutrient intakes of celiac disease patients. The aim of the present work was to update the previously developed version of the Italian GF-FCDB and to apply it to a theoretical GF diet. The updated GF-FCDB includes the composition of 108 GF cereal-based foods, as sold, in terms of energy and macro- and micro-nutrients, imputed using food label information combined with the standard recipe approach. Three scenarios (i.e., refined, mixed, and wholegrain cereals) of the weekly guideline menu for the general Italian population were analyzed for energy and nutrient content in a theoretical dietary assessment using traditional gluten-containing (GC) foods and the corresponding GF substitutes. All GF menus were higher than the corresponding GC menus in polyunsaturated fatty acids, linoleic acid, and vitamin E. Zinc was lower in GF than in GC menus only in the wholegrain-cereal scenario. Thanks to the application of the updated GF-FCDB including a comprehensive list of micronutrients, we observed that it is possible for celiac disease patients to meet nutrient requirements by simply substituting GC with GF cereal-based products following recommendations for the general population.
31779758	A Case of Polyautoimmunity: Celiac Hepatitis, Grave's Disease and Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia.	Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder with high incidence of multi organ involvement; especially, gastrointestinal manifestations and an increased risk of malignancies. Here we report a case of CD with celiac hepatitis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) and Grave's disease (GD) with their complications. Polyautoimmunity requires comprehensive analysis. While CD and GD were previously diagnosed, AIHA and cirrhosis were diagnosed during admission upon extensive work-up. Similarly, other autoimmune etiologies, such as autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), and/or primary biliary cholangitis were ruled out. All three diseases were treated afresh with strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) and carbimazole along with addition of medications for cirrhosis complicated by ascites. This was a rare case where non-adherence to a GFD led to such severe adverse events. A case of celiac hepatitis presenting with such a wide array of signs and symptoms has rarely been reported in the literature and the management of this patient was unique and challenging.
35334866	Compliance with Gluten Free Diet Is Associated with Better Quality of Life in Celiac Disease.	The quality of life (QOL) of patients with celiac disease (CD) can be altered by both symptoms of the disease and by the restrictions of the gluten-free diet (GFD). The objective was to determine the factors associated with better QOL in a large cohort of CD patients. A link to an online survey was sent to the members of the French Association of Gluten Intolerant People (AFDIAG). The French-Celiac Disease Questionnaire (F-CDQ), scoring from 0 to 100, was used to measure the QOL. Other data collected were sociodemographic characteristics, information on CD, purchasing and consumption habits of gluten-free products, and a self-assessment scale (ranging from 0 to 10) to determine the compliance with the GFD. Among the 907 CD patients who returned the questionnaire, 787 were analyzed (638 women (81%); median age: 49 years; 71% with self-assessed GFD compliance > 8). Their median F-CDQ was 73 (range: 59-82). In multivariate analysis, the main factors associated with a better quality of life were the long duration of the GFD, good compliance with the GFD, and the number of follow-up visits. Compliance with and duration of the GFD are associated with a better quality of life in patients with CD. Taking this into consideration would offset its restrictive aspect and improve its adherence.
34914787	Preserved central cholinergic functioning to transcranial magnetic stimulation in de novo patients with celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is now viewed as a systemic disease with multifaceted clinical manifestations. Among the extra-intestinal features, neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms are still a diagnostic challenge, since they can precede or follow the diagnosis of CD. In particular, it is well known that some adults with CD may complain of cognitive symptoms, that improve when the gluten-free diet (GFD) is started, although they may re-appear after incidental gluten intake. Among the neurophysiological techniques, motor evoked potentials (MEPs) to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can non-invasively probe in vivo the excitation state of cortical areas and cortico-spinal conductivity, being also able to unveil preclinical impairment in several neurological and psychiatric disorders, as well as in some systemic diseases affecting the central nervous system (CNS), such as CD. We previously demonstrated an intracortical disinhibition and hyperfacilitation of MEP responses to TMS in newly diagnosed patients. However, no data are available on the central cholinergic functioning indexed by specific TMS measures, such as the short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI), which might represent the neurophysiological correlate of cognitive changes in CD patients, also at the preclinical level. METHODS: Cognitive and depressive symptoms were screened by means of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), respectively, in 15 consecutive de novo CD patients and 15 healthy controls. All patients were on normal diet at the time of the enrolment. Brain computed tomography (CT) was performed in all patients. SAI, recorded at two interstimulus intervals (2 and 8 ms), was assessed as the percentage amplitude ratio between the conditioned and the unconditioned MEP response. Resting motor threshold, MEP amplitude and latency, and central motor conduction time were also measured. RESULTS: The two groups were comparable for age, sex, anthropometric features, and educational level. Brain CT ruled out intracranial calcifications and clear radiological abnormalities in all patients. Scores at MoCA and HDRS were significantly worse in patients than in controls. The comparison of TMS data between the two groups revealed no statistically significant difference for all measures, including SAI at both interstimulus intervals. CONCLUSIONS: Central cholinergic functioning explored by the SAI of the motor cortex resulted to be not affected in these de novo CD patients compared to age-matched healthy controls. Although the statistically significant difference in MoCA, an overt cognitive impairment was not clinically evident in CD patients. Coherently, to date, no study based on TMS or other diagnostic techniques has shown any involvement of the central acetylcholine or the cholinergic fibers within the CNS in CD. This finding might add support to the vascular inflammation hypothesis underlying the so-called "gluten encephalopathy", which seems to be due to an aetiology different from that of the cholinergic dysfunction. Longitudinal studies correlating clinical, TMS, and neuroimaging data, both before and after GFD, are needed.
33315591	ACG Clinical Guideline: Management of Irritable Bowel Syndrome.	Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a highly prevalent, chronic disorder that significantly reduces patients' quality of life. Advances in diagnostic testing and in therapeutic options for patients with IBS led to the development of this first-ever American College of Gastroenterology clinical guideline for the management of IBS using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. Twenty-five clinically important questions were assessed after a comprehensive literature search; 9 questions focused on diagnostic testing; 16 questions focused on therapeutic options. Consensus was obtained using a modified Delphi approach, and based on GRADE methodology, we endorse the following: We suggest that a positive diagnostic strategy as compared to a diagnostic strategy of exclusion be used to improve time to initiating appropriate therapy. We suggest that serologic testing be performed to rule out celiac disease in patients with IBS and diarrhea symptoms. We suggest that fecal calprotectin be checked in patients with suspected IBS and diarrhea symptoms to rule out inflammatory bowel disease. We recommend a limited trial of a low fermentable oligosaccharides, disacchardies, monosaccharides, polyols (FODMAP) diet in patients with IBS to improve global symptoms. We recommend the use of chloride channel activators and guanylate cyclase activators to treat global IBS with constipation symptoms. We recommend the use of rifaximin to treat global IBS with diarrhea symptoms. We suggest that gut-directed psychotherapy be used to treat global IBS symptoms. Additional statements and information regarding diagnostic strategies, specific drugs, doses, and duration of therapy can be found in the guideline.

33259164	Diet-Dependent and Diet-Independent Hemorheological Alterations in Celiac Disease: A Case-Control Study.	INTRODUCTION: Hemorheology is the study of the flow properties of the blood and its elements, which, together with natural anticoagulants, are important determinants of cardiovascular events. This study aimed to assess hemorheological and natural anticoagulant profiles of patients with celiac disease (CeD) comprehensively. METHODS: Our study is a case-control study (registered under ISRCTN49677481) comparing patients with CeD with age- and sex-matched control subjects (1:1). We measured erythrocyte deformability (ED) at high (3-30 Pa) and low shears (0.3-3 Pa), erythrocyte aggregation, whole blood viscosity, plasma viscosity, and natural anticoagulants (protein C, protein S, and antithrombin activity). Adherence to gluten-free diet was estimated through dietary interview and urine gluten immunogenic peptide (urine GIP) detection. RESULTS: After matching, we analyzed the data of 100 study participants. ED at high shears was impaired in CeD (P < 0.05 for all shears, confirmed by random forest analysis) independently of findings on CeD-specific serological assessment and urine GIP detection but slightly dependently on dietary adherence (P = 0.025 for 30 Pa shear). ED at low shears seemed to be impaired only in urine GIP+ CeD patients (P < 0.05 for all comparisons with urine GIP- CeD patients and control subjects). All parameters describing erythrocyte aggregation and whole blood viscosity were shifted toward a prothrombotic direction in patients with CeD with poor dietary adherence compared with those with good dietary adherence. Plasma viscosity and activity of natural anticoagulants did not differ across groups. DISCUSSION: We observed diet-dependent and diet-independent prothrombotic hemorheological alterations in CeD, which can contribute to the elevated cardiovascular risk. The untoward metabolic changes during gluten-free diet, which can further aggravate hemorheological status, may indicate the implementation of prevention strategies.(Equation is included in full-text article.).
35973187	Anemia Etiology and the Response to a Gluten-Free Diet in Untreated Patients With Celiac Disease: A 2-Year Follow-Up.	INTRODUCTION: Anemia and micronutrient deficiencies are common in newly diagnosed patients with celiac disease (CeD). We aim to determine the prevalence and etiology of anemia in a cohort of patients with CeD in the United States and examine the effect of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on the laboratory parameters related to anemia in CeD. METHODS: We analyzed a prospectively collected cohort of adults with biopsy-proven CeD followed in a specialized CeD center between January 2000 and June 2016. We used the level of hemoglobin (Hb) and micronutrients suggested by the World Health Organization to establish the diagnosis of anemia or deficiencies. Demographic data and laboratory parameters related to anemia and micronutrients were recorded at the time of diagnosis and on a GFD. A celiac expert nutritionist or gastroenterologist evaluated all patients. RESULTS: In 572 patients with laboratory evaluation before starting a GFD, approximately 25% presented with anemia at the time of diagnosis of CeD. Iron deficiency was present in 50.8% of the cohort and in 78.8% of the patients with anemia. Within the anemic population, 84.4% of female patients as compared with 58.3% of male patients ( P = 0.02) showed iron deficiency. Folate deficiency (23.2%), vitamin B12 deficiency (11%), and anemia of chronic diseases (7.8%) were also part of both sexes' anemia etiology. Of the initially anemic patients, 81% and 89% normalized their Hb levels within 1 year and 2 years of beginning a GFD, respectively. All patients received appropriate supplementation when needed. DISCUSSION: Approximately 25% of individuals have anemia at CeD diagnosis. The anemia etiology included iron deficiency, vitamin deficiencies, and anemia of chronic diseases. Most of the patients will normalize their Hb levels and the anemia laboratory parameters 1 year after starting a strict GFD.
29439526	The Effect of Oligofructose-Enriched Inulin on Faecal Bacterial Counts and Microbiota-Associated Characteristics in Celiac Disease Children Following a Gluten-Free Diet: Results of a Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial.	Celiac disease (CD) is associated with intestinal microbiota alterations. The administration of prebiotics could be a promising method of restoring gut homeostasis in CD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of prolonged oligofructose-enriched inulin (Synergy 1) administration on the characteristics and metabolism of intestinal microbiota in CD children following a gluten-free diet (GFD). Thirty-four paediatric CD patients (mean age 10 years; 62% females) on a GFD were randomized into two experimental groups receiving Synergy 1 (10 g/day) or placebo (maltodextrin; 7 g/day) for 3 months. The quantitative gut microbiota characteristics and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) concentration were analysed. In addition, side effects were monitored. Generally, the administration of Synergy 1 in a GFD did not cause any side effects. After the intervention period, Bifidobacterium count increased significantly (p < 0.05) in the Synergy 1 group. Moreover, an increase in faecal acetate and butyrate levels was observed in the prebiotic group. Consequently, total SCFA levels were 31% higher than at the baseline. The presented trial shows that Synergy 1 applied as a supplement of a GFD had a moderate effect on the qualitative characteristics of faecal microbiota, whereas it stimulated the bacterial metabolite production in CD children.
29181545	Non-celiac gluten sensitivity: people without celiac disease avoiding gluten-is it due to histamine intolerance?	INTRODUCTION: Food intolerance/malabsorption is caused by food ingredients, carbohydrates (mainly lactose and fructose), proteins (gluten), and biogenic amines (histamine) which cause nonspecific gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms. Here we focus on possible etiologic factors of intolerance/malabsorption especially in people with non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) or the so-called people without celiac disease avoiding gluten (PWCDAG) and histamine intolerance. METHODS: Recognizing the recently described symptoms of NCGS (PWCDAG) we review correlations and parallels to histamine intolerance (HIT). RESULTS: We show that intestinal and extra-intestinal NCGS (PWCDAG) symptoms are very similar to those which can be found in histamine intolerance. CONCLUSIONS: After a detailed diagnostic workup for all possible etiologic factors in every patient, a targeted dietary intervention for single or possibly combined intolerance/malabsorption might be more effective than a short-term diet low in fermentable oligo-, di- and monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) or the untargeted uncritical use of gluten-free diets.
32433771	Remission of Pituitary Autoimmunity Induced by Gluten-Free Diet in Patients With Celiac Disease.	CONTEXT: An improvement of some autoimmune diseases associated with celiac disease (CD) has been observed after a gluten-free diet (GFD). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this longitudinal study was to evaluate the effect of a GFD on autoimmune pituitary impairment in patients with CD and potential/subclinical lymphocytic hypophysitis (LYH). DESIGN: Five-year longitudinal observational study. SETTING: Tertiary referral center for immunoendocrinology at the University of Campania "Luigi Vanvitelli". PATIENTS: Ninety-three newly diagnosed LYH patients (high titer of antipituitary antibodies [APA] and normal or subclinically impaired pituitary function) were enrolled from 2000 to 2013 and grouped as follows: group 1, consisting of 43 patients with LYH + CD, and group 2, consisting of 50 patients with isolated LYH only. INTERVENTION: A GFD was started in patients in group 1 after the diagnosis of CD. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: APA titers and pituitary function were evaluated at the beginning of the study and then yearly for 5 years in both groups. Patients progressing to a clinically overt LYH were excluded from the follow-up. RESULTS: Complete remission of LYH (disappearance of APA and recovery of pituitary function in patients with previous subclinical hypopituitarism) occurred in 15 patients in group 1 after a GFD (34%) and spontaneously in only 1 patient in group 2 (2%) (P < .001). Two patients in group 1 and 25 in group 2 progressed to a clinically overt hypopituitarism and dropped out from the study to receive an appropriate replacement therapy. The presence of CD was the only independent predictor of pituitary function recovery (hazard ratio [HR] 0.059, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01-0.54, P = .012). CONCLUSION: In patients with LYH and CD, a GFD may be able to induce remission of subclinical LYH, or prevent the progression to clinical stage of this disease.
38674888	Risk of Gluten Cross-Contamination Due to Food Handling Practices: A Mini-Review.	Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease triggered by the ingestion of gluten in genetically predisposed individuals, affecting 1.4% of the world population. CD induces an inflammatory reaction that compromises small intestine villi, leading to nutrient malabsorption, and gastro and extraintestinal manifestations. Although other treatment approaches are being studied, adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only effective intervention to date. Despite this, about 50% of patients experience persistent inflammation, often associated with unintentional gluten ingestion through contaminated food. There are regulations for labeling gluten-free foods which specify a limit of 20 mg/kg (20 ppm). The risks of gluten cross-contamination above that level are present throughout the whole food production chain, emphasizing the need for caution. This review explores studies that tested different procedures regarding the shared production of gluten-containing and gluten-free food, including the use of shared equipment and utensils. A literature review covering PubMed, Scielo, Web of Science, VHL and Scopus identified five relevant studies. The results indicate that shared environments and equipment may not significantly increase gluten cross-contamination if appropriate protocols are followed. Simultaneous cooking of gluten-containing and gluten-free pizzas in shared ovens has demonstrated a low risk of contamination. In general, shared kitchen utensils and equipment (spoon, ladle, colander, knife, fryer, toaster) in controlled experiments did not lead to significant contamination of samples. On the other hand, cooking gluten-free and gluten-containing pasta in shared water resulted in gluten levels above the established limit of 20 ppm. However, rinsing the pasta under running water for a few seconds was enough to reduce the gluten content of the samples to less than 20 ppm.
31143330	Non alcoholic fatty liver disease in a young male with celiac disease.	A young emaciated male, known case of celiac disease came with complaints of diarrhea along with 5kgs of weight loss in 3 months' time. He had severe electrolyte abnormalities along with low albumin, low calcium and a high phosphate with deranged liver function test. Ultrasound abdomen had shown fatty liver. Nutrition consult was sought and he was found to have a BMI of 6.8kg/m2. He was started on nutrition support along with supportive therapy, which resulted in weight gain and improvement in his condition.
37779330	Establishment of New Immunostatistical Equations for Diagnosis and Follow-Up of Gluten-Free Diet in Patients with Celiac Disease.	<b>Background and Objective:</b> Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune condition characterized by immune responses to gluten. The reported prevalence of CD has increased globally due to improved screening and diagnostic techniques, however, there is significant global variation in methods of diagnosis and follow-up. A new immunostatistical equation that determines the values of two types of antibodies using the total IgA test. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> Only 70 blood samples were taken from people who had celiac disease or were suspected of having it, with ages ranging from 5 to 40 years and they were separated into two groups. The first group contained 40 people of both sexes who had previously been diagnosed with celiac disease, while the second group included 30 individuals of both sexes, with ages ranging from 5 to 35 years, who were suspected of having celiac disease due to the appearance of some clinical symptoms. The control group also included 30 blood samples from healthy individuals of both sexes, with ages ranging from 5 to 40 years. Total IgA antibody tTG/IgA and DGP/IgA levels were estimated for all study samples. <b>Results:</b> By using a regression coefficient test the results showed the percentage of the effect of total IgA on tTG/IgA, DGP/IgA amounted to 11 and 25%, respectively, as shown by the value of the coefficient of clarifications (R<sup>2</sup>) in patients with CD. On the other hand, The percentage of the effect of total IgA on tTG/IgA and DGP/IgA amounted to 11, 14%, respectively, as shown by the value of the coefficient of clarifications (R<sup>2</sup>) in patients with suspected CD in p<u><</u>0.05. The results of the study were revealed and through the regression coefficient, four new immunostatistical equations were mathematically derived that give the value of tTG/IgA and DGP/IgA based solely on the total IgA test in the laboratory. <b>Conclusion:</b> By adopting one laboratory test which determines total IgA, the study concluded four new immunostatistical equations that will help academic researchers and attending physicians to diagnose celiac disease in addition to following up on patient's adherence to a gluten-free diet.
37432272	Comparison of Clinical, Biochemical and Histological Features between Adult Celiac Patients with High and Low Anti-Transglutaminase IgA Titer at Diagnosis and Follow-Up.	In adults, celiac disease (CD) diagnosis is based on specific serology (anti-transglutaminase IgA-anti-tTG) and duodenal histology. Evidence is raising the possibility of perform CD diagnosis based only on high anti-tTG titer in children. We aimed to evaluate clinical, histological and biochemical differences between adult patients with high tTG IgA titer (HT) and those with low titer (LT) at CD diagnosis and follow-up. This retrospective study included consecutive adult CD patients divided into two groups: HT (anti-tTG > 10 x ULN) and LT (anti-tTG < 10 x ULN). Clinical, biochemical and histological features were compared between groups at CD diagnosis and at follow-up. A total of 291 patients were included (HT: 47.1%; LT: 52.9%). At CD diagnosis, HT patients showed a non 'classical' presentation (p = 0.04), Marsh 3C (p = 0.005), hypoferritinaemia (p = 0.006) and osteopenia/osteoporosis (p = 0.04) more frequently than LT patients. A total of 216 patients (HT: 48.6%; LT: 51.4%) performed a follow-up after a median Gluten-free diet of 14 months; HT patients had persistent antibodies positivity (p = 0.001) more frequently and GI symptoms (p = 0.04) less frequently than LT patients. In conclusion, HT patients presented severe histological damage more frequently at diagnosis, recovering similarly to LT patients after the start of the Gluten-free diet. At follow-up, anti-tTG persisted positive in HT more frequently compared to LT patients, without differences regarding histological recovery and clinical improvement.

36142642	Gut Dysbiosis and Fecal Microbiota Transplantation in Autoimmune Diseases.	Gut microbiota dysbiosis has recently been reported in a number of clinical states, including neurological, psychiatric, cardiovascular, metabolic and autoimmune disorders. Yet, it is not completely understood how colonizing microorganisms are implicated in their pathophysiology and molecular pathways. There are a number of suggested mechanisms of how gut microbiota dysbiosis triggers or sustains extraintestinal diseases; however, none of these have been widely accepted as part of the disease pathogenesis. Recent studies have proposed that gut microbiota and its metabolites could play a pivotal role in the modulation of immune system responses and the development of autoimmunity in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis or type 1 diabetes. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a valuable tool for uncovering the role of gut microbiota in the pathological processes. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge about gut microbiota dysbiosis and the potential of FMT in studying the pathogeneses and therapies of autoimmune diseases. Herein, we discuss the extraintestinal autoimmune pathologies with at least one published or ongoing FMT study in human or animal models.
29893137	Dietary Intake and Micronutrient Supplementation in Youth with Celiac Disease with and without Type 1 Diabetes.	The study purpose was to describe dietary intake and the factors influencing micronutrient supplements (MS) use in Celiac Disease (CD) +- Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). Three-day food records collected from parents of youth (3-18 years) with CD (n = 14) +- T1D (n = 10) were assessed for macro and micronutrient intake, diet quality (DQ), glycemic index (GI), glycemic load (GL), and food group intake. Focus group methodology and thematic concept analysis were conducted to determine factors influencing adolescent MS use. Mean +- SD age was 11 +- 4.4 (CD) and 13 +- 3.7 (CD + T1D) (P = 0.32). Body mass index was within healthy reference ranges (17.9 +- 2.5 [CD]; 19.3 +- 3.8 [CD + T1D] kg/m2; P = 0.61). The majority of youth with CD +- T1D (>90%) had high intakes of sugar and saturated fat, had high GI and GL, and met food serving recommendations and DQs that were indicative of "needs improvement." With the exception of vitamin D, vitamin E, folate, calcium, and potassium, youth in both groups met the estimated average requirements (EAR) for most micronutrients. MS use corrected suboptimal vitamin D intake; however, vitamin E, folate, calcium, and potassium intake remained below the EAR. Variables influencing adolescent MS use included daily routine, health professional influence, disease management (CD + T1D), and lack of knowledge about the need for MS. Strategies to elicit adolescent MS use varied between parent and adolescents.
37053375	Factors Associated With Adherence to a Gluten-Free Diet in Celiac Patients Diagnosed in Childhood as Compared to Adulthood.	Past studies have reported differences between pediatric and adult celiac disease patients. We aimed to compare factors associated with adherence to a gluten-free diet between these groups. An anonymous online questionnaire was sent via the Israeli Celiac Association and social networks to celiac patients. The Biagi questionnaire was used to assess dietary adherence. A total of 445 subjects participated. Mean age was 25.7 +- 17.5 years and 71.9% were female. Subjects were divided into six groups according to age at diagnosis: younger than 6 years (134 patients, 30.7%), 6-12 (79 patients, 18.1%), 12-18 (41 patients, 9.4%), 18-30 (81 patients, 18.5%), 30-45 (79 patients, 18.1%), and 45 years and above (23 patients, 5.3%). There were several significant differences between childhood- and adulthood-diagnosed patients. Pediatric patients were less likely to be noncompliant with a gluten-free diet (3.7% vs. 9.4%, p < .001). They were also more frequently followed by a gastroenterologist ( p < .001), a dietitian ( p < .001), and participated in a celiac support group ( p = .002). In logistic regression analyses, longer duration of disease was associated with poor compliance. In conclusion, pediatric-diagnosed celiac patients are more adherent to a gluten-free diet than those diagnosed in adulthood, with better social support and nutritional follow-up possibly contributing.
36040008	[Nutritional problems in celiac patients. Difficulties in achieving an adequate nutritional status].	Introduction: Celiac disease is the most common chronic intestinal disease. It affects approximately 1 % of the world population, affects all age groups and has symptoms both digestive and extra-digestive. The treatment of celiac disease is based on the strict withdrawal of gluten from the diet. This treatment supposes the improvement of symptoms and histology and the reduction of long-term comorbidities. People with celiac disease often follow diets that are far from the theoretical ideal, so they must be supervised and guided to achieve gluten-free diets that are also varied and balanced. In these patients it is important to avoid gluten consumption, but also to achieve an adequate supply of nutrients. However, their health problems, together with the limitations they must introduce in the diet make it more difficult to achieve a correct diet, so the group deserves special nutritional monitoring and surveillance.
29030981	Mesalazine treatment in organotypic culture of celiac patients: Comparative study with gluten free diet.	Given the central role of gluten in the pathogenesis of celiac disease (CD), a strict gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only validated treatment able to restore epithelium integrity and eliminate risks of complications. The risk of gluten contamination and the persistence of inflammation, even in patients strictly adhering to GFD, may render this treatment not always effective claiming the necessity of different new solutions. Oxidative and nitrosative stress have been indicated to play a pathophysiological role in CD. Mesalazine (5-ASA), a drug largely used in inflammatory bowel disease, has potent antinflammatory and antioxidant effects. In fact, mesalazine has been shown to decrease in vitro gluten induced cytokine response and it has been used in vivo in some refractory condition. However, its effect has never compared to that of GFD. The present study aimed to address this issue by comparing the ability of mesalazine and GFD in treating gluten-induced inflammation and oxidative stress. These effects were studied on duodenal mucosa biopsy cultures from newly diagnosed CD patients, treated or not in vitro with mesalazine, and CD biopsy cultures from patients on gluten-free diet for at least one year; and a cohort of controls constituted by healty subjects. On these models, the antioxidant cellular defences, the PPARgamma, NF-kB and NOS2 proteins levels were studied. This study shows that mesalazine is as effective as GFD in reducing oxidative burst and inducing PPARgamma expression; moreover it resulted more effective than GFD in decreasing NF-kB and NOS2 to the levels of controls.
36459294	Role of Serology, Dietary Assessment, and Fecal Gluten Immunogenic Peptides for Predicting Histologic Recovery in Children with Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND: A strict lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD) remains the only treatment of celiac disease (CD). Adherence to gluten-free diet is best reflected by mucosal healing. Noninvasive tools capable of predicting mucosal recovery in CD patients need to be identified. AIMS: To compare the ability of various modalities used to assess compliance to GFD, for predicting persistent mucosal damage in children with CD. METHODS: A prospective, single-center, observational study on children with CD on a GFD was conducted between January 2020 and April 2021. Children with CD on GFD were consecutively enrolled and various modalities used to assess adherence to GFD were compared. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty children (Mean age 12.2 +- 3.6 years, 58% Boys) on GFD (Mean duration 6 +- 3.1 years) were enrolled in the study. Persistent mucosal damage was seen in 88% of the enrolled. Fecal gluten immunogenic peptide (GIP) was positive in 87.8% (129/147). Antibodies to tissue transglutaminase (TGA-IgA) and/or deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP) were positive in 32% (48/150) whereas antibody to synthetic neoepitopes of TGA-IgA was positive in 24.8% (37/149). Non-compliance as assessed by local questionnaire, Biagi score, and dietitian detailed interview were 62.7%, 60%, and 75.3%, respectively. Serology had the highest specificity (83%) and fecal GIP had the highest sensitivity (89%). On logistic regression analysis, only non-compliance by Biagi score predicted poor mucosal recovery. CONCLUSION: Fecal GIP may be sensitive to detect only "one-point dietary transgression." None of the existing modalities used to assess compliance to GFD accurately predict persistent mucosal damage. A subset of patients may develop gluten tolerance.
36839352	IgE-Dependent Allergy in Patients with Celiac Disease: A Systematic Review.	In order to answer the question if an IgE-mediated allergy (A-IgE) may occur in subjects with celiac disease (CD), a systematic review was performed of available publications collected in the United States National Institute for Biotechnology Information/National Institutes of Health/National Library of Medicine/PubMed database up to 28 December 2022, with the use of the following keywords "allergy&celiac/coeliac", "sensitization&celiac/coeliac", and "anaphylaxis&celiac/coeliac" compared in the form of a conjunction. In total, the search returned 2013 publications from these keywords in any section of the article. As numerous review articles included the above-mentioned entries in the abstract, we decided to focus on the publications with the entries only in the title (n = 63). After rejecting studies unrelated to the topic, narrative reviews, book chapters, conference abstracts, symposium reports, letters to the editor, or non-English articles, 18 publications (6 observational original studies and 12 case reports describing a total of 15 cases of A-IgE developed after a diagnosis of CD) were included to this review. Our study is the first systematic review on allergy occurrence in CD patients. The analysis indicated that the possibility of a coexistence of A-IgE with any food and inhalant allergens in subjects diagnosed with CD should be considered. A sensitization to wheat was the most frequently described in subjects with CD. The clinical manifestation of A-IgE in CD was similar to that in subjects without CD; e.g., with possible atopic dermatitis, vomiting, urticaria, angioedema, or anaphylactic shock. Screening for allergies in subjects with CD should be considered, especially in those cases where symptoms persist after introducing a gluten-free diet. The elimination of wheat from the diet of patients with CD may lead to a loss of immune tolerance and to the development of sensitization, which may even manifest as anaphylaxis. In conclusion, although there are few studies assessing the occurrence of A-IgE in subjects with CD, they show the possibility of a coexistence of both diseases and the high clinical significance of this phenomenon, which indicates the need for further studies.
29915404	The Global Phenomenon of Self-Reported Wheat Sensitivity.	Celiac disease affects about 1% of the population and is treated with a gluten-free diet. However, the last decade has seen a huge rise in individuals self-reporting wheat sensitivity, and consuming a gluten-free diet, despite not having a doctor-diagnosis of celiac disease. A recent flurry of observational studies from across the globe suggests that approximately 10% of the population is self-reporting wheat sensitivity. They describe a constellation of intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms attributed to ingestion of gluten-based products. This phenomenon poses a significant challenge to clinicians with regards to adequately excluding celiac disease, identifying the culprit agent, understanding the pathophysiology, and providing safe aftercare.
36412507	Assessment of Knowledge of Gluten-Free Diet Amongst Food Handlers in Hospitals.	Purpose: When admitted to the hospital, individuals with celiac disease rely on food handlers for provision of safe, uncontaminated gluten-free meals. We aimed to assess the knowledge of gluten-free diet (GFD) amongst individuals involved in meal preparation for patients.Methods: A questionnaire with 10 demographic and 35 test items to assess knowledge of GFD, including workplace scenarios encountered in meal preparation, was administered to food handlers including cooks, utility workers, dietary technicians, and supervisors in 2 tertiary care, university-affiliated hospitals. A score of >=28 of 35 (>=80%) was considered a "pass".Results: A total of 72 individuals completed the study, mean age 40.3 +- 1.6 years, 75% female. Only 42 (56.8%) scored >=80% and achieved a pass. The average score was 75.9% +- 13.4%, range 25.7%-100%. The supervisors had significantly higher scores (87.9% +- 11.4%) than utility workers (73.0% +- 11.4%; P = 0.01) and cooks (71.7% +- 14.5%; P = 0.01). Cooks had the lowest scores with 80% scoring <80%. Females scored higher than males (77.8% vs. 68.8%; P = 0.02).Conclusions: There are significant differences in GFD knowledge amongst various groups involved in food preparation in hospitals. The gaps identified in knowledge can potentially compromise the safety of patients with celiac disease. Targeted interventions to educate hospital food handlers about GFD are warranted. Registered Dietitians can play an important role in providing this education.
29505551	Dietary Factors and Mucosal Immune Response in Celiac Disease Patients Having Persistent Symptoms Despite a Gluten-free Diet.	GOALS: The aim of this study was to investigate the role of dietary factors, distinct small-bowel mucosal immune cell types, and epithelial integrity in the perpetuation of gastrointestinal symptoms in treated celiac disease patients. BACKGROUND: For unexplained reasons, many celiac disease patients suffer from persistent symptoms, despite a strict gluten-free diet (GFD) and recovered intestinal mucosa. STUDY: We compared clinical and serological data and mucosal recovery in 22 asymptomatic and 25 symptomatic celiac patients on a long-term GFD. The density of CD3 and gammadelta intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), CD25 and FOXP3 regulatory T cells, and CD117 mast cells, and the expression of tight junction proteins claudin-3 and occludin, heat shock protein 60, interleukin 15, and Toll-like receptor 2 and 4 were evaluated in duodenal biopsies. RESULTS: All subjects kept a strict GFD and had negative celiac autoantibodies and recovered mucosal morphology. The asymptomatic patients had higher mean fiber intake (20.2 vs. 15.2 g/d, P=0.028) and density of CD3 IELs (59.3 vs. 45.0 cell/mm, P=0.045) than those with persistent symptoms. There was a similar but nonsignificant trend in gammadelta IELs (17.9 vs. 13.5, P=0.149). There were no differences between the groups in other parameters measured. CONCLUSIONS: Low fiber intake may predispose patients to persistent symptoms in celiac disease. There were no differences between the groups in the markers of innate immunity, epithelial stress or epithelial integrity. A higher number of IELs in asymptomatic subjects may indicate that the association between symptoms and mucosal inflammation is more complicated than previously thought.
33651455	Occupational IgE-mediated psyllium allergy in contemporary gluten-free and vegan baking: A case of allergic rhinitis.	Psyllium (from Plantago ovata; ispaghula) is used as a dietary supplement and is supplied in the form of husk, granules, capsules, or powder. Consumers using psyllium-containing laxatives, healthcare workers handling these, and pharmaceutical workers in laxative-manufacturing plants are known to be at risk of sensitization and subsequent rhinitis, asthma, contact urticaria, and even anaphylaxis. To our knowledge, the case we present here is the first of baker's immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated occupational allergy due to psyllium exposure. Our patient, a 24-year-old female baker with no previous allergies, was referred to our clinic with suspected occupational rhinitis. After 1 year of baking with cereal flour or gluten-free flour-mix, she began to suffer from rhino-conjunctival symptoms during workdays. Skin prick tests with agents from the patient's workplace revealed allergies not only to wheat and rye flours but also to psyllium, with a remarkable 10 mm wheal. Subsequently, nasal provocation tests confirmed occupational allergic rhinitis to psyllium. We also found work-related sensitization to buckwheat, which she used in gluten-free baking. Due to the increased prevalence of celiac disease and the popularity of gluten-free and vegan food, psyllium has recently become a common ingredient in baking, used as a substitute for gluten or eggs. Bakers handle allergens such as these in high concentrations and this may lie behind the emergence of respiratory and dermal symptoms. It is essential to consider new or recenlty introduced materials as possible allergens if it is suspected that a baker has work-related respiratory or allergic symptoms.
33198212	Adherence to the Gluten-Free Diet during the Lockdown for COVID-19 Pandemic: A Web-Based Survey of Italian Subjects with Celiac Disease.	We aimed to assess the perceived impact of the lockdown, imposed to control the spreading of COVID-19, on the adherence of Italian celiac disease (CD) subjects to the gluten-free diet by a web-based survey. A total of 1983 responses were analyzed, 1614 (81.4%) by CD adults and 369 (18.6%) by parents/caregivers of CD children/adolescents. The compliance with the GFD was unchanged for 69% of the adults and 70% of the children, and improved for 29% of both. The factors increasing the probability to report stricter compliance were the presence of CD symptoms in the last year before the lockdown (odds ratio (OR) 1.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.46-2.26), a partial usual adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD) (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.2-3.06), and having tried recipes with naturally gluten-free ingredients more than usual (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.28-1.96) for adults; the presence of CD symptoms in the last year (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.21-3.47), still positive CD antibodies (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.14-3.13), and other family members with CD (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.3-3.85) for children/adolescents. Therefore, the lockdown led to a reported improved adherence to the GFD in one-third of the respondents, in particular in those with previous worse disease control, offering the opportunity to avoid sources of contamination/transgression and increase the use of naturally gluten-free products.

35934174	The impact of gluten-free diet on growth, metabolic control and quality of life in youth with type 1 diabetes and celiac disease: A systematic review.	AIMS: To evaluate the impact of gluten free diet (GFD) on growth, metabolic control and quality of life in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and celiac disease (CD). METHODS: A systematic search was performed including studies published in the last 15 years. PICOS framework was used in the selection process and evidence was assessed using the GRADE system. RESULTS: Overall, studies comparing youth with T1D + CD on GFD to those with T1D only, showed no significant differences in growth parameters, HbA1c, number of episodes of hypoglycemia, total daily insulin doses. Studies assessing the effect of GFD introduction showed stable BMI and HbA1c. Only two studies assessed QoL of life, which was not different between T1D + CD vs T1D only youth, as well as pre- and post-CD diagnosis and introduction of GFD. CONCLUSION: This systematic review, including only studies of moderate-high evidence quality level and reporting data on objectively assessed adherence to GFD, highlights that adherence to GFD in youth with T1D + CD leads to regular growth, stable BMI, without any negative effect on HbA1c and insulin requirements. Although assessed in few studies, lipid profile and QoL improved with the introduction of GFD.
36033766	Current knowledge and "myths" about celiac disease among physicians in the Republic of Kazakhstan: A countrywide cross-sectional study.	Background: Celiac disease (CD) is a common genetically predisposed autoimmune condition affecting the gut and other organs. Disease awareness is one of the key components of early case identification. This study aimed to assess awareness about CD among primary care physicians, who are the front-liners in suspecting the diagnosis, and other medical specialists. Methods and findings: The questionnaire for this survey-based study was created based on the latest international guidelines on CD and included a consent form, 5 general questions (age, gender, etc.), and 10 specific questions concerning CD. Overall, 232 respondents from 13 country provinces (out of 14) and two republican cities were recruited for this study. Of them, 110 (47.4%) were primary care physicians and 122 (52.6%) other medical specialists, including 10 (4.3%) gastroenterologists. A scoring system was used to classify the level of awareness of participants into 3 categories, namely, poor, fair, and good. Analysis of responses revealed poor awareness in 59.4% of physicians, associated with work in republican/province/district/rural/village hospitals (p = 0.004), male gender (p = 0.006), and age of 40-50 years (p = 0.02). The most common "myths" about CD were the following: "symptoms are always obvious in children" or "in adults" (92.5 or 88.4% of respondents, respectively); "genetic mutation HLA DQ2/DQ8 causes the development of CD in all carriers of the mutation" (51.3%); "CD is a disease of children only" (12.5%); and "is triggered by dairy products" (8.6%). Genotyping of HLA DQ genes has been recommended in case of CD suspicion by every third respondent and was advocated as a "golden standard" confirmatory test by every fifth respondent. A quarter of respondents revealed their incorrect treatment strategies: gluten-free diet for 1 month, dairy-free diet, Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy, or responded that did not know how to treat. Overall, 93.5% of respondents expressed intention to learn more about CD, while the rest 6.5% thought that they knew enough, although their knowledge was poor. Conclusion: This study revealed a poor level of awareness among physicians in Kazakhstan and identified common misconceptions about CD, which potentially could lead to incorrect application of diagnostic tests, delay in diagnosis, and inefficient treatment. Development and implementation of educational programs as well as promotion of self-learning would increase awareness and unravel misconceptions.
32054274	Atrophic enteropathy refractory to a gluten-free diet: what should we consider?	Olmesartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist used for the treatment of blood hypertension. Long-term use has been associated with diarrhea and sometimes intestinal involvement may mimic enteropathies such as celiac disease. Clinicians should consider drugs within the differential diagnosis of enteropathies. We report the case of a female who sought medical help for malabsorptive symptoms and was finally diagnosed with olmesartan-associated gastritis and atrophic enteropathy.

32843265	Development and effectiveness assessment of a Persian-language smartphone application for celiac patients: A randomized controlled clinical trial.	OBJECTIVES: We aimed to design a Persian-language application for celiac patients and assess its effectiveness on patients` knowledge and adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: In the present randomized controlled clinical trial, 60 patients were randomly assigned to receive education through a smartphone application (n = 30) or conventional clinical education (n = 30). The primary outcomes were assessing knowledge about celiac disease and GFD, and adherence to GFD that were assessed at baseline and three months after interventions. The knowledge and adherence were assessed by a valid author-designed knowledge questionnaire and the validated celiac disease adherence test (CDAT) respectively. RESULTS: The mean disease duration was 4.38 +- 3.27 years. The mean post-intervention score of knowledge about gluten-free foods was significantly higher in the intervention group compared with the placebo group after adjusting for baseline values and characteristics (p-value = 0.03). There was a significant difference in post-intervention CDAT values between the two groups (p-value = 0.01). CONCLUSION: The smartphone application had a significant effect on celiac patients` knowledge about gluten-free foods and adherence to GFD. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The smartphone applications can be designed according to each country's particular circumstances and can be suggested by nutritionists and physicians to use by celiac patients.
34716736	Association of the use of diabetes technology with HbA1c and BMI-SDS in an international cohort of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes: The SWEET project experience.	OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between the use of diabetes technology (insulin pump [CSII], glucose sensor [CGM] or both) and metabolic control (HbA1c) as well as body adiposity (BMI-SDS) over-time in a cohort of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D), that have never used these technologies before. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Four thousand six hundred forty three T1D patients (2-18 years, T1D >=1 year, without celiac disease, no CSII and/or CGM before 2016) participating in the SWEET prospective multicenter diabetes registry, were enrolled. Data were collected at two points (2016; 2019). Metabolic control was assessed by glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and body adiposity by BMI-SDS (WHO). Patients were categorized by treatment modality (multiple daily injections [MDI] or CSII) and the use or not of CGM. Linear regression models, adjusted for age, gender, duration of diabetes and region, were applied to assess differences in HbA1c and BMI-SDS among patient groups. RESULTS: The proportion of patients using MDI with CGM and CSII with CGM significantly increased from 2016 to 2019 (7.2%-25.7%, 7.8%-27.8% respectively; p < 0.001). Linear regression models showed a significantly lower HbA1c in groups that switched from MDI to CSII with or without CGM (p < 0.001), but a higher BMI-SDS (from MDI without CGM to CSII with CGM p < 0.05; from MDI without CGM to CSII without CGM p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Switching from MDI to CSII is significantly associated with improvement in glycemic control but increased BMI-SDS over-time. Diabetes technology may improve glucose control in youths with T1D although further strategies to prevent excess fat accumulation are needed.
30885888	Neurologic Deficits in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Celiac Disease Are Frequent and Linked With Autoimmunity to Transglutaminase 6.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder induced by ingestion of gluten that affects 1% of the population and is characterized by gastrointestinal symptoms, weight loss, and anemia. We evaluated the presence of neurologic deficits and investigated whether the presence of antibodies to Transglutaminase 6 (TG6) increases the risk of neurologic defects in patients with a new diagnosis of celiac disease. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study at a secondary-care gastroenterology center of 100 consecutive patients who received a new diagnosis of celiac disease based on gastroscopy and duodenal biopsy. We collected data on neurologic history, and patients were evaluated in a clinical examination along with magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy of the cerebellum, and measurements of antibodies against TG6 in serum samples. The first 52 patients recruited underwent repeat MR spectroscopy at 1 year after a gluten-free diet (GFD). The primary aim was to establish if detection of antibodies against TG6 can be used to identify patients with celiac disease and neurologic dysfunction. RESULTS: Gait instability was reported in 24% of the patients, persisting sensory symptoms in 12%, and frequent headaches in 42%. Gait ataxia was found in 29% of patients, nystagmus in 11%, and distal sensory loss in 10%. Sixty percent of patients had abnormal results from magnetic resonance imaging, 47% had abnormal results from MR spectroscopy of the cerebellum, and 25% had brain white matter lesions beyond that expected for their age group. Antibodies against TG6 were detected in serum samples from 40% of patients-these patients had significant atrophy of subcortical brain regions compared with patients without TG6 autoantibodies. In patients with abnormal results from MR spectroscopy of the cerebellum, those on the GFD had improvements detected in the repeat MR spectroscopy 1 year later. CONCLUSIONS: In a prospective cohort study of patients with a new diagnosis of celiac disease at a gastroenterology clinic, neurologic deficits were common and 40% had circulating antibodies against TG6. We observed a significant reduction in volume of specific brain regions in patients with TG6 autoantibodies, providing evidence for a link between autoimmunity to TG6 and brain atrophy in patients with celiac disease. There is a need for early diagnosis, increased awareness of the neurologic manifestations among clinicians, and reinforcement of adherence to a strict GFD by patients to avoid permanent neurologic disability.
30561390	Thyroid and celiac disease in pediatric age: a literature review.	Chronic autoimmune thyroid disease or Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) and Graves-Basedow disease (GD) are the main autoimmune thyroid diseases in pediatric age. Both are characterized by the production of anti-thyroid antibodies, by an infiltration of autoreactive B and T lymphocytes into the thyroid parenchyma and by alterations in thyroid function (hyperthyroidism in GD, normal function or subclinical hypothyroidism in HT with possible evolution towards manifest hypothyroidism). Celiac disease (CD) is a systemic autoimmune disease caused by gluten ingestion in genetically predisposed subjects, its prevalence is around 1% in Western Countries. It presents with a pathognomonic enteropathy, a variety of clinical manifestations, positivity for specific antibodies, positivity for typical haplotypes HLA DQ2/DQ8. The clinical manifestations may vary among four types: typical, atypical, silent and latent. Diagnosis can be made in presence of specific histopathologic findings in duodenal biopsies and antibodies positivity. Celiac disease is associated to various endocrine autoimmunities such as thyropathies, diabetes mellitus type 1, Addison disease, multiendocrine syndromes. The most frequent associated thyropaties are HT and GD. The present review aims to explore the associations between thyropathies and celiac disease in pediatric age.
30453479	Descriptive Study of the Different Tools Used to Evaluate the Adherence to a Gluten-Free Diet in Celiac Disease Patients.	Celiac disease (CD) is a genetically conditioned autoimmune process that appears in susceptible people. It can affect people of any age, and slightly predominates in females. It has a fairly homogenous global distribution, with an average prevalence of 1-2%, the frequency having increased in recent decades. The only effective treatment is a strict and permanent gluten-free diet (GFD), although the level of compliance is poor, at about 50% of cases. To monitor the effectiveness of the GFD, several procedures involving various approaches are employed: (a) Periodic visits by expert Nutritionists; (b) Clinical follow-up; (c) Serological time controls of specific antibodies; (d) Serial endoscopies with collection of duodenal biopsies; (e) Use of structured questionnaires; and (f) Determination of gluten peptides derived from gluten in faeces and/or urine. All of these procedures are useful when applied, alone or in combination, depending on the cases. Some patients will only need to consult to their doctors, while others will require a multidisciplinary approach to assess their compliance with the GFD. In children, normalization of duodenal mucosa was achieved in 95% of cases within two years, while it is more delayed in adults, whose mucosa take longer time (3-5 years) to heal completely.
36631740	Short and long-term follow-up and clinical outcomes in patients with celiac disease in a large private practice setting.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is caused by an immune response to gluten and treatment is adherence to a gluten-free diet. Guidelines from studies in large academic settings recommend registered dietitian (RD) referrals at time of diagnosis and periodic testing for micronutrient deficiencies. There is limited data to guide follow-up parameters in a large, community-based practice. The purpose of this study was to evaluate guideline adherence in this setting. METHODS: This retrospective study conducted in 2019 assessed CD care based on follow-up rates, micronutrient testing, symptoms, and serology results in cohorts with and without RD referrals. Patients in this study were followed at Rockford Gastroenterology Associates (RGA): a large, private GI practice. Patients were included if they had a diagnosis of CD from 1/2014 through 12/2018, based on positive serology and/or duodenal biopsy. Patient data was collected by chart review and analyzed through Microsoft Excel. Fisher's exact and Chi-square tests were used for the statistical analysis and were calculated through the Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) software. RESULTS: 320 patients were initially reviewed and a cohort of 126 patients met inclusion criteria. 69.8% had a RD referral. 65.9% had at least one lab test order for any of the 6 micronutrients. Of 63 patients tested for iron, 11 were iron deficient (8 with RD referral). Of 64 patients tested for vitamin D, 21 were deficient (17 with referral). 80.2% attended at least one follow-up appointment, but 34.9% had only one follow-up visit over a mean follow up duration of 5.82 months. 79 patients had follow-up data for symptoms or serology and were separated into 4 categories (with vs. without RD referral): (1) asymptomatic and negative serology (32% vs. 26%), (2) symptomatic and negative serology (28% vs. 16%), (3) asymptomatic and positive serology (27% vs. 32%), (4) symptomatic and positive serology (13% vs. 26%). Category 1 yielded a fisher exact test value of 2.62 (p = 0.466). CONCLUSIONS: RD referral, micronutrient testing, and close follow-up are important parameters that affect outcomes in patients with CD. Rates for dietitian referral, some micronutrient testing and follow-up visits were higher than 50%, though results from this study were not statistically significant. Further standardization of follow-up testing and monitoring for CD will help minimize discrepancies between community-based and large, academic GI practices.
33361039	Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth among patients with celiac disease unresponsive to a gluten free diet.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Little is known about the relationship between small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and celiac disease (CeD) in patients who are unresponsive to a gluten-free diet (GFD). This study aimed to determine the SIBO prevalence in patients with CeD who are unresponsive to a GFD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a case-control study from July 2012 to September 2014. We included 32 patients with CeD who were unresponsive to a GFD and 52 healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were obtained from patients' medical records. Antitissue transglutaminase antibody determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was recorded, and lactulose hydrogen breath test (LHBT) was used to detect SIBO in all participants. Microbiological analysis, including jejunal aspirates obtained using upper endoscopy, was performed for only 20 patients with CeD. RESULTS: A total of 10 (31%) of 32 patients with CeD and 4 (7.7%) of 52 controls tested positive for LHBT, with a statistically significant difference (p=0.007). Of 20 cultures, 3 (15%) were positive with no statistically significant correlation between the cultures and LHBT (p=0.05). In a subgroup analysis of children who were 18 years old or younger, 7/24 (29.2%) patients with CeD had a positive LHBT compared with 3/32 (9.4%) controls, but this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.08). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of SIBO was 31% in unresponsive patients with CeD according to LHBT and 15% in the quantitative culture of the jejunal aspirate, which is comparable with the published Western literature.
30201353	Is It a Refractory Celiac Disease?	
32810304	Gluten and skin disease beyond dermatitis herpetiformis: a review.	Gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley, is known to cause an immune reaction in patients with celiac disease (CD) resulting in small bowel villous atrophy and impaired nutrient absorption and cutaneous manifestations in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). It is common that patients associate skin conditions with their diet, and the advantages of a gluten-free diet (GFD) are brought up frequently. Indeed, there is evidence that certain dermatologic conditions can respond to a GFD, especially for those with concomitant CD and DH. In the last decade, new data have become available on the significance of gluten in skin disease. Herein, we review the role of gluten and a GFD on various cutaneous diseases beyond DH.
36536183	The role of mir-197-3p in regulating the tight junction permeability of celiac disease patients under gluten free diet.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a hereditary immune-mediated disorder, which is along with the enormous production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the reduced level of tight junction proteins. The aim of this study was to determine the expression of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-18, Occludin, miR-122-5p and miR-197-3p genes in duodenal biopsies of treated CD patients in comparison to the controls. METHODS AND RESULTS: Biopsy specimens were taken from the duodenum of 50 treated CD patients (36 (72%) females and 14 (28%) males with mean age of 37.06 +- 7.02 years) and 50 healthy controls (17 (34%) females and 33 (66%) males with mean age of 34.12 +- 4.9). Total RNA was isolated, cDNA was synthesized and mRNA expression of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-18, Occludin, miR-122-5p and miR-197-3p were quantified by relative qPCR using B2M and U6 as internal control genes. All data were evaluated using SPSS (V.21) and GraphPad Prism (V.5). Our results showed that there was no significant difference between patients and controls for intestinal mRNA expression of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-18, Occludin, and miR-122-5p (p > 0.05) and the expression of miR-197-3p was significantly increased in CD patients relative to control subjects (p = 0.049). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that adherence to GFD may have a positive effect on the tight junction (TJ) permeability and in this process, miR-197-3p plays an important role. Increased expression of miR-197-3p with a final protective effect on Occludin expression can be further studied as a complement therapeutic target for Celiac disease.
38224303	Dietitian-nutritionist incorporation in a university hospital: position statement of the Commission on Nutrition, Hospital Universitario La Paz.	Introduction: The present document has the objective of justifying the incorporation of a dietician/nutritionist to the multidisciplinary teams of specialized care that provide education, food anamnesis, nutritional recommendations, treatment and follow up of those patients in risk of malnutrition in Madrid. The appropriate nutritional status of hospitalized patients bears a close relationship with the existence of dieticians at hospitals. Dieticians use nutrition therapy as a cost-effective means to achieve significant health benefits by preventing or altering the course of diabetes, obesity, hypertension, lipid metabolism disorders, heart failure, osteoporosis, celiac disease, and chronic kidney disease, among other diseases.
35852982	[Amaranth grain proteins: prospects for use in specialized food products].	Amaranth is a widespread genus of predominantly annual herbaceous plants belonging to the Amaranthaceae family, which is one of the most widely used pseudocereals along with quinoa and buckwheat in nutrition. The aim of the research was to review and analyze the results of the studies on the characteristics of amaranth grain proteins, the effect of various food processing methods on their quality, and the prospects for using amaranth protein hydrolysates in therapeutic nutrition. Material and methods. For the main search for the literature, the PubMed bibliographic database was used, which covers about 75% of the world's medical publications. In addition, Scopus and Web of Science databases and non-commercial search engine Google Scholar were used. The depth of the search was 15 years. Results. The paper presents a brief review of modern approaches for obtaining amaranth protein isolates and concentrates, including the use of a complex of physicochemical methods: grinding, sifting, extraction at high pH values, defatting, ultrafiltration, centrifugation, isoelectric precipitation, and drying of the protein product. A comparative characteristic of amino acid content of protein fractions of pseudocereals is presented. Basically, leucine, isoleucine, and valine are limiting amino acids for the grain protein of various varieties of amaranth. When substantiating and developing modern effective food technologies for processing amaranth grain, the studies dedicated to the evaluation of their impact on the biological value of amaranth protein deserve special attention. Methods of grain fermentation, sprouting, steaming, malting, boiling can be used to increase the bioavailability and digestibility of its ingredients. The results of in vitro and in vivo studies indicate the presence of hypotensive, hypolipidemic and antioxidant activity of the amaranth protein and its hydrolysates what determines the prospects for their use as part of foods for special dietary uses and therapeutic nutrition. An analysis of the scientific publications presented in the review indicates an increase in demand for high-quality gluten-free products and an increase in the range of mass-consumption foods, such as bakery, pasta, flour confectionery, with pseudo-cereals in their composition, including amaranth. Conclusion. The high biological value and technological properties of amaranth protein concentrates/isolates determine the prospects for their use to create a wide range of specialized foods for various purposes.
35161479	Application of a Platform for Gluten-Free Diet Evaluation and Dietary Advice: From Theory to Practice.	The present work aimed to analyze, through the GlutenFreeDiet digital platform, the evolution over one year of the nutritional status, dietary profile and symptoms present among celiac people on a gluten-free diet (GFD) while receiving individualized dietary advice. Twenty-seven adults and thirty-one celiac children/adolescents participated in the study. This was then followed up by three visits, at diagnosis, and after 3 and 12 months (vt0, vt3 and vt12). Participants filled out dietary and gastrointestinal symptoms questionnaires. All patients received written personalized dietary advice from dietitians who interpreted data from the platform. Results obtained indicated that participants consumed proteins and lipids in excess and carbohydrates in defect. Low intakes of cereals, fruit and vegetables and high meat intakes were observed. However, gluten-free product (GFP) consumption and that of ultra-processed foods was reduced after 1 year in adults. Symptoms decreased after vt3 but recurred in vt12. Changes in ultra-processed foods and GFP intake, but lack of changes in the rest of the parameters suggested that the platform support was not effective enough. Even though the platform represents a useful tool for monitoring celiac patients and giving dietary advice, modules that require more continuous attention and nutritional education of patients should be provided for interventions to be more effective.
36082593	[A clinical case of depression finally explained by biology].	We report the clinical case of a patient, 36 years old, presenting a major depressive disorder for more than 6 months. Somatic complaints (diarrhea and eczema) are also present. Thanks to a biological assessment, the diagnosis of celiac disease will be made and a strict gluten-free diet will be prescribed to the patient. This will allow the improvement of depressive symptoms and somatic complaints. This clinical case underlines the importance of the search for somatic causes in the development of a depressive symptomatology.
36305882	Budesonide and the Gluten Containing Elimination Diet as Treatments for Non-responsive Celiac Disease in Children.	OBJECTIVES: Non-responsive celiac disease (NRCD) is defined as patients having persistent symptoms and enteropathy (Marsh 3 histology) suggestive of active celiac disease (CeD), after following a gluten-free diet (GFD) for at least 12 months. NRCD is suggested to affect 15% of children with CeD but data are limited and there is no research to date describing treatment of children with this condition. The aim of this study was to describe our center's approach to identifying and treating NRCD with budesonide and the Gluten Containing Elimination Diet (GCED). METHODS: We performed a retrospective, single center analysis over a 5-year period of patients with CD less than 18 years of age (inclusive) who underwent treatment for persistent symptoms and enteropathy despite following a GFD. RESULTS: We identified 22 patients with NRCD. Thirteen were treated with the GCED for 3 months with 46% achieving both histological and symptomatic resolution. Nine patients were treated with budesonide (6-9 mg), with 89% achieving both symptomatic and histologic resolution after a median 3-month treatment course. Further, 67% of patients who responded to the GCED and 100% of patients who responded to budesonide remained in remission for at least 6 months following treatment transition back to exclusive GFD. CONCLUSIONS: The GCED and budesonide can provide benefit for NRCD. Most patients with NRCD can return to a GFD after 3 months of treatment.
30959740	The Profile of Urinary Headspace Volatile Organic Compounds After 12-Week Intake of Oligofructose-Enriched Inulin by Children and Adolescents with Celiac Disease on a Gluten-Free Diet: Results of a Pilot, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial.	The concentration of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can inform about the metabolic condition of the body. In the small intestine of untreated persons with celiac disease (CD), chronic inflammation can occur, leading to nutritional deficiencies, and consequently to functional impairments of the whole body. Metabolomic studies showed differences in the profile of VOCs in biological fluids of patients with CD in comparison to healthy persons; however, there is scarce quantitative and nutritional intervention information. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the supplementation of a gluten-free diet (GFD) with prebiotic oligofructose-enriched inulin (Synergy 1) on the concentration of VOCs in the urine of children and adolescents with CD. Twenty-three participants were randomized to the group receiving Synergy 1 (10 g per day) or placebo for 12 weeks. Urinary VOCs were analyzed using solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Sixteen compounds were identified and quantified in urine samples. The supplementation of GFD with Synergy 1 resulted in an average concentration drop (36%) of benzaldehyde in urine samples. In summary, Synergy 1, applied as a supplement of GFD for 12 weeks had a moderate impact on the VOC concentrations in the urine of children with CD.
33843325	Navigating celiac disease and the gluten-free diet in China.	BACKGROUND: Little is known about celiac disease (CeD) diagnosis and management in China. AIM: This pilot aimed to be the first study to describe, quantitatively and qualitatively, how individuals living in China navigate CeD and the gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: Participants were 13 adults and four parents of children with reported CeD, recruited from 11 mainland China cities via an online GFD support group. CeD-specific quality of life (CD-QOL and CD-PQOL) and diet adherence (CDAT) were assessed. In-depth interviews addressed experiences with CeD and the GFD. RESULTS: Six of 17 participants reported biopsy- or serology-confirmed CeD. The mean (SD) adult CDAT score was 15.2 (3.6), > 13 indicating inadequate GFD adherence. The mean adult CD-QOL score was 62.1 (24.1) out of 100, in the "medium" to "good" range. Results were similar in children. Major interview themes included: (1) a challenging journey to obtain diagnosis; (2) social and structural barriers to maintaining the GFD; and (3) reliance on self in management of CeD. CONCLUSION: Obtaining a diagnosis, maintaining a GFD, and living with CeD can be extremely challenging in mainland China. Results suggest an urgent need for CeD-specific education and Asian-adapted GFD guidance for both healthcare practitioners and patients.
31183842	Interpretation and implementation of the revised European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) guidelines on pediatric celiac disease amongst consultant general pediatricians in Southwest of England.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a lifelong condition with significant morbidity and requires an accurate diagnosis. Guidelines for pediatric CD were revised by the European and British Societies of Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition in 2012 and 2013, respectively. New recommendations introduced non-biopsy pathway (NBP) of diagnosis for a selective group of symptomatic children whose anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) antibody titer is greater than ten times upper limit of normal. A clear understanding of the guidelines amongst consultant pediatricians will ensure all children with suspected CD receive a prompt and secure diagnosis. The aim of this study was to establish the interpretation and implementation of the revised guideline for CD amongst consultant general pediatricians in Southwest England (SWE) during the study period. METHODS: Telephone/email survey was conducted amongst consultant general pediatricians (n   140) working in 12 secondary care hospitals across SWE. The survey included eight questions incorporating three main themes: understanding of diagnostic pathway particularly for non-biopsy diagnosis, awareness of laboratory tests involved, and variations in practice in relation to the revised guidelines. RESULTS: Responses were available from 101/140 (72%). One hundred respondents were aware of the revised guidelines for diagnosing CD. However, only 17 respondents stated all the criteria of the guideline required for diagnosis by NBP, with further 17 seeking immediate advice from a specialist. Forty-four listed both the criteria for HLA-DQ2/DQ8 testing applicable to pediatricians. Forty-nine out of 100 pediatricians would commence gluten-free diet only after all the results were available. Thirty-three pediatricians also considered asymptomatic children with high anti-tTG titer eligible for diagnosis of CD by NBP. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for improved understanding of revised CD guidelines amongst consultant general pediatricians especially while using the NBP and requesting HLA-DQ2/DQ8 testing.
29338961	Is eosinophilic esophagitis an equivalent of pollen allergic asthma? Analysis of biopsies and therapy guided by component resolved diagnosis.	BACKGROUND: Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is characterized by esophageal dysfunction and, histologically, by eosinophilic inflammation. There is not a clear etiologic treatment. Biopsies analysis using plant histology methods may show callose and pollen tubes in the esophageal mucosa. Component-resolved diagnosis (CRD) with microarrays could detect possible allergens involved and indicate an elimination diet and allergen immunotherapy (AIT). METHODS: One hundred and twenty-nine patients with EoE were tested for environmental and food allergens. CRD, histological and botanical analysis were performed. Clinical scores and endoscopic biopsy were performed every six months for three years. Fifty healthy patients, 50 asthmatics due to pollen, and 53 celiac disease patients were included as comparison groups. CRD-directed AIT was administered in 91 EoE patients and elimination diet in 140 patients (87 EoE and all 53 CD patients). RESULTS: CRD detected allergen hypersensitivity in 87.6% of patients with EoE. The predominant allergens were grass group 1 (55%), lipid transfer proteins (LTP) of peach and mugwort, hazelnuts and walnuts. Callose from pollen tubes was found in 65.6% of biopsies. After CRD-guided elimination diet and/or AIT, 101 (78.3%) EoE patients showed significant clinical improvement (p<0.017) and 97 (75.2%) were discharged (negative biopsy, no symptoms, no medication) without relapse. AIT-treated patients had better outcomes (odds ratio 177.3, 95% CI 16.2-1939.0). CONCLUSION: CRD-directed AIT and/or elimination diet was efficient in treating EoE patients and was well tolerated.
37882829	[Dermatitis herpetiformis and other forms of wheat sensitivity].	BACKGROUND: Wheat sensitivity is a collective term for several, especially gastrointestinal, diseases that occur as part of a hypersensitivity reaction after wheat consumption. The symptoms, which are mostly similar to those of irritable bowel syndrome, are often accompanied by skin lesions. In addition to celiac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis, the cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease, wheat sensitivity also includes nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), allergic nickel contact mucositis, wheat allergy, amylase-trypsin inhibitor intolerance, and fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) intolerance. OBJECTIVES: This review article aims to provide an overview of the clinical, especially dermatological and gastrointestinal features of the different forms of wheat sensitivity. Diagnosis and therapeutic management are also discussed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A selective literature search was carried out with evaluation of our own clinical data. RESULTS: The skin lesions in dermatitis herpetiformis are very disease-specific. In contrast, wheat allergy often shares signs and symptoms with many other diseases. Other forms of wheat sensitivity cause primarily gastrointestinal abnormalities, but extra-intestinal manifestations can also occur. Their diagnosis is often complex and requires cross-disciplinary collaboration with experts in gastroenterology. The therapy consists of a wheat- or gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of the different and frequently occurring dermatological signs of wheat sensitivity is of great importance, because dermatological manifestations associated with gastrointestinal pathology, intolerance reactions, and allergies appear more and more frequently.
31335839	Celiac Dietary Adherence Test simplifies Determining Adherence to a Gluten-free Diet in Swedish Adolescents.	OBJECTIVES: The aims of the study were to ascertain whether the Celiac Dietary Adherence Test (CDAT) could contribute in determining adherence to a gluten-free diet in patients with celiac disease and to evaluate the diet adherence and well being of a study population 5 years after a celiac disease screening known as "Exploring the Iceberg of Celiacs in Sweden." METHODS: Through the screening, 90 adolescents (born 1997) were diagnosed with biopsy-proven celiac disease at 12 years of age. Of them, 70 (78%) came to a 5-year follow-up where anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies 2 was tested and a questionnaire was filled in, including CDAT, which consists of 7 questions related to adherence. Nonparametrical tests were used to determine associations between adherence measures. RESULTS: Among the adolescents, 86% were adherent to a gluten-free diet 5 years after screening, 38% reported their general well being as excellent, 50% very well, and 12% well. Statistically significant associations were seen between anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies 2 and the CDAT score (P = 0.033), and the self-reported adherence question and the CDAT score (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The screening-detected adolescents reported a high level of well being and adherence to a gluten-free diet 5 years after screening. We conclude that the CDAT can be used in clinical practice as an estimation of adherence to a gluten-free diet. It would be most suitable to use in conjunction with currently used adherence measures, but can also be used as a stand-alone method when others are not accessible.
34618236	The costs of celiac disease: a contingent valuation in Switzerland.	This paper proposes a first monetary measure of the private costs of celiac disease, including intangible costs (physical symptoms, logistical constraints, etc.) in Switzerland. This auto-immune disease damages the intestine when patients ingest gluten. The only treatment currently available is a gluten-free diet, which implies great nutritional constraints. To get a monetary equivalent of the costs borne by celiac patients, we used a contingent valuation. The scenario suggested to celiac patients a treatment in form of a daily pill, which would allow them to eat normally and avoid any physical pain from celiac disease. Mean Willingness To Pay (WTP) for the treatment is found to be around CHF 87 (approx. USD 87) per month. WTP is positively influenced by direct and indirect costs of the disease. Oppositely, individuals, who find the gluten-free diet healthier are willing to pay less. Finally, unlike symptoms before diagnostic, the current presence or intensity of physical symptoms are found to be insignificant. The latter result can be explained by the fact that, individuals facing stronger symptoms are more likely to adhere strictly to the GFD and hence to reduce their frequency.
31166403	Consensus on the treatment of autoimmune bullous dermatoses: dermatitis herpetiformis and linear IgA bullous dermatosis - Brazilian Society of Dermatology.	Dermatitis herpetiformis and linear IgA bullous dermatosis are autoimmune diseases that present with pruritic urticarial papules and plaques, with formation of vesicles and blisters of subepidermal location, mediated by IgA antibodies. Mucosal lesions are present only in linear IgA bullous dermatosis. The elaboration of this consensus consisted of a brief presentation of the different aspects of these dermatoses and, above all, of an updated literature review on the various therapeutic options that were discussed and compared with the authors' experience, aiming at the treatment orientation of these diseases in Brazil. Dermatitis herpetiformis is a cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease, and can be controlled with a gluten-free diet and dapsone. On the other hand, linear IgA bullous dermatosis arises spontaneously or is triggered by drugs, and can be controlled with dapsone, but often requires the association of systemic corticosteroids and eventually immunosuppressants.
32960627	[Celiac disease: causes, pathology, and nutritional assessment of gluten-free diet. A review].	INTRODUCTION: Introduction: celiac patients suffer deficiencies before and during their maintenance of a gluten-free diet. This is due to malabsorption, associated with the disease, and to non-enriched, mostly processed foods high in saturated fats and deficient in the minerals typically present in wheat. Objectives: the main objective of this review was to determine the molecular basis of celiac disease and the nutritional deficiencies that gluten-free diet entails, as well as an assessment of gluten-free diet and its nutritional deficiencies once the intestinal microvilli have been restored. Material and methods: a bibliographic search was carried out through electronic databases. The content of the review focuses on the pathogenesis of celiac disease and the assessment of gluten-free diet when established for treatment. Results: the main deficiencies that occur in untreated celiac patients are (calcium, iron, fiber, folic acid, omega-3, vitamin B12, and vitamin D). It has been observed that the quality of life of celiac patients, after starting treatment, is reduced, and this leads to low adherence to gluten-free diet. In addition, these gluten-free diets without proper follow-up by a nutritionist entail other deficits such as: an increase in the risk of cardiovascular, metabolic, overweight and obesity diseases. Conclusion: gluten-free diet, as followed by celiac patients, usually entails certain deficiencies such as group-B vitamins, vitamin D, calcium, iron, folic acid, and fiber, which is mainly due to the poor nutritional quality of gluten-free products as compared to their equivalents with gluten, and a scarce monitoring by health professionals.
28970717	Helminths as an alternative therapy for intestinal diseases.	Animal models and clinical studies have shown that helminth infections exert immunomodulatory activity, altering intestinal permeability and providing a potential beneficial action on autoimmune and inflammatory disorders in human beings, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and celiac disease. This is consistent with the theory that intestinal microbiota is responsible for shaping human immunological responses. With the arrival of the immunobiologic era and the use of antibodies, we propose a distinctive pathway for treating patients with IBD and celiac disease. We have some evidence about the safety and tolerability of helminth use, but evidence about their impact on disease activity is lacking. Using worms to treat diseases could be a possible way to lower treatment costs, since the era of immunobiologic agents is responsible for a significant rise in expenses. Some questions remain to be investigated regarding the use of helminths in intestinal disease, such as the importance of the specific species of helminths used, appropriate dosing regimens, optimal timing of treatment, the role of host genetics, diet, environment, and the elucidation of the exact mechanisms of action. One promising approach is the use of helminth-derived anti-inflammatory molecules as drugs. Yet there are still many challenges with this method, especially with regard to safety. Studies on intestinal permeability point to Strongyloides stercoralis as a useful nematode for these purposes.
31868785	A Quantitative Assessment of Gluten Cross-contact in the School Environment for Children With Celiac Disease.	OBJECTIVES: A gluten-free (GF) diet is the primary treatment for celiac disease (CD). Gluten is used in schools, particularly in early childhood, art, and home-economics classrooms. This study aimed to measure gluten transfer from school supplies to GF foods that a child with CD may eat. Also, to measure efficacy of washing techniques to remove gluten from hands and tables. METHODS: Five experiments measured potential gluten cross-contact in classrooms: Play-Doh (n = 30); baking project (n = 30); paper mache (n = 10); dry pasta in sensory table (n = 10); cooked pasta in sensory table (n = 10). Thirty participants ages 2 to 18 were enrolled. Following activities, gluten levels were measured on separate slices of GF bread rubbed on participant's hands and table surfaces. Participants were assigned 1 of 3 handwashing methods (soap and water, water alone, or wet wipe). Repeat gluten transfer measurements were taken from hands and tables. Gluten measurements made using R-Biopharm R7001 R5-ELISA Sandwich assay. RESULTS: Paper mache, cooked pasta in sensory tables, and baking project resulted in rates of gluten transfer far greater than the 20 ppm threshold set by Codex Alimentarius Commission. Play-Doh and dry pasta, however, resulted in few gluten transfers to GF bread >20 ppm. Soap and water was consistently the most effective method for removing gluten, although other methods proved as effective in certain scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: The potential for gluten exposure at school is high for some materials and low for others. For high-risk materials, schools should provide GF supplies and have a robust strategy to prevent gluten cross-contact with food.
30318895	Detection and quantification of gluten immunogenic peptides in feces of infants and their relationship with diet.	BACKGROUND: there are no effective methods to easily control the correct adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) in celiac disease (CD) patients. AIM: to assess the sensitivity and specificity of a rapid immunochromatographic (IC) test that detects gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) in feces, compared to an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. METHODS: fecal samples from healthy infants were analyzed by a rapid IC test and ELISA, both methods are based on the anti-gliadin 33-mer monoclonal antibody. Group 1 included infants aged from 6 to 24 months, with an unrestricted consumption of gluten containing cereals. Group 2 (negative controls) was comprised of infants aged from 0 to 6 months, either breastfed or formula fed who had never ingested gluten. RESULTS: in group 1 (n = 34), all infants had positive values by ELISA, the mean was 13.13 mugGIP/g (range 0.56-46.79). The IC test was negative in 5/20 cases and there was a significant correlation (p=0.006) between the mean daily gluten intake and GIP in feces. In group 2 (n = 20), all the samples were negative by both methods. Moreover, the Kappa Fleiss concordance index (Kappa = 0.79 CI95% [0.616, 0.965]) indicated a moderate concordance between both methods. CONCLUSIONS: according to our results, both methods are highly specific. However, the ELISA test had a higher sensitivity. Although we found a significant correlation between the amount of gluten consumed and GIP recovery in feces, further studies are needed to clarify the impact of individual confounding factors in GIP recovery.
31102129	Going Against the Grains: Gluten-Free Diets in Patients Without Celiac Disease-Worthwhile or Not?	While the gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only known effective therapy for celiac disease, in recent years it has become increasingly popular in the USA and worldwide, with many believing it to be more "healthful" and others claiming that it has beneficial effects for health conditions, many extraintestinal, other than celiac disease. This review examines the evidence for use of the GFD in patients without celiac disease who self-report intestinal and/or extraintestinal symptoms (non-celiac gluten sensitivity), as well as for enhancement of athletic performance and treatment of autism, rheumatoid arthritis, and psychiatric disorders. Overall, the evidence for use of GFDs in conditions other than celiac disease is poor. Though non-celiac gluten sensitivity may ultimately emerge as a biomarker-defined condition, a large proportion of patients with apparent non-celiac gluten sensitivity have, after careful investigation, an alternative diagnosis. In light of this, and coupled with the potential physical and psychological harms associated with the avoidance of gluten, initiating a GFD should not be encouraged for people who have these other conditions or are seeking physical/athletic enhancement.
35212046	Maternal autoimmune disease and risk of hospitalization for autoimmune disease, allergy, and cancer in offspring.	BACKGROUND: Children whose mothers have autoimmune disease may be at risk of developing immune-mediated disorders. We assessed the association between maternal autoimmune disease and risk of autoimmune disease, allergy, and cancer in offspring. METHODS: We analyzed a cohort of 1,011,623 children born in Canada between 2006 and 2019. We identified mothers who had autoimmune diseases and assessed hospitalizations for autoimmune disease, allergy, and cancer in offspring between birth and 14 years of age. We estimated hazard ratios (HR) for the association of maternal autoimmune disease with child hospitalization in adjusted Cox regression models. We used within-sibling analysis to control for genetic and environmental confounders. RESULTS: A total of 20,354 children (2.0%) had mothers with an autoimmune disease. Compared with no autoimmune disease, maternal autoimmune disease was associated with the risk of childhood hospitalization for autoimmune disease (HR 1.96, 95% CI 1.66-2.31) and allergy (HR 1.30, 95% CI 1.21-1.40), but was not significantly associated with cancer (HR 1.31, 95% CI 0.96-1.80). Type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, inflammatory arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus were among specific maternal autoimmune diseases most strongly associated with childhood hospitalization for autoimmune disease and allergy. The associations disappeared after controlling for genetic and environmental confounders in the within-sibling analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal autoimmune disease is associated with an increased risk of autoimmune disease and allergy hospitalization in offspring, but the relationship appears to be confounded by genetic and environmental factors. Prenatal exposure to immunologic or pharmacologic products is not likely a direct cause of immune-mediated disease in children.
37432208	Follow-Up of Celiac Disease in Adults: "When, What, Who, and Where".	For patients with celiac disease (CeD), a lifelong gluten-free diet is not a voluntary lifestyle choice-it is a necessity. The key end points in clinical follow-up are symptom resolution, the normalization of weight, prevention of overweight, seroconversion, and negation or minimization of increased long-term morbidity. For the latter, a surrogate endpoint is mucosal healing, which means the normalization of histology to Marsh 0-1. Ideally, celiac follow-up care includes a multidisciplinary approach, effective referral processes, improved access that leverages technological advances, and following guidelines with the identification of measurable quality indicators, ideally informed by evidence-based research. Face-to-face CeD care and telemedicine are considered the standards for this process, although published data are insufficient. Guidelines and statements on diagnosis are readily available. However, data are lacking on optimal clinic visit intervals and outcomes and quality indicators such as improvement of symptoms, function and quality of life, survival and disease control, and how to most effectively use healthcare resources. The results of future research should provide the basis for general recommendations for evidence-based standards of quality of care in CeD.
32545596	Thyroid-Gut-Axis: How Does the Microbiota Influence Thyroid Function?	A healthy gut microbiota not only has beneficial effects on the activity of the immune system, but also on thyroid function. Thyroid and intestinal diseases prevalently coexist-Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) and Graves' disease (GD) are the most common autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITD) and often co-occur with Celiac Disease (CD) and Non-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCWS). This can be explained by the damaged intestinal barrier and the following increase of intestinal permeability, allowing antigens to pass more easily and activate the immune system or cross-react with extraintestinal tissues, respectively. Dysbiosis has not only been found in AITDs, but has also been reported in thyroid carcinoma, in which an increased number of carcinogenic and inflammatory bacterial strains were observed. Additionally, the composition of the gut microbiota has an influence on the availability of essential micronutrients for the thyroid gland. Iodine, iron, and copper are crucial for thyroid hormone synthesis, selenium and zinc are needed for converting T4 to T3, and vitamin D assists in regulating the immune response. Those micronutrients are often found to be deficient in AITDs, resulting in malfunctioning of the thyroid. Bariatric surgery can lead to an inadequate absorption of these nutrients and further implicates changes in thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and T3 levels. Supplementation of probiotics showed beneficial effects on thyroid hormones and thyroid function in general. A literature research was performed to examine the interplay between gut microbiota and thyroid disorders that should be considered when treating patients suffering from thyroid diseases. Multifactorial therapeutic and preventive management strategies could be established and more specifically adjusted to patients, depending on their gut bacteria composition. Future well-powered human studies are warranted to evaluate the impact of alterations in gut microbiota on thyroid function and diseases.
34578835	It Is High Time for Personalized Dietary Counseling in Celiac Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis on Body Composition.	The body composition of patients with celiac disease (CD), on which the effects of a gluten-free diet (GFD) are controversial, differs from that of the average population. In this study, we aimed to compare the body composition across CD patients before a GFD, CD patients after a one-year GFD and non-celiac control subjects. A systematic search was conducted using five electronic databases up to 15 July 2021 for studies that reported at least one of the pre-specified outcomes. In meta-analyses, weighted mean differences (WMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. A total of 25 studies were eligible for systematic review, seven of which were included in meta-analysis. During a >=1-year GFD, fat mass of CD patients, compared to that at baseline, significantly increased (WMD = 4.1 kg, 95% CI = 1.5 to 6.6, three studies). In CD patients after a >=1-year GFD, compared to non-celiac controls, fat mass (WMD = -5.8 kg, 95% CI = -8.7 to -2.9, three studies) and fat-free mass (WMD = -1.9 kg, 95% CI = -3.0 to -0.7, three studies) were significantly lower. In conclusion, body composition-related parameters of CD patients differ from that of the non-celiac control subjects even after a longstanding GFD.
30905717	Efficacy of Enteric-Release Oral Budesonide in Treatment of Acute Reactions to Gluten in Patients With Celiac Disease.	Celiac disease (CeD) is a common gluten-responsive T cell-mediated enteropathy. The only current treatment is gluten avoidance; however, even when attempting to adhere to a gluten-free diet (GFD), symptomatic gluten exposures are frequent.1.

31880159	The value of a biopsy in celiac disease follow up: assessment of the small bowel after 6 and 24 months treatment with a gluten free diet.	INTRODUCTION: a routine small bowel biopsy (SBB) during the follow up of celiac disease (CD) is controversial. Little information is available regarding the histological changes during (gluten free diet (GFD) in the long term. OBJECTIVES: the aim of the study was to evaluate a novel criterion to compare duodenal histology in CD patients after six months and two years of gluten withdrawal. METHODS: this was a cross-sectional study of 200 patients with confirmed Marsh I-III who were under the six months (group A, n = 100) and 24 months (group B, n = 100) of a GFD. Nineteen patients were excluded due to an inadequate adherence to the GFD and another 23 patients were excluded as they were unwilling to undergo a re-endoscopy and did not comply with the necessary criteria. Endoscopy with a duodenal biopsy, serological assays and clinical evaluation were performed and compared with baseline data in the remaining 58 patients (20 patients in group A and 38 patients in group B). RESULTS: a significant complete histological recovery was found in 47.4% of patients in group B compared to 30% in group A (p = 0.026). A partial histological recovery was reported in seven (35%) and eleven (28.9%) patients in groups A and B, respectively. Any changes in mucosal histology after GFD was observed in 35% of patients in group A and 23.7% in group B. Serological assessment and endoscopic appearance normalized in 78.9% vs 75.0% in group B and 68.4% vs 65.0% in group A, respectively. However, this improvement did not reach statistical significance (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: the results of this study show that histological recovery in patients with Marsh >= III is slow and does not correlate with symptomatic improvement. We suggest that the long-term effects of a GFD can play an important role in achieving histological improvement, especially in older patients.
30016020	Effects of age of diagnosis and dietary compliance on growth parameters of patients with celiac disease.	INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to evaluate the relation between age at diagnosis and compliance to gluten free diet (GFD) on growth in children with celiac disease and the factors that influenced compliance to GFD. POPULATION AND METHODS: Celiac disease (CD) patients with villous atrophy followed in our hospital between January 2015 and January 2017, were included. They were classified according to diagnosis age and GFD compliance. Patients' anthropometric characteristics at diagnosis and follow-up were compared. RESULTS: There were 73 patients with 10.4 +- 4.5 years of average age, 35 (47.9%) patients had a short stature at diagnosis, the ages of patients who had short stature (7.8 +- 4.2 years) were higher than those who did not (5.1 +- 4.3 years) (p= 0.005). At diagnosis, 33 (45.2%) patients were aged <=6 years, 40 (54.8%) were aged >6 years. The height and weight z-scores of patients who were diagnosed at >6 years of age were significantly lower than those who were diagnosed <=6 years of age both at diagnosis (p= 0.01 and 0.04) and at last control (p= 0.001 and 0.001), respectively. Forty-five (61.6%) patients were fully compliant with GFD. In comparison of anthropometric data in terms of GFD compliance, the increase in BMI and weight z-score in the fully compliant group was found to be significantly higher when compared with the other group. CONCLUSIONS: Delay in CD diagnosis negatively affected both the height and weight and other growth parameters. GFD compliance positively affected the patients' all growth parameters, especially weight and BMI z-score.

34464324	Bone Mineral Density Screening and the Frequency of Osteopenia/Osteoporosis in Turkish Adult Patients With Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis in adult patients with celiac disease (CD) at diagnosis and/or in the follow-up after a gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: Adult patients diagnosed with CD were retrospectively screened through follow-up records and computer databases. Patients assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) at diagnosis and/or in the follow-up after a GFD were included in the study. RESULTS: One hundred patients who underwent a DEXA scan at least once after diagnosis or after being on a GFD were included in the study. The mean age of the patients at diagnosis was 34.61 +- 10.3 years, and 84% of the patients (n = 84) were female. At the time of diagnosis (n = 46), the prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis was 67.3% and 15.2%, respectively, at the lumbar spine, and 43.4% and 10.8%, respectively, at the femur. After a GFD (n = 78), the prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis was 61.5% and 8.9%, respectively, at the lumbar spine, and 37.1% and 2.5%, respectively, at the femur. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of CD patients with low bone mineral density (BMD) is high after diagnosis and in the follow-up after a GFD. It is important for all patients with CD to undergo a DEXA scan to determine the follow-up and/or treatment characteristics.
34049371	Gluten-induced Neurocognitive Impairment: Results of a Nationwide Study.	GOALS: This study aimed to understand the neurocognitive symptoms associated with gluten exposure in individuals with self-reported celiac disease (CD) and nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). BACKGROUND: While gluten-induced neurocognitive impairment (GINI; eg, "celiac fog" or "brain fog") is commonly described by individuals with CD and NCGS, there are little data regarding the prevalence and symptoms associated with these experiences. STUDY: A 9-question online survey was accessed by 1396 individuals (1143 with CD; 253 with NCGS). Forced choice and free-response questions were asked of participants to obtain a description of neurocognitive symptoms experienced after gluten ingestion. Free-response answers were coded using a coding structure developed based on the Health-Related Quality of Life Instrument. RESULTS: The majority of survey participants (89% of CD and 95% of NCGS) reported having GINI symptoms. When describing symptoms, the most common word descriptors for both groups were difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, and grogginess. Timing of symptoms, including onset and symptom peak, were similar across the 2 groups. Coding of free responses found the most common references were to cognitive, physical, psychological, and overall quality of life impacts. CONCLUSIONS: This survey suggests that GINI is common and may be severe in both individuals with CD and NCGS. Cognitive impairment and decline in physical functioning may be similar to that occurring in other illnesses, such as lupus. Clinical follow-up with both individuals with CD and NCGS should include assessment of GINI symptoms. Further research is warranted, including the development of a patient-reported outcome measure including neurocognitive effects of gluten exposure.
32059410	Constitutive Differential Features of Type 2 Transglutaminase in Cells Derived from Celiac Patients and from Healthy Subjects.	Type 2 transglutaminase (TG2) is a ubiquitous enzyme able to modify gliadin peptides introduced into the organism through the diet. By means of its catalytic activity, TG2 seems to have an important pathogenetic role in celiac disease (CD), an inflammatory intestinal disease caused by the ingestion of gluten-containing cereals. A strong autoimmune response to TG2 characterizes CD development. Anti-TG2 antibodies specifically derange the uptake of the alpha-gliadin peptide 31-43 by control, but not by celiac dermal fibroblasts, underlying some different constitutive features regarding TG2 in healthy and celiac subjects. Our aim was to investigate whether these differences depended on a different TG2 subcellular distribution and whether peptide 31-43 differentially regulated TG2 expression and activity in cells of the two groups of subjects. We found that TG2 was more abundantly associated with membranes of celiac fibroblasts than of control cells, in particular with the early endosomal and autophagic compartments. We also found that peptide 31-43 differentially affected TG2 expression and activity in the two groups of cells, activating TG2 more in control than in celiac cells and inducing TG2 expression in celiac cells, but not in control ones. The different TG2 subcellular localization and the different way the peptide 31-43 modulates TG2 activity and availability into control and CD cells suggested that TG2 is involved in the definition of a constitutive CD cellular phenotype, thus having an important and still undefined role in CD pathogenesis.
37625879	In vivo sensitization to gliadin by oral administration.	Celiac disease is a highly prevalent immune-mediated enteropathy that develops in genetically susceptible individuals expressing HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 after ingestion of gluten and results in decreased quality of life and increased morbidity. This pathology is triggered by immunogenic peptides generated from gliadins present in gluten, which act on the intestinal mucosa in a context of high intestinal permeability, activating the innate and adaptive response of the immune system. Several in vivo rodent models attempt to reproduce some phases of the intestinal inflammatory process that occurs in celiac disease. Allergic sensitization to gluten simulates, or enhances in some animal models, the loss of tolerance to gliadin peptides and the initial events that lead to celiac disease in a specific genetic or environmental context. Here we describe a simple method for performing gliadin sensitization in an in vivo animal model.
31144026	Oxidative stress, DNA stability and evoked inflammatory signaling in young celiac patients consuming a gluten-free diet.	PURPOSE: Celiac disease (CD) is a multifactorial, autoimmune, gluten-sensitive inflammatory disorder of the small intestine. Taking into account the pathogenesis of CD, a strict gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only treatment able to restore epithelium integrity and eliminate complications. The current study was designed to assess whether the use of a GFD is sufficient for maintaining a correct oxidative/antioxidant balance and ameliorating the evoked inflammatory signaling in young patients with CD. METHODS: The study covered 80 children, aged between 7 and 18 years, attending the Gastroenterology Service of the Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Child Nutrition Service from the Virgen de las Nieves Hospital in Granada. Children with CD diagnosed were included in the celiac group who followed a strict GFD for 2 years (n = 40) and the control group (n = 40) included healthy children, with negative serological screening. Soluble superoxide dismutase 1 and 2, total antioxidant status, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, cortisol, melatonin and inflammatory parameters in plasma, 15-F2t-isoprostanes in urine, and DNA breaks in peripheral blood lymphocytes were analysed. RESULTS: No differences were found in oxidative stress between CD patients and controls; however, IFN-gamma, IL-1alpha, IP-10 and TNF-beta were higher in the CD patients. VEGF was also higher than in the control group. CONCLUSION: The GFD in the CD patients is enough to reduce the oxidative stress; however, in the case of the inflammatory signaling, the initial exposure to gluten prior to stablish the GFD is strong enough to induce an inflammatory state which is maintained (even when consuming the GFD); meanwhile the increase in VEGF recorded in the CD group could be a compensatory mechanism to restore the damaged mucosa and duodenal villous atrophy, due to its role in endothelial activation and generation of new functional and stable vascular networks.
32115289	Impact of a gluten-free diet on patients with celiac disease, nonceliac gluten sensitivity, and asymptomatic controls.	
33588056	The impact of celiac disease and duration of gluten free diet on anterior and posterior ocular structures: Ocular imaging based study.	PURPOSE: To evaluate the eyes of adult celiac disease (CD) patients and investigate the association between these ocular parameters with celiac specific antibodies and duration of gluten free diet (GFD). METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 72 eyes of 36 CD patients (18-51 years of age) and 70 eyes of 35 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. In addition to a complete ophthalmologic examination, all patients were scanned by a Scheimpflug camera, specular microscopy and spectral domain optical coherence tomography. RESULTS: Endothelial cell density (ECD), anterior chamber angle (ACA) degrees, anterior chamber depth (ACD), anterior chamber volume (ACV) and central macular thickness (CMT) values were lower in CD patients as compared with control group (p values = 0.038, 0.024, 0.002, 0.038 and 0.046 respectively). ECD and CMT were lower in celiac patients whom endomysial antibodies (EMA) IgA were positive (p = 0.001, p = 0.042 respectively). Tissue transglutaminase IgA antibody (anti tTG IgA) was weakly positively correlated (p > 0.05) with ACD, and positively (r = 0.319; p < 0.05) correlated with ACV. As the duration of compliance to the diet increased in the celiac group the mean and inferior retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness decreased (p = 0.035, p = 0.008 respectively). Mean, inferior and temporal RNFL thicknesses were lower in celiac patients whose duration of GFD was longer than 5 years (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Decreases in ECD, ACA degree, ACD, ACV and CMT can occur in CD patients. In adult celiac patients; ECD, CMT might be effected in the presence of positive EMA, and ACD, ACV might be effected in the presence of higher anti tTG IgA titer. Adult celiac patients who had longer duration of GFD may have thinner RNFL. RNFL may be thinner in celiac patients who comply with GFD for more than 5 years.
38276560	Gluten and Wheat in Women's Health: Beyond the Gut.	Since the rise of awareness of gluten/wheat-related disorders in the academic and clinical field in the last few decades, misinformation regarding the gluten-free diet (GFD) and its impact on health has been spreading among the general population. Despite the established link between gluten and celiac disease (CD), where a GFD is mandatory to reach clinical and histological remission, things are more complicated when it comes to non-celiac gluten/wheat sensitivity (NCGWS) and other autoimmune/dysimmune disorders. In the last conditions, a beneficial effect of gluten withdrawal has not been properly assessed, but still is often suggested without strong supporting evidence. In this context, women have always been exposed, more than men, to higher social pressure related to nutritional behaviors and greater engagement in controlling body weight. With this narrative review, we aim to summarize current evidence on the adherence to a GFD, with particular attention to the impact on women's health.

35328331	Antibody Responses to Transglutaminase 3 in Dermatitis Herpetiformis: Lessons from Celiac Disease.	Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is the skin manifestation of celiac disease, presenting with a blistering rash typically on the knees, elbows, buttocks and scalp. In both DH and celiac disease, exposure to dietary gluten triggers a cascade of events resulting in the production of autoantibodies against the transglutaminase (TG) enzyme, mainly TG2 but often also TG3. The latter is considered to be the primary autoantigen in DH. The dynamics of the development of the TG2-targeted autoimmune response have been studied in depth in celiac disease, but the immunological process underlying DH pathophysiology is incompletely understood. Part of this process is the occurrence of granular deposits of IgA and TG3 in the perilesional skin. While this serves as the primary diagnostic finding in DH, the role of these immunocomplexes in the pathogenesis is unknown. Intriguingly, even though gluten-intolerance likely develops initially in a similar manner in both DH and celiac disease, after the onset of the disease, its manifestations differ widely.
29095937	Younger age at diagnosis predisposes to mucosal recovery in celiac disease on a gluten-free diet: A meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Persistent intestinal damage is associated with higher complication rates in celiac disease. We aimed to assess the potential modifiers of mucosal recovery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We screened databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Trials, and Web of Science) for papers on celiac disease. Papers discussing (1) celiac patients (2) follow-up biopsy and (3) mucosal recovery after commencement of a gluten-free diet were included. The primary outcome was to produce a comprehensive analysis of complete mucosal recovery (i.e., Marsh 0 on follow-up). We compared children's recovery ratios to those of adults. Patients following a strict gluten-free dietary regimen were included in a subgroup. Summary point estimates, 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and 95% predictive intervals (PIs) were calculated. Heterogeneity was tested with I2-statistic. The PROSPERO registration number is CRD42016053482. RESULTS: The overall complete mucosal recovery ratio, calculated from 37 observational studies, was 0.36 (CI: 0.28-0.44, PI: -0.12-0.84; I2: 98.4%, p<0.01). Children showed higher complete mucosal recovery ratio than adults (p<0.01): 0.65 (CI: 0.44-0.85, PI: -0.10-1.39; I2: 96.5%, p<0.01) as opposed to 0.24 (CI: 0.15-0.33, PI: -0.19-1.08; I2: 96.3%, p<0.01). In the strict dietary adherence subgroup, complete mucosal recovery ratio was 0.47 (CI: 0.24-0.70, PI: -0.47-1.41; I2: 98.8%, p<0.001). On meta-regression, diagnostic villous atrophy (Marsh 3) ratio (-8.97, p<0.01) and male ratio (+6.04, p<0.01) proved to be a significant determinant of complete mucosal recovery, unlike duration of gluten-free diet (+0.01, p = 0.62). The correlation between complete mucosal recovery ratio and age on diagnosis is of borderline significance (-0.03, p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable heterogeneity across studies concerning complete mucosal recovery ratios achieved by a gluten-free diet in celiac disease. Several celiac patients fail to achieve complete mucosal recovery even if a strict dietary regimen is followed. Younger age on diagnosis, less severe initial histologic damage and male gender predispose for achieving mucosal recovery.
29752728	A retrospective study of dermatitis herpetiformis from an immunobullous disease clinic in north India.	BACKGROUND: Indian data on dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is not available. The aim of this study was to investigate the demographic and clinicopathological characteristics of patients with DH and to study its association with other autoimmune diseases. METHODS: All data were collected from case record forms of patients registered in immunobullous disease clinic of our institute. The diagnosis was based on characteristic clinical and immuno/histopathological features. RESULTS: A total of 65 patients were included, which constituted 9.47% of the registered patients in the immunobullous disease clinic over 3.5 years. The male to female ratio was 1.4 : 1; the average age was 44.35 +- 15.52 years. Direct immunofluorescence showed granular IgA deposits at the papillary tips in 83.07% and basement membrane zone in 12.3% patients. Sixteen (24.1%) patients had associated celiac disease, and 15 (23.07%) patients had other autoimmune comorbidities such as hypothyroidism. Forty percent of patients on strict gluten-free diet achieved remission in 2 years, while 35.4% had frequent relapses as they continued gluten intake. CONCLUSIONS: Dermatitis herpetiformis is not a rare disease in northern India as previously believed. The clinical, histological, and immunopathological characteristics of Indian DH patients are similar to those reported in Caucasian populations. The limitations of our study include an absence of genetic testing for HLA-DQ2 or DQ8, nonavailability of kits for detecting IgA specific for epidermal transglutaminase (IgA eTG), and short follow-up period.
32245180	Is a Gluten-Free Diet Enough to Maintain Correct Micronutrients Status in Young Patients with Celiac Disease?	The current study assesses whether the use of a gluten-free diet (GFD) is sufficient for maintaining correct iron status in children with celiac disease (CD). The study included 101 children. The celiac group (n = 68) included children with CD, with long (> 6 months) (n = 47) or recent (< 6 months) (n = 21) adherence to a GFD. The control group (n = 43) included healthy children. Dietary assessment was performed by a food frequency questionnaire and a 3-day food record. Celiac children had lower iron intake than controls, especially at the beginning of GFD (p < 0.01). The group CD-GFD >6 months showed a higher intake of cobalamin, meat derivatives and fish compared to that of CD-GFD <6 months (all, p < 0.05). The control group showed a higher consumption of folate, iron, magnesium, selenium and meat derivatives than that of children CD-GFD >6 months (all, p < 0.05). Control children also showed a higher consumption of folate and iron compared to that of children CD-GFD <6 months (both, p < 0.05). The diet of celiac children was nutritionally less balanced than that of the control. Participation of dietitians is necessary in the management of CD to guide the GFD as well as assess the inclusion of iron supplementation and other micronutrients that may be deficient.
38613127	Efficacy of a Low-FODMAP Diet for Coeliac Patients with Persistent IBS-like Symptoms despite a Gluten-Free Diet: A Systematic Review.	Background: Persistent symptoms in coeliac disease (CD) can be due to not only poor gluten-free diet (GFD) adherence and complications of CD, but also functional gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Although the role of a low fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) diet is well-established in IBS, little data are available on its role in coeliac patients with persistent IBS-like symptoms despite a GFD. Methods: We systematically reviewed the literature in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines for studies evaluating the role of FODMAPs and/or a low-FODMAP diet in coeliac patients with persistent symptoms. PubMed and Embase were searched from inception to 16 January 2024 for eligible full-text papers. The study protocol was registered on Open Science Framework. Results: A total of 239 records were identified, and six papers were included. Of these, four were interventional studies comparing a low-FODMAP GFD to a regular GFD for persistent symptoms in 115 total coeliac patients (two randomized controlled trials and two open-label studies). A low-FODMAP GFD for a minimum of 4 weeks was significantly more effective than a regular GFD in reducing symptoms (p < 0.05 in 3/4 studies). Dietary FODMAP content of a conventional GFD was significantly lower than that of non-coeliac patients on a gluten-containing diet (both p < 0.05), especially regarding high-FODMAP grain products. However, coeliac patients consumed more servings of fruits/vegetables high in FODMAP. No relationship between FODMAP intake and persistence of symptoms was reported. Conclusions: A low-FODMAP diet may be beneficial for uncomplicated celiac patients with persistent IBS-like symptoms despite strict adherence to a GFD.
30726852	Pigment Epithelium-Derived Factor Affects Angiogenesis in Celiac Disease.	OBJECTIVE: Recent studies have demonstrated that angiogenesis is impaired in patients with celiac disease (CD). In this study, we evaluated the levels of the novel antiangiogenic factor pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) in CD patients. METHODS: Eighty-four patients were included in the study; 71 patients with CD and 13 healthy controls. In the CD patient cohort, there were 21 newly diagnosed patients, 19 with adherence to a gluten-free diet and 31 practicing no adherence to this diet. The PEDF levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. RESULTS: The data revealed that celiac patients had higher levels of PEDF than did healthy controls. PEDF levels were not significantly different among the three CD groups. Additionally, the PEDF levels were not correlated with tissue transglutaminase IgA or IgG. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that PEDF levels are significantly higher in CD patients than those in the healthy controls. This result suggests that PEDF negatively affects angiogenesis in CD. Although we did not observe any differences of PEDF levels among celiac patients, additional studies including more patients could clarify this issue.
30872088	Sequence of acquisition of self-management skills to follow a gluten-free diet by adults with celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) treatment is lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD), requiring mastery of numerous skills to maintain health. AIMS: To assess the rate of self-management skill acquisition following diagnosis, and the influence of demographic factors on this rate. METHODS: Patients attending a celiac center were invited to complete an anonymous survey which reported demographic information and time for mastery of self-management skills relevant to CD. RESULTS: Completed surveys were returned by 137 patients (79% female). Most participants reported mastering skills that involved identifying gluten-containing versus gluten-free foods within 6 months. Explaining CD and GFD to others required 1-2 years. Identifying gluten in medications and supplements required 3-5 years. Traveling internationally with GFD adherence required more than five years to learn. Demographic factors were not associated with the rate of acquisition. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first description of a timeline for relevant skill acquisition following diagnosis for CD. A sequence emerges, with most patients learning skills relevant to home, then social settings, then the workplace, and, finally, unfamiliar settings. Awareness of this progression of mastery, and particular recognition of difficult skills will allow physicians and dietitians to provide CD patients with targeted education and resources to facilitate adherence.
32316028	Immune profiling of breast milk from mothers with treated celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: The protective effect of breastfeeding on celiac disease (CD) onset is controversial. We studied a wide range of milk components in milk produced by celiac mothers following long-term gluten-free diet (GFD) in comparison to milk produced by healthy mothers. METHODS: Breast-milk samples from celiac (n = 33) and healthy (n = 41) mothers were obtained during the first year of lactation. A panel of bioactive components was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the aqueous fraction. We studied molecules involved in defenses, immunoregulation, and strengthening of the gut-epithelial barrier. RESULTS: During late lactation (from 6 to 12 months after delivery), the content of total immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgM was significantly lower in the milk produced by celiac patients. Nevertheless, gliadin (GFD)-specific IgA relative contribution was higher in this group, in contrast to tetanus toxoid-specific antibodies. The balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory molecules was different. While interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 were most frequently found in samples from celiac mothers, soluble Toll-like receptor-2 prevalence was lower. CONCLUSIONS: We describe differences between the innate and adaptive immune profile of milk produced by celiac and healthy mothers. These results might explain previous controversial reports about breastfeeding and CD protection. IMPACT: In spite of a long-term adherence to GFD, the milk produced by mothers with CD exhibit a different immune profile, in relation with some immunoregulatory factors and antibody content. This work shows a more comprehensive characterization of milk from celiac mothers, including macronutrients, lysozymes, growth factors, and immunoregulatory components that had not been studied before. The present study widens the available data regarding the characteristics of human milk of celiac mothers following GFD. Further follow-up studies of the health of children who were breastfed by celiac mothers will be necessary in order to also estimate the impact of the present results therein.
29478494	Safety of Oats in Children with Celiac Disease: A Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term validity and safety of pure oats in the treatment of children with celiac disease. STUDY DESIGN: This noninferiority clinical trial used a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design extended over 15 months. Three hundred six children with a biopsy-proven diagnosis of celiac disease on a gluten-free diet for >=2 years were randomly assigned to eat specifically prepared gluten-free food containing an age-dependent amount (15-40 g) of either placebo or purified nonreactive varieties of oats for 2 consecutive 6-month periods separated by washout standard gluten-free diet for 3 months. Clinical (body mass index, Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale score), serologic (IgA antitransglutaminase antibodies, and IgA anti-avenin antibodies), and intestinal permeability data were measured at baseline, and after 6, 9, and 15 months. Direct treatment effect was evaluated by a nonparametric approach using medians (95% CI) as summary statistic. RESULTS: After the exclusion of 129 patients who dropped out, the cohort included 177 children (79 in the oats-placebo and 98 in the placebo-oats group; median, 0.004; 95% CI, -0.0002 to 0.0089). Direct treatment effect was not statistically significant for clinical, serologic, and intestinal permeability variables (body mass index: median, -0.5; 95% CI, -0.12 to 0.00; Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale score: median, 0; 95% CI, -2.5 to 0.00; IgA antitransglutaminase antibodies: median, -0.02; 95% CI, -0.25 to 0.23; IgA anti-avenin antibodies: median, -0.0002; 95% CI, -0.0007 to 0.0003; intestinal permeability test: median, 0.004; 95% CI, -0.0002 to 0.0089). CONCLUSIONS: Pure nonreactive oat products are a safe dietary choice in the treatment of children with celiac disease. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00808301.
31594655	Pseudo-obstruction, enteric dysmotility and irritable bowel syndrome.	New diagnostic techniques have advanced our knowledge about the irritable bowel syndrome. The majority of patients that we believed to have a psychosomatic disorder have received other diagnoses explaining their symptoms. Endoscopy makes it possible to diagnose celiac disease before it leads to malnutrition and allows the detection of microscopic colitis as a cause of watery diarrhea. At the severe end of the symptom spectrum enteric dysmotility marks the border at which IBS ceases to be a functional disorder and becomes a genuine motility disorder. Joint hypermobility or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is present in a substantial proportion of patients with enteric dysmotility. Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction is the end-stage of a large number of very rare disorders in which failed peristalsis is the common denominator. Nutritional needs and symptom control are essential in the management of pseudo-obstruction. Home parenteral nutrition is life saving in more than half of patients with chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction.
30978358	Progression of Celiac Disease in Children With Antibodies Against Tissue Transglutaminase and Normal Duodenal Architecture.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Potential celiac disease is characterized by positive results from serologic tests for tissue transglutaminase antibodies (anti-TG2) but normal duodenal architecture (Marsh stages 0-1). There is controversy over the best way to manage these patients. We investigated risk factors associated with the development of villous atrophy in children with potential celiac disease. METHODS: We performed a prospective study of 280 children (ages 2-18 years) in Italy with suspected celiac disease, followed for up to 12 years (range, 18-150 months; median 60 months). The subjects had 2 consecutive positive results from tests for anti-TG2, tested positive for the endomysial antibody (anti-EMA), had total serum levels of immunoglobulin A in the normal range, normal duodenal architecture (Marsh stages 0-1) in 5 biopsies, and HLA DQ2- or DQ8-positive haplotypes. The children underwent serologic tests and clinical analyses every 6 months and a small bowel biopsy was taken every 2 years. A total of 210 patients of the original cohort were assessed at the 9-year follow-up evaluation. We performed multivariate analyses of clinical, genetic, and histologic data to identify factors associated with progression to villous atrophy. RESULTS: During the follow-up period, 42 (15%) of 280 children developed villous atrophy, whereas 89 (32%) children no longer tested positive for anti-TG2 or anti-EMA. The cumulative incidence of progression to villous atrophy was 43% at 12 years. In multivariate analysis, the baseline factors most strongly associated with development of villous atrophy were numbers of gammadelta intraepithelial lymphocyte cells followed by age and homozygosity for the HLA DQB1*02. In discriminant analysis, these baseline factors identified 80% of the children who developed baseline atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: In a long-term study of 280 children with suspected celiac disease (based on anti-TG2 and anti-EMA) on gluten-containing diets, the cumulative incidence of progression to villous atrophy was 43% over a 12-year period. We identified factors that can be used to identify children at highest risk for villous atrophy. This approach might be used to determine whether children with suspected celiac disease should immediately start a gluten-free diet or be monitored on their regular diet.
31952431	Suppressive Mechanisms Induced by Tregs in Celiac Disease	Celiac disease (CD) is a systemic immune-mediated disorder caused by the dietary gluten in individuals who are genetically susceptible to the disease. In fact, CD is a T cell-mediated immune disease in which gluten-derived peptides activate the lamina propria CD4+ Teff cells, and these T-cell subsets can cause the intestinal tissue damages. Also, there are additional subsets of CD4+ T cells with suppressor functions. These subsets express the master transcription factor, FOXP3, and include Tr1 cells and CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), which are the main population involved in maintaining the peripheral tolerance, preventing the autoimmune diseases and limiting the chronic inflammatory diseases such as CD. The suppressive function of Tregs is important to maintain the immune homeostasis. This paper examined the features and the basic mechanisms used by Tregs to mediate the suppression in CD.
29672438	Alterations of Inflammatory and Matrix Production Indices in Celiac Disease With Low Bone Mass on Long-term Gluten-free Diet.	BACKGROUND: A clinically meaningful impairment of bone mass secondary to malabsorption is frequent in untreated celiac disease. In adult patients, a rigorous gluten-free diet (GFD) significantly improves, but does not always normalize, bone mineral density (BMD). The reason for this marginal response is unclear. Accordingly, we evaluated the role of both local and systemic factors for bone loss in celiac patients on long-term GFD. STUDY: In a prospective cohort, 22 patients with low lumbar and/or femoral BMD and 22 with normal BMD underwent bone and mineral metabolism evaluation: we tested calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D; telopeptide of type I collagen, a bone resorption index; propeptide of type I procollagen, a bone neoformation index; receptor antagonist of NF-kB ligand, an osteoclast-stimulating factor; osteoprotegerin (OPG), a decoy receptor for RANKL. Sunlight exposure and physical exercise were measured. RESULTS: Patients with bone loss showed prevalently osteopenia, severe osteoporosis was rare. In comparison with normal BMD patients, they showed higher serum OPG, telopeptide, and lower serum propeptide, suggesting an increased bone turnover. Lumbar T-score was negatively correlated with OPG, telopeptide and RANKL and positively with propeptide. Propeptide was negatively correlated with OPG and telopeptide. OPG was positively correlated with telopeptide. CONCLUSIONS: The persistent activation of inflammation should be considered the main pathophysiological mechanism for bone defect in celiac disease patients with bone loss on long-term GFD. High levels of OPG, an attempt at protective mechanism, and low levels of propeptide of type I procollagen, reflecting an insufficient matrix production, characterize this subgroup of patients.
36380606	Anemia in Celiac Disease: Multiple Aspects of the Same Coin.	Extraintestinal manifestations of celiac disease (CD) are an integral part of the disease's clinical profile and, frequently, appear as the presenting feature. Given that anemia in CD may be multifactorial, increased awareness is needed on the part of treating physicians, and especially hematologists, to screen for CD. In this study, we highlight anemia as the presenting feature of CD which has remained undiagnosed for several years. In patients with a positive antibody testing or high suspicion of CD, endoscopy with a biopsy of the small intestine is performed, as it is considered the "gold standard" for diagnosing CD. Since most of the manifestations of CD are preventable or treatable with a gluten-free diet, an early diagnosis is vital for the prevention of serious and potentially lethal complications.
31127932	Mendelian randomization analysis of celiac GWAS reveals a blood expression signature with diagnostic potential in absence of gluten consumption.	Celiac disease (CeD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy with a strong genetic component where the main environmental trigger is dietary gluten, and currently a correct diagnosis of the disease is impossible if gluten-free diet (GFD) has already been started. We hypothesized that merging different levels of genomic information through Mendelian randomization (MR) could help discover genetic biomarkers useful for CeD diagnosis. MR was performed using public databases of expression quantitative trait loci (QTL) and methylation QTL as exposures and the largest CeD genome-wide association study conducted to date as the outcome, in order to identify potential causal genes. As a result, we identified UBE2L3, an ubiquitin ligase located in a CeD-associated region. We interrogated the expression of UBE2L3 in an independent data set of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and found that its expression is altered in CeD patients on GFD when compared to non-celiac controls. The relative expression of UBE2L3 isoforms predicts CeD with 100% specificity and sensitivity and could be used as a diagnostic marker, especially in the absence of gluten consumption. This approach could be applicable to other diseases where diagnosis of asymptomatic patients can be complicated.
30282900	Social and Emotional Fears and Worries Influencing the Quality of Life of Female Celiac Disease Patients Following a Gluten-Free Diet.	The gluten-free diet is effective in the majority of celiac disease (CD) patients, but it is burdensome and may influence quality of life (QoL). The aim of the study was to analyze the social and emotional fears and worries influencing the QoL of female CD patients following a gluten-free (GF) diet, as well as to indicate the sociodemographic interfering factors. The study was conducted on a group of 251 female CD patients, while emotional, social and worries subscales of the Celiac Disease Questionnaire (CDQ) were applied, as well as purchase-related emotions and behaviors were assessed. Respondents declaring worse economic status obtained significantly lower scores in the emotional, social and worries subscales of the CDQ than respondents declaring better economic status, while for other factors (CD duration, GFD adherence, BMI, place of residence and educational level) no significant association was stated in the multi-factor analysis. Moreover, respondents declaring worse economic status more often declared that a bad mood affected their purchase decisions than did respondents declaring better economic status. It was stated, that the economic status of CD patient could be one of the most important factors influencing their social and emotional fears and worries. It may be supposed that low economic status may lead some CD patients to choose to relieve stress by purchasing GF products instead of other products.
32532079	Association Between Celiac Disease and Cancer.	Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic enteropathy that develops in genetically susceptible individuals after the ingestion of gluten. There has been a substantial increase in CD prevalence in the last 50 years, and it is now estimated that this disease affects approximately 1% of the population in the Western world. In the large majority of cases, CD is a benign disease, characterized by the complete resolution of symptoms and a normal life expectancy after the onset of a gluten-free diet (GFD). However, failure to adhere to a strict GFD bears the risk of adverse events and increases mortality. A considerable number of studies have considered the possible association between CD and neoplasms. In particular, an increased risk of malignancies, such as cancers of the gastrointestinal tract and intestinal lymphomas, has been reported. In this review, we summarize and discuss the current evidence on the possible association between CD and cancer.
32061547	Factors associated with non adherence to a gluten free diet in adult with celiac disease: A survey assessed by BIAGI score.	INTRODUCTION: The cornerstone of the recommended treatment for Celiac disease (CeD) is a lifelong strict gluten-free diet (GFD). We aimed to identify prospectively the demographic, clinical, social and psychological profile associated with non-adherence to a GFD in adult CeD patients in Israel. METHODS: An anonymous online questionnaire was sent via the Israeli Celiac association and through social networks. Only CeD patients>=18 years old were included. Socio-demographic, laboratory and clinical data as well as anxiety and depression scores were reported. Adherence to a GFD was assessed by a Biagi questionnaire. RESULTS: In total, 301 patients completed the questionnaire with a mean age of 37.5+-14.9 years, 79.2% female. The most common presenting symptoms were: anemia (59.7%), abdominal pain (50.8%) and diarrhea (42.8%). According to the Biagi score, 82% of patients were found to be high adherent to a GFD (Biagi 3-4) and 18% were low adherent to a GFD (Biagi-0-2). Univariate analysis revealed that low adherence was associated with: younger age at the time of diagnosis (P<0.001), longer duration of disease (P=0.011) non academic education (P=0.011), below average income (P=0.018), smoking (P<0.001) and no gastroenterology follow up (P=0.038). However, in multivariate analysis, only a young age at diagnosis and smoking were significantly associated with non-adherence to a GFD (OR 0.924, 3.48, P-value<0.001, 0.029, respectively). In further analysis, we identified that age 20 is the best cutoff value to discriminate between those with high adherence and those with low adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Young age, smoking, long disease duration, no academic education, low income and no gastroenterology follow-up were found to be associated with low adherence to GFD rate in a univariate analysis, however only the first two were found to be significant in the multivariate analysis. Additional intervention strategies might improve adherence and reduce future complications with a better quality of life.
32304557	Routine Screening for Celiac Disease in Children With Down Syndrome Improves Case Finding.	OBJECTIVES: Children with Down syndrome have an estimated 6-fold increased risk of developing celiac disease in the United States compared with the general population, yet the determination to screen for celiac disease in this population is not agreed upon. The objectives of this study are to assess the prevalence of celiac disease in children with Down syndrome in our center and compare features from this population identified clinically and through screening. METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review of 1317 children with Down syndrome who received treatment at a single institution from 2011 to 2017. All participants (n = 90; 53.3% boys) met inclusion criteria of celiac disease diagnosis between 1 month and 22 years of age and Down syndrome. Clinical details were collected, which included the results from celiac disease screening tests, reason for diagnosis and/or testing, symptoms, nutrition notes, demographics, comorbidities, and outcomes. RESULTS: Prevalence of celiac disease in our population of children with Down syndrome ages 3 years or older was 9.8%. Mean age at diagnosis was 9.24 years (SD = 4.98) with an average of 2.85 years (SD +- 3.52) lag from the onset of symptoms to diagnosis for children clinically identified in comparison with 1.69 years (SD +- 2.09) for children identified through routine screening. Eighty-two percentage of clinic patients received a diagnosis of celiac disease because of routine screening compared with clinical testing based on identified symptoms alone. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest the need for routine celiac disease screening in children with Down syndrome to improve case-finding and avoid diagnostic delay.
29915405	Wheat Intolerance and Chronic Gastrointestinal Symptoms in an Australian Population-based Study: Association Between Wheat Sensitivity, Celiac Disease and Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders.	OBJECTIVES: Wheat avoidance in the absence of celiac disease (CD) is common but occurrence of concurrent functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) in this group is uncertain. The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of self-reported wheat or gluten sensitivity and doctor diagnosed CD in an Australian population, define the associated gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and FGIDs, and determine the relationship between self-reported wheat sensitivity, demographic and medical factors. METHODS: A total of 3542 people randomly selected from the Australian population returned a mail survey which contained questions on wheat avoidance, GI symptoms, demographic, medical, and lifestyle factors. We defined self-reported wheat sensitivity as people who reported gastrointestinal symptoms on ingestion of wheat based foods, but did not suffer from celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease or colorectal cancer. Functional dyspepsia (FD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) were diagnosed by Rome III criteria. CD status was self-reported. RESULTS: The prevalence of self-reported wheat sensitivity in this cohort was 14.9% (95% CI 13.7-16.2). The prevalence of CD was 1.2% (95%CI 0.8-1.6). Doctor diagnosed CD was significantly associated with a diagnosis of FD (OR 3.35, 95%CI 1.72-6.52) and IBS (OR 2.28, 95%CI 1.08-4.81). Those with self-reported wheat sensitivity were more likely to report multiple abdominal symptoms (of the 18 assessed) than those without (3.9 symptoms with self-reported wheat sensitivity vs. 1.6 without, p = 0.0001). In a multivariate analysis, self-reported wheat sensitivity was independently associated with IBS (OR 3.55, 95%CI 2.71-4.65) and FD (1.48, 95%CI 1.13-1.94). CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported wheat sensitivity is common, with a prevalence of 14.9% in this cohort. There is a strong association between both celiac disease and self-reported wheat sensitivity, and chronic gastrointestinal symptoms, as well as a diagnosis of FD and IBS.
35276940	Lactose Malabsorption and Presumed Related Disorders: A Review of Current Evidence.	BACKGROUND: Lactose malabsorption (LM) is a frequent clinical problem associated with several digestive and extra-digestive diseases. The aim of this manuscript was to clarify the real clinical impact of LM on these disorders. METHODS: A literature search for digestive and extra-digestive disorders related to LM was carried out using PubMed, Medline and Cochrane. RESULTS: A transient lactase deficiency is present in celiac disease (CD) on a normal diet. The persistence of symptoms in CD on a gluten-free diet may be instead, in part, attributed to a primary LM. Similar circumstances are present in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), in which LM can be responsible for a part of persistent symptoms in IBD on clinical remission. LM and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are instead independent conditions. On the other hand, a lactose-restricted diet may be useful for some IBS patients. A reduced lactose intake can lead to low bone mass and limited risk of fragility fractures. Finally, the absorption of levothyroxine could be conditioned by LM. CONCLUSIONS: LM can be responsible for persistent symptoms in CD and IBD. The association with IBS seems to be casual. Bone mass and levothyroxine absorption can be affected by LM.
29691797	Designing a Score-Based Method for the Evaluation of the Nutritional Quality of the Gluten-Free Bakery Products and their Gluten-Containing Counterparts.	Gluten-free (GF) products are consumed both by individuals with celiac disease and by an increasing number of people with no specific medical needs. Although the technological quality of GF products has been recently improved, their nutritional quality is still scarcely addressed. Moreover, the few published studies report conflicting results, mostly because the information from product nutrition facts is the only considered factor. The aim of the present study was to develop a score-based method for the nutritional evaluation of 134 packaged Italian GF bakery products and to compare it with that of 162 matched gluten-containing (GC) food items. The score included the information from the nutrition facts and the presence/absence of some nutritionally relevant components in the ingredients list. Results indicated an overall low nutritional quality of the considered GF bakery products. Additionally, with the sole exception of GF bread substitutes, there was no difference in nutritional quality between GF and equivalent GC bakery products. Future research and development of GF bakery products may take advantage of this scoring method, as it may represent an easy approach to evaluate their nutritional quality. The present findings do not justify the consumption of packaged GF bakery products by people without any specific medical needs.

36297063	Celiac Disease and Gallbladder: Pathophysiological Aspects and Clinical Issues.	Background: Celiac Disease (CD) is an immune-mediated disorder which primarily affects the small intestine; however, extra-intestinal organs are often affected by the pathological process, too. As regards the digestive system, liver alterations in CD patients have been widely described, which can also extend to the biliary tract. Notably, gallbladder function can be altered in CD patients. In this review, we specifically analyze and summarize the main pathophysiological aspects and clinical evidence of gallbladder dysfunction in CD patients, in order to discuss the potential medical complications and clinical research gaps. In addition to some perturbations of bile composition, CD patients can develop gallbladder dysmotility, which mainly expresses with an impaired emptying during the digestive phase. The main pathophysiological determinant is a perturbation of cholecystokinin secretion by the specific duodenal enteroendocrine cells in response to the appropriate nutrient stimulation in CD patients. This situation appears to be reversible with a gluten-free diet in most cases. Despite this gallbladder impairment, CD patients do not seem to be more predisposed to gallbladder complications, such as calculous and acalculous cholecystitis. However, very few clinical studies have actively investigated these clinical aspects, which may not be completely evidenced so far; alternatively, the substantial improvements in the last two decades regarding CD diagnosis, which have reduced the diagnostic delay (and related dietary treatment), may have lessened the potential clinical consequences of CD-related gallbladder dysfunction. Specific clinical studies focused on these aspects are needed for a better understanding of the clinical implications of gallbladder alterations in CD patients.
34764035	Prevalence of medically unsupervised activated charcoal use a cause for concern in celiac disease?	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes an intolerance to gluten. Owing to hidden sources, lack of clear labeling, and cross-contamination, it is not uncommon for individuals with celiac disease to inadvertently ingest gluten. A strict gluten-free diet is the only treatment. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to identify the frequency of activated charcoal use in celiac disease as a purported remedy despite the lack of literature on the safety and efficacy of the practice and to elucidate the manner in which using activated charcoal as a treatment for acute gluten ingestion is being communicated. METHODS: Using a descriptive study design, a Web-based survey was sent to members of the celiac disease community via social media pages for voluntary participants 18 years and older diagnosed with celiac disease. Participants were stratified into 3 major groups: (1) those who had heard of using activated charcoal as a remedy to counteract gluten ingestion and used it, (2) those who had heard of using activated charcoal but had not used it, and (3) those who had not heard of using activated charcoal. RESULTS: In subjects with celiac disease, 424 of 1613 respondents (26%) had heard of using activated charcoal as a potential remedy for gluten ingestion, and 12% had used it. The top source of information regarding any general information including remedies for maladies related to celiac disease was social media networks 72.3% (879/1613). Of those who had used activated charcoal, 122 participants (61.3%) reported subjectively feeling a reduced severity of symptoms. CONCLUSION: Pharmacists should be aware of the off-label use of activated charcoal for accidental gluten ingestion in celiac disease. Pharmacists should educate patients with celiac disease that there is not sufficient evidence to support the use of activated charcoal.
29157049	Small for gestational age as an independent risk factor for long-term pediatric gastrointestinal morbidity of the offspring.	OBJECTIVE: The concept of neonatal programming has begun to emerge as an important component of adult health. Scarce data exist regarding perinatal risk factors for long-term gastrointestinal (GI) morbidity of the offspring. We aimed to evaluate the association between birthweight (BW) at term and long-term pediatric GI morbidity. STUDY DESIGN: A population-based cohort analysis was performed, comparing the risk of long-term GI morbidity (up to the age of 18 years) in children delivered at term according to their BW. The study included all term deliveries occurring between 1991 and 2014 at a single regional tertiary medical center. Multiple gestations and fetuses with congenital malformations were excluded. BW was subdivided into: small for gestational age (small for gestational age (SGA) - BW <= 5th centile), appropriate for gestational age (AGA -5th centile < BW < 95th centile), and large for gestational age (LGA - BW >=95th centile). Hospitalizations up to the age of 18 years involving GI morbidity were evaluated, using a predefined set of ICD-9 codes, as recorded in the hospital files. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was used to compare cumulative GI morbidity incidence. A Cox proportional hazards model was constructed to control for confounders. RESULTS: During the study period, 225,600 term singleton deliveries met the inclusion criteria. Of them, 4.6% (n = 10,415) were SGA and 4.3% (n = 9796) were LGA. During the 18-years follow-up period, 11,791 (5.2%) children were hospitalized with GI morbidity. Hospitalizations were significantly more common in the SGA group, as compared with the AGA and LGA groups (6.6 versus 5.2 versus 4.5%, respectively, p < .001) Specifically, inflammatory bowel disease, celiac, hernia, hepatitis, and cholecystitis, were more common in the SGA group. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve demonstrated a significantly higher cumulative incidence of gastrointestinal morbidity in the SGA group (log rank p < .001). In the Cox proportional hazards model, controlled for relevant clinical confounders, SGA BW was found to be an independent risk factor for long-term GI morbidity (adjusted HR = 1.23, 95%CI 1.14-1.33, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: SGA offspring are at an increased and independent risk for long-term pediatric GI morbidity.
38578113	Microbiological quality of gluten-free meals, naturally gluten free foods, and gluten free-labelled products.	Background: The rising prevalence of gluten-related disorders such as celiac disease explains the increased consumption of gluten-free foods (GFF). However, these foods must be safe in terms of both gluten content and contamination by pathogenic microorganisms in order to avoid food poisoning. Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the microbiological quality of gluten-free meals, naturally gluten free foods, and gluten free-labelled products. Material and Methods: We collected 62 GFF samples including 20 meals (M-GF), 22 naturally gluten free (N-GFF) and 20 labelled (L-GFF) products, which were investigated for microbiological contamination according to Moroccan regulations guidelines, issued by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The analysis consisted of the detection of Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes in each sample, and the quantification of the microbial load of the following six micro-organisms: total aerobic mesophilic flora, total coliforms, fecal coliforms, Staphylococcus aureus, Sulphite-Reducing Anaerobic, and yeasts and molds. Results: A total of 372 analyses were carried out, showing a microbiological contamination rate of 5.1%. This contamination concerned N-GFF in 8.3% (predominantly with yeasts and molds), and meals prepared at home in 11.7 (predominantly with Staphylococcus aureus and coliforms). Only one case (0.8%) of contamination was observed in products labelled gluten-free and no contamination was noticed in meals prepared in food services. Listeria monocytgenes and Salmonella were not detected in any samples of food analyzed. These results indicate a good compliance of L-GFP and M-GF prepared in food services, while unsatisfactory quality was observed in N-GFF and M-GF prepared at home. Conclusion: Therefore, rigorous hygienic practices and adequate corrective measures should be considered by celiac patients, especially regarding the N-GFF and M-GF prepared at home.
31970917	Circulating Dendritic Cells from Celiac Disease Patients Display a Gut-Homing Profile and are Differentially Modulated by Different Gliadin-Derived Peptides.	SCOPE: Circulating dendritic cell (DC) and monocyte subsets contribute to the pool of intestinal DC and macrophages in celiac disease (CeD), an autoimmune gut disorder triggered by dietary gluten. Here, this study aims to characterize these circulating subsets in CeD and assess the effect of different gliadin-derived peptides on conventional DC (cDC). METHODS AND RESULTS: Flow cytometry profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells reveals a slight decrease in the proportion of plasmacytoid and type 1 cDC in gluten-free diet (GFD)-treated CeD patients. In comparison to healthy donors, DC and monocyte subsets from active and GFD-treated CeD patients display an increased gut-homing profile. Type 2 cDC (cDC2) are sorted and stimulated with the gliadin-derived peptides 8-mer, 19-mer, and 33-mer. All peptides induce cDC2 maturation, although the profile is different. While peptide 8-mer induces a Th1/Th17 pro-inflammatory cytokine profile in active CeD patients, cDC2 primed with peptide 33-mer displays a higher capacity to promote gut-homing CCR9+ expression onto autologous T-cells. CONCLUSION: Distinct gliadin-derived peptides elicit different effects on cDC2 phenotype and function. This effect is compatible with a model where diverse gliadin peptides may cooperate to promote full cDC2 activation and the subsequent T-cell response in genetically predisposed individuals.
29253321	Role of capsule endoscopy in alarm features and non-responsive celiac disease: A European multicenter study.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: The role of capsule endoscopy (CE) in established celiac disease (CD) remains unclear. Our objective was to analyze the usefulness of CE in the suspicion of complicated CD. METHODS: This was a retrospective multicenter study. One hundred and eighty-nine celiac patients (mean age: 46.6 +- 16.6, 30.2% males) who underwent CE for alarm symptoms (n = 86, 45.5%) or non-responsive CD (n = 103, 54.5%) were included. Diagnostic yield (DY), therapeutic impact and safety were analyzed. RESULTS: Capsule endoscopy was completed in 95.2% of patients (small bowel transit time: 270.5 +- 100.2 min). Global DY was 67.2%, detecting atrophic mucosa (n = 92, 48.7%), ulcerative jejunoileitis (n = 21, 11.1%), intestinal lymphoma (n = 7, 3.7%) and other enteropathies (n = 7, 3.7%, six Crohn's disease cases and one neuroendocrine tumor). The DY of CE was significantly higher in patients presenting with non-responsive disease compared to patients with alarm symptoms (73.8% vs 59.3%, P = 0.035). The new findings of the CE modified management in 59.3% of the cases. There were no major complications. CONCLUSION: Capsule endoscopy may be a moderately helpful and safe diagnostic tool in the suspicion of complicated CD, modifying the clinical course of these patients.
34895120	Advanced Protein Drugs and Formulations.	Previously, the application of proteins was uncommon as therapeutically active molecules. Some of the first applications of proteins as drugs have been insulin and vaccines for overcoming a physiological deficiency and the prevention of diseases, respectively. Nowadays, proteins have many applications, not only as drugs but also as drug delivery systems to be administered by different routes. Due to their nature, the behavior of proteins varies while the conditions of the environment are modified. For this reason, it is necessary to study their behavior for predicting the correct manufacturing, storing, or combination with other possible molecules in a formulation or into the body. The application of techniques for predicting the behavior of proteins in different environments has led to associating this type of behavior into the body with the occurrence of diseases, such as celiac disease or Alzheimer's disease. Thus, this work shows an overview of the main types of proteins applied as active therapeutically molecules, proteins-based drug delivery systems, and techniques for predicting their stability into the primary storing container and the body.

37806803	Factors associated to influenza vaccination among hospital's healthcare workers in the Autonomous Community of Madrid, Spain 2021-2022.	Influenza vaccination (IV) aims primarily to protect high-risk groups against severe influenza-associated disease and death. It is recommended in Spain for high-risk groups, including Healthcare workers (HCWs). However, vaccination uptake has been consistently below desirable levels. The objective of this study were to evaluate influenza vaccination coverage using data from the regional vaccination registry, during 2021-2022 season, among HCWs in public hospitals in Autonomous Community of Madrid (CAM) and to explore factors associated with influenza vaccination. We conducted a cross-sectional study using administrative data retrieved from the Regional Department of Health data repositories. A multilevel logistic regression model was designed to estimate Level 1 (individual) and Level 2 (contextual) variables that are associated with HCWs vaccination. The study population was HCWs from 25 public hospitals in CAM who were active during the period of the influenza 2021-2022 vaccination campaign. The global influenza vaccination coverage (IVC) was 52.1 %. All study Level 1 variables were significantly associated with vaccine uptake. Greater IVC is associated with individual characteristics: female (OR1.14; 95 %CI 1.09-1.19), older age 59-69 years old (OR1.72; 95 %CI 1.60-1.84), born in Spain, medical staff, more than one high-risk condition (OR1.24; 95 %CI 1.10-1.40; respectively) and vaccinated in two previous campaigns (OR25.64; 95 %CI 24.27-27.09). IVC was highest among HCWs celiac disease (65.5 %) followed by diabetes mellitus (65.1 %) and chronic inflammatory disease (64.3 %). The hospital where the study subject worked also showed an effect on the vaccination uptake, although Level 2 variable (hospital complexity) was not positively associated. IVC in HCWs remains suboptimal. These findings may prove useful to tailor strategies to reach specific groups. It is recommended to delve into the identification of factors associated with the HCWs workplace that may have a positive impact on IV.
31394930	Should we worry about the eyes of celiac patients?	PURPOSE: In this article, we evaluate subfoveal choroidal thickness in celiac patients with respect to adherence to the gluten-free diet and nonadherence to the gluten-free diet, comparing with age and sex matched healthy controls using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case-control study among 42 celiac patients and 42 healthy participants was conducted in the Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology. Celiac patients of our policlinics compliant with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography examination enrolled in the study. Celiac patients had been asked verbally about their adherence to gluten-free diet, were evaluated according to negative or positive EmA and anti-TG2 for defining adherence, and were divided into two groups (adherence to gluten-free diet and nonadherence to gluten-free diet). RESULTS: Subfoveal choroidal thickness was thinner in EmA (+) or anti-TG2 (+) eyes than EmA(-) or anti-TG2 (-) eyes in celiac patients, but it was not statistically significant. The mean subfoveal choroidal thickness values in eyes with celiac disease, whose diagnosis time was longer than 60 months, were thinner than shorter group. Longer duration of gluten-free diet was associated with adherence difficulty and thinner choroidal thickness (r = -0.15, p = 0.34). Adherence to gluten-free diet was 88.2% for children below the age of 60 months and 57.1% for children older than 60 months. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, in addition to other extraintestinal manifestations of celiac disease, diagnosis time longer than 60 months in pediatric celiac patients, nonadherence to the gluten-free diet, and antibody positivity should be focused on during ophthalmologic examination and choroid measurement.
29795662	Identification of peculiar gene expression profile in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of celiac patients on gluten free diet.	Celiac disease (CD) is a systemic disorder characterized by an immune-mediated reaction to gluten and a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. Currently, the main treatment of CD is represented by adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) which determines the resolution of symptoms, and the normalization of the serology and of the duodenal villous atrophy. In the present study, we aimed to identify changes in gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of celiac patients on GFD for at least 2 years, in order to identify novel disease biomarkers and candidate targets for putative therapeutic approaches. Microarray analysis was performed on PBMCs from 17 celiac patients on long-term GFD and 20 healthy controls. We identified 517 annotated genes that were significantly modulated between celiac patients and controls. Significant biological pathways were functionally clustered using the Core Function of Ingenuity System Pathway Analysis (IPA). Intriguingly, despite being on a GFD, celiac patients exhibited a peculiar PBMC profile characterized by an aberrant expression of genes involved in the regulation of immunity, inflammatory response, metabolism, and cell proliferation. Random forest algorithm was then used to validate the prediction ability of core genes as classifiers of the "celiac status". In conclusion, our study identified a characteristic PBMCs signature profile in clinically asymptomatic celiac patient.
30525325	Consumption of different types of bakery products and its effect on visceral fat area in healthy population	Background: Bread is one of the world's most consumed food commodity. However, in the last years consumption of breadand bakery products has declined, especially in the Western population. The reason for concern is the weight gain and presence of gluten in these products. Gluten is unacceptable in the diet only in patients with celiac disease who are forced adhere the gluten-free diet all the time. The consequences of gluten-free diet in healthy people are the subject of many recent studies. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes of visceral fat area in the general population after 6 weeks of consumption of gluten-free, gluten-containing and whole-grain bread and other bakery products. Material and Methods: The study group consisted of 120 volunteers divided into four subgroups each with 30 subjects. Anthropometric measurements were made using the InBody 720 (Biospace Co. Ltd., Seoul, Republic of Korea). We used the Lookin'Body 3.0 software to process the results. The collected data from anthropometric measurements were evaluated statistically and graphically in Microsoft Office Excel 2010 (Los Angeles, CA, USA). Results: After the intervention we found out that visceral fat area values increased in probands consuming gluten-free and gluten-containing bakery products, but these changes were not significant (P>0.05; 72.7+-29.18 cm2 vs 73.26+-30.32 cm2 and 69.6+-34.06 cm2 vs 70.34+-32.33 cm2, respectively). In whole-grain and control group we observed a reduction in visceral fat area, in the control group there was a significant change (P>0.05 - 91.58+-33 cm2 vs 90.47+-34.37 cm2 and P<0.05 - 77.3+-21.65 cm2 vs 75.56+-21.87 cm2, respectively). After the intervention the visceral fat area values increased in gluten-free group in 57% of subjects, in gluten group in 73% of subjects and in the whole-grain group in 43% of volunteers. Although visceral fat area values had inceased in gluten-free and gluten-containing groups, the number of probands with reference values increased from 80% to 86% in the gluten-free group and from 43% to 66% in the gluten-containing group. In the whole-grain group we found decrease in number of subjects with reference values of visceral fat area (from 70% to 63%). There were no changes in the control group (86% vs. 86%). Conclusions: Consumption of different types of bakery products has mostly changed the visceral fat area values in a positive direction.
32418545	Comparison of diet quality between celiac patients and non-celiac people in East Azerbaijan-Iran.	BACKGROUND: Considering the lifelong dietary restriction in celiac patients, it is important to assess the diet quality in these patients. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the diet quality in adult celiac patients and compare it with that of the non-celiac people. METHODS: In the present cross-sectional study, 130 celiac patients were selected from the celiac disease (CD) registry database of East Azerbaijan province, Iran. Non-celiac people (n = 464) was selected from the major lifestyle promotion project conducted in the East Azerbaijan district. The dietary intake data was obtained by an 80-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Diet quality was assessed using the healthy eating index-2015 (HEI-2015). RESULTS: The mean total HEI score was significantly higher in the celiac group compared with the non-celiac people (P < 0.001) and 68.5% of non-celiac people and 17.4% of celiac patients had poor diet quality. After adjusting for confounding factors, the mean score of total HEI in adherents to gluten-free diet (GFD) was significantly higher compared with non-adherents (P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Although the mean total HEI score was higher in celiac patients compared with the non-celiac people, about 17.5% of patients had poor diet quality and the scores of whole grains and dairy products group were very low in our population. Accordingly, it seems that educational programs should be held for the celiac patients and non-celiac people to increase their nutritional literacy and enable them to select healthy gluten-free alternatives.
33513886	Prevalence of Wheat/Gluten-Related Disorders and Gluten-Free Diet in Paraguay: An Online Survey-Based Study.	Gluten-related disorders (GRDs) are increasing around the world, but their magnitude and relevance remain unknown in most Latin American countries. Thus, an online survey was conducted to estimate the prevalence of GRDs as well as adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) in Paraguayan adult population. There were 1058 individuals surveyed using a validated questionnaire (response rate of 93.9%). The self-reported prevalence rates were as follows (95% CI): gluten sensitivity (GS), 10.30% (8.53-12.29); non-celiac GS (NCGS), 5.19% (3.94-6.71); physician-diagnosed celiac disease (PD-CD), 3.11% (2.15-4.35); wheat allergy (WA), 2.07% (1.30-3.13); and adherence to GFD, 15.69% (13.55-18.02). Excluding CD, more women than men met the criteria for GRDs, adverse food reactions, and GFD (p < 0.05). Eight respondents reported the coexistence of NCGS with PD-CD and/or WA. Most cases on a GFD indicated medical/dietitian advice for following the diet (68.07%). Non-self-reported GS individuals indicated weight control (46.4%) and the notion that the GFD is healthier (20.2%) as the main motivations for following the diet. GRDs are not uncommon in Paraguayan adult population. It seems that there is awareness about GRDs and the GFD, but training about the diagnosis of GRDs is desirable because of the informed overlapping diagnoses of CD or WA with NCGS. Future studies involving face-to-face interviews are necessary.
29704914	Celiac disease and non-celiac gluten or wheat sensitivity and health in later life: A review.	Celiac disease (CD) and non-gluten (or wheat) sensitivity (NCGS) are two gluten-related disorders, the treatment of which relies on dietary withdrawal of gluten (absolute and lifelong in the case of CD patients). However, these conditions differ in their pathophysiology and impact on health. CD is an autoimmune disorder of the intestine, and is associated with a wide range of disorders, pre- and post-diagnosis. Its autoimmune and inflammatory nature raises concerns about its potential effects on mortality and morbidity. Here we review the data on the health impact CD or NCGS may have prospectively, and report on the role of a gluten-free diet (GFD) in this respect. Since study designs have been heterogeneous, we focus on studies of treated patients with a biopsy-proven diagnosis of CD, to eliminate possible bias from misdiagnosis. The review revealed a moderately increased mortality risk among CD patients, mainly attributed to cardiovascular disease and malignancy. Other long-term morbidities of CD include autoimmune disorders, nutritional deficiencies, impaired bone health, reproductive abnormalities, and neurologic and neuropsychiatric disorders, which are substantially improved, and some of them even completely treated, after strict adherence to a GFD. For NCGS, the literature is too limited and its long-term complications are unknown.
37721353	Efficacy of a gluten-free diet in reducing the widespread pain index and symptom severity scale in patients affected by fibromyalgia.	OBJECTIVE: Dietary interventions to improve fibromyalgia (FM) symptoms reported conflicting results. This study aimed to treat FM patients with a gluten-free diet (GFD), alternated with a non-restricted gluten-containing diet, followed by a rechallenge of the GFD. METHODS: Twenty postmenopausal women with FM and no history of celiac disease participated. A GFD was assigned for 6 months. This was followed by 3 months of a non-restricted gluten-containing diet and then a new GFD for another 6 months. At each visit, the widespread pain index (WPI) and the symptom severity scale (SS) scores were evaluated. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients enrolled was 53.9+-10 years. None of the patients had a diagnosis of irritable bowel disease, although they reported vague gastrointestinal symptoms. After 6 months of a GFD, a statistically significant reduction was observed for the WPI (10.3+-1.8 vs 7.7+-1.4; p<0.0001) and the SS scale (6.4+-1.8 vs 4.15+-1.6; p=0.0002). The D percentage reduction of the WPI after 6 months of GFD was -24%+-9%, while for the SS scale, it was -36%+-21%. The following reintroduction of a gluten-containing diet brought about a statistically significant rise in the absolute SS scale and WPI, as well as a D modification of the WPI (21%+-13%) and of the SS scale (74%+-90%). The rechallenge of the GFD showed a significant improvement in absolute and D WPI (-24%+-7%) and SS (-36%+-11%). No modifications to the body mass index were found. CONCLUSIONS: A GFD improved FM symptoms evaluated with WPI and SS. This was confirmed for the first time, also with a rechallenge of the GFD that followed a non-restricted gluten-containing diet.
33224137	Bacterial-Based Strategies to Hydrolyze Gluten Peptides and Protect Intestinal Mucosa.	Gluten is a mixture of proteins highly resistant to hydrolysis, resulting in the emergence of toxic peptides responsible for gluten-related disorders. Currently, a gluten-free diet (GFD) is the unique proven therapy for celiac disease (CD). Several research groups and pharmaceutical companies are developing new nondietetic therapeutic strategies for CD. Probiotics are viable microorganisms thought to have a healthy effect on the host. The proteolytic mechanism of lactic acid bacteria comprises an extracellular serine protease, di- and oligopeptide-specific transport systems, and several intracellular peptidases that might affect gluten degradation. Therefore, probiotic supplementation is an attractive therapy because of its possible anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Several studies have been performed to assess the effectiveness of various specific probiotic strains, showing positive effects on immune-modulation (inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha) restoring gut microbiota and decrease of immunogenic peptides. The present review aims to summarize the current knowledge on the ability of probiotic strain (single or mixtures) to digest gliadin peptides in vitro and to modulate the inflammatory response in the gut.

35458242	What about TSH and Anti-Thyroid Antibodies in Patients with Autoimmune Thyroiditis and Celiac Disease Using a Gluten-Free Diet? A Systematic Review.	The prevalence of celiac disease (CD) in patients with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (CAIT) is estimated to be between 2 and 7.8%. A gluten-free diet (GFD) in patients with CD is suggested to have a beneficial effect on CAIT. Thus, the present systematic review was undertaken to achieve more robust evidence about the change in thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroid-specific antibodies (T-Ab) levels obtained in CD patients following a GFD. A specific search strategy was planned. The last search was performed on March 2022. The following data were mainly searched for in order to be extracted: sample size, mean and/or median with standard deviation (SD), and error (SE), individually, of thyroid hormones and T-Ab at baseline and after GFD, and the duration of the study. The initial search retrieved 297 records and 6 articles met the inclusion criteria. In total, 50 patients with both CD and CAIT and 45 controls were reported. The effects of a GFD on the thyroid hormonal and immunological profile could be extracted only in a part of the studies. Two studies were case reports. A low risk of bias was observed. These findings advise further studies, ideally randomized, in order to better investigate the potential relationship between GFD and thyroid homeostasis. The level of evidence is not still sufficient to recommend GFD to patients with CAIT.
33118261	Celiac disease in children with type 1 diabetes varies around the world: An international, cross-sectional study of 57 375 patients from the SWEET registry.	BACKGROUND: Children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are at much higher risk of developing celiac disease (CD) than the general population. The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence and differences in clinical presentation of CD in T1D in different regions of the world. METHODS: This study is based on the Better control in Pediatric and Adolescent diabeteS: Working to crEate cEnTers of Reference (SWEET) database. There were 57 375 patients included in the study, aged <=18 years from 54 SWEET centers. Only centers with screening for celiac disease were included. Regression models adjusted for age, diabetes duration, and gender and a fixed effect in the models for region was used. Diabetes duration, age at diabetes onset, and sex were presented as unadjusted results. RESULTS: CD was present in 2652 subjects (4.5%), with different prevalence among regions: from 1.9% in Asia/Middle East to 6.9% in Australia/New Zealand. CD was observed more often among females. Comparing children with and without CD, characteristics for those with CD were younger age at diabetes onset (6.3 [3.3; 9.8] vs 8.1 [4.6; 11.3], P < 0.001) and had longer diabetes duration (6.4 [3.6; 9.8] vs 4.8 [2.1; 8.2], P < 0.001). Further, they had lower glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in Europe and North America/Canada; lower body mass index (BMI)-SD score (BMI-SDS) in southern Europe, North America, and Canada; In most regions daily insulin dose was lower, height-SDS was lower, and the percentage of insulin pump users was higher in children with T1D and CD. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence and the anthropometric and metabolic consequences of CD in children with T1D differ around the world.
36286890	[Celiac crisis in patients with celiac disease. Case report].	Celiac crisis (CC) is a rare life-threatening course of celiac disease, observed mainly in children. In adults, CK can be the first manifestation of the disease and, very rarely, a relapse that occurs in patients who do not follow the gluten-free diet (AGD). Triggers can be stress, surgery, childbirth, etc. A clinical observation of CC developed in a 49-year-old patient with previously established latent celiac disease with subtotal villous atrophy, stage Marsh III C is presented. The patient did not comply with AHD. After severe angina, she developed anorexia, diarrhea, emaciation, coagulopathy, bilateral pulmonary embolism, infarction pneumonia, and enterogenic sepsis. As a result of intensive therapy with prednisolone, Fraxiparine, antibiotics, fresh frozen plasma and strict adherence to hypertension, remission of the disease was achieved.
35482279	Migraine and Diet: Updates in Understanding.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We explore recent developments in the prevention and treatment of migraine through dietary interventions. RECENT FINDINGS: Healthier diets (defined in multiple ways), meal regularity, and weight loss are associated with decreased headache burden. Specific diets including the ketogenic diet, the low-glycemic index diet, and the DASH diet are supported by modest evidence for the prevention of migraine. Neither a gluten-free diet, in patients without celiac disease, nor elimination diets have sufficient evidence for their routine consideration. Diet remains a crucial, but underexplored, component of comprehensive migraine management. Multiple interventions exist for providers and patients to consider integrating into their treatment plan. Larger studies are needed to support stronger recommendations for utilization of specific dietary interventions for the prevention and treatment of migraine.
29854070	Oxidative and Antioxidative Status of Children with Celiac Disease Treated with a Gluten Free-Diet.	AIMS: Oxidative stress is a factor involved in the pathogenesis of celiac disease (CD), possibly affecting the course of the disease and celiac-related complications. We assessed the intensity of oxidative processes and the efficiency of antioxidant defense in children with celiac disease. Methods. Group I (n = 32) consisted of children with CD treated with a gluten-free diet, and group II (n = 24) consisted of healthy children on a traditional diet. Antioxidative and oxidative status was assessed by measurement of serum total antioxidant capacity (TAC), total oxidant capacity (TOC), and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) and on the basis of oxidative stress index (OSI). RESULTS: There were no significant differences in serum TAC, TOC, ox-LDL, and OSI between children with CD and healthy children. Cluster analysis showed that the group of children with CD is not homogeneous in terms of serum TAC and TOC levels. About 50% of these children had TAC levels < 1.3 mmol/L and TOC levels > 0.35 mmol/L. CONCLUSIONS: Strict adherence to a gluten-free diet by children with CD seems to be important for maintaining oxidative-antioxidant balance. However, further research is needed to identify factors potentially responsible for increased oxidative stress in some children with celiac disease despite adherence to a gluten-free diet.
31311347	Challenges to drug discovery for celiac disease and approaches to overcome them.	Introduction: The only available effective treatment for celiac disease (CD) is strict and long-term compliance with a gluten-free diet. Dietary gluten restriction must be strict and long term, but is difficult to achieve in many cases and alternative dietary strategies have been investigated in the past few years. Areas covered: This review highlights the progress that has been made in the development of new therapeutics for CD. Detailed information is provided on the targets of drugs for CD as their related mechanisms of action. The therapies are classified in five mechanisms: modification of gluten, intraluminal therapies, immunomodulation, intestinal permeability and modulation of adaptative response. The actual development phase and future approach are also described and discussed. Expert opinion: There are several limitations in each of the treatment targets related either through complications or the lack of complete response to a normal gluten containing diet. It is clear that the most desired therapy for celiac patients would induce gluten tolerance and progress has been made as per the treatments described herein. Therefore, it is shortly expected that curative or complimentary tools to a gluten free diet will be available that will improve the quality of life of CD sufferers.
32338009	National survey on the experiences of people with celiac disease in Spain. The CELIAC-SPAIN project.	INTRODUCTION: coeliac disease (CD) is well known, but not so its impact on the patient's life. OBJECTIVE: to determine the impact of CD in the life of celiac patients on different aspects such as diagnosis, follow-up and treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: associates of FACE participated in an auto-administered, telematic survey conducted between May and July, 2019. Three participant profiles have been defined: adults diagnosed in adulthood, adults diagnosed in childhood and parents/guardians of celiac children. RESULTS: 540 surveys (343 adult celiacs, 58 celiacs from children and 139 parents/guardians) from all autonomous communities have been included. In the diagnostic process highlights the diagnostic delay (up to 2 years) and the limitations to screening of family members. After diagnosis, about 20 % of adults do not refer to follow any control. Having a CD generates different reactions, but concern and quality of life limitation are very common. As for the gluten-free diet, 90 % of patients referred good adherence to treatment, which is accompanied by improved symptoms and weight gain. Diet tracking limits patients' daily lives. Gluten-free manufactured products are considered expensive, with unclear and unappealing labeling. CONCLUSIONS: the results of the "CELIAC-SPAIN" project show that there are still many aspects to be improved in CD, both diagnosis and follow-up and in facilitating access to gluten-free products.
29057833	Indications and Use of the Gluten Contamination Elimination Diet for Patients with Non-Responsive Celiac Disease.	For the majority of patients diagnosed with celiac disease, once a gluten-free diet is initiated, symptoms improve within weeks and may completely resolve in months. However, up to 30% of patients may show signs, symptoms or persistent small intestinal damage after one year on a gluten-free diet. These patients require evaluation for other common GI etiologies and assessment of their celiac disease status in order to make a diagnosis and suggest treatment. Here, we propose an approach to evaluating patients with celiac disease with persistent symptoms, persistently elevated serology, and or persistent villous atrophy despite a gluten-free diet. We detail how to diagnose and distinguish between non-responsive and refractory celiac disease. Finally, we introduce the indications for use of the gluten contamination elimination diet and provide information for practitioners to implement the diet when necessary in their practice.
31652803	Multifactorial Etiology of Anemia in Celiac Disease and Effect of Gluten-Free Diet: A Comprehensive Review.	Celiac disease (CD) is a multisystemic disorder with different clinical expressions, from malabsorption with diarrhea, anemia, and nutritional compromise to extraintestinal manifestations. Anemia might be the only clinical expression of the disease, and iron deficiency anemia is considered one of the most frequent extraintestinal clinical manifestations of CD. Therefore, CD should be suspected in the presence of anemia without a known etiology. Assessment of tissue anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysial antibodies are indicated in these cases and, if positive, digestive endoscopy and intestinal biopsy should be performed. Anemia in CD has a multifactorial pathogenesis and, although it is frequently a consequence of iron deficiency, it can be caused by deficiencies of folate or vitamin B12, or by blood loss or by its association with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or other associated diseases. The association between CD and IBD should be considered during anemia treatment in patients with IBD, because the similarity of symptoms could delay the diagnosis. Vitamin B12 deficiency is common in CD and may be responsible for anemia and peripheral myeloneuropathy. Folate deficiency is a well-known cause of anemia in adults, but there is little information in children with CD; it is still unknown if anemia is a symptom of the most typical CD in adult patients either by predisposition due to the fact of age or because biochemical and clinical manifestations take longer to appear.

31978015	Frequency and Predictors of Successful Transition of Care for Young Adults With Childhood Celiac Disease.	OBJECTIVES: Transition from pediatric to adult care for individuals with chronic conditions is important to prevent gaps in care, though this has not been well-studied in celiac disease (CD). The aim of this study was to discern rates and predictors of successful transition of care for young adults with childhood-diagnosed CD. METHODS: An anonymous 21-question online survey was sent to individuals on our center's email contact list seeking responses from those ages 18 to 25 years diagnosed with CD before age 18 years. Information collected included method of diagnosis, demographics, CD-related care, reasons for not seeking care, and symptoms. RESULTS: Respondents (n = 98), 70% women, had a median age of 21 years (IQR 19--23 years). The majority were full or part-time students (67%; 95% CI 59%-77%). Only 31% of respondents had successfully transitioned to an adult CD provider. Some 37% (95% CI 29%-48%) were not receiving any CD medical care. An older age at diagnosis was associated with successful transition to adult gastroenterology (P = 0.002) as well as with greater symptom scores (P = 0.002). Receiving a referral for ongoing adult CD care predicted successful transition to an adult provider (odds ratio [OR] 3.92, 95% CI 1.58-9.72). CONCLUSIONS: Transition of care for young adults with CD is inconsistent, particularly among asymptomatic patients. Receipt of a referral for an adult provider significantly improves follow-up rates.
38613039	Gluten-Free Diet and Other Celiac Disease Therapies: Current Understanding and Emerging Strategies.	A lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only treatment for celiac disease and other gluten-related disorders. Nevertheless, strict adherence to the GFD is often challenging due to concerns about social isolation, risk of gluten contaminations, high cost, poor quality and the taste of gluten-free products. Moreover, although the GFD is effective in achieving mucosal healing, it may lead to dietary imbalances due to nutrient deficiencies over a long period of time. To overcome these issues, several gluten-free wheat flours have been developed to create products that closely resemble their gluten-containing counterparts. Furthermore, given the critical importance of adhering to the GFD, it becomes essential to promote adherence and monitor possible voluntary or involuntary transgressions. Various methods, including clinical assessment, questionnaires, serology for celiac disease, duodenal biopsies and the detection of Gluten Immunogenic Peptides (GIPs) are employed for this purpose, but none are considered entirely satisfactory. Since adherence to the GFD poses challenges, alternative therapies should be implemented in the coming years to improve treatment efficacy and the quality of life of patients with celiac disease. The aim of this narrative review is to explore current knowledge of the GFD and investigate its future perspectives, focusing on technology advancements, follow-up strategies and insights into a rapidly changing future.
28830676	Gluten related illnesses and severe mental disorders: a comprehensive review.	The putative role of gluten in the pathophysiology of severe mental illnesses remains uncertain and there is doubt about the possible benefit of gluten-free diets for individuals affected by psychosis and mood disorders. The objective of this review was to summarize the findings linking gluten related conditions to pathophysiological substrates implicated in schizophrenia and mood disorders and review the evidences of potential benefits of glute-free diets in these populations. A literature search was conducted within PubMed and Scielo databases including references from inception until March 1st 2017. The strategy search was to use the key words "gluten", "celiac disease", "wheat", "bipolar disorder", "mood disorders", "psychosis", "schizophrenia", "depression". In the review about the potential efficacy of gluten-free diets in severe mental illnesses, we included only studies with original data, including cross sectional and longitudinal studies and clinical trials. Book chapters, review articles and meta-analysis and republished data were excluded. Although the current available evidences suggest that people with celiac disease or gluten allergy could have a slightly higher risk of schizophrenia and mood disorders compared to the general population, the literature review reveals significant inaccuracies in the data. There is insufficient evidence to recommend gluten-free diets for populations with psychosis and mood disorders.
37243608	The role of gluten challenge in the diagnosis of celiac disease: a review.	INTRODUCTION: Duodenal biopsy is the gold standard in the diagnosis of celiac disease, with increasing utilization of serology. A gluten challenge may be required, for example, when dietary gluten reduction precedes appropriate diagnostic evaluations. Evidence on the best challenge protocol is currently sparse. Pharmaceutical trials in recent years may have provided new insights into the challenge and advanced the development of novel sensitive histological and immunological methods. AREAS COVERED: This review outlines the current perspectives on the use of gluten challenge in the diagnosis of celiac disease and explores future directions in this area. EXPERT OPINION: Comprehensive elimination of celiac disease before dietary gluten restriction is essential to avoid diagnostic uncertainties. Gluten challenge continues to have an important role in certain clinical scenarios, although it is important to understand its limitations in the diagnostic evaluation. The evidence so far permits no unequivocal recommendation considering the timing, duration, and amount of gluten used in the challenge. Thus, these decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis. Further studies with more standardized protocols and outcome measures are called for. In the future novel immunological methods may help to shorten or even avoid gluten challenge.
32960543	A Narrow Window: Booming Gluten-free Market and Fostering Healthy Dietary Habits in Children With Celiac Disease.	An expanding gluten-free marketplace has left children with celiac disease and their families with a host of new dietary options. The quality of these foods is inconsistent and processed items may be high in caloric content while lacking nutritional value. Assessing the dietary preferences of a cohort of children with celiac disease via cross-sectional survey, we find that these processed food items have become a staple of the gluten-free diet, and in many cases, these foods are consumed to the exclusion of healthy alternatives. Furthermore, children with celiac disease and their families become less interested in dietary education over time, indicating that the greatest opportunity for imparting a healthy diet may occur at the time of diagnosis.
32160043	EFFECT OF GLUTEN-FREE DIET ON METABOLIC CONTROL AND ANTHROPOMETRIC PARAMETERS IN TYPE 1 DIABETES WITH SUBCLINICAL CELIAC DISEASE: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL.	Objective: It is unclear whether the institution of gluten-free diet (GFD) is beneficial in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and subclinical celiac disease (CD). Our primary objective was to evaluate the effect of GFD on the frequency of hypoglycemia, in patients with T1DM and subclinical CD. Our secondary objective was to investigate the effect of GFD on height, weight, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin dose requirement, and bone mineral homeostasis. Methods: We carried out a prospective open label randomized controlled trial (RCT). Patients with T1DM and subclinical CD were randomized to receive GFD or a normal diet for 1 year. The primary outcome was the frequency of hypoglycemic episodes (blood glucose <70 mg/dL) measured by self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) at the sixth month of the study in the 2 groups. Results: Screening for CD was carried out in 320 T1DM patients. Thirty eligible patients were randomized to receive GFD (n = 15) or a normal diet (n = 15). The mean number of hypoglycemic episodes/month recorded by SMBG and the mean time spent in hypoglycemia measured by CGM (minutes) in the GFD group versus the non-GFD group at six months was 2.3 minutes versus 3.4 minutes (P = .5) and 124.1 minutes versus 356.9 minutes (P = .1), respectively. The mean number of hypoglycemic episodes/month significantly declined in the GFD group (3.5 episodes at baseline versus 2.3 episodes at the sixth month; P = .03). The mean HbA1c declined by 0.73% in the GFD group and rose by 0.99% in non-GFD group at study completion. Conclusion: This is the first RCT to assess the effect of GFD in T1DM and subclinical CD. A trend towards a decrease in hypoglycemic episodes and better glycemic control was seen in patients receiving GFD. Abbreviations: BMC = bone mineral content; BMI = body mass index; CD = celiac disease; CGM = continuous glucose monitoring; GFD = gluten-free diet; Hb = hemoglobin; HbA1c = glycosylated hemoglobin; iPTH = intact parathyroid hormone; RCT = randomized controlled trial; SMBG = self-monitoring of blood glucose; T1DM = type 1 diabetes mellitus; tTG-IgA = tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin A.
32350146	Celiac disease: a multi-faceted medical condition.	Celiac disease (CD) is a systemic condition of autoimmune origin, affecting genetically predisposed individuals who at some point lose tolerance towards dietary gluten. Prevalence in the general population is 0.5 - 1%, with a higher frequency in women. The most important environmental factor for CD is ingestion of specific gluten peptides. It triggers a sequence of molecular events, involving the intestinal permeability and the immune system, which ends in damage of the intestinal mucosa. A number of studies have demonstrated the correlation between the intestinal microbiota and celiac disease. MicroRNAs through their regulatory role on gene expression have been implicated in the pathogenesis of CD and suggested as potential biomarkers. In the pediatric and adult population, CD displays different clusters of clinical symptoms. Persistent diarrhea, abdominal pain and involuntary weight loss are the classic symptoms of CD. In the majority of cases diagnosis relies on the combination of serum autoantibodies (anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomisium IgA) and duodenal biopsy showing villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia and intraepithelial lymphocytes. Observance of a lifelong gluten-free diet, which interrupts the immune response to gluten peptides, is the only effective treatment of CD.
37192180	Celiac disease and COVID-19 in adults: A systematic review.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease affecting around 1.4% of the total human population. Local and systemic manifestations are described in CD. Viral infections seem to trigger CD or even have a worse outcome in CD patients. The evidence on the relationship between CD and coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is limited. To evaluate existing evidence on the association between CD and COVID-19, we conducted the current systematic review. METHODS: We systematically searched Pubmed, Scopus, and Embase databases to find articles that reported risks or outcomes of COVID-19 in CD patients. Papers in any language published up to November 17, 2022, were evaluated for possible inclusion. The results were analyzed qualitatively. This study is registered with PROSPERO(CRD42022327380). RESULTS: We identified 509 studies by searching databases; 14 reported data on the risk or outcome of COVID-19 in CD patients and were eligible for qualitative synthesis. We found that the relative risk of acquiring COVID-19 in CD patients may be lower than in the general population. Approximately 90% of infected patients were treated as an outpatient, and 10% were hospitalized. GFD adherence and Health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) were more or less the same before and during the pandemic. The gluten-free products (GFP) supply seems to be plunged during the pandemic. The data on the psychological effects of the pandemic were conflicting. CONCLUSION: The risk of acquiring COVID-19 in CD patients is lower than in the general population. Females were more likely to be infected by COVID-19, and the most common comorbidity in infected patients was a chronic lower respiratory disease; around 10% of infected patients needed hospitalization, GFD adherence, and HR-QOL was more or less the same before and during the pandemic, depression, anxiety, and stress levels of patients varied among studies. Patients had more difficulties accessing GFPs based on limited data.
31770352	Persistent Symptoms in People With Celiac Disease Despite Gluten-Free Diet: A Concern?	Studies show that people with celiac disease have reduced well-being and have persistent symptoms, mainly related to the gastrointestinal tract. The aim of this study was to analyze how persons in a celiac disease member association report their symptoms, health, and life satisfaction. A questionnaire, with both open and closed questions, was distributed to all members (n = 726) of a celiac association in the southeast of Sweden. The response rate was 74.5%, of which 524 (72%) said they had received a celiac disease diagnosis and were thus included in the study. Almost half of the participants (40.7%-42.2%) stated that they had persistent celiac disease symptoms despite following a gluten-free diet. Diarrhea, abdominal pain, and congestion were persistent symptoms reported and could contribute to a lower health status compared with people without persistent symptoms. The life satisfaction scale (LiSat-9) showed differences in 5 of 9 variables between the groups. Living with celiac disease is far from easy when you have persistent symptoms. People with celiac disease require follow-up by healthcare services, and a new treatment needs to be developed because following the gluten-free diet alone does not seem to alleviate symptoms in everyone.
36771266	The Influence of SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic on the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease and Clinical Practice in Pediatric Gastroenterology.	Celiac disease (CD) has a high prevalence but remains largely underdiagnosed. Although extensive studies have confirmed that children with CD do not have an increased risk of severe COVID-19, public health regulations associated with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic may have exacerbated this problem. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the number of new-onset CD cases. Additionally, the role of SARS-CoV-2 in autoimmune diseases and its influence on clinical practice in pediatric gastroenterology were briefly reviewed. We described the data from the hospital electronic registry of new-onset CD, during the COVID-19 pandemic and 2 years before. A total of 423 children were diagnosed with CD between March 2018 and February 2022: 228 in the 2-year pre-COVID-19 period and 195 during the pandemic. The number of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic was 14.5% lower than in the previous years. The quarterly comparison of CD diagnoses showed a reduction in all quarters. A reduction in diagnoses during the lockdown and in the following months was evident and not compensated thereafter. This is the first study to evaluate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the diagnosis of CD in children. Further studies are necessary to improve the system of biopsy-sparing diagnosis and to evaluate the effect of the diagnostic delay. Special attention should be given to the implementation of telemedicine services.
28815514	Intraepithelial lymphocyte immunophenotype: a useful tool in the diagnosis of celiac disease.	According to new ESPGHAN guidelines, gluten challenge is considered necessary when there is doubt about the initial diagnosis of celiac disease (CD). The main aim of this study was to quantify intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) immunophenotype on celiac patients on gluten-containing diet (GCD) compared to those on gluten-free diet (GFD). Another aim was to evaluate the clinical utility of IELs in the CD diagnosis, especially in selected patients on GFD where diagnostic uncertainty remains. IEL immunophenotype (TCRgammadelta and NK-like IELs) were studied by flow cytometry in 111 children with CD (81 children with CD on GCD and 30 celiac patients on GFD) and a control group (10 children). Duration of GFD was 5.4 +- 1.6 years. TCRgammadelta IELs in celiac patients receiving a GCD or GFD were significantly higher (p < 0.001) than in the control group. NK-like IELs in patients receiving a GCD or GFD were significantly lower than in the control group (p < 0.001). We observed a permanent decrease of NK-like IELs and an increment of TCRgammadelta IELs after following an adequate establishment and compliance of a long-term GFD in celiac patients. Recognition of IELs changes in the intestinal mucosa on celiac patients after long-term establishment of a GFD could constitute a useful tool for CD diagnosis in various situations: in which there is doubt about the initial diagnosis and repeat biopsy is necessary (avoiding the need of gluten challenges), and in those patients with symptoms/signs suggestive of CD who maintain a low gluten diet.
34952810	Improving the diagnostic approach to celiac disease: Experience from a regional network.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is still underestimated. To close this diagnostic gap, the Health Sicilian Authorities have constituted the "Sicilian Network for CD". AIMS: A) To verify the quality of the current diagnostic approach using the data sheet of the Network. B) To evaluate the clinical, serologic and histologic data of new diagnoses in the context of the Network METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the data collection forms of 369 patients with CD from three Centers within the Sicilian Network. All the Centers used a standard data collection form. RESULTS: A non-classical CD presentation was more frequent than the classical one, anemia being the most frequent symptom (50%). An IBS-like presentation was found in one third of the cases. A diagnostic delay of about 9 years following the onset of symptoms was observed. Almost half of the patients had not undergone multiple duodenal biopsies; unrecommended CD serology assays were prescribed in 59.9% of the cases. CONCLUSIONS: The regional data sheets allowed an assessment of the diagnostic delay. We recorded a frequent use of unrecommended tests prescribed before referring patients to the regional Centers. Updating the education of physicians regarding CD is necessary to avoid unwarranted health expenditure.
34628462	Treatment-Refractory, Primary Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura in a Patient with Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is primarily caused by antibody-mediated destruction of platelets. Alterations in immune homeostasis can induce loss of peripheral tolerance and promote the development of self-reactive antibodies. Primary ITP is the diagnosis of exclusion made after the extensive work-up rules out other possible causes of thrombocytopenia. The association between the ITP and other autoimmune disorders is well-established. In recent years, increasing attention has been directed toward the association between celiac disease (CD) and ITP. CASE REPORT A 27-year-old man with a history of primary ITP presented with an occasional nosebleed, 1 episode of rectal bleeding, and easy bruising. The patient was later found to have high titers of TTG-IGA and endomysial IGA levels consistent with CD. Our patient not only failed to improve with the gluten-free diet, but also failed multiple lines of treatment including steroids, IVIG, rituximab, eltrombopag, and even a non-traditional treatment for ITP (azathioprine and plasma exchange). The patient's CD-related antibody titers remained elevated. CONCLUSIONS It is possible that in certain cases the alteration of immune response caused by CD with a concurrent elevation of CD-related antibodies can make ITP refractory to all medical management. Whether or not this refractoriness to treatment is related to the persistently elevated antibody titers of CD or unknown genetic relationship between ITP and CD remains not entirely clear and warrants further molecular, immunologic, and genetic analysis.
30477107	Probiotics in Celiac Disease.	Recently, the interest in the human microbiome and its interplay with the host has exploded and provided new insights on its role in conferring host protection and regulating host physiology, including the correct development of immunity. However, in the presence of microbial imbalance and particular genetic settings, the microbiome may contribute to the dysfunction of host metabolism and physiology, leading to pathogenesis and/or the progression of several diseases. Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic autoimmune enteropathy triggered by dietary gluten exposure in genetically predisposed individuals. Despite ascertaining that gluten is the trigger in CD, evidence has indicated that intestinal microbiota is somehow involved in the pathogenesis, progression, and clinical presentation of CD. Indeed, several studies have reported imbalances in the intestinal microbiota of patients with CD that are mainly characterized by an increased abundance of Bacteroides spp. and a decrease in Bifidobacterium spp. The evidence that some of these microbial imbalances still persist in spite of a strict gluten-free diet and that celiac patients suffering from persistent gastrointestinal symptoms have a desert gut microbiota composition further support its close link with CD. All of this evidence gives rise to the hypothesis that probiotics might play a role in this condition. In this review, we describe the recent scientific evidences linking the gut microbiota in CD, starting from the possible role of microbes in CD pathogenesis, the attempt to define a microbial signature of disease, the effect of a gluten-free diet and host genetic assets regarding microbial composition to end in the exploration of the proof of concept of probiotic use in animal models to the most recent clinical application of selected probiotic strains.
34526700	Society for the Study of Celiac Disease position statement on gaps and opportunities in coeliac disease.	Progress has been made in understanding coeliac disease, a relatively frequent and underappreciated immune-mediated condition that occurs in genetically predisposed individuals. However, several gaps remain in knowledge related to diagnosis and management. The gluten-free diet, currently the only available management, is not curative or universally effective (some adherent patients have ongoing duodenal injury). Unprecedented numbers of emerging therapies, including some with novel tolerogenic mechanisms, are currently being investigated in clinical trials. In March 2020, the Celiac Disease Foundation and the Society for the Study of Celiac Disease convened a consensus workshop to identify high-yield areas of research that should be prioritized. Workshop participants included leading experts in clinical practice, academia, government and pharmaceutical development, as well as representatives from patient support groups in North America. This Roadmap summarizes key advances in the field of coeliac disease and provides information on important discussions from the consensus approach to address gaps and opportunities related to the pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of coeliac disease. The morbidity of coeliac disease is often underestimated, which has led to an unmet need to improve the management of these patients. Expanded research funding is needed as coeliac disease is a potentially curable disease.
31337023	Nutritional Deficiencies in Children with Celiac Disease Resulting from a Gluten-Free Diet: A Systematic Review.	BACKGROUND: A strictly gluten-free diet (GFD) is the basis for managing celiac disease (CD). Numerous studies have reported nutritional deficiencies/imbalances ascribable to a GFD. The aim of this review is to describe nutritional deficiencies observed in children with celiac disease on a GFD, to discuss the clinical consequences related to these nutritional imbalances, and to identify strategies that may be adopted to treat them. METHODS: We reviewed the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases between January 1998 and January 2019. RESULTS: Children are, regardless of whether they are on a gluten-free diet or not, at risk of consuming too much fat and insufficient fiber, iron, vitamin D, and calcium. These imbalances may be exacerbated when children are on a gluten-free diet. In particular, the intake of folate, magnesium, zinc, and foods with a high glycemic index in children with CD who are on a GFD is significantly altered. CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic protocols should include nutritional education to help teach subjects affected by disorders such as CD the importance of labels, the choice of foods, and the combination of macro- and micronutrients. Children with CD on a GFD should be encouraged to rotate pseudo-cereals, consume gluten-free commercial products that have been fortified or enriched, and use foods that are local and naturally gluten-free.
30817868	Compliance with gluten-free diet in a selected group of celiac children in the Slovak Republic.	OBJECTIVE: Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic long-term disease with autoimmune disorder connected to an allergic reaction to the molecule of gluten. CD is manifested in persons who are genetically predisposed. The only therapy for CD is a strong gluten-free (GF) diet. The aim of our study was to follow the adherence to the gluten-free diet in the selected group of parents and caregivers of children with CD, and to compare factors influencing the adherence to GF diet and therefore influencing also clinical symptoms of CD. We compared and examined important food-related activities as well, by using a personal questionnaire in the group of CD children's parents or caregivers. METHODS: We designed a cross-sectional study; 325 parents or caregivers of children with CD were recruited in the sample. CD was confirmed by the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) criteria. The anonymous questionnaires were collected at summer camps within period data 2012-2016 and followed factors which might have an influence on compliance with GF diet, according to parents' opinions. RESULTS: Adherence to GF diet was statistically significantly higher among girls compared to boys. Parents' questionnaires confirmed that younger group of children and children with the family history of CD had statistically higher compliance with GF diet. Parents with higher education confirmed better adherence to GF diet, statistical analyses confirmed higher adherence in mother s education compared to father's education. Duration of CD, socio-demographic factors of parents - age of parent, gender of parent, and residency were not statistically significant in terms of compliance with the diet. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed important factors influencing adherence to the GF diet, which are connected to the symptoms and consequences of CD. The assessment of parents' opinions and burden on the families of children with celiac disease should be also reflected in the evaluation of patient's status. Important is also the role of parents in order to facilitate and support clinical interventions and prevention of CD.
37316859	Identifying and validating the educational needs to develop a Celiac Self-Care System.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is a major public health problem in many countries, including Iran. Considering the disease's exponential spread throughout the world and its risk factors, identifying the educational priorities and minimum data required to control and treat the disease is of great significance. METHODS: The present study was conducted in two phases in 2022. In the first phase, a questionnaire was developed based on the information obtained from a review of the literature. Later, the questionnaire was administered to 12 pundits in the fields of nutrition (n = 5), internal medicine (n = 4), and gastroenterology (n = 3). As a result, the necessary and important educational content was determined for developing the Celiac Self-Care System. RESULTS: According to the experts' viewpoints, the educational needs of patients were classified into nine categories of demographic information, clinical information, long-term complications, comorbidity, tests, medications, dietary recommendations, general recommendations, technical capabilities as well as 105 subcategories. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the increased prevalence of Celiac disease and the lack of an established minimum set of data, determining the required educational information is of great importance at the national level. Such information could be useful in implementing educational health programs to raise the public level of awareness. In the field of education, such contents can be employed in planning new technology based on mobile phones (mobile health), preparing registries, and producing widely used content.

29387990	Hypervigilance to a Gluten-Free Diet and Decreased Quality of Life in Teenagers and Adults with Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Avoidance of gluten is critical for individuals with celiac disease (CD), but there is also concern that "extreme vigilance" to a strict gluten-free diet may increase symptoms such as anxiety and fatigue, and therefore, lower quality of life (QOL). We examined the associations of QOL with energy levels and adherence to, and knowledge about, a gluten-free diet. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional prospective study of 80 teenagers and adults, all with biopsy-confirmed CD, living in a major metropolitan area. QOL was assessed with CD-specific measures. Dietary vigilance was based on 24-h recalls and an interview. Knowledge was based on a food label quiz. Open-ended questions described facilitators and barriers to maintaining a gluten-free diet. RESULTS: The extremely vigilant adults in our sample had significantly lower QOL scores than their less vigilant counterparts [(mean (SD): 64.2 (16.0) vs 77.2 (12.2), p = 0.004]. Extreme vigilance was also associated with greater knowledge [5.7 (0.7) vs 5.1 (0.8), p = 0.035]. Adults with lower energy levels had significantly lower overall QOL scores than adults with higher energy levels [68.0 (13.6) vs 78.9 (13.0), p = 0.006]. Patterns were similar for teenagers. Cooking at home and using internet sites and apps were prevalent strategies used by the hypervigilant to maintain a strict gluten-free diet. Eating out was particularly problematic. CONCLUSION: There are potential negative consequences of hypervigilance to a strict gluten-free diet. Clinicians must consider the importance of concurrently promoting both dietary adherence and social and emotional well-being for individuals with CD.
30029702	How to improve the gluten-free diet: The state of the art from a food science perspective.	The celiac disease is the most common food intolerance and its prevalence is increasing. Consequently, use of gluten-free diet has expanded, notwithstanding consumption as therapy for other gluten-related disorders or by wellbeing people without any medical prescription. Even the therapeutic efficiency has undoubtedly proven, several drawbacks mainly regarding the compliance, nutritional deficits and related diseases, and the alteration of the intestinal microbiota have described in the literature. Food science has been considered as one of the primary area of intervention to limit or eliminate such drawbacks. Efforts have approached shelf life, rheology and palatability aspects but more recently have mainly focused to improve the nutritional features of the gluten-free diet, and to propose dietary alternatives. The sourdough fermentation has shown the most promising results, also including a biotechnology strategy that has allowed the complete degradation of gluten prior to consumption.
33435615	Gliadin Sequestration as a Novel Therapy for Celiac Disease: A Prospective Application for Polyphenols.	Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder characterized by a heightened immune response to gluten proteins in the diet, leading to gastrointestinal symptoms and mucosal damage localized to the small intestine. Despite its prevalence, the only treatment currently available for celiac disease is complete avoidance of gluten proteins in the diet. Ongoing clinical trials have focused on targeting the immune response or gluten proteins through methods such as immunosuppression, enhanced protein degradation and protein sequestration. Recent studies suggest that polyphenols may elicit protective effects within the celiac disease milieu by disrupting the enzymatic hydrolysis of gluten proteins, sequestering gluten proteins from recognition by critical receptors in pathogenesis and exerting anti-inflammatory effects on the system as a whole. This review highlights mechanisms by which polyphenols can protect against celiac disease, takes a critical look at recent works and outlines future applications for this potential treatment method.
28866981	Carpal spasm in a girl as initial presentation of celiac disease: a case report.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is an immune-mediated disorder elicited by ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible persons. This disorder is characterized by specific histological changes of the small intestine mucosa resulting in malabsorption. This case was written up as it was an unusual and dramatic presentation of celiac disease. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 3-year-old Albanian girl who presented at our clinic with carpal spasms and hand paresthesia. A physical examination at admission revealed a relatively good general condition and body weight of 10.5 kg (10 percentile). Carpal spasms and paresthesias of her extremities were present. Neuromuscular irritability was demonstrated by positive Chvostek and Trousseau signs. Blood tests showed severe hypocalcemia with a total serum calcium of 1.2 mmol/L (normal range 2.12 to 2.55 mmol/L), ionized calcium of 0.87 (normal range 1.11 to 1.30 mmol/L), and 24-hour urine calcium excretion of 9.16 mmol (normal range female <6.2 mmol/day). Among other tests, screening for celiac disease was performed: antigliadin immunoglobulin A, anti-tissue transglutaminase, and anti-endomysial immunoglobulin A antibodies were positive. A duodenal biopsy revealed lymphocyte infiltration, crypt hyperplasia, and villous atrophy compatible with celiac disease grade IIIb according to the Marsh classification. Following the diagnosis of celiac disease, human leukocyte antigen typing was performed, giving a definite diagnosis of celiac disease. She was started on a gluten-free diet. Due to failure to follow a gluten-free diet, episodes of carpal spasms appeared again. Unfortunately, at the age of 7 years she presents with delayed psychophysical development. CONCLUSIONS: Although hypocalcemia is a common finding in celiac disease, hypocalcemic carpal spasm is a rare initial manifestation of the disease. Therefore, the possibility of celiac disease should be considered in patients with repeated carpal spasms that seem unduly difficult to treat. This should be evaluated even in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms since hypocalcemia and its manifestation may present as initial symptoms of celiac disease even in young children.
31590358	The Gut Microbiota in Celiac Disease and probiotics.	Celiac disease (CeD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy, and unique in that the specific trigger is known: gluten. The current mainstay of therapy is a gluten-free diet (GFD). As novel therapies are being developed, complementary strategies are also being studied, such as modulation of the gut microbiome. The gut microbiota is involved in the initiation and perpetuation of intestinal inflammation in several chronic diseases. Intestinal dysbiosis has been reported in CeD patients, untreated or treated with GFD, compared to healthy subjects. Several studies have identified differential bacterial populations associated with CeD patients and healthy subjects. However, it is still not clear if intestinal dysbiosis is the cause or effect of CeD. Probiotics have also been considered as a strategy to modulate the gut microbiome to an anti-inflammatory state. However, there is a paucity of data to support their use in treating CeD. Further studies are needed with therapeutic microbial formulations combined with human trials on the use of probiotics to treat CeD by restoring the gut microbiome to an anti-inflammatory state.

32751379	Dietary Gluten and Neurodegeneration: A Case for Preclinical Studies.	Although celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease that primarily involves the intestinal tract, mounting evidence suggests that a sizeable number of patients exhibit neurological deficits. About 40% of the celiac patients with neurological manifestations have circulating antibodies against neural tissue transglutaminase-6 (tTG6). While early diagnosis and strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) have been recommended to prevent neurological dysfunction, better therapeutic strategies are needed to improve the overall quality of life. Dysregulation of the microbiota-gut-brain axis, presence of anti-tTG6 antibodies, and epigenetic mechanisms have been implicated in the pathogenesis. It is also possible that circulating or gut-derived extracellular structures and including biomolecular condensates and extracellular vesicles contribute to disease pathogenesis. There are several avenues for shaping the dysregulated gut homeostasis in individuals with CD, non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) and/or neurodegeneration. In addition to GFD and probiotics, nutraceuticals, such as phyto and synthetic cannabinoids, represent a new approach that could shape the host microbiome towards better prognostic outcomes. Finally, we provide a data-driven rationale for potential future pre-clinical research involving non-human primates (NHPs) to investigate the effect of nutraceuticals, such as phyto and synthetic cannabinoids, either alone or in combination with GFD to prevent/mitigate dietary gluten-induced neurodegeneration.
37375589	Assessment of Nutritional Status by Bioelectrical Impedance in Adult Patients with Celiac Disease: A Prospective Single-Center Study.	The gluten-free diet [GFD] has been linked to an increased risk of weight gain and the development of metabolic disorders. Most of the studies have focused on the effect of GFD on the Body Mass Index [BMI]. We aimed to evaluate the nutritional status using specific nutritional parameters in patients with celiac disease [CeD] at diagnosis and on a GFD compared to healthy controls. We recruited subjects at our outpatient clinic at the University of Padua. We collected demographic and clinical data and values obtained with bioelectrical impedance analysis. A total of 24 CeD patients and 28 healthy controls were enrolled. CeD patients at diagnosis had a lower body cell mass index [BCMI, p = 0.006], fat-free mass index [FFMI, p = 0.02], appendicular skeletal muscle index [ASMI, p = 0.02], and phase angle [PA] [p < 0.001] compared to controls. Their percentage of extracellular water [ECW] was also higher [p < 0.001]. Considering CeD patients after GFD, nutritional status significantly improved after 6 months of GFD. We did not observe differences in BMI among groups [p = ns]. CeD patients at diagnosis were found to have a poorer nutritional status than healthy controls, with a positive effect of the GFD on their nutritional status, underlining the inefficacy of evaluating this aspect through only BMI evaluation.
29275927	E-Healthcare for Celiac Disease-A Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the (cost-)effectiveness of online consultations in follow-up of patients with celiac disease (CD). STUDY DESIGN: Multicenter randomized, controlled trial involving 304 patients aged <=25 years with CD for >=1 year, randomized to an online (n = 156) or outpatient consultation (n = 148). An online consultation included questionnaires for symptom and growth measurement. Antitransglutaminase-type-2 antibodies were determined using a point-of-care (POC) test. Controls had a traditional consultation with antitransglutaminase-type-2 antibodies testing in laboratories. Both groups completed questionnaires concerning CD-specific health-related quality of life (HRQOL), gluten-free diet adherence, and patient satisfaction. Six months later, participants repeated HRQOL and patient satisfaction questionnaires and the POC test. The primary outcome was anti-transglutaminase-type-2 antibodies after 6 months, and the secondary outcomes were health problems, dietary adherence, HRQOL, patient satisfaction, and costs. RESULTS: The performance of the POC test was inferior to laboratory testing (2/156 positive POC tests vs 13/148 positive laboratory tests; P = .003). Health problems were detected significantly more frequently using online consultation. The detection of growth problems and dietary transgressions was similar. HRQOL (from 1 [good] to 5 [poor]) improved after online consultation (from 3.25 to 3.16 [P = .013] vs controls from 3.10 to 3.23; P = .810). Patient satisfaction (from 1 [low] to 10 [high]) was 7.6 (online) vs 8.0 (controls; P = .001); 58% wished to continue online consultations. Mean costs per participant during the studied period were $202 less for the online group (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The primary outcome could not be tested because the POC test was unreliable. Nevertheless, our results indicate that online consultations for children and young adults with CD are cost saving, increase CD-specific HRQOL, and are satisfactory for the majority.

34201435	New Insights into Non-Dietary Treatment in Celiac Disease: Emerging Therapeutic Options.	To date, the only treatment for celiac disease (CD) consists of a strict lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD), which has numerous limitations in patients with CD. For this reason, dietary transgressions are frequent, implying intestinal damage and possible long-term complications. There is an unquestionable need for non-dietary alternatives to avoid damage by involuntary contamination or voluntary dietary transgressions. In recent years, different therapies and treatments for CD have been developed and studied based on the degradation of gluten in the intestinal lumen, regulation of the immune response, modulation of intestinal permeability, and induction of immunological tolerance. In this review, therapeutic lines for CD are evaluated with special emphasis on phase III and II clinical trials, some of which have promising results.

36961593	Nutrition and oral health in children with recently and previously diagnosed celiac disease.	OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the nutritional and oral health status of children with previously diagnosed celiac disease (CD) who follow a gluten-free diet and recently diagnosed CD patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Previously and recently diagnosed groups were formed from children with CD, aged 4 to 15 years. A questionnaire was completed about the children's dental history and nutritional and oral hygiene habits. All the children underwent an oral examination, and dmft-DMFT indices were determined. Dental plaque status, periodontal health, and dental enamel defects were recorded. Oral soft tissues were examined for the presence of lesions. Unstimulated salivary flow rate and pH value were evaluated. RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was determined between the previously and recently diagnosed patients in terms of toothpaste preference (p=0.003), frequency of going to the dentist (p=0.039), and the types of dental treatment they had received (p=0.001). A statistically significant difference was determined between the previously and recently diagnosed patient groups in terms of dmft values (p=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Children with CD should be directed to a pediatric dentist to improve oral and dental health, relieve the symptoms of oral mucosal lesions, be informed about enamel defects, and be encouraged to use gluten-free oral care products. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The collaboration of pediatric gastroenterologists and pediatric dentists can prevent the progression of oral symptoms in children with CD and eliminate long-term complications in terms of both oral health and multisystemic problems.
29895017	Transition in Pediatric and Adolescent Hypogonadal Girls: Gynecological Aspects, Estrogen Replacement Therapy, and Contraception.	Hypogonadism may be suspected if puberty is delayed. Pubertal delay may be caused by a normal physiological variant, by primary ovarian insufficiency (Turner syndrome), or reflect congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH; genetic) or acquired HH (brain lesions). Any underlying chronic disease like inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, malnutrition (anorexia or orthorexia), or excessive physical activity may also result in functional HH. Thus, girls with delayed puberty should be evaluated for an underlying pathology before any treatment, including oral contraception, is initiated. Estrogen replacement is important and natural 17beta-estradiol, preferably transdermally, is the preferred choice, whereas the oral route can be used as an alternative depending on patient preference and compliance. Sexual activity is often delayed in the hypogonadal adolescent girl. In the adolescent hypogonadal girl, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) most likely has been initiated at the time she becomes sexually active. If a risk of unwanted pregnancy cannot be ruled out, there is a need to consider contraception. This consideration does not contradict the principles of HRT but can be included as a part of the substitution, e.g. oral contraceptives containing 17beta-estradiol or a progestogen intrauterine device combined with continuous 17beta-estradiol (transdermal or oral).
30081502	Extraintestinal Manifestations of Celiac Disease: Early Detection for Better Long-Term Outcomes.	Population-based screening studies have shown celiac disease to be one of the most common chronic gastrointestinal diseases. Nevertheless, because of the diverse clinical presentation, the great majority of patients remain unrecognized. Particularly difficult to identify are the multifaceted extraintestinal symptoms that may appear at variable ages. Although the pathogenesis and long-term outcome of these manifestations are still poorly established, there is some evidence that unrecognized celiac disease predisposes to severe complications if not diagnosed and prevented with an early-initiated gluten-free diet. Therefore, it is of utmost importance that physicians of different disciplines learn to recognize celiac disease in individuals with non-gastrointestinal symptoms. In the future, more studies are needed to clarify the factors affecting development and prognosis of the extraintestinal manifestations.
34350534	Post-bariatric Surgery Outcomes and Complications in Patients with Celiac Disease: a Matched Case-Control Study.	PURPOSE: The shift towards an obese phenotype in celiac disease (CD) patients increases risk of morbidity and mortality. Bariatric surgery (BS) is the gold standard treatment for obesity. Few studies have explored the role of BS in patients with CD. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of BS in this population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a retrospective matched case-control (1:5) study of adult patients with confirmed CD who underwent BS at our institution from 1998 to 2018. Demographics, operative data, post-operative outcomes, complications, and nutritional parameters were collected. RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients (mostly Caucasian females) were included. Thirteen had confirmed CD and were compared with 65 controls. The most common type of BS was the RYGB. The percent of total body weight loss (%TWL) was similar for both groups at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months, with the highest weight loss being at 12 months: %TWL 28.4 (20.2-38.4) for CD, n=13; vs. 29.1 (19.6-39.3) for non-CD, n=49; p=0.8. Obesity-associated co-morbidities greatly and comparably improved in both groups. Patients with CD had no complications after BS. Post-BS malodorous and oily stools were more common among patients with CD (23.1% vs. 4.6%, p=0.03). Micronutrient deficiencies were common and comparable among both groups with iron and vitamin D being the most common deficiencies. Gluten-free diet (GFD) non-adherence post-operatively was associated with a higher incidence of post-BS abdominal pain (60.0% vs. 0.0%, p=0.012). CONCLUSIONS: BS is safe and effective in patients with CD. Close monitoring is necessary to ensure compliance with GFD and vitamin supplementation. KEY POINTS:   Bariatric surgery leads to significant weight loss in celiac disease (CD) patients.   Mid- and long-term weight loss does not differ between patients with and without CD.   Obesity-associated co-morbidities significantly improve after surgery in CD patients.   The incidence of post-surgical complications is not higher in CD patients.
34034270	Serum transglutaminase antibodies do not always detect the persistent villous atrophy in patients with celiac disease on a gluten-free diet.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: Serum transglutaminase antibodies (tTGs) are used for celiac disease screening and to monitor celiac disease patients on a gluten-free diet (GFD). The need for histology of duodenal biopsies to assess mucosal healing after a GFD is still a matter of debate. We evaluated whether tTGs are adequate to detect the persistence of histological lesions of duodenal mucosa in celiac patients after a GFD. METHODS: In total 253 patients with histological diagnosis of celiac disease according to Marsh criteria, both at the time of diagnosis (T0) and 18-24 months after starting a GFD (T2), were included. tTGs were evaluated both at T0 and T2; endomysial antibodies (EMAs) only at T0. RESULTS: At T0, 9.2% of patients had both tTG and EMA negative values, despite the evidence of duodenal lesions: 33.3% of Marsh 1, 14.3% of Marsh 2 and 5.2% of Marsh 3. At T2, tTGs were negative in 77.6% of patients: 82.2% of Marsh 0, 79.8% of Marsh 1, 70.0% of Marsh 2 and 59.1% of Marsh 3. At T2, approximately 60% of patients with the persistence of mucosal atrophy had negative tTGs. At T0, tTG median values were lower in patients with Marsh 1 and Marsh 2 than patients with Marsh 3 (P < 0.001), whereas no difference was found at T2 regardless of Marsh's grade (P = 0.4). CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study highlight how histologic evaluation of duodenal biopsies remains the gold standard for both celiac disease diagnosis and the evaluation of mucosal recovery after 18-24 months of a GFD.
32745639	Genome-Wide Transcriptomic Analysis of Intestinal Mucosa in Celiac Disease Patients on a Gluten-Free Diet and Postgluten Challenge.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Gluten challenge studies are instrumental in understanding the pathophysiology of celiac disease. Our aims in this study were to reveal early gluten-induced transcriptomic changes in duodenal biopsies and to find tools for clinics. METHODS: Duodenal biopsies were collected from 15 celiac disease patients on a strict long-term gluten-free diet (GFD) prior to and post a gluten challenge (PGC) and from 6 healthy control individuals (DC). Biopsy RNA was subjected to genome-wide 3' RNA-Seq. Sequencing data was used to determine the differences between the three groups and was compared to sequencing data from the public repositories. The biopsies underwent morphometric analyses. RESULTS: In DC vs. GFD group comparisons, 167 differentially expressed genes were identified with 117 genes downregulated and 50 genes upregulated. In PGC vs. GFD group comparisons, 417 differentially expressed genes were identified with 195 genes downregulated and 222 genes upregulated. Celiac disease patients on a GFD were not "healthy". In particular, genes encoding proteins for transporting small molecules were expressed less. In addition to the activation of immune response genes, a gluten challenge induced hyperactive intestinal wnt-signaling and consequent immature crypt gene expression resulting in less differentiated epithelium. Biopsy gene expression in response to a gluten challenge correlated with the extent of the histological damage. Regression models using only four gene transcripts described 97.2% of the mucosal morphology and 98.0% of the inflammatory changes observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our gluten challenge trial design provided an opportunity to study the transition from health to disease. The results show that even on a strict GFD, despite being deemed healthy, patients reveal patterns of ongoing disease. Here, a transcriptomic regression model estimating the extent of gluten-induced duodenal mucosal injury is presented.
29373441	Impact of Thyroid Autoimmunity on Thyroid Function in 12-year-old Children With Celiac Disease.	OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease (CD) is associated with thyroid autoimmunity and other autoimmune diseases. Data are, however, lacking regarding the relationship between thyroid autoimmunity and thyroid function, especially in regard to CD. Our aim was to investigate the impact of thyroid autoimmunity on thyroid function in 12-year-old children with CD compared to their healthy peers. METHODS: A case-referent study was conducted as part of a CD screening of 12-year-olds. Our study included 335 children with CD and 1695 randomly selected referents. Thyroid autoimmunity was assessed with antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPOAb). Thyroid function was assessed with thyroid-stimulating hormone and free thyroxine. RESULTS: TPOAb positivity significantly increased the risk of developing hypothyroidism in all children. The odds ratios (with 95% confidence intervals) were 5.3 (2.7-11) in healthy 12-year-olds, 10 (3.2-32) in screening-detected CD cases, 19 (2.6-135) in previously diagnosed CD cases, and 12 (4.4-32) in all CD cases together. Among children with TPOAb positivity, hypothyroidism was significantly more common (odds ratio 3.1; 95% CI 1.03-9.6) in children with CD (10/19) than in children without CD (12/46). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of thyroid dysfunction due to thyroid autoimmunity is larger for those with CD than their healthy peers. Our study indicates that a gluten-free diet does not reduce the risk of thyroid dysfunction. Further studies are required for improved understanding of the role of the gluten-free diet for the risk of autoimmune diseases in children with CD.
30228265	Combination of Gluten-Digesting Enzymes Improved Symptoms of Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity: A Randomized Single-blind, Placebo-controlled Crossover Study.	INTRODUCTION: Recently, the population of individuals with non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) who do not have celiac disease but show improved symptoms with a gluten-free diet, has increased. Enzyme replacement therapy using digestive enzymes is expected to improve the symptoms of NCGS and be sustainable, since gluten-related proteins that are indigestible by the digestive system have been considered triggers of NCGS. METHODS: We selected patients with NCGS by screening demographic interviews, as well as performing medical evaluations, anti-gluten antibody tests, and gluten challenge tests. We performed a single-blind and crossover clinical trial with these subjects using a gluten challenge with the enzyme mixture or a placebo. Our designed enzyme mixture contained peptidase, semi alkaline protease, deuterolysin, and cysteine protease derived from Aspergillus oryzae, Aspergillus melleus, Penicillium citrinum, and Carica papaya L., respectively. RESULTS: Administration of the enzyme mixture significantly decreased the change in the score of the symptom questionnaire before and after the gluten challenge compared with administration of the placebo in patients with NCGS without adverse events. In particular, the changes in the score of the gluten-induced incomplete evacuation feeling and headaches were significantly improved. The serum levels of interleukin (IL)-8, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, andregulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) in subjects were not significantly changed by gluten, as expected from previous studies, and the enzyme mixture did not affect these inflammatory markers. CONCLUSION: In this human clinical study, we demonstrated the efficacy of the enzyme mixture derived from microorganisms and papaya in improving the symptoms of NCGS.
30528262	Management of celiac disease in daily clinical practice.	Celiac disease (CD) is the most common autoimmune enteropathy worldwide. In CD, dietary gluten triggers a T cell driven small intestinal inflammation in a subset of genetically predisposed subjects, expressing the HLA DQ2 and/or DQ8 genes on their antigen presenting cells. HLA DQ2/DQ8 can bind gluten peptides after their prior modification by the CD autoantigen, tissue transglutaminase (TG2). This process leads to the activation of gluten reactive T cells, small bowel villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia and intraepithelial lymphocytosis, the histological hallmarks of CD. The clinical picture of CD is extremely heterogeneous including intestinal (especially diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating) and extraintestinal (especially associated autoimmune diseases, anemia, osteoporosis) manifestations. The prevalence of CD in most parts of the world is estimated at 1:100-1:150 and its diagnosis is based on the presence of circulating autoantibodies (anti-TG2) and the histological detection of villous atrophy. Treatment is a lifelong gluten free diet but adjunctive therapies are in development. Although CD is a well-characterized disease, it is grossly underdiagnosed, despite the severe consequences of long-term gluten ingestion in CD, such as enhanced autoimmunity, refractory CD and intestinal T cell lymphoma. The aim of the presented review is to provide a clinical guide and to summarize the most recent clinical progress in CD research.
32097370	Severity of Villous Atrophy at Diagnosis in Childhood Does Not Predict Long-term Outcomes in Celiac Disease.	OBJECTIVES: Current pediatric guidelines allow noninvasive diagnosis of celiac disease in selected children. We investigated in a large cohort study whether the severity of villous atrophy at diagnosis is associated with clinical characteristics or long-term health outcomes, thus having a prognostic significance. METHODS: Comprehensive medical data on 906 children with celiac disease were analyzed. Long-term health outcomes of 503 adult patients diagnosed in childhood were moreover assessed with a specific study questionnaire and validated Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) and Psychological General Well-Being (PGWB) questionnaires. Patients were classified into 3 groups according to the severity of villous atrophy at diagnosis, and all variables were compared. RESULTS: Altogether 34% of the patients had partial, 40% subtotal, and 26% total villous atrophy. Children with milder lesions were diagnosed more recently (median year 2007 vs 2006 vs 2001, respectively, P < 0.001), more often by screening (30% vs 25% vs 17%, P < 0.001) and they suffered less often from anemia (16% vs 21% vs 32%, P < 0.001) and growth disturbances (22% vs 36% vs 54%, P < 0.001) and had lower transglutaminase-2 antibody levels (median 64 U/L vs 120 U/L vs 120 U/L, P < 0.001). There was no difference in other disease features.Altogether 212 adults diagnosed in childhood completed the questionnaires. Severity of villous atrophy at childhood diagnosis did not predict presence of complications or comorbidities, persistent symptoms, and self-perceived health, quality of life or adherence to a gluten-free diet in adulthood. CONCLUSION: Presence of advanced villous atrophy at diagnosis is associated with more severe clinical characteristics but not with poorer long-term health and treatment outcomes.
30428550	Possible Prevention of Diabetes with a Gluten-Free Diet.	Gluten seems a potentially important determinant in type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Intake of gluten, a major component of wheat, rye, and barley, affects the microbiota and increases the intestinal permeability. Moreover, studies have demonstrated that gluten peptides, after crossing the intestinal barrier, lead to a more inflammatory milieu. Gluten peptides enter the pancreas where they affect the morphology and might induce beta-cell stress by enhancing glucose- and palmitate-stimulated insulin secretion. Interestingly, animal studies and a human study have demonstrated that a gluten-free (GF) diet during pregnancy reduces the risk of T1D. Evidence regarding the role of a GF diet in T2D is less clear. Some studies have linked intake of a GF diet to reduced obesity and T2D and suggested a role in reducing leptin- and insulin-resistance and increasing beta-cell volume. The current knowledge indicates that gluten, among many environmental factors, may be an aetiopathogenic factors for development of T1D and T2D. However, human intervention trials are needed to confirm this and the proposed mechanisms.
33176106	The use of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in celiac disease diagnosis and treatment.	Introduction: Celiac disease is characterized by an abnormal immune activation driven by the ingestion of gluten from wheat, barley, and rye. Gluten-specific CD4+ T cells play an important role in disease pathogenesis and are detectable among peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Areas covered: This review summarizes the use of celiac disease patient PBMCs in clinical applications focusing on their exploitation in the development of diagnostic approaches and novel drugs to replace or complement gluten-free diet. Expert opinion: The most used PBMC-based methods applied in celiac disease research include ELISpot and HLA-DQ:gluten tetramer technology. ELISpot has been utilized particularly in research aiming to develop a celiac disease vaccine and in studies addressing the toxicity of different grains in celiac disease. HLA-DQ:gluten tetramer technology on the other hand initially focused on improving current diagnostics but in combination with additional markers it is also a useful outcome measure in clinical trials to monitor the efficacy of drug candidates. In addition, the technology serves well in the more detailed characterization of celiac disease-specific T cells, thereby possibly revealing novel therapeutic targets. Future studies may also reveal clinical applications for PBMC microRNAs and/or dendritic cells or monocytes present among PBMCs.
30367395	All that a physician should know about gluten-free diet.	Gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only definitive treatment for patients with celiac disease (CeD). Strict adherence to GFD improves the symptoms, nutritional deficiencies, and the overall well-being of the patients. The management of CeD is truly different and unique from the treatment of other medical or surgical diseases. While prescribing a GFD is easy, the key to the success lies in the dietary counseling by a nutrition specialist/physician and maintenance of adherence to the prescribed diet by the patient. When restricting gluten from all possible sources, it is pertinent to recommend a diet that is healthy and balanced for patients with celiac disease. Those following GFD must be counseled properly on the ways of balancing their diets and of avoiding cross contamination. They should be taught how to read food labels properly and given tips for dining out or during traveling. Regular follow up with patients is required for assessing the compliance and monitoring growth and the status of recovery. In this review article, we have compiled, for the physicians and gastroenterologists, the relevant information about GFD including counseling, adherence, nutritional adequacy, and many other related issues.
37090031	Nutritional status, nutrient imbalances, food-related behaviors and dietary supplements use among patients with celiac disease on a gluten free diet in Lebanon: a national cross-sectional study.	Background: Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten, that occurs in susceptible individuals and is associated with dietary restriction and subsequent nutritional deficiencies. This study investigated the diet quality, nutrition imbalances and nutrition status among young children,adolescents and adults with CD who were referred to several hospitals in Lebanon. Methods: A cross-sectional study in 50 individuals (31.74 +- 15.64 years) with CD who follow a gluten free diet was conducted, using biochemical parameters, anthropometric measurements, dietary and physical activity assessments. Results: Of the 50 participants, 38% and 16% were presenting low serum levels of iron and vitamin B12, respectively. The majority of participants were physically inactive and around 40% of them had low muscle mass. A weight loss of 10% to 30% indicating mild to moderate malnutrition was shown in 14% of individuals. The assessment of food-related behaviors shows that 80% of participants were reading nutrition labels and 96% of them were following gluten-free diets (GFD). Some barriers including family ignorance (6%), language of the nutrition labels (20%) and expensive GF products (78%) were limiting the adherence to GFD. The inadequacy of the daily energy intake along with insufficient intakes of calcium and vitamin D were remarked among individuals with CD. However, protein and iron intake were exceeding the recommendations among all age groups, except in males aged 4-8 years and 19-30 years. Half the study participants were using dietary supplements where 38%, 10%, 46%, 18%, 16% and 4% used vitamin D, vitamin B12, iron, calcium, folate and probiotics, respectively. Conclusion: GFD is the key treatment for CD. However, it is not without inadequacies and may cause certain deficiencies such as calcium and vitamin D leading to reduced bone density. This underlines the critical role of dietitians in education and maintenance of healthy GFD among individuals with CD.
29306516	Long term effects of gluten-free diet in non-celiac wheat sensitivity.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Information about the clinical outcome of patients with non-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCWS) treated with gluten-free diet (GFD) derive from studies assessing the symptom response in the first few weeks of treatment. We aimed to evaluate the clinical response to the GFD and the quality of life (QoL) of NCWS patients in the long term. METHODS: Forty-four NCWS (diagnosed according to the Salerno criteria) participated in the study. Participants rated their symptoms according to a 0-10 scale patients and filled in a QoL questionnaire (CDQ) before the beginning of the GFD and during a follow-up evaluation performed after at least one year. To assess the reliability of the questionnaire we also included a control group of 43 matched patients with celiac disease (CD). RESULTS: Upon diagnosis, NCWS patients had a high prevalence of intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms. Also, most symptoms were described as severe and the QoL questionnaire showed high scores. On follow-up, both prevalence and severity of the most common symptoms were significantly reduced. However, persistent intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms of mild severity were found in 65.9 and 72.7% of NCWS patients. In comparison, in the CD group, the prevalence was lower (32.6 and 23.2% respectively) and consistent with previous studies. The analyses of the determinant of QoL showed that, upon diagnosis, NCWS patients had higher scores in the CDQ "gastrointestinal symptoms" (p < 0.001), "emotional aspects" (p < 0.001) and "social problems" (p < 0.001) subclasses compared to CD patients. After the GFD, NCWS and CD patients shared similar scores in all of the subclasses. CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of NCWS patients still complains of intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms, even if significantly attenuated by the GFD, even years after the diagnosis. A comprehensive nutritional evaluation of these patients is required to further improve their symptoms and their QoL.
33338656	Determinants and Trends of Adherence to a Gluten-Free Diet in Adult Celiac Patients on a Long-term Follow-up (2000-2020).	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Data on factors governing long-term adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) in celiac disease (CD) are scarce. We aimed to determine trends and clinical predictors of long-term GFD adherence in adult CD. METHODS: Initial and long-term (>3 years) GFD adherence, clinical characteristics at baseline and follow-up were collected retrospectively from celiac patients followed-up over 20 years (2000-2020). Predictors of long-term GFD adherence at diagnosis, and follow-up were evaluated by multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: 248 patients (37 +- 12 years, 186F, median time on a GFD 90 months) were included. Twenty-five (10.1%) had only short-term follow-up (<3 years) while 223 (89.9%) had initial and long-term dietary assessment. 187/223 (83.9%) patients were initially adherent and 36/223 (16.1%) were not. 17/36 (47.2%) patients initially not adherent become adherent, while only 4/187 (2.1%) initially adherent patients became not adherent. In the long-term, 200/223 (89.7%) were adherent and 21/223 (9.4%) patients were not. Adherence improved more frequently than worsened (OR, 39.5; 95% CI, 11.4-178.5; P < .01). Classical symptoms (diarrhea, weight loss) at diagnosis of CD predicted stricter long-term GFD adherence (OR, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.21-8.81; P = .02), while anemia (OR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.12-0.82; P = .02) and dermatitis herpetiformis (OR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.06-0.91; P = .04) predicted poorer long-term adherence. At follow-up, initial GFD adherence (OR, 42.70; 95% CI, 10.70-171.00; P = .04) was the major determinant of long-term GFD adherence. CONCLUSIONS: GFD adherence changes over time in <10% of patients, generally improving when it does. Major determinants of long-term GFD adherence are classical symptoms at diagnosis and initial adherence to a GFD. Patients with anemia or dermatitis herpetiformis at diagnosis require stricter dietetic input.
31399743	Dietary Gluten as a Conditioning Factor of the Gut Microbiota in Celiac Disease.	The gut microbiota plays a relevant role in determining an individual's health status, and the diet is a major factor in modulating the composition and function of gut microbiota. Gluten constitutes an essential dietary component in Western societies and is the environmental trigger of celiac disease. The presence/absence of gluten in the diet can change the diversity and proportions of the microbial communities constituting the gut microbiota. There is an intimate relation between gluten metabolism and celiac disease pathophysiology and gut microbiota; their interrelation defines intestinal health and homeostasis. Environmental factors modify the intestinal microbiota and, in turn, its changes modulate the mucosal and immune responses. Current evidence from studies of young and adult patients with celiac disease increasingly supports that dysbiosis (i.e., compositional and functional alterations of the gut microbiome) is present in celiac disease, but to what extent this is a cause or consequence of the disease and whether the different intestinal diseases (celiac disease, ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease) have specific change patterns is not yet clear. The use of bacterial-origin enzymes that help completion of gluten digestion is of interest because of the potential application as coadjuvant in the current treatment of celiac disease. In this narrative review, we address the current knowledge on the complex interaction between gluten digestion and metabolism, celiac disease, and the intestinal microbiota.
31000461	Metabolic effects in patients with celiac disease, patients with nonceliac gluten sensitivity, and asymptomatic controls, after six months of a gluten-free diet.	INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: It is essential for patients with celiac disease (CD) to be on a gluten-free diet (GFD) but said diet has also been reported to increase the risk for metabolic syndrome. There is no evidence on the metabolic effects of a GFD in patients with nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) or in asymptomatic subjects. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the metabolic effects of a GFD over a 6-month period in patients with CD, patients with NCGS, and in asymptomatic controls (ACs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study was conducted that evaluated metabolic syndrome and its components of obesity, high blood pressure, hepatic steatosis, and hyperglycemia at the baseline and at 6 months. RESULTS: A total of 66 subjects (22 CD, 22 NCGS, and 22 AC) were included in the study. At the baseline, 10% of the patients with CD presented with obesity, high blood pressure, hepatic steatosis, and metabolic syndrome. After 6 months, obesity and metabolic syndrome increased by 20% (p=0.125). In the patients with NCGS, obesity increased by 5% after the GFD and 20% of those patients presented with de novo hepatic steatosis. The prevalence of obesity decreased by 10% in the controls after the GFD (30 vs 20%, p=0.5) and none of the other components of metabolic syndrome were affected. CONCLUSIONS: The metabolic benefits and risks of a GFD should be considered when prescribing said diet in the different populations that opt for that type of intervention.
29146521	HLA-DQ-Gluten Tetramer Blood Test Accurately Identifies Patients With and Without Celiac Disease in Absence of Gluten Consumption.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease is characterized by HLA-DQ2/8-restricted responses of CD4+ T cells to cereal gluten proteins. A diagnosis of celiac disease based on serologic and histologic evidence requires patients to be on gluten-containing diets. The growing number of individuals adhering to a gluten-free diet (GFD) without exclusion of celiac disease complicates its detection. HLA-DQ-gluten tetramers can be used to detect gluten-specific T cells in blood of patients with celiac disease, even if they are on a GFD. We investigated whether an HLA-DQ-gluten tetramer-based assay accurately identifies patients with celiac disease. METHODS: We produced HLA-DQ-gluten tetramers and added them to peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from 143 HLA-DQ2.5+ subjects (62 subjects with celiac disease on a GFD, 19 subjects without celiac disease on a GFD [due to self-reported gluten sensitivity], 10 subjects with celiac disease on a gluten-containing diet, and 52 presumed healthy individuals [controls]). T cells that bound HLA-DQ-gluten tetramers were quantified by flow cytometry. Laboratory tests and flow cytometry gating analyses were performed by researchers blinded to sample type, except for samples from subjects with celiac disease on a gluten-containing diet. Test precision analyses were performed using samples from 10 subjects. RESULTS: For the HLA-DQ-gluten tetramer-based assay, we combined flow-cytometry variables in a multiple regression model that identified individuals with celiac disease on a GFD with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value of 0.96 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.89-1.00) vs subjects without celiac disease on a GFD. The assay detected individuals with celiac disease on a gluten-containing diet vs controls with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value of 0.95 (95% CI 0.90-1.00). Optimized cutoff values identified subjects with celiac disease on a GFD with 97% sensitivity (95% CI 0.92-1.00) and 95% specificity (95% CI 0.84-1.00) vs subjects without celiac disease on a GFD. The values identified subjects with celiac disease on a gluten-containing diet with 100% sensitivity (95% CI 1.00-1.00]) and 90% specificity (95% CI 0.83-0.98) vs controls. In an analysis of 4 controls with positive results from the HLA-DQ-gluten tetramer test, 2 had unrecognized celiac disease and the remaining 2 had T cells that proliferated in response to gluten antigen in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: An HLA-DQ-gluten tetramer-based assays that detects gluten-reactive T cells identifies patients with and without celiac disease with a high level of accuracy, regardless of whether the individuals are on a GFD. This test would allow individuals with suspected celiac disease to avoid gluten challenge and duodenal biopsy, but requires validation in a larger study. Clinicaltrials.gov no: NCT02442219.

31009990	Feralgine  a New Approach for Iron Deficiency Anemia in Celiac Patients.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an immunologically-mediated disorder characterized by duodenal mucosa villi atrophy. Iron absorption is usually reduced in celiac patients making every kind of oral iron treatment unhelpful because of malasorption. Feralgine  is a new product that has been demonstrated to be more bioavailable. As such, the aim of our study was to evaluate the absorption of Feralgine  in adult patients with CD. METHODS: Twenty-six adults affected by Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA), of which 14 were also affected by CD and 12 were not affected by CD, were enrolled. An oral iron absorption test (OIAT) was performed in each patient by administrating Feralgine , and serum iron was evaluated at baseline (T0) and after 2 h (T1) from the oral iron ingestion. RESULTS: The OIAT was well tolerated in all patients, and, surprisingly, an equivalent statistically significant improvement in serum iron occurred in the two groups of patients (IDA plus CD: T0 = 28.21 microg/dL vs. T1 = 94.14 microg/dL p = 0.004 and IDA without CD: T0 = 34.91 microg/dL vs. T1 = 118.83 microg/dL, p = 0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated the high absorption of Feralgine  in celiac patients, confirming our previous data obtained with Ferrous Bysglicinate in children with CD.
31915797	Short children with impaired growth hormone secretion. Do they have celiac disease?	OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of celiac disease (CeD) in children with short stature (SS) and growth hormone deficiency (GHD). METHODS: This is a retrospective study of patients with isolated SS and GHD, diagnosed during the period 2002 to 2016. Their medical records were reviewed and serum tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibody results retrieved. Patients with positive serology results underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and small bowel biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of CeD. Clinical, anthropometric, and laboratory data were recorded for all patients. RESULTS: Of the 351 patients identified with GHD, 199 (56.7%) were male. The mean age+-SD was 9.0+-3.7 years (range: 2-17.6 years), and the mean+-SD height-for-age z score was -2.9+-1.3. Partial GHD constituted 42.2% and severe GHD constituted 57.8% of GHD diagnoses. The mean growth hormone (GH) peak level was 5.8+-3.9 ng/ml. Forty-seven patients (13.4%) had positive serology, and 14 (4%) had biopsy-proven CeD. No predictors could be identified through binary logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSION: A prevalence of CeD seropositivity was found in 13.4% and overt CeD in 4% of children with GHD. The finding of GHD should not preclude the search for CeD, because the majority will potentially improve on a gluten-free diet (GFD).

28922261	The Effect of Gluten-free Diet on Clinical Symptoms and the Intestinal Mucosa of Patients With Potential Celiac Disease.	In this prospective study, we evaluated the effect of gluten-free diet (GFD) in a cohort of 65 children with potential celiac disease. Patients received GFD for signs/symptoms (N = 47) or parents' choice (N = 18). Most frequent signs/symptoms were low body mass index (36%), recurrent abdominal pain (34%), and diarrhea (19%). Of the 35/47 patients followed-up on GFD, only 54% (19/35) showed a complete clinical response. In 9 of 65 patients an intestinal biopsy was also performed after at least 1 year of GFD. No significant differences were observed in terms of Marsh grade (P = 0.33), lamina propria CD25+ cells (P = 0.80), CD3+ (P = 0.9), and gammadelta+ (P = 0.59) intraepithelial lymphocytes density and intestinal anti-TG2 deposits (P = 0.60). In conclusion, caution is necessary before attributing all symptoms to gluten in this condition.
37806557	Comparison of weekly gluten immunogenic peptide measurement and conventional tools to assess adherence to the gluten-free diet in celiac disease: An observational prospective study.	AIM: Adherence to the gluten-free diet (GFD) is critical to achieve symptom control and mucosal healing in celiac disease (CeD), but its assessment is difficult. We sought to compare stool gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) measurements over a 4-week period with conventional tools commonly used to monitor compliance with a gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: Consecutive adult patients with CeD, attending the Small Bowel Section of the Buenos Aires Gastroenterology Hospital, were invited to this observational study, and were instructed to collect stool samples on Fridays for four consecutive weeks. Weekly average stool GIP concentration was measured was estimated. GIP results were compared with a self-assessment scale of adherence, specific-CeD serology, the celiac symptom index (CSI), and the assessment by expert dietitian. RESULTS: Fifty-three CeD patients were enrolled and those with stool GIP >=0.65 mug/g/week (n=13; 24.5%) had higher serum concentrations of IgA deamidated gliadin peptides (DGP) antibodies (69 [29-109] vs. 14 [13-29]; p=0.0005) and IgA tissue transglutaminase (tTG) (42 [14-200] vs. 10 [7-16]; p=0.02), higher proportion of cases with IgA DGP antibodies >20 AU/mL (84.6% vs. 33.3%; p=0.002), and a higher self-estimated adherence score (5 [4-9] vs. 9 [7-10]; p=0.003). GIP did not correlate with CSI scores (55.6% vs. 30.8%; p=0.9). Expert dietitian assessment identified 69% (OR: 5.25, [95% CI: 1.1-27.2]; p=0.01) of non-adherent cases when high stool GIP. Logistic regression analysis determined that IgA DGP (aOR: 1.1 [95% CI: 1.01-1.11]; p=0.02) and male sex (aOR: 28.3 [95% CI: 1.1-722.6]; p=0.04) were independently associated with excessive gluten exposure. CONCLUSION: Weekly stool GIP identifies gluten exposure that is not always detected by commonly used GFD adherence assessment methods. The higher the level of stool GIP, the better the predictive value of serology and dietitian interview. Stool GIP is a useful and practical test for GFD monitoring, particularly for risky gluten exposure in real life scenario.
30197183	Clinical guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of celiac disease in Mexico.	Celiac disease, celiac sprue, or gluten-sensitive enteropathy, is a generalized autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation and atrophy of the small bowel mucosa. It is caused by dietary exposure to gluten and affects genetically predisposed individuals. In Mexico, at least 800,000 are estimated to possibly have the disease, prompting the Asociacion Mexicana de Gastroenterologia to summon a multidisciplinary group of experts to develop the "Clinical guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of celiac disease in Mexico" and establish recommendations for the medical community, its patients, and the general population. The participating medical professionals were divided into three working groups and were given the selected bibliographic material by the coordinators (ART, LUD, JMRT), who proposed the statements that were discussed and voted upon in three sessions: two voting rounds were carried out electronically and one at a face-to-face meeting. Thirty-nine statements were accepted, and once approved, were developed and revised by the coordinators, and their final version was approved by all the participants. It was emphasized in the document that epidemiology and risk factors associated with celiac disease (first-degree relatives, autoimmune diseases, high-risk populations) in Mexico are similar to those described in other parts of the world. Standards for diagnosing the disease and its appropriate treatment in the Mexican patient were established. The guidelines also highlighted the fact that a strict gluten-free diet is essential only in persons with confirmed celiac disease, and that the role of gluten is still a subject of debate in relation to nonceliac, gluten-sensitive patients.
31401019	No major reduction in bone mineral density after long-term treatment of patients with Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND: At time of diagnosis, patients with celiac disease (CD) have been shown to have lower bone mineral density (BMD) than healthy controls. It is unclear whether adult patients with CD can regain a normal BMD after treatment with a gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: Patients diagnosed with CD as adults, who had been treated with GFD for a minimum of two years, were examined by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to determine BMD at femoral neck and spine L2-4. Adherence to GFD was measured using the Celiac Disease Adherence Test (CDAT) scoring tool. RESULTS: 143 CD patients underwent DXA assessment, mean age was 55.8 years and mean treatment duration was 9.3 years. 67% of the patients were women, and 51% of these were postmenopausal. The prevalence of low bone mass (Z-score <= -1.0) was 18.2% (95%CI: 12.7-25.3%) at femoral neck and 23.1% (95%CI: 16.9-30.6%) at spine L2-4. An increase in low bone density prevalence at spine L2-4 compared to the expected prevalence (p = 0.016) was limited to the postmenopausal women. In a multiple regression analysis, only postmenopausal status and poor adherence to GFD was independently associated with reduced bone density, this however limited to spine L2-4. CONCLUSION: Our study shows a small increase in the prevalence of low bone density at lumbar spine limited to the postmenopausal women. The main finding is that the majority of the CD patients after two years of treatment with GFD had a normal bone density when adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity and weight.
36469632	Effect of a gluten-free diet on bone mineral density in children and adolescents with celiac disease: Systematic review and meta-analysis.	Studies suggest an association between a gluten-free diet (GFD) and bone health in celiac disease (CD). However, the evidence on this relationship in children and adolescents is limited. Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to analyze the effect of GFD on the bone health and anthropometric profile of children and adolescents with CD. Five databases were searched up to January, 2022 to identify relevant studies. The studies' methodological quality was evaluated using two scales. The Hedge's g standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals were estimated using a random-effects model. The GRADE approach was used to assess the quality of evidence. Twenty-eight studies were included in the final review. GFD increased bone mineral content (BMC) (SMD = 0.39; 95%CI = 0.16, 0.62) and bone mineral density (BMD) (SMD = 0.29; 95%CI = 0.10, 0.47) in CD individuals. Difference in mean BMC and BMD between children and adolescents with CD versus healthy individuals was -0.49 (95%CI = -0.76, -0.22) and -0.47 (SMD = -95%CI = -0.72, -0.22), respectively. There was no difference in BMI and body fat among celiac children and adolescents versus healthy controls. In conclusion, GFD was associated with higher BMC and BMD in children and adolescents with CD.
32466557	The Gluten Free Diet's Impact on Growth in Children with Celiac Disease in Two Different Countries.	The effects of gluten free diet (GFD) on body mass index (BMI) and growth parameters in pediatric patients with celiac disease (CD) and their dependence on different socio-cultural environments are poorly known. We conducted an international retrospective study on celiac patients diagnosed at the University of Verona, Italy, and at the University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA, as underweight. A total of 140 celiac children and 140 controls (mean age 8.4 years) were enrolled in Chicago; 125 celiac children and 125 controls (mean age 7.3 years, NS) in Verona. At time of diagnosis, Italian celiac children had a weight slightly lower (p = 0.060) and a BMI z-score significantly (p < 0.001) lower than their American counterparts. On GFD, Italian celiac children showed an increased prevalence of both underweight (19%) as well as overweight (9%), while American children showed a decrease prevalence of overweight/obese. We concluded that while the GFD had a similar impact on growth of celiac children in both countries, the BMI z-score rose more in American than in Italian celiac children. Additionally, in Italy, there was an alarming increase in the proportion of celiac children becoming underweight. We speculate that lifestyle and cultural differences may explain the observed variations.
30652421	Online education for gluten-free diet teaching: Development and usability testing of an e-learning module for children with concurrent celiac disease and type 1 diabetes.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Celiac disease (CD), the most common genetically-based food intolerance, affects 3% to 16% of children with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Treatment involves lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). Individualized dietary education is resource-intensive. We, therefore, sought to develop and test the usability of an e-learning module aimed at educating patients and caregivers regarding implementation of the GFD in children with concurrent CD and T1D. METHODS: An interactive e-learning module was developed based on extensive review of CD, T1D, and educational literature. A mixed-methods usability testing approach was used to refine and evaluate the module, using qualitative semi-structured interviews, observations, and satisfaction and knowledge questionnaires in two iterative cycles. The module was refined based on themes identified from each usability cycle. RESULTS: Eighteen patients (8 in cycle 1, 10 in cycle 2) and 15 caregivers (7 in cycle 1, 8 in cycle 2) participated. Patient participants had CD and T1D for a mean (SD) of 6.1 +- 5.1 and 8.3 +- 5.5 years, respectively. Their mean age was 13.5 +- 4.5 years. Thematic analysis of usability interviews showed the module to be appealing and resulted in minor module revisions after each cycle to improve usability. Mean satisfaction scores post-module completion were high (4.67 +- 0.54), indicating participants were "very satisfied" with the education. Knowledge test scores increased significantly from pre- to post-module completion (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: A multifaceted user-centered usability approach demonstrated that an innovative, interactive e-learning module is effective in knowledge retention and can provide comprehensive and accessible information in the implementation of the GFD teaching in children with CD and T1D.
30986791	Rotavirus Vaccination Does Not Increase Type 1 Diabetes and May Decrease Celiac Disease in Children and Adolescents.	BACKGROUND: Rotavirus (RV) infection has been proposed to trigger type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1) and celiac disease (CD) by molecular mimicry in genetically susceptible children. If so, a live attenuated oral RV vaccine could also trigger these autoimmune diseases, or else, prevent the effect of wild-type RV infection. METHODS: In Rotavirus Efficacy and Safety Trial, conducted between 2001 and 2003, the participant children received RotaTeq (Kenilworth, NJ) vaccine or placebo in 1:1 ratio. The surveillance was extended as Finnish Extension Study. A questionnaire was sent in 2015 to the parents of 19,133 Finnish Extension Study participants and 5764 (30%) returned the questionnaire. Diagnosis of DM1, biopsy-proven CD and other autoimmune disease over the 11-14 year period were inquired. RESULTS: At the time of questionnaire, the prevalence of DM1 was similar in both groups, 0.97% (25 of 2580 children) in the placebo group and 1.04% (33 of 3184 children) in the vaccine group (P = 0.810). The prevalence of CD was significantly higher in placebo recipients (1.11%; confidence interval: 0.78%-1.6%) than in vaccine recipients (0.60%; confidence interval: 0.38%-0.93%) (P = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: RV vaccination using RotaTeq did not alter the occurrence of DM1 but decreased the prevalence of CD in childhood and adolescence. We propose that wild-type RV may trigger CD and the triggering effect can be prevented or reduced by RV vaccination.
31146067	Novel Nondietary Therapies for Celiac Disease.	Celiac Disease (CeD) is defined as a chronic small intestinal immune-mediated enteropathy that is precipitated by exposure to dietary gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. CeD is one of the most common autoimmune disorders affecting around 1% of the population worldwide. Currently, the only acceptable treatment for CeD is strict, lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) which can often present a challenging task. A GFD alone is not sufficient to control symptoms and prevent mucosal damage that can result from unintentional gluten exposure. Moreover, long-term complications can occur in many patients. Consequently, there is an unmet need for non-dietary therapies for the management of CeD. Such therapies could serve as an adjunct to the GFD but eventually may replace it. This review will focus on and discuss non-dietary therapies currently in clinical development for the management of CeD. METHODOLOGY: We searched clinicaltrials.gov and PubMed to extract articles about celiac disease. We used keywords including, but not limited to, "celiac disease," "non-dietary," "therapeutics," "pathophysiology," "Endopeptidases," "tight junction modulators," "vaccine," and "Nexvax2". We focused mainly on articles that conducted pathophysiologic and therapeutic research in human trials.
31739176	Effect of analytically measured fiber and resistant starch from gluten-free products on the diets of individuals with celiac disease.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present work was to assess the content of fiber and resistant starch (RS) in several gluten-free products (GFPs), compare them with their gluten-containing analogs (GCP) analytically and with label data, and measure the contribution of these foodstuffs to the fiber content of a gluten-free diet. METHODS: Total dietary fiber and RS content in a large amount of GFP (n = 55) and their counterparts (n = 55) were measured by analytical techniques based on AOAC methods. Dietary assessment was carried out with a sample of 141 individuals (pediatric and adult patients with celiac disease) submitted to a food frequency questionnaire and a 24-h recall survey (three times on different days). RESULTS: In general terms, GFP and GCP showed similar fiber and RS content, with the exception of breads, which revealed a higher percentage of both in GFPs. This food group was the main contributor to fiber intake in both groups of patients. Even if GFPs were to be blamed for being nutritionally poorer than GCPs, this was not the case for fiber. CONCLUSIONS: The fiber and RS content were not different in the studied samples, except for the bread. It is noteworthy that label information can underestimate fiber consumption among those with celiac disease, and this must be considered for future database revision. Additionally, we demonstrated a significant effect on the fiber intake of children and adults due to GFPs, and especially to bread, a widely consumed basic product.
32531982	Intestinal Permeability in Children with Celiac Disease after the Administration of Oligofructose-Enriched Inulin into a Gluten-Free Diet-Results of a Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Pilot Trial.	Abnormalities in the intestinal barrier are a possible cause of celiac disease (CD) development. In animal studies, the positive effect of prebiotics on the improvement of gut barrier parameters has been observed, but the results of human studies to date remain inconsistent. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of twelve-week supplementation of a gluten-free diet (GFD) with prebiotic oligofructose-enriched inulin (10 g per day) on the intestinal permeability in children with CD treated with a GFD. A pilot, randomized, placebo-controlled nutritional intervention was conducted in 34 children with CD, being on a strict GFD. Sugar absorption test (SAT) and the concentrations of intestinal permeability markers, such as zonulin, intestinal fatty acid-binding protein, claudin-3, calprotectin, and glucagon-like peptide-2, were measured. We found that the supplementation with prebiotic did not have a substantial effect on barrier integrity. Prebiotic intake increased excretion of mannitol, which may suggest an increase in the epithelial surface. Most children in our study seem to have normal values for intestinal permeability tests before the intervention. For individuals with elevated values, improvement in calprotectin and SAT was observed after the prebiotic intake. This preliminary study suggests that prebiotics may have an impact on the intestinal barrier, but it requires confirmation in studies with more subjects with ongoing leaky gut.
35437007	Biochemical abnormalities among patients referred for celiac disease antibody blood testing in a primary health care setting.	To investigate possible biochemical abnormalities associated with celiac disease (CD) antibody positivity in a primary health care setting and thereby identify predictors that could potentially reduce diagnostic delay and underdiagnosis of CD. This observational cohort study included measurements of CD antibodies in the Copenhagen Primary Care Laboratory (CopLab) database from 2000 to 2015; CD antibody positivity was defined as tissue transglutaminase antibody IgA or IgG >= 7 kU/L and/or deamidated gliadin peptide antibody IgG >= 10 kU/L. Individuals with a prior diagnosis of CD were excluded. We examined differences between individuals with positive and negative CD antibody tests regarding the results of biochemical tests performed six months before and one month after the date of the CD antibody test. We identified 76,265 measurements of CD antibodies during 2000-2015, and 57,061 individuals met the inclusion criteria (706 antibody-positive and 56,355 antibody-negative). We found lower ferritin, hemoglobin, cobalamin and folic acid levels and higher levels of transferrin, ALAT (alanine transaminase), and alkaline phosphate among individuals with a positive CD antibody test. Furthermore, we illustrated more measurements below the sex-specific reference intervals for hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), ferritin, cobalamin and folic acid among individuals with a positive CD antibody test. This study identified several biochemical abnormalities associated with CD antibody positivity among individuals referred to CD antibody testing. The pattern of abnormalities suggested that micronutrient deficiencies were prevalent among CD antibody-positive individuals, confirming malabsorption as a sign of CD. These findings illustrate the possibility of reducing diagnostic delay and underdiagnosis of CD.
32397695	Pilot study on non-celiac gluten sensitivity: effects of Bifidobacterium longum ES1 co-administered with a gluten-free diet.	BACKGROUND: Bifidobacterium longum ES1 is a strain probiotic, colonizing the human gut and capable of a degradative action on gliadin. In an attempt to find new nutritional solutions aimed at improving the quality of life of patients with non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) we evaluated the effectiveness of this strain, in association with a gluten-free diet, comparing its efficacy versus diet therapy alone. METHODS: The experimental design included a non-randomized, open-label, 1:1 intervention study in parallel groups. Enrolled patients with symptoms attributable to NCGS, and with negative diagnoses of both wheat allergy and celiac disease, were included in this three-month trial divided into four outpatient visits (baseline, T1, T2 and T3). Fifteen patients for each group completed the experimental protocol. RESULTS: Our results showed that a combination of diet and probiotic determined a more significant reduction in the frequency and intensity of intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms, and a clear improvement in stool consistency. CONCLUSIONS: Although the study was carried out on a small number of patients, the results of our pilot trial suggest that a combined strategy of naturally gluten-free diet therapy with administration of the probiotic strain ES1 appears to offer a greater advantage than the dietary regime alone in improving the clinical symptomatic picture and in stabilizing the intestinal microbiota.
29534461	Assessment of Mycotoxin Exposure in Breastfeeding Mothers with Celiac Disease.	OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk of mycotoxin exposure (aflatoxin M1, ochratoxin A, and zearalenone) in celiac disease (CD) breastfeeding mothers and healthy control mothers, as well as in their offspring, by quantifying these contaminants in breast milk. STUDY DESIGN: Thirty-five breastfeeding women with CD on a gluten-free diet and 30 healthy breastfeeding controls were recruited. Milk sampling was performed three times per day for three consecutive days. Mycotoxin content was investigated by an analytical method using immunoaffinity column clean-up and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorometric detection. RESULTS: Aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) was detected in 37% of CD group samples (mean +- SD = 0.012 +- 0.011 ng/mL; range = 0.003-0.340 ng/mL). The control group showed lower mean AFM1 concentration levels in 24% of the analyzed samples (0.009 +- 0.007 ng/mL; range = 0.003-0.067 ng/mL, ANOVA on ranks, p-value < 0.01). Ochratoxin A and zearalenone did not differ in both groups. CONCLUSION: Breast milk AFM1 contamination for both groups is lower than the European safety threshold. However, the estimated exposures of infants from CD mothers and control mothers was much higher ( 15 times and  11 times, respectively) than the threshold set by the joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). Since incongruities exist between JECFA and the European Union standard, a novel regulatory review of the available data on this topic is desirable. Protecting babies from a neglected risk of high AFM1 exposure requires prompt regulatory and food-control policies.
31203642	[Quality of life of consumers following a gluten-free diet. Results of a questionnaire survey in Hungary and Romania].	Introduction and aim: With the rising consumer's health awareness, especially towards patients with celiac disease, gluten has become a food ingredient to be avoided by many people expecting various positive health effects. The strict adherence of diet requires serious abandonments and lifestyle changes that affect directly their quality of life. The aim of the present study was to recognise the quality of life of Hungarian and Romanian consumers following a gluten-free diet as well as to explore the negative effects on them. Method: An online questionnaire survey was conducted upon 1155 Hungarian and Romanian respondents. Results: For gluten-free consumers, self-control was relatively easy to overcome, but their lifestyle was negatively affected by social events and dining out. In addition, diet adherence was a burden from both lifestyle and financial point of view. For Hungarian consumers, external factors such as price, choice, taste and availability of products had become a major obstacle, while Romanian ones were more likely to be affected by internal factors (product information, diet knowledge, lifestyle, self-control). Mandatory labelling of substances and products causing allergies and intolerances has achieved its purpose, as it has made it easier for consumers on diet to choose food and increased their confidence. Conclusions: The study points out that dieters' quality of life can be enhanced not only by general actions (improving the preparedness of out-of-home meal services and rationalising the price of products), but also through country-specific community intervention.

33407153	Non-celiac wheat sensitivity: rationality and irrationality of a gluten-free diet in individuals affected with non-celiac disease: a review.	Non-celiac gluten or wheat sensitivity (NCWS) is a "clinical entity induced by the ingestion of wheat leading to intestinal and/or extraintestinal symptoms that improve once the wheat-containing foodstuff is removed from the diet, and celiac disease and wheat allergy have been excluded". This mostly accepted definition raises several points that remain controversial on this condition. In the present review, the authors summarize the most recent advances in the clinic and research on NCWS through an accurate analysis of different studies. We screened PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Scopus using the keywords "non-celiac gluten sensitivity", "non-celiac wheat sensitivity", and "diagnosis". We would like to emphasize two main points, including (A) the controversial clinical and etiological aspects in different trials and experiences with particular attention to the Salerno criteria for the diagnosis of NCWS and (B) the histological aspects. The etiology of NCWS remains controversial, and the relationship with irritable bowel syndrome is obscure. Histologically, the duodenal mucosa may show a variable pattern from unremarkable to a slight increase in the number of T lymphocytes in the superficial epithelium of villi. The endorsement of this disease is based on a positive response to a gluten-free diet for a limited period, followed by the reappearance of symptoms after gluten challenge. The Salerno expert criteria may help to diagnose NCWS accurately. Social media and inaccurate interpretation of websites may jeopardize the diagnostic process if individuals self-label as gluten intolerant.
34959996	Compliance to a Gluten-Free Diet in Swedish Children with Type 1 Diabetes and Celiac Disease.	Children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are at increased risk of celiac disease (CD). The replacement of insulin in T1D, and the exclusion of gluten in CD, are lifelong, burdensome treatments. Compliance to a gluten-free diet (GFD) in children with CD is reported to be high, while compliance in children with both diseases has scarcely been studied. To examine compliance to a GFD in children with both T1D and CD, we analyzed tissue transglutaminase IgA-antibodies (tTGA). Moreover, associations between compliance and age, sex, glycemic control, ketoacidosis (DKA), body mass index (BMI), and time of CD diagnosis were investigated. Of the 743 children diagnosed with T1D in southern Sweden between 2005 and 2012, 9% were also diagnosed with CD. Of these, 68% showed good compliance to a GFD, 18% showed intermediate compliance, and 14% were classified as non-compliant. Higher age, poorer HbA1c, and more DKAs were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with poorer compliance. In conclusion, we found that compliance to a GFD in children with T1D and CD is likely be lower than in children with CD only. Our results indicate that children with both T1D and CD could need intensified dietary support and that older children and children with poor metabolic control are especially vulnerable subgroups.
36984425	Celiac Disease and the Gluten Free Diet during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Experiences of Children and Parents.	The COVID-19 pandemic perturbed the everyday life of children and those with chronic illnesses, along with the lives of their families. Patients with celiac disease (CD) follow a strict gluten-free diet (GFD), and gluten ingestion is associated with negative health outcomes. The aim of this study was to investigate the experiences of children with CD and their families concerning their GFD, symptoms and CD management during the first period of the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was performed including 37 Dutch pediatric patients with CD, along with their parents. The majority reported good compliance to the GFD and stated that the diet was easier to follow during the pandemic, mainly due to eating more meals in the home. Some discovered a greater variety of GF products by utilizing online shopping, potentially increasing the financial burden of the GFD. Concerning general dietary habits, 21.6% reported a healthier eating pattern, in contrast to 37.8% and 10.8% who consumed more unhealthy snacks and fewer fruits and vegetables, respectively, than normal during the pandemic. The natural experiment of the COVID-19 pandemic provides valuable information regarding the management of pediatric CD. Education on healthy dietary patterns is important, especially for children with restrictive diets, and the findings of this study show that there is room for improvement in this respect, regardless of the current pandemic.
36569268	Prevalence of functional gastrointestinal disorders in children with celiac disease on different types of gluten-free diets.	BACKGROUND: Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are common during the pediatric age. FGIDs are not related to biochemical or structural abnormalities. However, since they have a high prevalence, several studies have evaluated an overlap between FGIDs and organic diseases. Individuals with celiac disease (CD) have been shown to be at an increased risk for functional abdominal pain, even if they adhere well to a gluten-free diet (GFD). Little information is available for the pediatric age group. The aims of our study were to evaluate the prevalence of FGIDS in CD children 1 year after diagnosis and to compare the prevalence of FGIDs in CD children on a GFD with processed foods compared with those on a GFD with natural products. AIM: To assess the prevalence of FGIDs in children with CD after 1 year of follow-up and to compare the prevalence of FGIDs in children with CD on a GFD with processed foods and in children on a GFD with natural products. METHODS: We recruited pediatric patients aged 1-18 years with a new CD diagnosis. Participants were randomized to two groups: Group A on a GFD with processed foods (diet 1); and group B on a GFD with natural products (diet 2). Clinical monitoring, diet assessment and the questionnaire on pediatric gastrointestinal symptoms-Rome IV version were performed at diagnosis (T0) and after 12 mo of follow-up (T1). Dietary intake was assessed using a 3-d food diary record. Data from the diaries were evaluated using WinFood nutrient analysis software. We assessed the prevalence of FGIDs at T1 and the correlation with the type of GFD. RESULTS: We registered 104 CD children, with 55 patients in group A (53.0%) and 49 patients in group B (47.0%). Initially, 30 of the 55 (54.5%) CD children were symptomatic in group A, while 25 of 49 (51.0%) were symptomatic in group B. At T1, in spite of a low or negative serology for CD, FGIDs prevalence was 10/55 (18.0%) in group A and 8/49 (16.3%) in group B, with no statistically significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.780). At T1 the macro- and micronutrient intake was similar across the two groups with no significant differences in nutrient analysis. However, in both groups at T1 we found that a lower prevalence of FGIDs (P = 0.055) was associated with an inferior caloric (odds ratio = 0.99, 95% confidence interval: 0.99-1.00) and fat (odds ratio = 0.33, 95% confidence interval: 0.65-0.95) intake. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that CD children on a GFD have gastrointestinal symptoms with an elevated prevalence of FGIDs. Our study suggests that developing FGIDs may be linked to caloric intake and percentage of food fat, but it does not change between a GFD with processed foods or a GFD with natural products. However, long-term monitoring is required to evaluate a correlation between FGIDs and various types of GFDs.
31729208	How diabetes type 1 affects immune response to hepatitis B virus vaccine in pediatric population? Evaluation of a booster dose in unresponsive subjects with type 1 diabetes.	BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine reduced the incidence of Hepatitis B worldwide. Genetic variability , by the presence of specific haplotypes of HLA system (HLA-DR3, HLA-DR4) , influences the response to the vaccination. Subjects affected by T1D, contrary to non-diabetics, have a high prevalence of Hepatitis B. METHODS: The objective of the study was to evaluate anti-HBs antigen (anti-HBsAg) antibody (Ab) in a group of 201 children (age range: 2 - 18 years), regularly vaccinated against HBV according to the national vaccination schedule. Patients with anti-HBs Ab >=10 mlU/mL have been defined "Responders" and those with anti-HBs Ab<10mlU/mL have been defined "Non-Responders".The possible association between the Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) and a low immune response to the vaccine has been subsequently valued. Besides the presence of T1D, other possible influential variables have been studied: sex, age, presence of celiac disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis, intervening years from the diagnosis of diabetes and presence/absence of diabetic ketoacidosis at time of diagnosis. RESULTS: Among the 201 subjects with type 1 diabetes, 90 (44.8%) were Responders, while 111 (55.2%) were non-Responders; among the 145 subjects without type 1 diabetes, 86 (59.3%) were Responders and 59 (40.7%) non-Responders. We invited "Subjects with type 1 diabetes Non-Responders" to undergo a booster dose of the same vaccine. Of these, 21 refused the booster, reducing the sample to 90 patients. After 4 weeks from the booster dose 81 patients showed seroconversion ("false Non-Responders"), and 9 did not("true Non-Responders"). CONCLUSIONS: After the booster dose, immune response in our cross-section has been similar to general population. Given the high frequency of "false Non-Responders" anti-HBsAg Ab should be tested in T1D patients and a booster dose should be administrated in Non-Responders.
32574219	Characterization of white and red sorghum flour and their potential use for production of extrudate crisps.	In the human food industry, the wheat-free market sales have increased over the years due to awareness of wheat gluten allergy and celiac disease. Sorghum is a gluten-free grain with great potential to address shortcomings in this market. The aim of this study was to evaluate the milling process and flour quality of one white and one red sorghum varieties and evaluate extrusion as a potential process to produce sorghum crisps. The white and red sorghum grains were milled into flour in three production cycles. Flour quality was evaluated by determination of nutritional composition, pasting, and thermal profile. Extrusion processing of white and red sorghum flour was performed, and macrostructure of final product was evaluated. The white and red sorghum used in this study yielded similar flour content (P > 0.05). Chemical analyses revealed a higher protein and lower starch content for white sorghum than red sorghum flour (P < 0.05); however, their pasting properties did not differ. Initial and peak gelatinization temperatures were higher (P < 0.05) for red sorghum compared to white sorghum flour. Regarding particle size, white sorghum flour presented lower d10 and d50 compared to the red sorghum flour (P < 0.05). However, these differences did not impact the extrusion conditions, and white and red sorghum crisps had similar macrostructure characteristics. In conclusion, although differences in nutritional, thermal, and particle size properties were observed between the sorghum flours used in this study, changes in extrusion parameters were not needed in order to produce sorghum crisps with similar characteristics.
37610566	Experiences and difficulties for primary caretakers of children with celiac disease - A qualitative study.	BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to understand the experiences of primary caretakers (PCTs) with a child diagnosed with celiac disease (CeD). There is paucity of research in understanding the experiences of PCTs of children with CeD in India. METHODS: Purposive sampling was used to select PCTs of CeD-affected children from a tertiary hospital in New Delhi. Ten PCTs took part in the investigation. To gather the data, semi-structured interviews were held with participants. Hindi was used to administer the interviews. RESULTS: The current study focused on the difficulties and worries PCTs experience in managing CeD. The main themes and sub-themes that emerged from the data were diagnosis of CeD (misdiagnosis of CeD, late diagnosis of CeD, feelings at the time of diagnosis, help from a doctor/nutritionist at the time of diagnosis); characteristics of CeD (CeD as a new disease, CeD as an allergy); attitude towards wheat (wheat as a poison, ignorance regarding negative effect of wheat); influence of significant others (making fun of the child, queries from others are a source of worry, non-acceptance of celiac disease by others and pressure to give gluten to the child); issues in following gluten-free diet (GFD) (fear of cross-contamination, distrust on GFD available outside home, GFD is expensive, making GFD is difficult, joint family, non-adherence to GFD, making non-GFD along with GFD); effect of CeD (financial effect of CeD, effect on physical and mental health of the child and PCT, effect on social life, change in family dynamics, eating restrictions); management of CeD (GFD for the whole family to manage CeD, family support to manage CeD, adhering to GFD, early diagnosis); and concerns (future marital concern for the child, cure of CeD, proper physical growth). CONCLUSION: The current study gave an understanding of how PCTs dealt with a child's CeD. The difficulties and worries of caretakers should be taken into consideration and appropriate recommendations made to lessen the strain of managing the child's CeD and the daily obstacles associated with it.
31977451	Is Peer Support in Group Clinics as Effective as Traditional Individual Appointments? The First Study in Patients With Celiac Disease.	INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease (CD) is common, affecting approximately 1% of the population. The cornerstone of management is a gluten-free diet, with dietetic advice being the key to aiding implementation. The aim of the study was to assess group clinics in comparison with traditional individual appointments. METHODS: Patients with a new diagnosis of CD, confirmed histologically, were prospectively recruited over 18 months in Sheffield, United Kingdom. Patients received either a group clinic or traditional one-to-one appointment, led by a dietitian. Quality-of-life questionnaires were completed at baseline, as well as biochemical parameters being recorded. Patients were followed up at 3 months, where adherence scores were assessed as well as biochemical parameters and quality of life questionnaires being completed. RESULTS: Sixty patients with CD were prospectively recruited and received either an individual (n = 30) or group clinic (n = 30). A statistically significant reduction in tissue transglutaminase was noted following group clinics (mean 58.5, SD 43.4 U/mL vs mean 13.2, SD 5.7 U/mL, P < 0.01). No significant differences in baseline and follow-up biochemical parameters between one-to-one and group clinics were noted. At follow-up, there was no statistically significant difference between mean gluten-free diet adherence scores (mean 3.1, SD 0.4 vs mean 3.1, SD 0.7, P = 0.66) between one-to-one and group clinics. DISCUSSION: This first study assessing group clinics in CD demonstrates they are as effective as traditional one-to-one clinics, with the added benefits of peer support and greater efficiency, with an estimated 54% reduction of dietetic resources.
38309373	Celiac disease and depressive disorders as nutritional implications related to common factors - A comprehensive review.	Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated disease affecting the small intestine. The only treatment strategy for CD is the gluten-free diet (GFD). One of the more common mental disorders in CD patients is major depressive disorder (MDD). The influence of GFD on the occurrence of MDD symptoms in patients with CD will be evaluated. This diet often reduces nutritional deficiencies in these patients and also helps to reduce depressive symptoms. Both disease entities are often dominated by the same deficiencies of nutrients such as iron, zinc, selenium, iodine, or B and D vitamins. Deficiencies of particular components in CD can favor MDD and vice versa. Gluten can adversely affect the mental state of patients without CD. Also, intestinal microbiota may play an important role in the described process. This work aims to comprehensively assess the common factors involved in the pathomechanisms of MDD and CD, with particular emphasis on nutrient imbalances. Given the complexity of both disease entities, and the many common links, more research related to improving mental health in these patients and the implementation of a GFD would need to be conducted, but it appears to be a viable pathway to improving the quality of life and health of people struggling with CD and MDD. Therefore, probiotics, micronutrients, macronutrients, and vitamin supplements are recommended to reduce the risk of MDD, given that they may alleviate the symptoms of both these disease entities. In turn, in patients with MDD, it is worth considering testing for CD.
37049545	The Role of Diet in Children with Psoriasis: Emerging Evidence and Current Issues.	Psoriasis is an immune-mediated inflammatory systemic disease with skin tropism and chronic relapsing course; it is associated with an increased cardiovascular risk and with many metabolic comorbidities, emerging during childhood in 22-33% of cases. Diet influences the presentation and the clinical course of inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis; in particular, it was shown that a Mediterranean, gluten-free, or low-calorie diet may positively affect disease control in adult patients with psoriasis and adequate pharmacological therapy. These three dietary regimens may play a role also in children with psoriasis. It has been demonstrated that pediatric psoriasis is associated with psychological stress, celiac disease, and obesity, which may be positively influenced by these dietary regimens, respectively. Therefore, the expertise of multiple health figures (gastroenterologists, nutritionists, pediatricians, dermatologists) is required to plan a tailor-made dietary strategy, ensuring good growth, through an adequate intake of essential micro- and macronutrients and, at the same time, impacting the pro-inflammatory biochemical profile and on the associated cardiovascular risk of psoriasis disease.
35980500	Baking Process Effects and Combined Cowpea Flour and Sorghum Bran on Functional Properties of Gluten-Free Cookies.	Gluten-related disorders, including celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity, are growing worldwide. The only treatment for both disorders is a lifelong gluten-free diet. However, gluten-free foods are generally poorer in nutrients, less healthy, and have a high cost. Sorghum and cowpea are gluten-free grains with high levels of phenolic compounds (PC) and a low cost. Their phenolic profile is structurally different; thus, the blend of both can provide synergistic/complementary health benefits to the final product. This study analyzed the effect of baking process and the blend of cowpea flour (CP) and sorghum bran (SB) on the levels of PC, resistant starch (RS), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and antioxidant capacity (AC) of gluten-free cookies. Eleven rice or cowpea cookie formulations were made with or without white sorghum bran (WSB) or black sorghum bran (BSB). Baking increased the extractability of PC, AC, and the NDF of almost all formulations. The PC and AC were, respectively, about twice and 3-5 times higher in cookies containing BSB compared to the others. There was a minor effect of WSB on the PC and AC. Although there were losses, the retention of RS of cookies after the baking process was between 49.8 and 92.7%. Sorghum bran has excellent potential for use as a functional ingredient in healthy food production. The combined CP and SB have great potential to improve the nutritional and functional properties of gluten-free products, especially the PC, RS, and NDF contents.
33198516	The potential benefits of camps for children and adolescents with celiac disease on social support, illness acceptance, and health-related quality of life.	Among N = 165 14-22-year-old bearers of celiac disease (CD), the German-based study examined if participation in camps for children with CD is related to higher CD-related quality of life (CD-QoL); N = 48 of the study participants attended at least one camp. Camp participation was found to be related to higher CD-QoL, an effect mediated by having more friends with CD and by perceiving higher social support. Camp participation was also associated with higher illness acceptance and lower anxiety. Results show the potential benefits of recreational activities in CD treatment, to be further examined in experimental research.
34418405	Current pharmacological approaches and potential future therapies for Celiac disease.	Celiac Disease (CeD) is estimated to currently affect 2 million Americans in the United States. This autoimmune disorder occurs when the consumption of gluten-based products leads to an inflammatory response in the small intestine. Over time, this inflammatory response permanently damages the villi in the small intestine. Celiac disease patients generally present with fatigue, diarrhea, and weight loss due to the disease. The current gold standard for diagnosing CeD is the endoscopy with duodenal biopsy indicating villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia. No FDA-approved medication exists for the treatment of CeD and the only recommended course to alleviate CeD induced symptoms is to abstain from consuming any gluten-based products. There are several clinical trials actively developing and testing pharmacological approaches to treat CeD. Two of the further advanced clinical trials include AT-1001 (Larazotide acetate) and IMGX-003 (Latiglutenase; formerly known as ALV003) therapies. These drugs aim to alleviate celiac disease-induced symptoms using two different approaches. AT-1001 aims to close the villi's tight junctions, while IMGX-003 acts as a gluten endopeptidase that degrades gluten before being absorbed in the small intestine. This review article summarizes the various preclinical research and clinical trials being conducted and specifies the mechanism by which these drugs function.
37049494	The Impact of Different Types of Rice and Cooking on Postprandial Glycemic Trends in Children with Type 1 Diabetes with or without Celiac Disease.	The aims of this study were to evaluate: (i) the chemical and nutritional composition of rice before and after cooking and (ii) postprandial glycemic impacts in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) after eating two different types of rice ("Gigante Vercelli" white rice and "Artemide" black rice) or white rice cooked "risotto" style or boiled using an advanced hybrid closed loop (AHCL) system (Tandem Control-IQTM). General composition and spectrophotometric analyses of raw and cooked rice were performed. Eight T1D subjects (four males and four females, aged 11 +- 1.4 years), two with celiac disease (CD), using an AHCL system were enrolled. "Gigante Vercelli" white rice cooked as risotto or boiled and boiled "Artemide" rice were prepared by the same cook on two evenings. Continuous glucose monitoring metrics were evaluated for 12 h after meal consumption. Total dietary fiber was higher for both rice types after cooking compared with raw rice. Cooking as risotto increased polyphenols and antioxidants (p < 0.05) in both rice varieties, and total starch decreased after boiling (p < 0.05) in white rice. There was a significant peak in glycemia after consuming risotto and boiled white rice (p < 0.05), while the mean glycemic peak remained <180 mg/dL in individuals eating boiled Artemide rice. There were no significant differences in automatic basal or auto-bolus insulin deliveries by the AHCL according to different types of rice or cooking method. Our findings suggest that glycemic trends are impacted by the different chemical and nutritional profiles of rice but are nevertheless well controlled by AHCL systems.
29851812	Diagnostic challenges of celiac disease in a young child: A case report and a review of the literature.	RATIONALE: Celiac disease is a chronic, immune-mediated, multiorgan disorder that affects susceptible individuals, and it is triggered by gluten and other prolamins. PATIENT CONCERNS: We present the case of a 1-year-old male child, with a history of idiopathic pericardial effusion, admitted in our clinic for severe abdominal bloating, irritability, loss of appetite and intermittent diarrheic stools. The clinical findings were: influenced general status, irritability, distended abdomen, and diffuse abdominal tenderness. DIAGNOSES: The initial laboratory tests revealed anemia, leukocytosis, increased inflammatory biomarkers, high levels of transaminases, and hypoalbuminemia. The stool culture identified an enterocolitis with enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (E. coli). INTERVENTIONS: We initiated antibiotic treatment, substitution therapy with human albumin and probiotics with initial favorable evolution, but after 1 month, the patient was re-admitted for the persistence of intermittent diarrheic stools and abdominal bloating, when we established the diagnosis of cow's milk protein allergy. We initiated diary-free diet. OUTCOMES: Unfortunately, the patient was re-admitted after another 8 months, presenting the same clinical and laboratory findings as during the initial admission. We repeated the serology for celiac disease and we performed an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with duodenal biopsies, which established the diagnosis of celiac disease. After 1 month of gluten-free diet, the patient's evolution improved considerably. LESSONS: Enterocolitis with E. coli could be considered as trigger for CD in our case. The diagnosis of CD in small children can be hindered by an insufficient gluten-exposure, and can lead to a delay in the diagnosis as in the case presented above.
37497810	A dietitian-led coeliac service helps to identify and reduce involuntary gluten ingestion with subsequent reduction in the frequency of repeat endoscopies.	BACKGROUND: Dietitian-led coeliac clinics have the potential to be a cost-effective way of monitoring patients living with coeliac disease (CD). The aim of this service evaluation was to explore the impact of a dietitian-led coeliac clinic on gluten-free diet (GFD) adherence and the frequency of endoscopies with repeat duodenal biopsies. METHODS: Adults with biopsy-proven CD were transferred to a new dietitian-led coeliac clinic where data were collected from medical records and analysed using SPSS. GFD adherence was assessed by a specialist dietitian, specialist nurse, consultant gastroenterologists and a validated GFD adherence questionnaire. Repeat duodenal biopsy findings were compared with the most recent dietitian GFD adherence assessment. Project and ethics approval was granted by the hospital trust and affiliated university. RESULTS: Data from 170 patients (White: 51%, South Asian: 45%) are presented, with most being 35-64 years old (61%). Specialist dietitian assessments identified 67 (39%) of patients were adhering to the GFD, whereas prior gastroenterologist or coeliac nurse assessments identified 122 (72%) (p < 0.001) and the validated GFD adherence questionnaire identified 97 (57%) (p < 0.001). Dietitian assessments identified involuntary gluten consumption in 39/104 (38%) of those who self-reported GFD adherence, consequently avoiding the need for nine endoscopies with repeat duodenal biopsies once patients had received dietary education from the dietitian. On follow-up, within the dietitian-led coeliac clinic, significantly fewer patients consumed gluten involuntarily (14%, p < 0.001). In addition, a reduction in voluntary gluten consumption was observed from three to five to one to two times per month (p < 0.001) in 66 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The dietitian-led coeliac clinic helped to identify involuntary gluten ingestion, avoid repeat endoscopies with duodenal biopsies and was associated with significantly improved GFD adherence.

32316404	Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Gluten-Related Disorders.	Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is frequently associated with celiac disease (CD) and nonceliac gluten/wheat sensitivity (NCGS/NCWS), but epidemiological and pathophysiological aspects are still unclear. Furthermore, a gluten-free diet (GFD) can positively influence IBS symptoms. Methods: A comprehensive online search for IBS related to CD, NCGS and GFD was made using the Pubmed, Medline and Cochrane databases. Results: Although a systematic screening for CD in IBS is not recommended, CD prevalence can be increased in diarrhea-predominant IBS patients. On the other hand, IBS symptoms can be persistent in treated CD patients, and their prevalence tends to decrease on a GFD. IBS symptoms may overlap and be similar to those associated to nonceliac gluten and/or wheat sensitivity. Increased gut permeability could explain the gluten/wheat effects in IBS patients. Finally, a GFD could improve symptoms in a subgroup of IBS patients. Conclusions: The possible interplay between IBS and gluten-related disorders represents a scientifically and clinically challenging issue. Further studies are needed to confirm these data and better clarify the involved pathophysiological mechanisms.
29392873	Gluten-free diet during pregnancy alleviates signs of diabetes and celiac disease in NOD mouse offspring.	BACKGROUND: Gluten-free (GF) diet during pregnancy ameliorates autoimmune diabetes in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse offspring. Due to comorbidity of celiac disease in type 1 diabetes, we hypothesized that GF diet in utero alleviates the humoral and histopathological signs of celiac disease in NOD mice. We aimed to establish the mechanisms behind the diabetes-protective effect of GF diet in utero. METHODS: Breeding pairs of NOD mice were fed a GF or gluten-containing standard (STD) diet until parturition. The offspring were nursed by mothers on STD diet and continued on this diet until ages 4 and 13 weeks. Analyses of serum antitissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) intestine and islet histology, islet transglutaminase (TG) activity, and cytokine expression in T cells from lymphoid organs were performed. RESULTS: GF versus STD diet in utero led to reduced serum anti-tTG titre and increased villus-to-crypt ratio at both ages. Insulitis along with systemic and local inflammation were decreased, but islet TG activity was unchanged in 13-week-old GF mice. These mice had unchanged beta-cell volumes, but increased islet numbers throughout the prediabetic period. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, GF diet administered during pregnancy improves signs of celiac disease and autoimmune diabetes in the offspring. The diabetes-ameliorative effect of GF diet in utero is followed by dampening of inflammation, unchanged beta-cell volume, but increased islet numbers.
34071870	Pandemic Effects and Gluten-Free Diet: An Adherence and Mental Health Problem.	The COVID-19 pandemic has been present for many months, influencing diets such as the gluten-free diet (GFD), which implies daily challenges even in non-pandemic conditions. Persons following the GFD were invited to answer online ad hoc and validated questionnaires characterizing self-perceptions of the pandemic, current clinical condition, dietary characteristics, adherence to GFD, anxiety, and depression. Of 331 participants, 87% experienced shortage and higher cost of food and 14.8% lost their jobs. Symptoms increased in 29% and 36.6% failed to obtain medical help. Although 52.3% increased food preparation at home and purchased alternative foodstuffs, 53.8% had consumed gluten-containing foods. The Health Eating Index was intermediate/"needs improvement" (mean 65.6 +- 13.3 points); in 49.9% (perception) and 44.4% (questionnaire), adherence was "bad". Anxiety and depression scores were above the cutoff in 28% and 40.4%, respectively. Adherence and mental health were strongly related. The likelihood of poor adherence was 2.3 times higher (p < 0.004) in participants declaring that pandemic altered GFD. Those suffering depressive symptoms were 1.3 times more likely to have poor adherence (p < 0.000). Depression and faulty GFD (mandatory for treatment) appear, affecting a high proportion of participants, suggesting that support measures aimed at these aspects would help improve the health condition of people that maintain GFD. Comparisons of data currently appearing in the literature available should be cautious because not only cultural aspects but conditions and timing of data collection are most variable.
37704112	Standardizing Randomized Controlled Trials in Celiac Disease: An International Multidisciplinary Appropriateness Study.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: There is a need to develop safe and effective pharmacologic options for the treatment of celiac disease (CeD), however, consensus on the appropriate design and configuration of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in this population is lacking. METHODS: A 2-round modified Research and Development/University of California Los Angeles Appropriateness Method study was conducted. Eighteen gastroenterologists (adult and pediatric) and gastrointestinal pathologists voted on statements pertaining to the configuration of CeD RCTs, inclusion/exclusion criteria, gluten challenge, and trial outcomes. Two RCT designs were considered, representing distinct clinical scenarios for which pharmacotherapy may be used: (1) trials incorporating a gluten challenge to simulate exposure; and (2) trials evaluating reversal of histologic changes despite attempted adherence to a gluten free diet (GFD). Each statement was rated as appropriate, uncertain, or inappropriate, using a 9-point Likert scale. RESULTS: For trials evaluating prevention of relapse after gluten challenge, participants adherent to a GFD for >=12 months with normal/near-normal-sized villi should be enrolled. Gluten challenge should be FODMAP-free, and efficacy evaluated using histology with a secondary patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure. For trials evaluating reversal of villus atrophy, the panel voted it appropriate to enroll participants with a baseline villus height:crypt depth ratio of <=2, and measure efficacy using a primary histologic endpoint. Guidance for measuring histologic, endoscopic, and PRO outcomes in adult and pediatric patients with CeD are provided, along with recommendations regarding the merits and limitations of different endpoints. CONCLUSION: We developed standardized recommendations for clinical trial design, eligibility criteria, outcome measures, gluten challenge, and disease evaluations for RCTs in patients with CeD.
30445682	Beneficial Effect of Oligofructose-Enriched Inulin on Vitamin D and E Status in Children with Celiac Disease on a Long-Term Gluten-Free Diet: A Preliminary Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Nutritional Intervention Study.	Prebiotics have been shown to improve absorption of some nutrients, including vitamins. This pilot study evaluated the effect of the prebiotic oligofructose-enriched inulin (Synergy 1) on fat-soluble vitamins status, parathormone, and calcium-related elements in pediatric celiac disease (CD) patients (n = 34) on a strict gluten-free diet (GFD). Participants were randomized into a group receiving 10 g of Synergy 1 or placebo (maltodextrin) together with a GFD. At baseline and after 3 months of intervention, 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], parathormone, vitamin E and A, calcium, phosphate, magnesium, total protein, and albumin were determined. Concentration of 25(OH)D increased significantly (p < 0.05) by 42% in CD patients receiving Synergy 1 in GFD, whereas no change was observed in placebo. Vitamin D status reached an optimal level in 46% of patients receiving Synergy 1. No significant difference in parathormone, calcium, and phosphate levels was observed. Concentration of vitamin E increased significantly (p < 0.05) by 19% in patients receiving Synergy 1, but not in the placebo. Vitamin A levels were not changed. Supplementation of GFD with Synergy 1 improved vitamin D and vitamin E status in children and adolescents with CD and could be considered a novel complementary method of management of fat-soluble vitamins deficiency in pediatric CD patients.
34019354	[Development of a daily diet for children with celiac disease in municipal pre-school educational institutions].	Improving the quality of nutrition for children with gluten intolerance in preschool institutions is an important state task. Relevant adjustment of the diet enables to reduce the risk of the celiac syndrome. Balanced nutrient composition of diet is necessary for the harmonious growth and development of a child. The aim of the research was to develop specialized diet for children with gluten intolerance and celiac desease in municipal preschool educational institutions. Material and methods. A study of the 10-days full-day menu of children aged 3 to 7 years was carried out. To compose the specialized menu, we used the computational program "MDOU Calculate menu. Universal program for kindergarten". Technological maps of dishes in municipal preschool educational institutions were used. The calculation of the supply of the diet with vitamins, minerals and trace elements and the deviation of the nutritional and energy value of the diet from the recommended daily intake was made. Results. The necessity of developing a specialized diet for children 3-7 years old with a confirmed diagnosis of celiac disease, as well as for children on a gluten-free diet has been substantiated. A specialized daily food ration has been developed, consisting of four meals. Analysis of the nutritional and energy value of the dishes offered in the menu showed the minimum deviation of the obtained indicators from recommended daily intake. The necessity of introducing the developed diet into the system of specialized nutrition in preschool educational institutions has been substantiated. Conclusion. The results of the work indicate that under the conditions of state funding, there is a possibility of adjusting the existing food rations for the full-fledged socialization of children with various diseases.
30527260	Oat safety for celiac disease patients: theoretical analysis correlates adverse symptoms in clinical studies to contaminated study oats.	Inclusion of oats in a gluten-free (GF) diet can provide whole grain nutritional benefits to celiac disease (CD) patients, but there has been debate regarding oat safety for these individuals. This is because of conflicting research findings, with inconsistencies attributed to varying CD subject's sensitivities to "pure" oats. Clinical trials to date have assumed oats provided to subjects to be lightly contaminated, if at all. This assumption is challenged here since oat's propensity to be "kernel" contaminated with gluten sources like wheat and barley has recently been shown to significantly complicate confirmation of a GF state. We therefore hypothesize that clinical studies may have inadvertently provided pill-like gluten kernels intermittently to study subjects, leading to adverse outcomes that could potentially explain inconsistencies between study conclusions. To test this theory, potential gluten contamination of oats used in a cross-section of 12 important oat feeding studies has been estimated, done according to descriptions of oats used, published contamination rates for various oat types, and study oat dosages. Expected gluten exposures were found to be at levels to elicit clinical effects in a large portion of CD patients, correlating with observed clinical reaction rates in those studies (P value = .0006). Estimated gluten doses were found insufficient, however, to affect morphological outcomes, whereas only 1 study had 1 case. Our analysis provides a new perspective with which to view oat safety study conclusions and justifies new clinical trials using today's higher-purity GF oats to settle the oat safety for CD patient debate.
35031683	The double-edged sword of gut bacteria in celiac disease and implications for therapeutic potential.	Celiac disease (CeD) is an immune-mediated disease, triggered by gluten ingestion, in genetically susceptible individuals. The gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only current treatment for CeD, but is difficult to follow, has high non-adherence rates, and does not always lead to symptomatic or mucosal remission. Microbially-mediated mechanisms have been proposed to contribute to disease pathogenesis, and clinical studies support an association, but mechanistic insight has been difficult to obtain. Recent advances using translational approaches have provided clues to the mechanisms through which bacteria could contribute to CeD pathogenesis. In this review we discuss these bacterially mediated mechanisms, which include the modulation of pathogenic or protective pathways. Targeting these pathways through microbial therapeutics could provide adjuvant therapies to the GFD.
32752175	Current Evidence on the Efficacy of Gluten-Free Diets in Multiple Sclerosis, Psoriasis, Type 1 Diabetes and Autoimmune Thyroid Diseases.	In this review, we summarize the clinical data addressing a potential role for gluten in multiple sclerosis (MS), psoriasis, type 1 diabetes (T1D) and autoimmune thyroid diseases (ATDs). Furthermore, data on the prevalence of celiac disease (CD) and gluten-related antibodies in the above patient groups are presented. Adequately powered and properly controlled intervention trials investigating the effects of a gluten-free diet (GFD) in non-celiac patients with MS, psoriasis, T1D or ATDs are lacking. Only one clinical trial has studied the effects of a GFD among patients with MS. The trial found significant results, but it is subject to major methodological limitations. A few publications have found beneficial effects of a GFD in a subgroup of patients with psoriasis that were seropositive for anti-gliadin or deamidated gliadin antibodies, but no effects were seen among seronegative patients. Studies on the role of gluten in T1D are contradictive, however, it seems likely that a GFD may contribute to normalizing metabolic control without affecting levels of islet autoantibodies. Lastly, the effects of a GFD in non-celiac patients with ATDs have not been studied yet, but some publications report that thyroid-related antibodies respond to a GFD in patients with concomitant CD and ATDs. Overall, there is currently not enough evidence to recommend a GFD to non-celiac patients with MS, psoriasis, ATDs or T1D.
30688709	Is Adherence to a Gluten-Free Diet by Adult Patients With Celiac Disease Influenced by Their Knowledge of the Gluten Content of Foods?	The aim of this study was to investigate adherence to a gluten-free diet and potentially associated factors, focusing on the relationship between adherence and knowledge of the gluten content of foods and of celiac disease in general. A questionnaire was completed by adult patients diagnosed with celiac disease including demographics, dietary practices, sources of information, and attitude to the disease. Their knowledge of disease and gluten-free diet was assessed using a newly developed scale comprising 31 statements on celiac disease in general and foods appropriate in a gluten-free diet. A validated questionnaire was used to measure adherence to diet. One hundred four patients with celiac disease took part in the study, 65% of them reported strictly adhering to a gluten-free diet. Factors associated with adherence were membership of the Italian Celiac Association and receiving support from this association, Internet, and social media. Patients' knowledge regarding celiac disease and gluten-free diet was generally poor: one patient answered all questions correctly. Knowledge of celiac disease and gluten-free diet was strongly and significantly associated with adherence to a gluten-free diet. The association between knowledge of celiac disease and gluten-free diet in patients with celiac disease and their adherence to the diet suggests the promotion of education and behavioral programs.
32575561	Effect of Gluten-Free Diet on Gut Microbiota Composition in Patients with Celiac Disease and Non-Celiac Gluten/Wheat Sensitivity.	Celiac disease (CD) and non-celiac gluten/wheat sensitivity (NCG/WS) are the two most frequent conditions belonging to gluten-related disorders (GRDs). Both these diseases are triggered and worsened by gluten proteins ingestion, although other components, such as amylase/trypsin inhibitors (ATI) and fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs), seem to be involved in the NCG/WS onset. Therefore, the only effective treatment to date is the long-life adherence to a strictly gluten-free diet. Recently, increasing attention has been paid to the intestinal barrier, a dynamic system comprising various components, which regulate the delicate crosstalk between metabolic, motor, neuroendocrine and immunological functions. Among the elements characterizing the intestinal barrier, the microbiota plays a key role, modulating the gut integrity maintenance, the immune response and the inflammation process, linked to the CD and NCG/WS outbreak. This narrative review addresses the most recent findings on the gut microbiota modulation induced by the gluten-free diet (GFD) in healthy, CD and NCG/WS patients.
38474812	Trends in Faecal Zonulin Concentrations in Paediatric Patients with Celiac Disease at Baseline and on a Gluten-Free Diet: Exploring Correlations with Other Faecal Biomarkers.	Celiac disease (CeD) is an autoimmune condition triggered by gluten in genetically predisposed individuals, affecting all ages. Intestinal permeability (IP) is crucial in the pathogenesis of CeD and it is primarily governed by tight junctions (TJs) that uphold the intestinal barrier's integrity. The protein zonulin plays a critical role in modulating the permeability of TJs having emerged as a potential non-invasive biomarker to study IP. The importance of this study lies in providing evidence for the usefulness of a non-invasive tool in the study of IP both at baseline and in the follow-up of paediatric patients with CeD. In this single-centre prospective observational study, we explored the correlation between faecal zonulin levels and others faecal and serum biomarkers for monitoring IP in CeD within the paediatric population. We also aimed to establish reference values for faecal zonulin in the paediatric population. We found that faecal zonulin and calprotectin values are higher at the onset of CeD compared with the control population. Specifically, the zonulin levels were 347.5 ng/mL as opposed to 177.7 ng/mL in the control population (p = 0.001), while calprotectin levels were 29.8 mug/g stool compared to 13.9 mug/g stool (p = 0.029). As the duration without gluten consumption increased, a significant reduction in faecal zonulin levels was observed in patients with CeD (348.5 ng/mL vs. 157.1 ng/mL; p = 0.002), along with a decrease in the prevalence of patients with vitamin D insufficiency (88.9% vs. 77.8%). We conclude that faecal zonulin concentrations were higher in the patients with active CeD compared with healthy individuals or those following a gluten-free diet (GFD). The significant decrease in their values over the duration of the GFD suggests the potential use of zonulin as an additional tool in monitoring adherence to a GFD.
30888750	Hepatitis B virus vaccination and revaccination response in children diagnosed with coeliac disease : a multicentre prospective study.	AIM: This study evaluates hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination response in children with celiac disease (CD). Response in initial non-responders after a single booster vaccination as well as factors influencing HBV vaccination response were evaluated. METHODOLOGY: Anti-hepatitis B surface antibodies (a-HBsAB) were checked in all children with CD and a documented complete HBV vaccination. An a-HBsAB <10 U/L was considered as non-response. A single intramuscular HBV-vaccine booster was advised to all non-responders. Response was checked at the next appointment. RESULTS: 133 children with CD were included, median age of 7.3 years (range 1.7-17.3) and 46 (35%) were male. The age at CD diagnosis was 6.0 years (range 1.1-15.7). HBV non-response was documented in 55% (n=73/133). No other factors were influencing the response. A booster was documented in 34/73 (47 %) initial non-responders (3 refused (4%), 36 (49%) had no follow up). Response after booster vaccination resulted in immunity in 22/34 (65%) and persisting non-response in 12/34 (35%). A single booster is able to reduce non-response from 55% (73/133) to 23% (22/94). CONCLUSION: A significantly lower immune response following HBV vaccination in children with CD was confirmed. A single intramuscular booster vaccination is able to induce a serologic response in two thirds of the initial non-responders. Control of HBV vaccination response has to become part of the follow-up in CD patients.
33933744	Micronutrient deficiencies in children with coeliac disease; a double-edged sword of both untreated disease and treatment with gluten-free diet.	INTRODUCTION: In coeliac disease (CD) micronutrient deficiencies may occur due to malabsorption in active disease and diminished intake during treatment with a gluten-free diet (GFD). This study assessed the micronutrient status in children with CD at diagnosis and follow-up. METHODS: Fifteen micronutrients were analysed in 106 blood samples from newly diagnosed CD and from patients on a GFD for <6 months, 6-12 months and with longstanding disease (>12 months). Predictors of micronutrient status included: demographics, disease duration, anthropometry, gastrointestinal symptoms, raised tissue transglutaminase antibodies (TGA), multivitamin use and faecal gluten immunogenic peptide (GIP). Micronutrient levels were compared against laboratory reference values. RESULTS: At CD diagnosis (n = 25), low levels in >=10% of patients were observed for: vitamins E (88%), B1 (71%), D (24%), K (21%), A (20%) and B6 (12%), ferritin (79%), and zinc (33%). One year post-diagnosis, repletion of vitamins E, K, B6 and B1 was observed (<10% patients). In contrast, deficiencies for vitamins D, A and zinc did not change significantly post-diagnosis. Copper, selenium and magnesium did not differ significantly between diagnosis and follow-up. All samples for B2, folate, vitamin C (except for one sample) and B12 were normal. A raised TGA at follow-up was associated with low vitamins A and B1 (raised vs normal TGA; vitamin A: 40% vs 17%, p = 0.044, vitamin B1: 37% vs 13%, p = 0.028). Low vitamin A (p = 0.009) and vitamin D (p = 0.001) were more common in samples collected during winter. There were no associations between micronutrient status with GIP, body mass index, height, socioeconomic status, or gastrointestinal symptom. Multivitamin use was less common in patients with low vitamin D. CONCLUSIONS: Several micronutrient deficiencies in CD respond to a GFD but others need to be monitored long-term and supplemented where indicated.
34444783	Dynamics and Considerations in the Determination of the Excretion of Gluten Immunogenic Peptides in Urine: Individual Variability at Low Gluten Intake.	BACKGROUND: A lifelong strict gluten-free diet is the only available treatment for celiac disease, but total exclusion of gluten is difficult to achieve. The aim of this study was to determine the range of time and the amount of gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) excreted in urine after specific gluten ingestions. METHODS: 20 healthy participants followed the same diet for 12 days in which 50 mg and 2 g of gluten were ingested and all the urinations were collected. GIP were analyzed by lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) tests and quantified using an LFIA reader. RESULTS: GIP were detected in 15% and 95% of participants after 50 mg and 2 g gluten intakes, respectively. The higher frequency and concentration of GIP was found between 6 and 9 h after both gluten ingestions. The ranges of detection were 3-12 h (50 mg) and 0-15 h (2 g). CONCLUSIONS: An increase in the frequency of urine tests may be a suitable approach to avoid false negative results. The use of the LFIA test in three urine samples collected at different times may show a sensitivity of 19.6% for a gluten ingestion like 50 mg, increasing to 93% after 2 g consumption.
30986085	Design and development of a self-microemulsifying drug delivery system of olmesartan medoxomil for enhanced bioavailability.	Olmesartan medoxomil (OM) is a hydrophobic antihypertensive drug with low bioavailability (26%) and is known to have adverse effects such as celiac disease and enteropathy. The purpose of this study was to develop SMEDDS to increase bioavailability and decrease potential side effects of OM. Hydrophilic lipophilic balance was calculated by testing solubility of OM in different oils, surfactants, and cosurfactants to obtain the most suitable combination of SMEDDS. Pseudoternary phase diagram was used to select the better oil/water formulation of SMEDDS. After a test for 3-month stability, dissolution tests and parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA) were conducted to investigate drug solubility and permeability. Biodistribution of fluorescent marked SMEDDS was observed by using in vivo imaging system. The pharmacodynamics of the drug were determined by measuring blood pressure from tails of rats. At the end of the experiment, intestines were examined for adverse effects of OM. Compared with tablet formulation according to the dissolution study, SMEDDS formulation showed 1.67 times improvement in solubility of OM. PAMPA studies suggested a much faster permeability rate for OM SMEDDS compared to the suspension form. Labeled SMEDDS gave 3.96 times stronger fluorescent emission than control dye administered mice in in vivo imaging system (IVIS ) studies, indicating an increased bioavailability. Treating effect of SMEDDS was 3.1 times more efficient compared to suspension in hypertensive rats. It caused neither celiac-like enteropathy nor diarrhea, during 21-day noninvasive blood pressure system (NIBP) assay. Our results suggest that SMEEDS formulation improves dissolution and oral bioavailability of OM while reducing its adverse effects.
34445038	Nutritional Imbalances in Adult Celiac Patients Following a Gluten-Free Diet.	Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic autoimmune disorder of the small intestine, whose only effective treatment is a gluten-free diet (GFD). It is characterized by the atrophy of the intestinal villi that leads to altered nutrient absorption. This study describes the nutritional imbalances which may be found in adults with CD following a GFD. During the first year of treatment, deficiencies will overcome as the intestinal mucosa recovers. Thus, biochemical data will show this progression, together with the decrease in symptoms. In contrast, in the long term, when a strict GFD is followed and mucosal recovery is achieved, analyzing nutrient intake makes more sense. Macronutrient consumption is characterized by its low complex carbohydrate and fiber intakes, and high fat (especially SFA) and sugar intakes. This profile has been related to the consumption of GFP and their nutritional composition, in addition to unbalanced dietary habits. The most notable deficiencies in micronutrients are usually those of iron, calcium and magnesium and vitamin D, E and some of group B. It is necessary to follow up patients with CD and to promote nutritional education among them, since it could help not only to achieve a gluten free but also a balanced diet.
32947787	Gluten-Free Diet in Prisons in Poland: Nutrient Contents and Implementation of Dietary Reference Intake Standards.	The gluten-free diet (GFD) requires special attention from nutritionists due to the potential risk of nutrient deficiencies in its users. This risk may be greater when this type of nutrition is implemented in prisons due to the limited possibilities of external control, a low catering budget for meals, and insufficiently defined recommendations regulating nutrition for prisoners. The aim of the present study was to assess the nutritional value of GFD and regular diet meals served in some Polish prisons and to compare the values to the dietary reference intake (DRI) standards. Using a specialized computer program, 7-day menus of both types of diet provided in 10 prisons were analyzed. The percentage coverage of the DRI was calculated based on the recommendations of the Polish National Food and Nutrition Institute. GFD was characterized by lower average contents of energy and 11 out of 14 essential nutrients, i.e., protein, carbohydrates, dietary fiber, starch, ash, sodium, calcium, iron, zinc, folate, and vitamin B12. The average content of phosphorus, niacin, and riboflavin in the gluten-free diet was higher than that in the regular diet. It was shown that the meals in GFD and the regular diet did not provide the recommended amounts of calcium (38 and 44% DRI, respectively), vitamin D (29 and 30% DRI), vitamin C (86 and 76% DRI), and folate (51 and 56% DRI). In turn, the supply of sodium, phosphorus, copper, and vitamins A and B6 substantially exceeded the recommended levels. The results indicate a need for greater quality control of GFD meals served in catering facilities. It is also necessary to develop legal provisions that will regulate more specifically the nutrition for prisoners in terms of an adequate supply of minerals and vitamins.
29016564	The Role of an IgA/IgG-Deamidated Gliadin Peptide Point-of-Care Test in Predicting Persistent Villous Atrophy in Patients With Celiac Disease on a Gluten-Free Diet.	OBJECTIVES: Mucosal healing is important in celiac disease (CD) for the prevention of complications. However, obtaining duodenal biopsies is invasive, and there is currently no reliable surrogate marker for histological remission in clinical practice. We aimed to assess the role of a point-of-care test (POCT) based on IgA/IgG-deamidated gliadin peptide, in detecting persistent villous atrophy (VA) in CD. METHODS: We prospectively recruited patients with CD attending endoscopy for the assessment of histological remission. All patients had IgA-endomysial (EMA) antibodies, IgA-tissue transglutaminase (TTG) antibodies, and the POCT performed, and completed a validated dietary adherence questionnaire. A gastroscopy was performed in all patients, with four biopsies taken from the second part of the duodenum and one from the duodenal bulb. We compared the diagnostic performance of the surrogate markers against duodenal histology as the reference standard. RESULTS: A total of 217 patients with CD (70% female, age range 16-83 years, median age 53 years) on a gluten-free diet (median duration 6 years) were recruited from 2013 to 2017. Eighty-five (39.2%) patients had persistent VA. The sensitivities of the POCT, TTG, EMA, and the adherence score in detecting VA were 67.1%, 44.7%, 37.7%, and 24.7% respectively (P=0.0005). The combination of the POCT and adherence score only marginally increased the sensitivity to 70.6% (59.7-80.0%). CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity of the POCT was higher than the other surrogate markers in predicting VA. A POCT may provide the additional advantage of an immediate objective assessment of mucosal healing at the time of an office-based follow-up consultation.
29258815	Elevated serum antiphospholipid antibodies in adults with celiac disease.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: An increased incidence of thrombosis is suggested in celiac disease. We explored serum levels of antiphospholipid antibodies in untreated and treated adult celiac disease patients. METHODS: A cohort of 179 biopsy-proven celiac disease patients (89 untreated, 90 on long-term gluten-free diet) and 91 non-celiac controls underwent clinical examination, assessment of celiac serology and enzyme immunoassay testing for anticardiolipin IgG and IgM, prothrombin IgG, and phosphatidylserine-prothrombin IgG and IgM. RESULTS: The level of antiphospholipid antibodies was higher in celiac disease patients compared with controls: anticardiolipin IgG 4.9 (0.7-33.8) vs 2.2 (0.4-9.6) U/ml, antiprothrombin IgG 2.9 (0.3-87.8) vs 2.1 (0.5-187.0) U/ml, antiphosphatidylserine-prothrombin IgG 6.9 (0.0-54.1) vs 2.3 (0.5-15.1) U/ml; p < 0.05 for all. Anticardiolipin IgG, antiprothrombin IgG and antiphosphatidylserine-prothrombin IgG were higher in treated compared with untreated patients. The phenotype of celiac disease at presentation (gastrointestinal symptoms, malabsorption or anemia, and extraintestinal symptoms or screen-detected disease) had no effect on the level of serum antiphospholipid antibodies. CONCLUSION: The serum level of antiphospholipid antibodies is increased in adults with celiac disease. The higher level of antibodies in treated patients suggests that the increase is not gluten-dependent. The prothrombotic role of antiphospholipid antibodies in celiac disease warrants further studies.
28819290	Progress towards non-invasive diagnosis and follow-up of celiac disease in children; a prospective multicentre study to the usefulness of plasma I-FABP.	This prospective study investigates whether measurement of plasma intestinal-fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP), a sensitive marker for small intestinal epithelial damage, improves non-invasive diagnosing of celiac disease (CD), and whether I-FABP levels are useful to evaluate mucosal healing in patients on a gluten-free diet (GFD). Ninety children with elevated tTG-IgA titres and HLA-DQ2/DQ8 positivity were included (study group). Duodenal biopsies were taken, except in those fulfilling the ESPGHAN criteria. Plasma I-FABP levels and tTG-IgA titres were assessed sequentially during six months of follow-up. Eighty children with normal tTG-IgA titres served as control group. In 61/90 (67.8%) of the children in the study group an increased I-FABP level was found; in all these children CD diagnosis was confirmed. Interestingly, in 14/30 (46.7%) children with slightly elevated tTG-IgA titres (<10x upper limit of normal), an increased I-FABP level was found. In all these children the diagnosis of CD was confirmed histologically. After gluten elimination for six weeks I-FABP levels had decreased towards levels in the control group. Measurement of plasma I-FABP, in addition to tTG-IgA, EMA-IgA and HLAtyping, enables non-invasive diagnosing of CD in a substantial number of children, and might therefore be of value in the diagnostic approach of CD.
34210038	Microbiota and Metabolomic Patterns in the Breast Milk of Subjects with Celiac Disease on a Gluten-Free Diet.	The intestinal microbiome may trigger celiac disease (CD) in individuals with a genetic disposition when exposed to dietary gluten. Research demonstrates that nutrition during infancy is crucial to the intestinal microbiome engraftment. Very few studies to date have focused on the breast milk composition of subjects with a history of CD on a gluten-free diet. Here, we utilize a multi-omics approach with shotgun metagenomics to analyze the breast milk microbiome integrated with metabolome profiling of 36 subjects, 20 with CD on a gluten-free diet and 16 healthy controls. These analyses identified significant differences in bacterial and viral species/strains and functional pathways but no difference in metabolite abundance. Specifically, three bacterial strains with increased abundance were identified in subjects with CD on a gluten-free diet of which one (Rothia mucilaginosa) has been previously linked to autoimmune conditions. We also identified five pathways with increased abundance in subjects with CD on a gluten-free diet. We additionally found four bacterial and two viral species/strains with increased abundance in healthy controls. Overall, the differences observed in bacterial and viral species/strains and in functional pathways observed in our analysis may influence microbiome engraftment in neonates, which may impact their future clinical outcomes.
37049601	The Importance of an Early Evaluation after Establishing a Gluten-Free Diet in Children with Celiac Disease.	A gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only treatment available for celiac disease (CD); hence, it is important to ensure correct adherence to the diet and adequate monitoring of the diet. The present study aims to assess the importance of an early follow-up of celiac patients after diagnosis of the disease, identify the role of stool gluten immunogenic peptides (GIPs) in the assessment of GFD adherence, and analyze possible nutritional imbalances or deficiencies in the GFD. This is a cross-sectional study carried out in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed CD in a tertiary hospital in Spain. Of the 61 patients included, 14% had positive stool GIPS at 4 months after CD diagnosis, Among them, 88% had negative stool GIPS at 9 months after diagnosis, following dietary advice. We found nutritional deficiencies in the GFD, such as vitamin D (with only 27% of patients with adequate intakes), folate, calcium, magnesium, and fiber. Similarly, we found imbalances: excess protein and fat intakes and a high percentage of total daily energy intake came from ultra-processed foods (UPF). These findings emphasize the importance of early follow-up of children after diagnosis of CD. It is also crucial to identify patients with poor GFD compliance based on stool GIPS and analyze GFD nutritional imbalances and deficits. Our findings may contribute to the development of specific strategies for the early follow-up of patients with CD, including appropriate nutritional counselling.
35631231	Long-Term Effect of Gluten-Free Diets on Nutritional Status, Body Composition, and Associated Factors in Adult Saudi Females with Celiac Disease.	This cross-sectional study examines the influence of long-term gluten-free diet (GFD) consumption on nutritional status, body composition, and associated factors in adult Saudi females with celiac diseases (CD). Fifty-one patients who have been diagnosed with CD and have been on GFD for more than 1 year were included in this study where data regarding their dietary pattern, as well as a complete analysis of their anthropometric parameters, vitamins B12 and D levels, and complete blood count (CBC), were collected. Data have shown that all included patients showed a reduced intake in all micro and macro-nutrients, as well as vitamin D, folate, calcium, and iron. However, the vast majority of all measured hematological parameters and blood indices were within the expected reference range. In addition, 51%, 43.1%, and 60.8% of the patients showed low waist/hip ratio (WHR), decreased level of total body fat (BF), and decreased level of visceral fat (VF), respectively, whereas 33.3% were slim. The poor educational level and some psychosocial factors were associated with the poor nutritional status of the patients. In conclusion, the GFD-dependent intake by female patients with CD adversely affects their nutritional intake and anthropometric indices and leads to a deficiency in major nutrients, vitamins, and ions.
38443736	A Dedicated Celiac Disease Program Improves Celiac Quality Care Metrics and Short-Term Outcomes in Real Life.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Dedicated multidisciplinary programs in gastroenterology are emerging with the goal to improve care. There is little information about the effects of a celiac disease program on disease-related quality care metrics and outcomes. We aimed to compare quality care metrics, symptom resolution, and serological response among patients diagnosed and treated in a celiac disease program with a standard of care cohort. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study with adult celiac disease patients. We divided patients into two groups: celiac disease patients treated in our program and those treated by gastroenterologists not affiliated with the program (standard of care). We abstracted data from electronical medical records and compared frequency at which guideline-driven quality care metrics were obtained, assessed symptom resolution, and serological response based on IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase levels. RESULTS: We included 340 patients, 120 in the celiac disease program (89 women) and 220 (166 women) in the standard of care. Frequency of quality care metrics implementation in program patients was significantly greater for all variables (p < 0.0005). Diarrhea resolved in 38/46 (82.6%) in the CD program and 63/98 (64.2%) in the standard of care after starting a gluten-free diet (p = .025); bloating also resolved significantly more often in the former (26/34) than the latter (31/58; p = 0.03). Otherwise, there were no significant differences in resolution of clinical symptoms or serological response. CONCLUSION: A celiac disease program improves celiac-related quality care metrics and may improve outcomes such as diarrhea resolution compared to standard of care.
32887250	Influence of Compliance to Diet and Self-Efficacy Expectation on Quality of Life in Patients with Celiac Disease in Spain.	The purpose of this study is to understand the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with celiac disease (CD) and analyze its main determinants. A transversal descriptive study of 738 patients with celiac disease was carried out. A series of questionnaires were answered related to their HRQoL, adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD), and self-efficacy beliefs among other relevant variables. Regression analyses were carried out in order to explore the predictive variables in adherence to the GFD and HRQoL. A total of 61.2% showed a good HRQoL, and the main predictors of HRQoL were specific self-efficacy, adherence to the diet, risk perception, time since diagnosis, and age. While 68.7% of participants showed good or excellent adherence to the GFD, and the main predictors of adherence were specific self-efficacy, perceived adoption of recommended behaviors, HRQoL and gender. The HRQoL of patients with CD, and adherence to the GFD in Spain, are good. It is the self-efficacy expectation, measured specifically and not generally, which is the best predictor of both adherence and HRQoL. It is necessary to develop programs to improve the HRQoL of patients with CD that focus on improving specific self-efficacy.
29749319	There is need a new insight for celiac disease.	
30257431	The Availability and Nutritional Adequacy of Gluten-Free Bread and Pasta.	Management of coeliac disease (CD) requires the removal of gluten from the diet. Evidence of the availability, cost, and nutritional adequacy of gluten-free (GF) bread and pasta products is limited. GF flours are exempt from UK legislation that requires micronutrient fortification of white wheat flour. This study surveyed the number and cost of bread and pasta products available and evaluated the back-of-pack nutritional information, the ingredient content, and the presence of fortification nutrients of GF bread and pasta, compared to standard gluten-containing equivalent products. Product information was collected from four supermarket websites. Standard products were significantly cheaper, with more products available than GF (p < 0.05). GF bread products were significantly higher in fat and fiber (p < 0.05). All GF products were lower in protein than standard products (p < 0.01). Only 5% of GF breads were fortified with all four mandatory fortification nutrients (calcium, iron, niacin, and thiamin), 28% of GF breads were fortified with calcium and iron only. This lack of fortification may increase the risk of micronutrient deficiency in coeliac sufferers. It is recommended that fortification legislation is extended to include all GF products, in addition to increased regulation of the nutritional content of GF foods.
30769829	Role of Front-of-Package Gluten-Free Product Labeling in a Pair-Matched Study in Women with and without Celiac Disease on a Gluten-Free Diet.	Gluten-free (GF) product labeling is one of the most important determinants of food product choices by patients with celiac disease, due to the need for following a GF diet. The aim of this study was to assess the role of front-of-package GF product labeling in pair-matched celiac and non-celiac women on a GF diet in a choice experiment (CE). In subgroups of celiac (n = 77) and non-celiac pair-matched respondents on a GF diet, but with no gluten-related diseases diagnosed (n = 77), the influence of front-of package labeling of GF bread on the choice of products was assessed. The labeling assessed in a CE included for all the products crossed grain logotype and additional logotypes of European Union (EU) organic production, "dairy-free" product, wheat starch-free product, quality and vegan product, as well as additional "gluten-free" written information. It was stated that the frequency of selection of products with "gluten-free" written information did not differ between subgroups of celiac and non-celiac respondents, as well as in subgroups stratified by age, body mass index (BMI), place of residence, and economic status. The frequency of selection of products with "vegan" logotype was higher for non-celiac respondents than for celiac ones (p = 0.0011). The frequency of selection of a product with additional logotypes was influenced by BMI and place of residence, but not by age and economic status of assessed women.
30823833	Non-celiac gluten/wheat sensitivity: still more questions than answers.	Non-celiac gluten/wheat sensitivity (NCG/WS) is a syndrome characterized by intestinal and extra-intestinal sym-ptoms elicited by gluten/wheat ingestion in the persons, who are not affected by celiac disease and wheat allergy. Due to the lack of established biomarkers, the diagnosis of NCG/WS is based on the clinical picture, and it is necessary to validate it in well-defined double-blind, placebo-controlled challenge (The Salerno Experts  Criteria). In the article is discussed a current knowledge of NCG/WS in terms of pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment. Key words: gluten - gluten-related disorders - non-celiac gluten/wheat sensitivity - wheat.
30342033	Synthetic Neoepitopes of the Transglutaminase-Deamidated Gliadin Complex as Biomarkers for Diagnosing and Monitoring Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease (CeD) has characteristics of an autoimmune disease, such as increased antibody levels to tissue transglutaminase (tTG). However, assays to measure these biomarkers in blood samples do not identify patients with sufficient accuracy for diagnosis or monitoring of CeD. We aimed to discover biomarkers of CeD derived from neoepitopes of deamidated gliadin peptides (DGP) and tTG fragments and to determine if immune reactivity against these epitopes can identify patients with CeD with mucosal healing. METHODS: We analyzed serum samples from 90 patients with biopsy-proven CeD and 79 healthy individuals (controls) for immune reactivity against the tTG-DGP complex (discovery cohort). A fluorescent peptide microarray platform was used to estimate the antibody-binding intensity of each synthesized tTG-DGP epitope. We validated our findings in 82 patients with newly diagnosed CeD and 217 controls. We tested the ability of our peptide panel to identify patients with mucosal healing (based on the histologic analysis) using serum samples from patients with treated and healed CeD (n = 85), patients with treated but unhealed CeD (n = 81; villous atrophy despite a adhering a gluten-free diet), patients with untreated CeD (n = 82) and disease controls (n = 27), villous atrophy without CeD), and healthy controls (n = 217). Data were analyzed using principal component analysis followed by machine learning and support vector machine modeling. RESULTS: We identified 172 immunogenic epitopes of the tTG-DGP complex. We found significantly increased immune reactivity against these epitopes vs controls. In the both cohort, the set of neoepitopes derived from the tTG-DGP complex identified patients with CeD with 99% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Serum samples from patients with untreated CeD had the greatest mean antibody-binding intensity against the tTG-DGP complex (32.5 +- 16.4). The average antibody-binding intensity was significantly higher in serum from patients with treated but unhealed CeD mucosa (15.1 +- 7.5) than in patients with treated and healed CeD mucosa (5.5 +- 3.4) (P < .001). The assay identified patients with mucosa healing status with 84% sensitivity and 95% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: We identified immunogenic epitopes of the tTG-DGP complex, and found that an assay to measure the immune response to epitopes accurately identified patients with CeD, as well as patients with mucosal healing. This biomarker assay might be used in detection and monitoring of patients with CeD.
38648685	Celiac disease: Hope for new treatments beyond a gluten-free diet.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the small intestine induced and maintained by gluten ingestion in susceptible individuals. Current treatment consists of strict adherence to a lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD) which is considered safe and effective in the large majority of patients. However, since adherence to a GFD is difficult and has a negative impact on quality of life, an increasing interest in other treatment options has emerged. Moreover, in some individuals a GFD is not sufficiently effective, necessitating alternative treatments. METHODS: By performing a systematic search, we constructed a detailed narrative review. Only treatment options considered relevant and conducted in a phase I, II or III clinical trial were included. RESULTS: Based on the pathophysiology of CD, four major therapeutic approaches can be distinguished: firstly, by focusing on intraluminal gluten detoxification before absorption occurs, secondly, by modulating intestinal permeability and preventing paracellular uptake, thirdly, by enhancing immunological tolerance to gluten and finally, by regulating gluten auto-immunity. CONCLUSIONS: Despite significant efforts, no treatment has yet completed a phase III clinical trial. Future studies will likely focus on the use of supplemental drugs in conjunction to a GFD, with ALV003 and ZED-1227 currently being the most promising therapeutic options.
31544803	Linear growth of children with celiac disease after the first two years on gluten- free diet: a controlled study.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a lifelong disorder with gluten-induced manifestations in different organs especially growth. Gluten free diet (GFD) is required to achieve remission and prevent abnormal growth. Study reports on growth of children with celiac disease on long-term GFD are not consistent. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effect of GFD on growth of children with the classical form of CD (diagnosed by serology and small intestine mucosal biopsy) on log-term GFD (>2 years). METHODS: We studied growth parameters (weight gain/day, BMI and BMI-SDS, height growth velocity, Ht-SDS) and lab data in 30 prepubertal children, aged 7.4+-2.6 years, with CD, who were on GFD since the age of 3.2+-1.6 years of age (>2 years on GFD) for duration of 1 year. The anthropometric data of 30 randomly selected normal, age and sex matched, children were used as control. Lab investigations of CD children included complete blood count (CBC), renal and liver functions (aspartate transaminase - AST, alanine aminotransferase - ALT, and alkaline phosphatase- ALP, serum albumin, fasting blood glucose, vitamin D, and thyroid function and antibodies. RESULTS: The weight gain per day was on average or above, for age and sex, in 27 children and below average in 3. Two out of those 3 children had slow linear growth (decreased Ht-SDS by -0.56 and -0.1, over one year). BMI-SDS was normal in 26/30 patients (>-1.5). BMI-SD changed from -0.36+-1.1 to -0.33+-1.1 during the year of treatment. BMI-SDS decreased in 9 children during the follow up period that was explained by their fast-linear growth (increased Ht-SDS) in seven of them. The Ht-SDS was <-2 in four out of 30 children at the beginning of the study (2 years after being on GFD) and in 2 children after a year of follow-up (catch-up growth). Ht-SDS remained normal or increased in 28/30 children during the year of treatment (-0.38 +-1.2 to -0.22+-1.1), with a positive trend: 0.15+-0.4 SDS. Only one patient crossed down 1 Ht-SDS during the year of follow up, with low weight gain/day and decreased BMI-SDS that can be explained by poor compliance with GFD. Ht-SDS and BMI-SDS increased significantly in the CD group versus controls during the year of follow-up. All patients had normal serum albumin, liver enzyme and hemoglobin levels. 33.3% of patients had low serum ferritin level and 33.3% had a vitamin D deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Most of our children with CD grew normally both in height and weight during GFD. Significant catch-up growth occurred in some of them after 2 years of being on GFD. Those with low BMI-SDS and/or Ht-SDS needed further management, including reinforcement on the importance of GFD and investigations on factors affecting growth pattern. Measuring weight gain /day appears to be a sensitive indicator for monitoring growth in these children. Vitamin D and iron status should be monitored, and deficiencies corrected.
30159724	Development of wheat genotypes expressing a glutamine-specific endoprotease from barley and a prolyl endopeptidase from Flavobacterium meningosepticum or Pyrococcus furiosus as a potential remedy to celiac disease.	Ubiquitous nature of prolamin proteins dubbed gluten from wheat and allied cereals imposes a major challenge in the treatment of celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder with no known treatment other than abstinence diet. Administration of hydrolytic glutenases as food supplement is an alternative to deliver the therapeutic agents directly to the small intestine, where sensitization of immune system and downstream reactions take place. The aim of the present research was to evaluate the capacity of wheat grain to express and store hydrolytic enzymes capable of gluten detoxification. For this purpose, wheat scutellar calli were biolistically transformed to generate plants expressing a combination of glutenase genes for prolamin detoxification. Digestion of prolamins with barley endoprotease B2 (EP-HvB2) combined with Flavobacterium meningosepticum prolyl endopeptidase (PE-FmPep) or Pyrococcus furiosus prolyl endopeptidase (PE-PfuPep) significantly reduced (up to 67%) the amount of the indigestible gluten peptides of all prolamin families tested. Seven of the 168 generated lines showed inheritance of transgene to the T2 generation. Reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography of gluten extracts under simulated gastrointestinal conditions allowed the identification of five T2 lines that contained significantly reduced amounts of immunogenic, celiac disease-provoking gliadin peptides. These findings were complemented by the R5 ELISA test results where up to 72% reduction was observed in the content of immunogenic peptides. The developed wheat genotypes open new horizons for treating celiac disease by an intraluminal enzyme therapy without compromising their agronomical performance.

29974760	[Analysis of bone mineral density in children with celiac disease. Densitometry indications and effect of gluten-free diet].	INTRODUCTION: one of the main extradigestive manifestations of celiac disease is the decrease in bone mineral density (BMD). Bone densitometry performed with DXA is the method of choice for BMD assessment. Indications for its use in celiac children are controversial. OBJECTIVE: analyzing BMD and various clinical-analytical variables in celiac children when diagnosed and after a gluten-free diet. Define a profile of patients who are more likely to present BMD involvement based on several individual characteristics, to perform DXA indications. METHODS: study performed in 24 celiac children (12 boys) (age: 8.7 +- 3.3 years). Their BMD was determined at diagnosis and after a gluten-free diet using DXA. The BMD was compared in each patient in the two moments of the study and at the moment of diagnosis between groups of patients stratified according to severity criteria dependent on clinical, analytical and histological variables. RESULTS: BMD was normal in all patients studied at the time of diagnosis and after treatment, with no difference between the two moments of the analysis. Children who presented symptomatology when diagnosed with celiac disease had lower spine and femur BMD than asymptomatic ones. The calcemia had an inverse correlation with the time of evolution of the disease before its diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: in general, in our setting, the study of bone mineralization in celiac children is not indicated, unless there has been a prolonged clinical course before diagnosis.
32172690	Safety of occasional ingestion of gluten in patients with celiac disease: a real-life study.	BACKGROUND: Gluten-free diet (GFD) decreases the quality of life of celiac disease (CD) patients, who frequently ask to occasionally ingest gluten-containing food. We evaluated CD patients reporting voluntary and occasional transgressions to their GFD. METHODS: From October 2017 to September 2018, the patients reporting occasional and voluntary gluten ingestion (GFD-noncompliant) were prospectively enrolled. These patients underwent clinical examination, blood tests, duodenal biopsy, capsule enteroscopy (CE), and a validated food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) assessing the frequency and quantity of gluten intake. Mortality was calculated and compared to the general population. A group of patients on strict GFD (GFD-adherent) acted as controls. RESULTS: One thousand three hundred seventy-eight CD patients were evaluated during the study period. One hundred nine (8%) reported occasional (weekly or monthly) voluntary ingestion of gluten. The mean gluten intake was 185.2 +- 336.9 g/year, and the duration of their incorrect GFD was 8.6 +- 6.9 years. Among the noncompliant patients, 57% did not present any histological alteration; furthermore, the Marsh score profile was not different between compliant and noncompliant patients. Seventy percent did not present any alteration at CE. Seventy-five percent of patients reported no gastrointestinal symptoms after gluten ingestion. Twenty-three percent of patients in the GFD-noncompliant group presented positive tTG-IgA. No association was found between gluten intake, clinical symptoms, and biomarkers. Mortality was not different between the groups and the general population. CONCLUSIONS: Our results are that in a real-life scenario, a group of CD patients on long-term gluten intake showed no significant clinical symptoms or small bowel damage, thus suggesting that a degree of tolerance towards gluten consumption can be reached.
29709462	Faecal high mobility group box 1 in children with celiac disease: A pilot study.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a gluten-related immunological disorder resulting in inflammatory enteropathy. AIMS: We assessed a stool marker of intestinal inflammation, the HMGB1 protein, in children with CD on a gluten free diet (GFD) at baseline and at follow up (FU). METHODS: Thirty-nine children were investigated at diagnosis and at FU. Traditional serum markers of CD (anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysial antibodies) and faecal HMGB1 (by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblotting) were tested. RESULTS: There was a marked increase at baseline in both serum anti-transglutaminase IgA (anti-tTGAs) and faecal HMGB1; the latter being undetectable in controls. A strong correlation occurred between the two markers. At 12-month FU in 24 patients on GFD, HMGB1 decreased in all subjects, yet still being detectable in six children: high anti-tTGAs where evident in three, while the three with normal anti-tTGAs were complaining of intestinal symptoms and reported a low GFD adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Faecal HMGB1 is a valuable marker of intestinal inflammation and may have a role in complementing serology in the management of CD children. Future studies including larger patient cohorts and small bowel mucosa histology will be designed to assess the relationship between faecal HMGB1 levels and duodeno-jejunal histopathology.
37299462	Advances in Understanding the Human Gut Microbiota and Its Implication in Pediatric Celiac Disease-A Narrative Review.	Celiac disease (CD) is a multifactorial disorder, defined by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Both genetic predisposition and dietary exposure to gluten are essential factors in triggering CD. However, there is proof that their presence is necessary, but not sufficient, for disease development. Through gut microbiota modulation, several additional environmental factors have shown their potential role as co-factors in CD pathogenesis. The aim of this review is to illustrate the possible mechanisms that stand behind the gut microbiota's involvement in CD pathogenesis. Furthermore, we discuss microbiota manipulation's potential role as both a preventative and therapeutic option. The available literature provides evidence that even before CD onset, factors including cesarean birth and formula feeding, as well as intestinal infection exposure, amplify the risk of CD in genetically predisposed individuals, due to their influence on the intestinal microbiome composition. Active CD was associated with elevated levels of several Gram-negative bacterial genera, including Bacteroides, Escherichia, and Prevotella, while beneficial bacteria such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria were less abundant. Viral and fungal dysbiosis has also been described in CD, evidencing specific taxa alteration. A gluten-free diet (GFD) may improve the clinical symptoms and duodenal histopathology, but the persistence of intestinal dysbiosis in CD children under a GFD urges the need for additional therapy. Probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbial transplant have demonstrated their efficacy in restoring gut microbiota eubiosis in adult CD patients; however, their efficacy and safety as adjunctive therapies to a GFD in pediatric patients needs further investigation.
35979168	Pancreatic involvement in celiac disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is well recognized as a systemic, chronic autoimmune disease mainly characterized by gluten-sensitive enteropathy in genetically predisposed individuals but with various extraintestinal features. One of the affected organs in CD is the pancreas, consisting of both endocrine and exocrine alterations. Over the last decades there has been increasing interest in the pancreatic changes in CD, and this has been reflected by a great number of publications looking at this extraintestinal involvement during the course of CD. While pancreatic endocrine changes in CD, focusing on type 1 diabetes mellitus, are well documented in the literature, the relationship with the exocrine pancreas has been less studied. This review summarizes currently available evidence with regard to pancreatic exocrine alterations in CD, focusing on risk of pancreatitis in CD patients, association with autoimmune pancreatitis, prevalence and outcomes of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency in newly diagnosed and gluten-free diet treated CD patients, and the link with cystic fibrosis. In addition, we discuss mechanisms behind the associated pancreatic exocrine impairment in CD and highlight the recommendations for clinical practice.
28810029	Celiac Disease and Nonceliac Gluten Sensitivity: A Review.	IMPORTANCE: The prevalence of gluten-related disorders is rising, and increasing numbers of individuals are empirically trying a gluten-free diet for a variety of signs and symptoms. This review aims to present current evidence regarding screening, diagnosis, and treatment for celiac disease and nonceliac gluten sensitivity. OBSERVATIONS: Celiac disease is a gluten-induced immune-mediated enteropathy characterized by a specific genetic genotype (HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 genes) and autoantibodies (antitissue transglutaminase and antiendomysial). Although the inflammatory process specifically targets the intestinal mucosa, patients may present with gastrointestinal signs or symptoms, extraintestinal signs or symptoms, or both, suggesting that celiac disease is a systemic disease. Nonceliac gluten sensitivity is diagnosed in individuals who do not have celiac disease or wheat allergy but who have intestinal symptoms, extraintestinal symptoms, or both, related to ingestion of gluten-containing grains, with symptomatic improvement on their withdrawal. The clinical variability and the lack of validated biomarkers for nonceliac gluten sensitivity make establishing the prevalence, reaching a diagnosis, and further study of this condition difficult. Nevertheless, it is possible to differentiate specific gluten-related disorders from other conditions, based on currently available investigations and algorithms. Clinicians cannot distinguish between celiac disease and nonceliac gluten sensitivity by symptoms, as they are similar in both. Therefore, screening for celiac disease must occur before a gluten-free diet is implemented, since once a patient initiates a gluten-free diet, testing for celiac disease is no longer accurate. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Celiac disease and nonceliac gluten sensitivity are common. Although both conditions are treated with a gluten-free diet, distinguishing between celiac disease and nonceliac gluten sensitivity is important for long-term therapy. Patients with celiac disease should be followed up closely for dietary adherence, nutritional deficiencies, and the development of possible comorbidities.
35225129	Next generation strategies to recover immunological tolerance in celiac disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease that occurs in genetically predisposed individuals following the ingestion of gluten. Its prevalence is rising worldwide. A gluten-free (GF) diet is mandatory for the management of CD. However, several issues persist regarding the nutritional quality of GF products. Importantly, deep knowledge about the pathogenic mechanisms in CD highlights the central role of CD4+ T cell-mediated immunity in CD. Furthermore, intestinal T regulatory cells are functional in CD, but cytokines such as IL-15, produced under inflammatory conditions, hamper their activity. This paves the way for the development of immunomodulatory strategies to the GF diet. From this perspective, microbiological approaches were considered able to modulate the gluten-specific immune response. Interestingly, gliadin peptide-based immunotherapy to abolish the inflammatory CD4+T cell-mediated response has been explored in CD patients. Furthermore, different biotechnological approaches based on the use of chemically/enzymatically modified gluten molecules have been proved effective in different models of CD. However, the choice of the right age in infants to introduce the antigen and thus induce tolerance still remains an important issue to solve. Addressing all these points should help to design an effective intervention strategy for preventing CD.
33825090	Cost, Nutritional Content and Number of Gluten-Free Staple Foods Available in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.	Data has indicated that gluten-free (GF) foods are more expensive and have lower nutritional value than their gluten-containing (GC) counterparts. The aim of the present study was to compare the cost and nutrient content between GF and GC staple foods and determine whether the number and price of GF staple foods differed based on type of store or location within Winnipeg, Canada. Twelve grocery stores (2 chain stores/quadrant;1 local store/quadrant) in the four quadrants (northwest, northeast, southwest, southeast) of Winnipeg were visited to identify GF staple products (bread, flour, cereal, pasta) along with a GC comparator. A total of 819 GF products along with GC comparators were identified. The median cost of GF products ($1.50/100 g) was 131 % greater than that of GC ($0.65/100 g) (p < 0.0001). The greatest difference in cost was between GF and GC flour, with the least difference occurring between GF and GC cereal. GF products were 58, 36 and 100 % lower in iron, protein and saturated fat (p < 0.0001) than their GC comparators, respectively. The number of GF staple products was 370 % higher (p < 0.007) at chain stores than at local stores, whereas store location did not significantly affect the number of GF products available. The greatest difference in number of different GF foods based on store type was for cereals, with the least being for flours. These results confirm that GF staple foods are more expensive and have lower nutritional value (mainly due to lower iron and protein content) compared to GC foods.
30926284	Risk of bacterial pneumonia and pneumococcal infection in youths with celiac disease - A population-based study.	OBJECTIVE: Assess the risk of hospitalizations for bacterial pneumonia or pneumococcal infections, in a cohort of young individuals with celiac disease (CD) compared to matched references. STUDY DESIGN: The cohort consists of 213,635 individuals, born in 1989-2012 and resident in Friuli-Venezia Giulia (Italy). Through pathology reports, hospital discharge records or co-payment exemptions, we identified 1294 CD patients and 6470 reference individuals matched by gender and birth year. We considered hospital admissions for first episodes of bacterial pneumonia and pneumococcal infections. Hazard ratios (HRs) for episodes after CD diagnosis were calculated with Cox regression and odds ratios (OR) for the ones before CD diagnosis with conditional logistic regression. Further analyses were performed on unvaccinated follow-up periods. RESULTS: 14 CD patients (in 9450 person-years) and 42 references (in 48,335 person-years) experienced a first episode of bacterial pneumonia, with an increased risk among CD patients (HR 1.82; 95%CI 0.98-3.35). Risks of bacterial pneumonia were significantly increased before CD diagnosis and especially the year before CD diagnosis (OR 6.00, 95%CI 1.83-19.66). Risks of pneumococcal infections showed a non-significant increase in CD patients. CONCLUSIONS: CD children and youth showed an increased risk of bacterial pneumonia, especially in proximity to CD diagnosis. Anti-pneumococcal vaccination should be recommended to all young CD patients.
34586475	Elevated liver enzymes of newly diagnosed pediatric celiac patients-a prospective-observational study.	Celiac disease clinical presentation is constantly changing. We set to determine the prevalence of elevated transaminases in newly diagnosed celiac patients and to evaluate this sub-group of patients for associated clinical and laboratory findings and assess their natural course of disease following therapeutic diet initiation. We conducted a prospective-observational study of all newly diagnosed pediatric celiac patients, between August 2016 and April 2018, in a pediatric gastroenterology clinic. Clinical data, anthropometrics, and blood test results were recorded at diagnosis and at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively, of follow-up. We compared patients with normal and elevated transaminases at diagnosis. ALT threshold was set at 24 U/l. Of 125 newly diagnosed celiac patients, 31 (24.8%) had elevated ALT at diagnosis; two (1.6%) with over 3 x ULN. Patients with elevated ALT at diagnosis were significantly younger (mean age 5.5 (SD 3.4) vs. 7.3 (SD 3.7) years, p < 0.01) and more commonly presented with diarrhea (32.3% vs. 14.9%, p = 0.03). Eighty percent of patients with elevated ALT levels normalized their ALT within 3 months and all within 1 year. Following gluten-free diet initiation, patients with elevated ALT had similar clinical course, growth, serology normalization rate, and laboratory results, compared to patients with normal ALT over a 1-year follow-up. A single patient was simultaneously co-diagnosed with celiac disease and autoimmune hepatitis.Conclusion: Clinically significant ALT abnormalities are rare among newly diagnosed pediatric celiac patients. Significant elevations failing to normalize on a gluten-free diet should raise concern of a concomitant primary liver disease and warrant further investigations. What is Known:   Elevated liver enzymes may be an extra-intestinal manifestation of celiac disease.   Reported prevalences of ALT elevations among children with a new diagnosis of celiac disease ranges between 5 and 40%. What is New:   ALT elevations are present in 25% of children with a new diagnosis of celiac disease.   Significant elevations (>3 x ULN) are rare (1.6%).   Elevated liver enzymes are associated with earlier age at diagnosis.   The natural history of patients with elevated liver enzymes at diagnosis is comparable to those without.
35810780	Regulatory and Clinical Expert Perspective of the 2022 FDA Draft Guidance "Celiac Disease: Developing Drugs for Adjunctive Treatment to a Gluten-Free Diet".	
31115370	Role of anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA+IgG antibodies in detection of potential celiac disease in patients with type 1 diabetes.	BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: : Celiac disease (CD) can exist in various forms in type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients and can remain undetected, leading to severe complications. This study was aimed to evaluate five commercially available anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) ELISA kits with distinct formats for the detection of CD and potential CD in T1D patients. Clinical and demographic profiles of the patients with different disease subsets were also studied. METHODS: : Fifty T1D patients with classical and non-classical symptoms of CD and 100 T1D patients without any symptoms of CD were included in this study. Anti-tTG autoantibody levels were estimated by five ELISA kits followed by histological examination of duodenal biopsy. HLA DQ2-DQ8 and DRB1-DQB1 typing was done, and serum levels for transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 were also estimated. RESULTS: : Assay format detecting anti-tTG IgA antibodies against recombinant antigens along with neopeptides of gliadin was most efficient in the detection of CD in symptomatic patients, and assay format detecting IgA+IgG helped in the detection of potential CD in asymptomatic T1D patients. These findings were supported by histological examination and human leucocyte antigen analysis. Patients with potential CD were found to have markedly deranged glycaemic control parameters and also had significantly raised serum levels of TGF-beta1, (P <0.05) compared to T1D patients. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: : Potential CD can be frequently seen in T1D patients. This can be attributed to the dietary patterns prevalent in the subcontinent and the genetic basis of the disease. Anti-tTG IgA+IgG antibodies can be useful in the detection of these potential CD cases in T1D patients. Early intervention with gluten-free diet can be considered in these patients for better disease management.
30065211	Cognitive Impairment and Celiac Disease: Is Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation a Trait d'Union between Gut and Brain?	Celiac disease is a systemic disorder with multifactorial pathogenesis and multifaceted symptomatology. In response to gluten exposure, a significant part of the general population produces antibodies that have been hypothesized to be deleterious to the brain. Among the well-known neurological manifestations, adult celiac patients often complain cognitive symptoms, ranging from the so-called "brain fog" till an overt dementia. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that can contribute to the assessment and monitoring of celiac patients, even in those without a clear neurological involvement. The studies here reviewed seem to converge on an impaired central motor conductivity and a "hyperexcitable celiac brain" to TMS, which partially reverts back after a long-term gluten restriction. Notably, a clear hyperexcitability is a stably reported feature of both degenerative and vascular dementia. Therefore, given its potential neuroprotective effect, the gluten-free diet should be introduced as early as possible, although the overall response of neurological symptoms (and cognition in particular) is still controversial. Identifying new and possibly modifiable risk factors may be of crucial importance for patients, clinicians, and researchers.
31581722	The Pros and Cons of Using Oat in a Gluten-Free Diet for Celiac Patients.	A therapeutic gluten-free diet often has nutritional limitations. Nutritional qualities such as high protein content, the presence of biologically active and beneficial substances (fiber, beta-glucans, polyunsaturated fatty acids, essential amino acids, antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals), and tolerance by the majority of celiac patients make oat popular for use in gluten-free diet. The health risk of long-time consumption of oat by celiac patients is a matter of debate. The introduction of oat into the diet is only recommended for celiac patients in remission. Furthermore, not every variety of oat is also appropriate for a gluten-free diet. The risk of sensitization and an adverse immunologically mediated reaction is a real threat in some celiac patients. Several unsolved issues still exist which include the following: (1) determination of the susceptibility markers for the subgroup of celiac patients who are at risk because they do not tolerate dietary oat, (2) identification of suitable varieties of oat and estimating the safe dose of oat for the diet, and (3) optimization of methods for detecting the gliadin contamination in raw oat used in a gluten-free diet.
32075276	Narrative Review: Nutrient Deficiencies in Adults and Children with Treated and Untreated Celiac Disease.	Nutrient deficiencies are well recognized as secondary consequences of celiac disease (CD) and closely related to the clinical presentation of affected patients. Despite their clinical significance, consensus is lacking on the pattern and frequency of nutrient deficiencies in CD, the usefulness of their assessment at the time of diagnosis and during follow-up. This review aims to provide an overview of nutrient deficiencies among pediatric and adult CD patients at diagnosis and on a gluten-free diet (GFD), and their potential causes in CD. Secondly, we review their impact on CD management strategies including the potential of nutrient supplementation. A search of Medline, Pubmed and Embase until January 2019 was performed. Despite a high variability between the reported deficiencies, we noted that nutrient deficiencies occur frequently in children and adults with CD at diagnosis and during treatment with a GFD. Both inadequate dietary intake and/or diminished uptake due to intestinal dysfunction contribute to nutrient deficiencies. Most deficiencies can be restored with (long-term) treatment with a GFD and/or supplementation. However, some of them persist while others may become even more prominent during GFD. Our results indicate a lack of comprehensive evidence on the clinical efficacy of nutrient supplementation in CD management highlighting the need for further studies.
31331324	Celiac disease: a comprehensive current review.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease remains a challenging condition because of a steady increase in knowledge tackling its pathophysiology, diagnosis, management, and possible therapeutic options. MAIN BODY: A major milestone in the history of celiac disease was the identification of tissue transglutaminase as the autoantigen, thereby confirming the autoimmune nature of this disorder. A genetic background (HLA-DQ2/DQ8 positivity and non-HLA genes) is a mandatory determinant of the development of the disease, which occurs with the contribution of environmental factors (e.g., viral infections and dysbiosis of gut microbiota). Its prevalence in the general population is of approximately 1%, with female predominance. The disease can occur at any age, with a variety of symptoms/manifestations. This multifaceted clinical presentation leads to several phenotypes, i.e., gastrointestinal, extraintestinal, subclinical, potential, seronegative, non-responsive, and refractory. Although small intestinal biopsy remains the diagnostic 'gold standard', highly sensitive and specific serological tests, such as tissue transglutaminase, endomysial and deamidated gliadin peptide antibodies, have become gradually more important in the diagnostic work-up of celiac disease. Currently, the only treatment for celiac disease is a life-long, strict gluten-free diet leading to improvement in quality of life, ameliorating symptoms, and preventing the occurrence of refractory celiac disease, ulcerative jejunoileitis, and small intestinal adenocarcinoma and lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: The present review is timely and provides a thorough appraisal of various aspects characterizing celiac disease. Remaining challenges include obtaining a better understanding of still-unclear phenotypes such as slow-responsive, potential (minimal lesions) and seronegative celiac disease. The identification of alternative or complementary treatments to the gluten-free diet brings hope for patients unavoidably burdened by diet restrictions.
33804221	Wait-and-See Approach or Gluten-Free Diet Administration-The Rational Management of Potential Coeliac Disease.	Potential celiac disease (PCD) is a heterogeneous disease; only some patients develop full celiac disease (CD), characterised by advanced atrophic changes in the small intestine. Few accurate prognostic factors exist for the progression of PCD; therefore, therapeutic decisions should be made on an individual basis in each case. Patients with clinical gastroenterological or parenteral symptoms often benefit from a gluten-free diet, and those left on a diet containing gluten should receive clinical, serological and histopathological supervision.
38756445	Salivary interleukin-17A and interleukin-18 levels in patients with celiac disease and periodontitis.	Background: An increased level of interleukin-17A and interleukin-18 in the serum and intestinal mucosa of celiac disease patients reflecting the severity of villous atrophy and inflammation was documented. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the concentrations of salivary-17A, interleukin-1 beta, and interleukin-18 in patients with celiac disease who are on a gluten-free diet, both with and without periodontitis, and to compare these levels with those in healthy individuals. Methods: The study involved 23 participants with serologically confirmed celiac disease (CD) and 23 control subjects. The CD patients had been following a gluten-free diet (GFD) for a minimum of 1 year and had no other autoimmune disorders. The research involved collecting demographic data, conducting periodontal examinations, gathering unstimulated whole saliva, and performing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to measure salivary interleukin-17A, interleukin-1 beta, and interleukin-18 levels. Spearman's correlation analysis was utilized to explore the relationships between CD markers in patients on a GFD and their periodontal clinical findings. Results: The periodontal findings indicated significantly lower values in celiac disease patients adhering to a gluten-free diet compared to control subjects (p = 0.001). No significant differences were found in salivary IL-17A, IL-18, and IL-1B levels between celiac disease patients and control subjects. Nevertheless, the levels of all interleukins were elevated in periodontitis patients in both the celiac and control groups. The IL-1 Beta level was significantly higher in periodontitis patients compared to non-periodontitis patients in the control group (p = 0.035). Significant negative correlations were observed between serum IgA levels and plaque index (r = -0.460, p = 0.010), as well as gingival index (r = -0.396, p = 0.030) in CD patients on a gluten-free diet. Conclusion: Celiac disease patients on gluten-free diet exhibited better periodontal health compared to control subjects. However, increased levels of salivary IL-17A, IL-18 and IL-1B levels were associated with periodontitis. Additionally, serum IgA level was significantly inversely associated with periodontitis clinical manifestations and with salivary inflammatory mediators in CD patients on GFD.
35001079	Detection of gluten immunogenic peptides and the Celiac Disease Adherence Test to monitor gluten-free diet: a pilot study.	Gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) in feces and/or urine have recently been proposed as a sensitive and specific marker to detect ongoing gluten intake. Here, we compared GIP with the Celiac Disease Adherence Test (CDAT), a simple validated self-administered questionnaire that measures adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD). Of 70 subjects (59 women), six were classified as non-adherent by fecal GIP (mean 0.23 microg/g, standard deviation 0.08, range 0.082-0.319), including five classified as non-adherent by CDAT. GFD adherence was significantly higher by GIP than CDAT (p < 0.001). Fecal GIP may be useful as a biomarker for ongoing gluten intake that is not possible to detect with current clinical methods to assess GFD adherence, and may play a role in the management of persistent gastrointestinal symptoms in celiac disease.
33362776	Effects of In Vivo Gluten Challenge on PBMC Gene Expression Profiles in Diet Treated Celiac Disease.	The pathological mechanisms that lead to the onset and reactivation of celiac disease (CD) remain largely unknown. While gluten free diet (GFD) improves the intestinal damage and associated clinical symptoms in majority of cases, it falls short of providing full recovery. Additionally, late or misdiagnosis is also common as CD presents with a wide range of symptoms. Clear understanding of CD pathogenesis is thus critical to address both diagnostic and treatment concerns. We aimed to study the molecular impact of short gluten exposure in GFD treated CD patients, as well as identify biological pathways that remain altered constitutively in CD regardless of treatment. Using RNAseq profiling of PBMC samples collected from treated CD patients and gluten challenged patient and healthy controls, we explored the peripheral transcriptome in CD patients following a short gluten exposure. Short gluten exposure of just three days was enough to alter the genome-wide PBMC transcriptome of patients. Pathway analysis revealed gluten-induced upregulation of mainly immune response related pathways, both innate and adaptive, in CD patients. We evaluated the perturbation of biological pathways in sample-specific manner. Compared to gluten exposed healthy controls, pathways related to tight junction, olfactory transduction, metabolism of unsaturated fatty acids (such as arachidonic acid), metabolism of amino acids (such as cysteine and glutamate), and microbial infection were constitutively altered in CD patients regardless of treatment, while GFD treatment appears to mostly normalize immune response pathways to "healthy" state. Upstream regulator prediction analysis using differentially expressed genes identified constitutively activated regulators relatively proximal to previously reported CD associated loci, particularly SMARCA4 on 19p13.2 and CSF2 on 5q31. We also found constitutively upregulated genes in CD that are in CD associated genetic loci such as MEF2BNB-MEF2B (BORCS8-MEF2B) on 19p13.11 and CSTB on 21q22.3. RNAseq revealed strong effects of short oral gluten challenge on whole PBMC fraction and constitutively altered pathways in CD PBMC suggesting important factors other than gluten in CD pathogenesis.
29247390	Cognitive impairment in celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity: review of literature on the main cognitive impairments, the imaging and the effect of gluten free diet.	Celiac disease (CD) and non celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) can be responsible for neurological complications such as ataxia and peripheral neuropathies but also cognitive impairment. This cognitive involvement is variable in its expression, its duration and its prognosis ranging from transient and reversible subtle involvement to dementia itself. Through this article, we tried to achieve a review of the literature to better understand this topic. Several mechanisms were proposed to explain the deleterious influence of gluten-related pathologies on cognitive functions: nutritional deficiencies, elevation of circulating cytokine levels due to systemic inflammation, low brain serotonin levels... Several types of dementia such as Alzheimer dementia, vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia were reported in association with CD. Memory disorder, acalculia, inattention, visuospatial deficits and executive dysfunction must be sought systematically by a neuropsychological assessment in patients with CD or NCGS. As far as the cognitive impairment is concerned, there is no pathognomonic radiological lesion. Concerning therapeutic management; although its effect is controversial, gluten free diet should be introduced, as early as possible, because of its potentially protective effect.
38742113	Enhancing life with celiac disease: unveiling effective tools for assessing health-related quality of life.	Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune chronic enteropathy provoked by gluten ingestion in genetically predisposed individuals. Considering it s only safe treatment is a lifelong gluten-free diet, the burden of living with the disease becomes evident, as well as the need to assess CD health-related quality of life (HRQOL). This review aims to identify and analyze the instruments used to evaluate the HRQOL of adults with CD. This integrative review using a systematic approach was designed to achieve high scientific standards. Accordingly, the search strategy was developed and executed as recommended by the guideline of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Detailed individual searches were developed to Pubmed, Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. After careful analysis of the papers, 43 studies were included, in which seven instruments were identified: Celiac Disease Questionnaire (CDQ) (n=21), Celiac Disease Specific Quality of Life Instrument (CD-QOL) (n=17), Celiac Disease Assessment Questionnaire (CDAQ) (n=4), CeliacQ-7 (n=1), CeliacQ-27 (n=1), Black and Orfila s self-developed instrument (n=1) and the Coeliac Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire (CDQL) (n=1). The CDQ and CD-QOL were the two most applied instruments. Since the first focuses on the physical and mental symptoms related to the disease and the second focuses on the emotional repercussions of adhering to the GFD treatment for life (dysphoria), the CDQ application is an interesting option for countries that struggle with public policies for CD patients and patients with active CD. The CD-QOL could be used for countries with strict regulations for CD and gluten-free products and populations in remission. When comparing results among different populations, it is preferable to utilize culturally validated instruments, which have been applied across multiple countries, providing greater comparability between study findings.
31402697	Gluten-related disorders: Celiac disease, wheat allergy, and nonceliac gluten sensitivity.	The consumption of gluten-free products is becoming an increased alimentary habit in the general population. The scientific unfounded perception suggesting that the avoidance of gluten would improve health or that gluten could be toxic for humans are fostering medically unjustified adherences to a gluten-free diet. Currently, only patients diagnosed with celiac disease are advised to follow a strict lifelong gluten-free diet. In the same way, patients diagnosed with IgE-mediated wheat allergy must avoid exposure to wheat in any form. In that context, a third disorder, called nonceliac gluten sensitivity, characterized by distress after gluten consumption and in which neither celiac disease nor IgE-mediated allergy plays a role, has gained increased attention in the last years. Although important scientific advances have been made in the understanding of the pathologic mechanisms behind nonceliac gluten sensitivity, this disorder is still a matter of active debate in the scientific community. In the present review, the most recent advances in the immunopathology, diagnostic biomarkers and susceptibility determinants of gluten-related diseases are summarized and discussed. Furthermore, an updated overview of the new potential therapies that are currently underway for the treatment of gluten-related disorders is also provided.
35085750	A large series of true pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysms.	INTRODUCTION: True pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysms (PDAAs) are rare, and prior reports often fail to distinguish true aneurysms from pseudoaneuryms. We sought to characterize all patients who presented to our health system from 2004 to 2019 with true PDAAs, with a focus on risk factors, interventions, and patient outcomes. METHODS: Patients were identified by querying a single health system picture archiving and communication system database for radiographic reports noting a PDAA. A retrospective chart review was performed on all identified patients. Patients with pseudoaneurysm, identified as those with a history of pancreatitis, abdominal malignancy, hepatopancreaticobiliary surgery, or abdominal trauma, were excluded. Continuous variables were compared using t-tests, and categorical variables were compared using Fisher's exact tests. RESULTS: A total of 59 true PDAAs were identified. Forty aneurysms (68%) were intact (iPDAAs) and 19 (32%) were ruptured (rPDAAs) at presentation. The mean size of rPDAAs was 16.4 mm (median size, 14.0 mm; range, 10-42 mm), and the mean size of iPDAAs was 19.4 mm (median size, 17.5 mm; range, 8-88 mm); this difference was not statistically significant (P = .95). Significant celiac disease (occlusion or >70% stenosis) was noted in 39 aneurysms (66%). Those with rupture were less likely to have significant celiac disease (42% vs 78%; P = .017) and less likely to have aneurysmal wall calcifications (6% vs 53%; P = .002). Thirty-seven patients underwent intervention (63%), with eight (22%) undergoing concomitant hepatic revascularization (two stents and six bypasses) due to the presence of celiac disease. Eighteen patients with occluded celiac arteries underwent aneurysm intervention; of those, 11 were performed without hepatic revascularization (61.1%). Those with rPDAAs experienced an aneurysm-related mortality of 10.5%, whereas those with iPDAAs experienced a rate of 5.6%. One patient with celiac occlusion and PDA rupture who did not undergo hepatic artery bypass expired postoperatively from hepatic ischemia. rPDAAs showed a trend toward the increased need for aneurysm-related endovascular or open reintervention, but this was not statistically significant (47% vs 28%; P = .13). CONCLUSIONS: These findings support previous reports that the rupture risk of PDAAs is independent of size, their development is often associated with significant celiac stenosis or occlusion, and rupture risk appears decreased in patients with concomitant celiac disease or aneurysm wall calcifications. Endovascular intervention is the preferred initial treatment for both iPDAAs and rPDAAs, but reintervention rates are high in both groups. The role for hepatic revascularization remains uncertain, but it does not appear to be mandatory in all patients with complete celiac occlusion who undergo PDAA interventions.
37669330	Clinical Features of Children With Serology Negative, Biopsy Positive Celiac Disease.	The prevalence of pediatric serological negative celiac disease (SNCD) is poorly described, with few recognized clinical predictors beyond immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency or reduced gluten intake. The purpose of this retrospective review was to describe the prevalence of SNCD at the Stollery Children's Hospital and identify clinical features to help in recognition of these cases. Patients with a positive biopsy and negative serology (SNCD) were compared to those with positive biopsy and serology. SNCD diagnosis required clinical correlation and either confirmatory genetics or follow up endoscopy on a gluten-free diet. Of the 424 patients who met celiac disease (CD) criteria, 4.7% (n = 20) fulfilled our criteria for SNCD. There was a significant difference in the rates of IgA deficiency between the 2 groups, but no other clinical features were found that allowed for ready identification of SNCD patients.
34909845	THE MANAGEMENT OF DERMATITIS HERPETIFORMIS BY THE GASTROENTEROLOGIST. A SERIES OF CASES.	BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is considered a skin celiac disease (CD). The individuals can be seen by primary care professionals or by dermatologists that could refer the patient to a gastroenterologist. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to investigate the clinical profile of patients diagnosed with DH and referred to a gastroenterologist and evaluate the treatment response. METHODS: We retrospectively studied patients with DH referred to the same gastroenterologist at a private office in Curitiba, Brazil, between January 2010 to December 2019. We included adult patients with a confirmed DH diagnosis. Symptoms, clinical signs, laboratory and histological data, as well as treatment response, were collected. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients were studied (60.6% women, mean age at diagnosis 40.8+-12.61 years). The median delay for DH diagnosis was four years. Skin involvement was mild in 33.3%, moderate in 18.2%, and severe in 48.5%. The more frequent gastrointestinal complaints were abdominal distension (78.8%), flatulence (75.7%), and gastroesophageal reflux (51.5%). Depression and anxiety were observed in 81.8% and anemia in 51.1%. A higher prevalence of bone disorders was associated with higher age at DH diagnosis (P=0.035). Duodenal biopsy showed changes in all patients. Improvement after treatment only with a gluten-free diet (GFD) plus dapsone was verified in 81.2%. CONCLUSION: Patients with DH referred to a gastroenterologist showed a high frequency of gluten intolerance and systemic complaints. Duodenal histological alterations were found in all the cases. The treatment based on GFD plus dapsone was effective in most patients.
32981341	Recent strategies for tackling the problems in gluten-free diet and products.	The gluten-free food market is growing with the increases in the number of people who adhere to gluten-free diet. The noteworthy increase in the number of people following a gluten-free diet may be associated to the diagnosis of many silent and subclinical celiac disease cases, improved knowledge of celiac disease, gluten allergy or gluten sensitivity as well as to popular belief that gluten-free diet is healthier. Despite the increase in the number of people following a gluten-free diet, the lack of awareness and knowledge about gluten-free diet generates problems for non-celiac people who are considering that gluten-free products are healthier as well as for celiac people who have to follow gluten-free diet. Notwithstanding the increasing interest in adopting gluten-free diet, there are still important obstacles affecting the adherence to gluten-free diet. The limited availability, high price of products, insufficient labeling, cross-contamination risk, treatment burden, lack of knowledge and information about celiac disease and about gluten-free diet, psychological factors in celiac patients, the adverse effects of a gluten-free diet and quality defects of gluten-free products are among the major problems that faced by celiac patients. In this perspective, the aim of this review is to provide an overview of important challenges in the maintenance of a strict gluten-free diet that faced by celiac patients during the adherence to gluten-free diet and related approaches have been able for tackling the problems.
34507373	Results from the German registry for refractory celiac disease.	Refractory celiac disease (RCD) refers to a rare subgroup of patients with celiac disease who show clinical signs of malabsorption despite a gluten-free diet. RCD is divided into an autoimmune phenotype (RCD type I) and pre-lymphoma (RCD type II). To reflect the clinical reality in managing this disease in Germany, a national register was established based on a questionnaire developed specifically for this purpose. Between 2014 and 2020, a total of 53 patients were registered. The diagnosis of RCD was confirmed in 46 cases (87%). This included 27 patients (59%) with RCD type I and 19 patients (41%) with RCD type II. A wide range of diagnostic and therapeutic measures was used. Therapeutically, budesonide was used in 59% of the RCD patients regardless of the subtype. Nutritional therapy was used in only 5 patients (11%). Overall mortality was 26% (12 patients) with a clear dominance in patients with RCD type II (9 patients, 47%). In summary, RCD needs to become a focus of national guidelines to increase awareness, establish standards, and thus enable the treating physician to make the correct diagnosis in a timely manner. Moreover, we concluded that when treating such patients, contacting a specialized center is recommended to ensure sufficient management.
34647492	Gastrointestinal microbiome and gluten in celiac disease.	Coeliac disease (CD), also known as gluten sensitive enteropathy, is an autoimmune intestinal disease induced by gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. Gluten is a common ingredient in daily diet and is one of the main environmental factors to induce coeliac disease. Adhering to gluten free diet (GFD) is an effective method for treating CD. Microbiota plays an extremely important role in maintaining human health, and diet is the main factor to regulate the composition and function of gut microbiota. Recent studies have shown that gluten metabolism is closely related to gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbiota. With the increasing prevalence of coeliac disease, there is a need for alternative treatments to GFD. In this review, biological medication of gluten, relationship between gluten and gut microflora, effect of GFD on GIT microflora, and effect of probiotics on CD were reviewed. By analysing the research progress on relationship between gluten and gastrointestinal microbiome in coeliac disease, this review tried to explore the prospective and potential mechanism of microecological agents in treating coeliac disease.
33717063	Anti-Inflammatory and Immunomodulatory Effects of Probiotics in Gut Inflammation: A Door to the Body.	Hosting millions of microorganisms, the digestive tract is the primary and most important part of bacterial colonization. On one side, in cases of opportunistic invasion, the abundant bacterial population inside intestinal tissues may face potential health problems such as inflammation and infections. Therefore, the immune system has evolved to sustain the host-microbiota symbiotic relationship. On the other hand, to maintain host immune homeostasis, the intestinal microflora often exerts an immunoregulatory function that cannot be ignored. A field of great interest is the association of either microbiota or probiotics with the immune system concerning clinical uses. This microbial community regulates some of the host's metabolic and physiological functions and drives early-life immune system maturation, contributing to their homeostasis throughout life. Changes in gut microbiota can occur through modification in function, composition (dysbiosis), or microbiota-host interplays. Studies on animals and humans show that probiotics can have a pivotal effect on the modulation of immune and inflammatory mechanisms; however, the precise mechanisms have not yet been well defined. Diet, age, BMI (body mass index), medications, and stress may confound the benefits of probiotic intake. In addition to host gut functions (permeability and physiology), all these agents have profound implications for the gut microbiome composition. The use of probiotics could improve the gut microbial population, increase mucus-secretion, and prevent the destruction of tight junction proteins by decreasing the number of lipopolysaccharides (LPSs). When LPS binds endothelial cells to toll-like receptors (TLR 2, 4), dendritic cells and macrophage cells are activated, and inflammatory markers are increased. Furthermore, a decrease in gut dysbiosis and intestinal leakage after probiotic therapy may minimize the development of inflammatory biomarkers and blunt unnecessary activation of the immune system. In turn, probiotics improve the differentiation of T-cells against Th2 and development of Th2 cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-10. The present narrative review explores the interactions between gut microflora/probiotics and the immune system starting from the general perspective of a biological plausibility to get to the in vitro and in vivo demonstrations of a probiotic-based approach up to the possible uses for novel therapeutic strategies.
38608449	Potential therapeutic options for celiac Disease: An update on Current evidence from Gluten-Free diet to cell therapy.	Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic autoimmune enteropathy and multifactorial disease caused by inappropriate immune responses to gluten in the small intestine. Weight loss, anemia, osteoporosis, arthritis, and hepatitis are among the extraintestinal manifestations of active CD. Currently, a strict lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only safe, effective, and available treatment. Despite the social burden, high expenses, and challenges of following a GFD, 2 to 5 percent of patients do not demonstrate clinical or pathophysiological improvement. Therefore, we need novel and alternative therapeutic approaches for patients. Innovative approaches encompass a broad spectrum of strategies, including enzymatic degradation of gluten, inhibition of intestinal permeability, modulation of the immune response, inhibition of the transglutaminase 2 (TG2) enzyme, blocking antigen presentation by HLA-DQ2/8, and induction of tolerance. Hence, this review is focused on comprehensive therapeutic strategies ranging from dietary approaches to novel methods such as antigen-based immunotherapy, cell and gene therapy, and the usage of nanoparticles for CD treatment.
37628981	Old and New Adjunctive Therapies in Celiac Disease and Refractory Celiac Disease: A Review.	Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic enteropathy caused by the ingestion of gluten in a genetically susceptible individual. Currently, a gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only recommended treatment. However, unintentional gluten ingestion or a persistent villous atrophy with malabsorption (regardless of a strict GFD) as in the case of Refractory Celiac Disease (RCD) represents a major issue. In this review, we have analysed and discussed data from both randomized controlled trials and observational studies concerning adjunctive therapies as well as novel therapies for the treatment of CD and RCD. The literature search was carried out through Medline and Scopus. In total, 2268 articles have been identified and 49 were included in this review (36 studies resulting from the search strategy and 13 from other sources). Today, GFD remains the only effective treatment, although steroids, mesalamine, and more recently biological therapies have found space in the complex management of RCD. Currently, studies evaluating the effectiveness of novel therapies are still limited and preliminary results have been controversial.
33491958	Persistent Villous Atrophy in De Novo Adult Patients With Celiac Disease and Strict Control of Gluten-Free Diet Adherence: A Multicenter Prospective Study (CADER Study).	INTRODUCTION: A substantial proportion of adult patients with celiac disease on a gluten-free diet exhibit persistent villous atrophy, and inadvertent gluten exposure may be one of the causes. The aim of the present study was to evaluate villous atrophy persistence after 2 years on a gluten-free diet in de novo adult patients with celiac disease with strict control of gluten exposure. METHODS: Symptomatic de novo adult patients with celiac disease were prospectively included. Clinical visits and dietary surveillance were scheduled every 6 months during a 2-year follow-up period. At each visit, fecal samples were collected and stored at -20  C until analysis for gluten immunogenic peptides (f-GIPs). A follow-up duodenal biopsy was performed at 2 years. We evaluated the variables associated with persistent villous atrophy. RESULTS: Seventy-six patients completed the study (36.5 +- 1.6 years, 73% women); persistent villous atrophy was observed in 40 (53%), whereas 72.5% were asymptomatic and 75% had negative serology. Detectable f-GIP >0.08 mug/g in at least 1 fecal sample was seen in 69% of patients. There were no significant differences in the median f-GIP at each visit and median area under the curve over the serial measurements between patients with persistent villous atrophy and those who recovered. On multivariate analysis, only older age was associated with persistent villous atrophy (32% for 16-30 years; 67% for >30 years; P = 0.016). DISCUSSION: The rate of persistent villous atrophy after 2 years was high in adult patients with celiac disease on an intentionally strict gluten-free diet. Low-level ongoing inadvertent gluten exposure could be a contributing factor to persistent villous atrophy.
31383006	A case of checkpoint inhibitor-induced celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have now become standard of care treatment for many malignancies. ICIs are associated with unique immune mediated adverse events (irAEs) due to dysregulation of immune activation. As treatment with ICIs is becoming more common, rare irAEs are also being recognized. Here we report a case of ICI-induced celiac disease. CASE: A 74-year-old Caucasian female with metastatic renal carcinoma received second line nivolumab (anti-PD1 antibody) after initial disease progression on sunitinib. Ipilimumab was added after she failed to respond to six cycles of nivolumab monotherapy. One week after her first cycle of combination treatment, she presented with nausea, vomiting, grade 1 diarrhea, and weight loss. She underwent endoscopy, which showed bile stasis in the stomach, normal appearing stomach mucosa, and nonbleeding erythematous mucosa in the duodenal bulb. Stomach biopsy showed moderate active chronic gastritis. Duodenal biopsy showed moderate chronic active duodenitis with focal neutrophilic cryptitis, mucosal erosions, villous atrophy, mildly increased intraepithelial lymphocytes, and moderate chronic inflammation in the lamina propria pathognomonic of celiac disease. Symptoms improved with gluten-free diet, twice-daily omeprazole and anti-emetics and she was able to continue on treatment. CONCLUSIONS: There has been only one published case reporting ICI-induced celiac disease. Our case report highlights a rare irAE (celiac disease) associated with ICI treatment. It is unclear whether the patient had previously undiagnosed celiac disease or whether ICIs triggered her enteritis. Our patient was able to continue treatment with ICIs with dietary modifications, suggesting correct diagnosis is critical for optimal patient outcome.
33833484	Non-responsive celiac disease in children on a gluten free diet.	BACKGROUND: Non-responsive celiac disease (NRCD) is defined as the persistence of symptoms in individuals with celiac disease (CeD) despite being on a gluten-free diet (GFD). There is scant literature about NRCD in the pediatric population. AIM: To determine the incidence, clinical characteristics and underlying causes of NRCD in children. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study performed at Boston Children's Hospital (BCH). Children < 18 years diagnosed with CeD by positive serology and duodenal biopsies compatible with Marsh III histology between 2008 and 2012 were identified in the BCH's Celiac Disease Program database. Medical records were longitudinally reviewed from the time of diagnosis through September 2015. NRCD was defined as persistent symptoms at 6 mo after the initiation of a GFD and causes of NRCD as well as symptom evolution were detailed. The children without symptoms at 6 mo (responders) were compared with the NRCD group. Additionally, presenting signs and symptoms at the time of diagnosis of CeD among the responders and NRCD patients were collected and compared to identify any potential predictors for NRCD at 6 mo of GFD therapy. RESULTS: Six hundred and sixteen children were included. Ninety-one (15%) met criteria for NRCD. Most were female (77%). Abdominal pain [odds ratio (OR) 1.8 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-2.9], constipation (OR 3.1 95%CI 1.9-4.9) and absence of abdominal distension (OR for abdominal distension 0.4 95%CI 0.1-0.98) at diagnosis were associated with NRCD. NRCD was attributed to a wide variety of diagnoses with gluten exposure (30%) and constipation (20%) being the most common causes. Other causes for NRCD included lactose intolerance (9%), gastroesophageal reflux (8%), functional abdominal pain (7%), irritable bowel syndrome (3%), depression/anxiety (3%), eosinophilic esophagitis (2%), food allergy (1%), eating disorder (1%), gastric ulcer with Helicobacter pylori (1%), lymphocytic colitis (1%), aerophagia (1%) and undetermined (13%). 64% of children with NRCD improved on follow-up. CONCLUSION: NRCD after >= 6 mo GFD is frequent among children, especially females, and is associated with initial presenting symptoms of constipation and/or abdominal pain. Gluten exposure is the most frequent cause.
30554200	Metabolic Alterations in Celiac Disease Occurring after Following a Gluten-Free Diet.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: Many investigations have demonstrated that changes in body weight are frequent in patients with coeliac disease (CD) after a gluten-free diet (GFD); conversely data on the metabolic syndrome (MS) and hepatic steatosis (HS) are still rare. The aim is to evaluate the prevalence of MS and HS in patients with CD, before and after a GFD. METHODS: One hundred eighty-five coeliac adult patients were enrolled in the study. Diagnosis of MS was made according to the current international criteria including waist circumference (WC), hypertension, reduction of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, hypertriglyceridemia, and hyperglycemia. Body mass index (BMI), hypercholesterolemia, and HS were also assessed. RESULTS: CD patients showed an increased risk of developing both MS and HS after following a GFD. MS was reported in 3.24% of the cases at the time of CD diagnosis and in 14.59% after GFD (p < 0.0001). HS was reported in 1.7% at the time of diagnosis and in 11.1% after GFD (p < 0.0001). With regard to metabolic sub-categories, the prevalence of the increase in WC, hypertension, reduction of HDL cholesterol, hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, and BMI > 25 was significantly higher after GFD compared to baseline at CD diagnosis. CONCLUSION: In CD patients, following a GFD maybe can contribute to the development of MS and HS. Patients should be informed about this possible risk.
34764141	Enteropathies with villous atrophy but negative coeliac serology in adults: current issues.	OBJECTIVE: The differential diagnosis and management of seronegative enteropathies is challenging due to the rarity of these conditions, the overlap of clinical and histopathological features and the current lack of an international consensus on their nomenclature. DESIGN: This is a narrative review providing pragmatic guide on the investigation and clinical management of seronegative enteropathies in adults based on the available literature and our clinical experience. CONCLUSIONS: Seronegative coeliac disease is the most frequent cause among the heterogeneous group of seronegative enteropathies and its diagnosis is confirmed by the clinical and histological response to a gluten-free diet after the exclusion of other causes of villous atrophy. Correct identification and targeted management of seronegative enteropathies is mandatory because of the variation in terms of clinical outcomes and prognosis.
31097786	Pharmaceutically modified subtilisins withstand acidic conditions and effectively degrade gluten in vivo.	Detoxification of gluten immunogenic epitopes is a promising strategy for the treatment of celiac disease. Our previous studies have shown that these epitopes can be degraded in vitro by subtilisin enzymes derived from Rothia mucilaginosa, a natural microbial colonizer of the oral cavity. The challenge is that the enzyme is not optimally active under acidic conditions as encountered in the stomach. We therefore aimed to protect and maintain subtilisin-A enzyme activity by exploring two pharmaceutical modification techniques: PEGylation and Polylactic glycolic acid (PLGA) microencapsulation. PEGylation of subtilisin-A (Sub-A) was performed by attaching methoxypolyethylene glycol (mPEG, 5 kDa). The PEGylation protected subtilisin-A from autolysis at neutral pH. The PEGylated Sub-A (Sub-A-mPEG) was further encapsulated by PLGA. The microencapsulated Sub-A-mPEG-PLGA showed significantly increased protection against acid exposure in vitro. In vivo, gluten immunogenic epitopes were decreased by 60% in the stomach of mice fed with chow containing Sub-A-mPEG-PLGA (0.2 mg Sub-A/g chow) (n = 9) compared to 31.9% in mice fed with chow containing unmodified Sub-A (n = 9). These results show that the developed pharmaceutical modification can protect Sub-A from auto-digestion as well as from acid inactivation, thus rendering the enzyme more effective for applications in vivo.
33795221	Dietary gluten avoidance in Canada: a cross-sectional study using survey data.	BACKGROUND: A gluten-free diet (GFD) is required for the management of some conditions, whereas some Canadians may follow a GFD for discretionary reasons. We sought to estimate the prevalence of Canadians who adhere to a GFD, identify factors associated with adherence to a GFD, and describe and compare the location of food preparation and consumption for those who follow a GFD, those who report no dietary avoidances and those reporting other dietary avoidances. METHODS: We used cross-sectional data from the 2015 Canadian Community Health Survey - Nutrition (n = 20 487). Demographic variables included sex, age group, ethnicity, highest level of household education and income adequacy. The relations between respondent characteristics and report of a GFD were estimated using logistic regression. Respondents were further categorized as avoiding dietary gluten, other dietary avoidances and no dietary avoidances. RESULTS: An estimated 1.9% of Canadians follow a GFD. Women had 2 times higher odds (odds ratio [OR] 2.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32 to 3.27) of reporting a GFD than men. After adjustment for income adequacy, household education, sex, age group and ethnicity, residents of Ontario and Quebec had about half the odds (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.87, and OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.94, respectively) of reporting a GFD compared with residents of Atlantic Canada. Canadians who followed a GFD consumed significantly fewer calories from foods prepared at restaurants than both Canadians who reported no dietary avoidances and those who reported dietary avoidances other than gluten. Canadians following a GFD reported that 2.0% (95% CI 1.1% to 2.9%) of their daily kilocalories were from foods prepared at restaurants, compared with 6.7% (95% CI 5.4% to 7.9%) for Canadians reporting 1 or more dietary avoidances other than gluten, and 6.4% (95% CI 6.0% to 6.9%) for those reporting no avoidances. INTERPRETATION: The estimated 1.9% prevalence of dietary gluten avoidance likely includes individuals with celiac disease, wheat allergies and nonceliac gluten sensitivity, as well as individuals excluding gluten in the management of irritable bowel syndrome or for reasons related to dietary trends. Canadians eating GFDs consume fewer daily calories from restaurant-prepared foods than other Canadians, which may have social implications.
30593798	Plasma Cells Are the Most Abundant Gluten Peptide MHC-expressing Cells in Inflamed Intestinal Tissues From Patients With Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Development of celiac disease is believed to involve the transglutaminase-dependent response of CD4+ T cells toward deamidated gluten peptides in the intestinal mucosa of individuals with specific HLA-DQ haplotypes. We investigated the antigen presentation process during this mucosal immune response. METHODS: We generated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for the peptide-MHC (pMHC) complex of HLA-DQ2.5 and the immunodominant gluten epitope DQ2.5-glia-alpha1a using phage display. We used these mAbs to assess gluten peptide presentation and phenotypes of presenting cells by flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot (ELISPOT) in freshly prepared single-cell suspensions from intestinal biopsies from 40 patients with celiac disease (35 untreated and 5 on a gluten-free diet) as well as 18 subjects with confirmed noninflamed gut mucosa (controls, 12 presumed healthy, 5 undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy, and 1 with potential celiac disease). RESULTS: Using the mAbs, we detected MHC complexes on cells from intestinal biopsies from patients with celiac disease who consume gluten, but not from patients on gluten-free diets. We found B cells and plasma cells to be the most abundant cells that present DQ2.5-glia-alpha1a in the inflamed mucosa. We identified a subset of plasma cells that expresses B-cell receptors (BCR) specific for gluten peptides or the autoantigen transglutaminase 2 (TG2). Expression of MHC class II (MHCII) was not restricted to these specific plasma cells in patients with celiac disease but was observed in an average 30% of gut plasma cells from patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: A population of plasma cells from intestinal biopsies of patients with celiac disease express MHCII; this is the most abundant cell type presenting the immunodominant gluten peptide DQ2.5-glia-alpha1a in the tissues from these patients. These results indicate that plasma cells in the gut can function as antigen-presenting cells and might promote and maintain intestinal inflammation in patients with celiac disease or other inflammatory disorders.
33148252	Health related QoL in celiac disease patients in Slovenia.	BACKGROUND: Measurements of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among celiac disease patients using a validated questionnaire have been lacking in Slovenia. This study aims to measure HRQoL in celiac disease (CD) patients using EQ-5D internationally validated questionnaire and comparing it to the HRQoL of the general population. METHODS: In this cross sectional analysis all of the approximately 2000 members of the Slovenian Celiac Society were invited to take part. We used a 3 step approach for recruitment and data collection. HRQoL was evaluated through the EuroQoL EQ-5D-5L instrument (Slovenian version) and analysed using the ordinal logistic regression. RESULTS: Out of 321 patients who gave their consent, 247 celiac patients were included in the study (77%). 68% of the participants were female and 53% of them lived in an urban setting. Most patients originated from North-East Slovenia, whereas approximately 30% of patients came from other Slovenian regions. The EQ-5D respondents' self-reported health status at the time of the study show that most patients have slight or no problems when living with CD. The duration of the gluten-free diet, academic education and rare (< 1 x year) doctor visits affect EQ-5D in a positive way. On the other hand, higher age and chronic rheumatic disease were negatively associated with EQ-5D also when compared to the general population. CONCLUSION: This is the first Slovenian study to measure the HRQoL of Slovenian CD patients, using an internationally validated questionnaire. The results of our study show that HRQoL is slightly impaired among Slovenian patients with CD. Clinical characteristics are better determinants of their HRQoL than socio-demographic factors. Greater awareness of the impact of CD on patients' HRQoL would improve the holistic management of CD patients.
30885882	Benefits From and Barriers to Portable Detection of Gluten, Based on a Randomized Pilot Trial of Patients With Celiac Disease.	Research links diminished quality of life (QOL) to the challenges of a strict gluten-free diet (GFD), the only treatment for celiac disease (CD).1-4 This pilot study assessed the acceptability and feasibility of a portable gluten sensor device (Nima) to promote GFD adherence and QOL.
35064913	Impact of delay in diagnosis in patients with celiac disease: A study of 570 patients at a tertiary care center.	BACKGROUND: The varied presentation of celiac disease (CD) makes it challenging to diagnose it and predisposes to a significant diagnostic delay. We undertook a study to evaluate the effect of delayed diagnosis of CD on its systemic and laboratory manifestations. METHODS: In this retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data (January 2015 to December 2018), patients with CD >= 12 years were evaluated for clinical presentation and laboratory parameters. Based on duration of symptoms at the time of diagnosis, the patients were divided into 2 groups: group 1 (early diagnosis): <= 3 years, group 2 (delayed diagnosis): > 3 years. The two groups were compared for demographic, clinical, laboratory, and histological manifestations. RESULTS: Of the 570 patients, 289 constituted group 1 (early diagnosis) and 281 group 2 (delayed diagnosis). There was no age or sex difference between the two groups and both had comparable body mass index (BMI). Patients in the delayed group had lower rates of diarrhea as initial presentation with lower physician and gastroenterologist consultation and significantly higher rates of anemia, pubertal delay, and menstrual irregularities as well as higher rates of low hemoglobin, low ferritin, low transferrin saturation, and low vitamin D levels. The delayed group also had significantly higher anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody (anti-tTg Ab) titers and higher grades of villous atrophy at presentation. CONCLUSION: Patients with CD with more than 3 years of symptoms, more often have atypical presentation, anemia, pubertal delay, and more advanced histological changes. They also have fewer physician and gastroenterologist consultations. This underlines the need for proper awareness to ensure early diagnosis and treatment.
29401085	Creation of Experience-based Celiac Benchmarks: The First Step in Pretransition Self-management Assessment.	OBJECTIVES: Transition planning for children with chronic disease includes the development of independence in many self-management tasks. Conditions that depend on diet have distinct skill sets not well assessed by the traditional transition-readiness tools. There has been literature that describes age-appropriate skill acquisition for diabetes and food allergy patients. There are, however, no age-appropriate benchmarks established for celiac disease (CD). METHODS: CD experts (including physician, nurse, dietician, social worker, patient, and parent) created a list of celiac-related tasks, which formed the basis of the survey. Patients with CD, and their parents, were recruited from outpatient celiac clinic and support groups, and invited to report the age each task was mastered. RESULTS: Respondents included 204 patients and 155 parents. Mean age was 12 years (standard deviation 4.6) with average of 4 years since diagnosis. The earliest tasks were mastered by a median age of 8 years, such as recognizing GF as gluten-free, eating safely in a shared space and recognizing basic unsafe foods. Describing the effects of eating gluten or explaining CD to a friend or stranger occurred around age 10. Asking about gluten-free preparation in a restaurant, and identifying gluten-free medications or vitamins was mastered around age 12, whereas tasks involved with safe domestic travel or assessing risk in a job environment occurred between 14 and 16. The interquartile range was about 4 years for each question. No significant difference seen between patient and parent reports. CONCLUSIONS: This novel patient-centered celiac skill list may improve anticipatory guidance and accelerate self-management skills.
35291371	Coeliac disease hidden by cryptogenic hypertransaminasaemia in children: a case report.	Celiac disease is a chronic immune-mediated multisystem disorder that may affect several organs. Isolated hypertransaminasemia, with mild or nonspecific histologic changes in the liver biopsy, also known as "celiac hepatitis", is the most frequent presentation of liver injury in celiac disease. Both, histologic changes and liver enzymes reverse to normal after treatment with a gluten-free diet in most patients. Here we report the case of a young boy presenting with asymptomatic and persistent hypertransaminasemia whose etiologic investigation led to the diagnosis of celiac disease that resolved with dietary treatment alone. This case emphasizes the need to screen Celiac disease in patients with cryptogenic hypertransaminasemia, irrespective of the existence of gastrointestinal symptoms. It also exemplifies a particular situation in which a liver biopsy is useful to establish the diagnosis of celiac hepatitis.
31232884	HLA-DQ Genotyping, Duodenal Histology, and Response to Exclusion Diet in Autistic Children With Gastrointestinal Symptoms.	OBJECTIVES: A correlation between autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and gastrointestinal (GI) problems, and a possible link between gluten consumption and ASD have been increasingly reported. Gluten/casein-free diet (GCFD) is often undertaken, with conflicting results. This study aimed at evaluating the distribution of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2/DQ8 typing among patients with ASD with GI symptoms, together with its correlation with duodenal histology and response to GCFD. METHODS: Between 2002 and 2015 all patients with ASD with GI symptoms referred to our outpatient clinic, displaying clinical, laboratory, or ultrasound findings suggestive of organic disease, underwent endoscopy, celiac disease (CD) serum antibodies testing and HLA-DQ2/DQ8 genotyping. Patients were prescribed a 6-month GCFD, and then clinically reassessed. RESULTS: Among 151 enrolled patients, 134 (89%) were negative for CD-specific antibodies; 72 (48%) were positive for HLA-DQ2/DQ8; and 56 (37%) showed duodenal microscopic inflammation. Clinical improvement was observed in non-CD patients irrespective of the rigorous or partial adherence to the diet, being the difference nonstatistically significant. Response to diet was related to the presence of histological duodenal alterations at baseline (odds ratio 11.323, 95% confidence interval 1.386-92.549 for Marsh 2 pattern), but not to HLA-DQ2/DQ8 positivity (odds ratio 1.120, 95% confidence interval 0.462-2.716). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that children with ASD with GI symptoms have a high prevalence of duodenal intraepithelial lymphocytic infiltration, which seems to be linked to a mechanism other than autoimmune response to gluten consumption. Alteration of duodenal histology, but not the HLA-DQ2/DQ8 status, was associated with clinical response to the diet.
32344339	Reinventing the nutraceutical value of gluten: The case of l-theanine-gluten as a potential alternative to the gluten exclusion diet in celiac disease.	Functional foods have created an open environment for the development of new solutions to health-related issues. In celiac disease, there is still no therapeutic alternative other than the observance of a gluten-free diet. In this context, we developed a wheat flour enriched in l-theanine aimed to be a potential alternative to the gluten-free diet. Through microbial transglutaminase-catalysed transamidation of gluten proteins using ethylamine as amine nucleophile, substantial amounts of glutamine residues were converted in theanine residues. Furthermore, using T-cell lines generated from intestinal biopsy specimens of celiac disease patients, this treatment showed the potential to strongly reduce the ability of gluten proteins to stimulate a T-cell-mediated immune response. From a rheological point of view, the functionality of gluten was retained. Considering L-theanine's evidence-based health benefits, a novel functional food is presented here and for celiac disease can be a path towards the development of an alternative to the gluten-free diet.
30466678	Who Should Be Gluten-Free? A Review for the General Practitioner.	Historically, a gluten-free diet was recommended only for those with celiac disease or IgE-mediated wheat allergy. With changes in food allergy labeling in the United States and the publication of several best-selling books, gluten-related disorders have come to the forefront of popular culture. As a result, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of gluten-free diet followers, many for nontraditional reasons. As "going gluten-free" has become mainstream, it is imperative that health care providers acquire the knowledge to identify true gluten-related disorders to effectively counsel their patients and minimize potential complications from following such a restrictive diet.
34064541	Celiac Disease-Type Tissue Transglutaminase Autoantibody Deposits in Kidney Biopsies of Patients with IgA Nephropathy.	An association between celiac disease and IgA nephropathy (IgAN) has been suggested. In celiac disease, in addition to circulating in serum, IgA-class tissue transglutaminase (tTG) autoantibodies are deposited in the small bowel mucosa and extraintestinal organs. In this case series of IgAN patients with or without celiac disease, we studied whether celiac disease-type IgA-tTG deposits occur in kidney biopsies. The study included nine IgAN patients, four of them with celiac disease. At the time of the diagnostic kidney biopsy serum tTG autoantibodies were measured and colocalization of IgA and tTG was investigated in the frozen kidney biopsies. Three IgAN patients with celiac disease had IgA-tTG deposits in the kidney even though in two of these the celiac disease diagnosis had been set years later. These deposits were not found in a patient with already diagnosed celiac disease following a gluten-free diet. Of the five non-celiac IgAN patients, three had IgA-tTG deposits in the kidney. We conclude that tTG-targeted IgA deposits can be found in the kidney biopsies of gluten-consuming IgAN patients but their specificity to celiac disease seems limited.
30998982	Gluten Challenge Induces Skin and Small Bowel Relapse in Long-Term Gluten-Free Diet-Treated Dermatitis Herpetiformis.	Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an extraintestinal manifestation of celiac disease causing an itchy, blistering rash. Granular IgA deposits in the skin are pathognomonic for DH, and the treatment of choice is a lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD). Preliminary evidence suggests that there are patients with DH who redevelop gluten tolerance after adherence to a GFD treatment. To evaluate this, we performed a 12-month gluten challenge with skin and small-bowel mucosal biopsy samples in 19 patients with DH who had adhered to a GFD for a mean of 23 years. Prechallenge biopsy was negative for skin IgA and transglutaminase 3 deposits in 16 patients (84%) and indicated normal villous height-to-crypt depth ratios in the small bowel mucosa in all 19 patients. The gluten challenge caused a relapse of the rash in 15 patients (79%) in a mean of 5.6 months; of these 15 patients, 13 had skin IgA and transglutaminase 3 deposits, and 12 had small-bowel villous atrophy. In addition, three patients without rash or immune deposits in the skin developed villous atrophy, whereas one patient persisted without any signs of relapse. In conclusion, 95% of the patients with DH were unable to tolerate gluten even after long-term adherence to a GFD. Therefore, lifelong GFD treatment remains justified in all patients with DH.
30711205	Follow-up of Celiac Disease.	Currently, the only effective treatment for celiac disease is complete removal of gluten from the diet. However, patients need to follow a strict gluten-free diet that results in symptomatic, serologic, and histologic remission in most patients. Histologic remission is usually complete in children, but recovery is slower and more frequently incomplete in adults. When remission has been achieved, yearly follow-up is recommended for adults, children, and adolescents. This article deals with conventional strategies used in order to follow-up patients on treatment and aiming to obtain the best clinical outcome.
34067382	Knowledge of Medical Students and Medical Professionals Regarding Nutritional Deficiencies in Patients with Celiac Disease.	A gluten-free diet provides relief from symptoms for patients with celiac disease, although there is still a risk of nutritional deficiencies. These patients can potentially consume an excessive amount of fat and insufficient amounts of fiber, iron, vitamin D, and calcium. This study aimed to assess the knowledge of medical students and healthcare professionals in Poland regarding nutritional deficiencies and the prevention of such deficiencies in patients with celiac disease who are on a gluten-free diet. Of the 430 survey participants, 46% did not realize the risk of nutritional deficiencies in patients with celiac disease. The knowledge of the participants was lowest regarding the risk of being overweight or obese. Among the healthcare professionals, an acceptable level of correct answers was provided by only 37% of individuals and was highest for the dietitians' group. Our results demonstrate the need to improve the education of healthcare professionals concerning nutrition in patients with celiac disease.
31329915	The development of the gluten free healthy food basket in Cyprus. Is it affordable among low-income adults diagnosed with celiac disease?	BACKGROUND: Gluten free (GF) diets are not only restrictive but also costly. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the acceptability, cost and affordability of a Gluten Free Healthy Food Basket (GFHFB) and further examine whether low-income Cypriots diagnosed with celiac disease (CD) experience food stress. METHODS: GFEtaFBs were constructed for adult women and adult men (+-40 years) diagnosed with CD. Feasibility and acceptability was tested through three focus groups. Affordability was defined as the cost of the GFEtaFB as a percentage of the Guaranteed Minimum Income (GMI). RESULTS: The GFEtaFB was 33.6 and 47 euros/month more expensive compared to the HB (Healthy Basket) for women and men, respectively. The total budget for GF-manufactured products were 27.81 and 28.5% of the total food budget, for women and men, respectively. For low-income people receiving the GMI, the proportion of income that would need to be spent on the GFHFB ranges from around 42 to 60%. CONCLUSIONS: The GFEtaFB is costly and not affordable among low-income Cypriots diagnosed with CD; thus, they are likely to suffer from food stress. As such, the risk of reducing their adherence to a GF diet is high and thus compromises their long-term health.

30904232	Diet patterns in an ethnically diverse pediatric population with celiac disease and chronic gastrointestinal complaints.	INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease requiring lifelong adherence to the gluten-free diet (GFD). The GFD has significant nutritional limitations which may result in poor diet quality (DQ). We hypothesized that biopsy-proven children with CD (CCD) would have dietary patterns characterized by high saturated fat/simple sugar intake with a low micronutrient density contributing to lower DQ when compared to children with mild-gastrointestinal complaints (GI-CON). In addition, we hypothesized that ethnicity may further impact DQ. METHODS: Socio-demographic (age, CD duration, parent/child ethnicity, education), household characteristics, anthropometric, dietary intake (24-h recalls), gastrointestinal pain and adherence was collected in CCD (n = 243) and GI-CON (n = 148). Dietary patterns were determined using k-mean Cluster Analysis. RESULTS: GI-CON had significantly lower DQ than CCD (p < 0.001). Most CCD and GI-CON (>80%) had dietary patterns characterized by1) Western Diet (Cluster 1: %BMR: 110-150, low DQ, high fat, moderate CHO, high sodium) and 2) High Fat-Western Diet (Cluster 2: %BMR:130-150, low DQ, high Fat, high processed meats, high fat dairy products, CHO. Fewer children (<20%) had Prudent, Lower Fat/High Carbohydrate dietary patterns (% BMR:100-150, higher DQ, lower fat/sodium, higher CHO) with a greater proportion of non-Caucasian CCD consuming a Prudent dietary pattern. Seventy-seven percent and 37.5% of CCD and GI-CON, respectively, did not meet estimated average requirements for folate (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: CCD and GI-CON have predominantly Western dietary patterns with low DQ, particularly GI-CON. Non-caucasian CCD consume more prudent dietary patterns with higher DQ. Nutrition education is warranted to ensure optimal DQ in children with chronic gastrointestinal diseases.
34433427	The influence of a gluten-free diet on health-related quality of life in individuals with celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: Adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) and food insecurity (FI) may influence health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in individuals with celiac disease (CD). This study aimed to investigate the association between adherence to a GFD, FI, and HRQOL in individuals with CD. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 97 adults (mean age: 34 +- 9 years) diagnosed with CD. The participants were on a GFD for more than 6 months. Sociodemographic characteristics and medical history were assessed. Adherence to a GFD, FI, and HRQOL were assessed using validated questionnaires. RESULTS: Most participants (73%) adhered to a GFD, and 62% were experiencing FI. Individuals with CD faced difficulty in accessing GF foods due to the high cost (90%) and limited availability (79%). The mean overall HRQOL score was 60. Scores on the physical and mental health domains were 69 and 47, respectively. Adherence to a GFD was significantly associated with FI (P = 0.02), while there was no association between adherence to a GFD and HRQOL measures (P > 0.05). Participants facing FI had lower scores in emotional well-being and mental health domains, and overall HRQOL (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study demonstrate that FI influences adherence to a GFD, and that FI is associated with HRQOL in terms of both emotional well-being and mental health.
30938127	Randomized controlled trial of a gluten-free diet in patients with schizophrenia positive for antigliadin antibodies (AGA IgG): a pilot feasibility study	Background: Approximately one-third of people with schizophrenia have elevated levels of anti-gliadin antibodies of the immunoglobulin G type (AGA IgG) : a higher rate than seen in healthy controls. We performed the first double-blind clinical trial of gluten-free versus gluten-containing diets in a subset of patients with schizophrenia who were positive for AGA IgG. Methods: In this pilot feasibility study, 16 participants with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who had elevated AGA IgG (>= 20 U) but were negative for celiac disease were admitted to an inpatient unit for a 5-week trial. All participants received standardized gluten-free meals and were randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive a shake containing 10 g of gluten flour or 10 g of rice flour each day. Participants were rated for psychiatric, cognitive and gastrointestinal symptoms at baseline and endpoint. Results: Of the 16 participants, 14 completed the 5-week trial (2 discontinued early for administrative reasons). Compared with participants on the gluten-containing diet, participants on the gluten-free diet showed improvement on the Clinical Global Impressions scale (Cohen d = -0.75) and in negative symptoms (Cohen d = -0.53). We noted no improvement in positive or global cognitive symptoms, but did observe an improvement in attention favouring the gluten-free diet (Cohen d = 0.60). Robust improvements in gastrointestinal adverse effects occurred in the gluten-free group relative to the glutencontaining group. Adverse effects were similar between groups. Limitations: This study was limited by its small sample size; larger studies are needed. Conclusion: This feasibility study suggests that removal of gluten from the diet is associated with improvement in psychiatric and gastrointestinal symptoms in people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.
33852210	[Vaccination in adult patients: shingles vaccines and vaccination in case of anatomical or functional asplenia].	Shingles vaccination and pneumococcal vaccination of patients with celiac disease are among the most recent updates for the vaccination of vulnerable adults, in Switzerland. Shingles and especially post-herpes zoster pain remain an unresolved public health issue. The only vaccine available in Switzerland is very little administered because it is not reimbursed by health insurance companies. A second shingles vaccine is announced for 2022 and should help to reduce the burden of this disease. It has been known for many years that celiac disease is accompanied by hyposplenism in adults. The resulting increased risk of invasive pneumococcal infections justifies, since 2020, a recommendation for vaccination against these encapsulated bacteria.
30711213	(Outcome) Measure for (Intervention) Measures: A Guide to Choosing the Appropriate Noninvasive Clinical Outcome Measure for Intervention Studies in Celiac Disease.	There is an unmet need for diagnostic and treatment interventions for celiac disease. Both clinical trials and real-world studies require careful selection of clinical outcome measures. Often, neither serology nor histology is an appropriate primary outcome. This article reviews various measures of intestinal function and nutrition, patient-reported outcome measures for symptoms and for health-related quality of life, and measures of sickness burden as they apply to intervention studies for celiac disease. A series of case studies is presented to illustrate key considerations in selecting outcome measures for dietary interventions, pharmacologic interventions, and real-world studies.
33321512	Celiac Disease and Sensitization to Wheat, Rye, and Barley: Should We Be Concerned?	BACKGROUND: Concomitance of celiac disease (CD) and IgE-mediated wheat allergy is described in some case reports. The objective was to evaluate the frequency of sensitization to wheat, rye, barley, and malt in children and adolescents with CD. METHODS: Measurement of serum levels of specific IgE to wheat, rye, barley, and malt (ImmunoCAP; sensitization IgE >=0.35 kUA/L) in CD patients followed in specialized clinics to verify allergy history, general characteristics, small bowel biopsy characteristics, compliance with gluten-free diet (GFD), and occurrence of symptoms in case of noncompliance. RESULTS: We evaluated 74 patients; the median of age and age at diagnosis of CD were 8.6 years (5.0-12.8) and 3.6 years (1.6-7.0), respectively. Median time of GFD was 3.5 years (1.4-5.8). History of asthma occurred in 17.3% of subjects, allergic rhinitis in 13.5%, and AD in 5.4%. Frequency of sensitization was 4% for wheat, 10.8% for rye, 5.4% for barley, and 2.7% for malt. There was no association between wheat sensitization and age at diagnosis, time of GFD, small bowel biopsy characteristics, allergy history, and gluten consumption. There was no relationship between sensitization to wheat and occurrence of immediate symptoms when not complying with GFD. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the frequency of sensitization to wheat, rye, barley, and malt in CD patients was 4, 10.8, 5.4, and 2.7%, respectively. Therefore, to ensure that cutaneous and respiratory contact with wheat is safe, we advise patients with CD to investigate their sensitivity to wheat, rye, and barley because not all patients with CD are allergic to these cereals.
32069238	The effect of celiac disease and gluten-free diet on pubertal development: a two-center study.	Objectives We aimed to assess whether age at menarche and pubertal development (Tanner stage) are related to gluten-free diet (GFD) adherence, hormonal status, micro-nutrient levels and body mass index (BMI) in children with celiac disease (CD). Methods In this two-center, cross-sectional study, CD patients and healthy individuals were studied. CD patients were re-evaluated after 1 year of follow-up. Height, weight, Tanner stage, age at menarche and diet compliance were recorded. Blood samples for anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA (TTG), pituitary gonadotropins, gonadal hormones, prolactin and micronutrients (folate, vitamin B12, vitamin D, ferritin, iron and, iron-binding capacity [IBC]) were assayed. Results Consecutive age- and sex-matched 228 celiac patients (12.92 +- 2.35 years; 67.9% female) and 135 non-celiac healthy individuals (12.77 +- 2.25 years; 65.2% female) were studied. Tanner stage was significantly higher in the control group for both girls and boys (p < 0.05). The mean age at menarche was significantly lower in healthy individuals (13.13 +- 1.01 vs. 12.15 +- 0.97, p < 0.001). By multivariate analysis, GFD adherence, transferrin saturation (sTrf), total IBC (TIBC) and vitamin D status were found to be positively correlated with Tanner stage (p < 0.05). After 1 year, 192 of the CD patients were re-evaluated. GFD compliance was better (TTG levels: 135.59 +- 73.88 vs. 71.53 +- 69.40, p < 0.001) and it was correlated with Tanner stage (r = 0.49, p < 0.01), sTrf (r = 0.66, p < 0.01) and IBC (r = 0.23, p < 0.05). Conclusions Our data show that adequate weight gain, adherence to GFD, sufficient iron and vitamin D status are essential factors for salubrious puberty in CD patients.
31552781	A Single Institution's Experience of Primary Headache in Children With Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND: Few studies exist examining the frequency of primary headache in children with celiac disease and the impact of a gluten-free diet on primary headache symptomology. This study explores characteristics and frequency of headaches in children with celiac disease and response to gluten-free diet at a single institution. METHODS: Medical records were reviewed for children with celiac disease confirmed by the presence of elevated tissue transglutaminase IgA levels and histologic changes consistent with the diagnosis of celiac disease on small bowel biopsy. Eligible participants were contacted via letter for participation in a phone survey regarding headaches. Phone interviews were conducted 2 weeks after notification and lasted approximately 10 minutes. Headaches were classified according to ICHD-3 criteria. RESULTS: 247 eligible patients or their families were contacted. A total of 132 (53.44%) agreed to participate. One participant was excluded due to insufficient information provided. Overall, 51 of 131 participants had recurrent headache defined as at least 1 episode per month (39%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 31%-47%) and 33 had migraine with or without aura (25%, 95% CI: 18%-33%). Twenty-eight had frequent tension-type headache (22%, 95% CI: 15%-29%). Thirty-two participants noted headaches before a confirmed diagnosis of celiac disease. Twenty-two of 32 participants (68.75%) noticed decreased headache frequency or intensity, or both, after starting the gluten-free diet. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that at least one-third of children and adolescents with celiac disease have recurrent headaches at the time of diagnosis. A gluten-free diet led to improved headache symptomology in a significant number of these patients.
33639838	Symptoms and biomarkers associated with undiagnosed celiac seropositivity.	BACKGROUND: Studies have indicated that underdiagnosis and diagnostic delay are common in celiac disease. Therefore, it is important to increase our knowledge of what symptoms and biomarkers could identify undiagnosed cases of celiac disease. METHODS: We screened for celiac disease antibodies in stored blood samples from 16,776 participants in eight population-based studies examined during 1976-2012. Undiagnosed celiac seropositivity was defined as celiac disease antibody positivity (IgG-deamidated gliadin peptide above 10.0 U/mL and/or IgA-tissue transglutaminase (TTG) or IgG-TTG above 7.0 U/mL) without a known diagnosis of celiac disease in the National Patient Register. In all studies general health symptoms were recorded by participant-completed questionnaire, including self-perceived health, tiredness, headache and gastrointestinal symptoms. Furthermore, blood samples were drawn for analyses of biomarkers e.g. hemoglobin, blood glucose, cholesterol, liver parameters and vitamins. The participants with undiagnosed celiac seropositivity were matched by sex, age and study with four controls among the celiac disease antibody negative participants. RESULTS: We excluded, five participants with known celiac disease, resulting in a population of 16,771 participants. In this population 1% (169/16,771) had undiagnosed celiac seropositivity. There were no statistically significant differences in symptoms between cases and controls. Undiagnosed celiac seropositivity was associated with low blood cholesterol (< 5 mmol/L) and low hemoglobin (< 7.3 mmol/L for women and < 8.3 mmol/L for men). CONCLUSION: In this general population study, undiagnosed cases of celiac seropositivity did not have more symptoms than controls, confirming the diagnostic difficulties of celiac disease and the low prognostic value of symptoms for a diagnosis of celiac disease. Furthermore, decreased levels of cholesterol and/or hemoglobin in the blood were associated with undiagnosed celiac seropositivity.

29847525	Schizophrenia and celiac disease: which is the role of the gluten-free diet?	
30963964	Role of Dietary Gluten in Development of Celiac Disease and Type I Diabetes: Management Beyond Gluten-Free Diet.	Gluten triggers Celiac Disease (CD) and type I diabetes in genetically predisposed population of human leukocyte antigen DQ2/DQ8+ and associates with disorders such as schizophrenia and autism. Application of a strict gluten-free diet is the only well-established treatment for patients with CD, whereas the treatment for patients with celiac type I diabetes may be depend on the timing and frequency of the diet. The application of a gluten-free diet in patients with CD may contribute to the development of metabolic syndrome and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and may also lead to a high glycemic index, low fiber diet and micronutrient deficiencies. The alteration of copper bioavailability (deficient, excess or aberrant coordination) may contribute to the onset and progress of related pathologies. Therefore, nutrient intake of patients on a gluten-free diet should be the focus of future researches. Other gluten-based therapies have been rising with interest such as enzymatic pretreatment of gluten, oral enzyme supplements to digest dietary gluten, gluten removal by breeding wheat varieties with reduced or deleted gluten toxicity, the development of polymeric binders to suppress gluten induced pathology.
36499446	Replacing the Burden of the Gluten Free Diet: Then, Now, and the Future.	Without a doubt, a majority of diseases are food-pattern-related. However, one disease stands out as an increasingly more common autoimmune-mediated enteropathy triggered by the ingestion of gluten. Celiac disease (CD) is an old disease, with changing clinical patterns, affecting any age, including infancy and adolescence, and becoming more frequent among the elderly. The gluten-free diet (GFD) has been the sole provider of clinical, serological, and histological improvement for patients with CD for more than seven decades. Nowadays, complete avoidance of dietary gluten is rarely possible because of the wide availability of wheat and other processed foods that contain even more gluten, to the detriment of gluten-free products. Undeniably, there is a definite need for replacing the burdensome GFD. An add-on therapy that could control the dietary transgressions and inadvertent gluten consumption that can possibly lead to overt CD should be considered while on GFD. Nevertheless, future drugs should be able to provide patients some freedom to self-manage CD and increase food independence, while actively reducing exposure and mucosal damage and alleviating GI symptoms. Numerous clinical trials assessing different molecules have already been performed with favorable outcomes, and hopefully they will soon be available for patient use.
34009525	Enteropathy-Associated T cell Lymphoma.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma (EATL) is a rare subtype of mature T cell lymphoma. The available literature about this rare type T cell lymphoma is relatively limited. This article provides a summary and review of the available literature addressing this entity in terms of risk factors, pathogenesis, diagnostic, and therapeutic options. RECENT FINDINGS: EATL has two distinct subtypes. Type I EATL, now known as EATL, is closely, but not exclusively linked to celiac disease (CD), and it is primarily a disease of Northern European origin. It accounts for < 5% of peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL). Risk factors for EATL include advanced age, male sex, and most importantly, genetic susceptibility in the form of HLA-DQ2 homozygosity. The pathogenesis of EATL is closely related to celiac disease as it shares common pathogenic features with refractory celiac disease. The gold standard of diagnosis is histological diagnosis. EATL carries an aggressive course and a poor prognosis. Treatment of EATL includes surgery, induction chemotherapy, and consolidation in first complete remission and autologous stem cell transplant. The role of targeted and biologic therapies in newly diagnosed EATL patients along with relapsed, refractory cases is evolving and discussed in this review. EATL is an aggressive peripheral T cell lymphoma with poor overall treatment outcome using currently available therapy options. Clinical trials are considered the best approach for treatment of EATL. Early diagnosis and early referral to specialized centers would be the best way to deal with such patients. Development of new prognostic models and early surgical intervention are warranted. Prevention is where all the efforts should be spent, by counseling patients with CD regarding the importance of adherence to gluten-free diet and development of periodic surveillance programs in celiac disease patients for early detection of pre-lymphoma lesions.
37381936	Mucin Expression in the Small Bowel of Celiac Disease: A Systematic Review.	BACKGROUND: Mucins, heavily glycosylated glycoproteins, are synthesized by mucosal surfaces and play an important role in healthy and malignant states. Changes in mucin synthesis, expression, and secretion may be a primary event or may be secondary to inflammation and carcinogenesis. OBJECTIVES: To assess current knowledge of mucin expression in the small bowel of celiac disease (CD) patients and to determine possible associations between mucin profile and gluten-free diet. METHODS: Medical literature searches of articles in English were conducted using the terms mucin and celiac. Observational studies were included. Pooled odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. RESULTS: Of 31 articles initially generated by a literature search, 4 observational studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria remained eligible for meta-analysis. These studies included 182 patients and 148 controls from four countries (Finland, Japan, Sweden, United States). Mucin expression was significantly increased in small bowel mucosa of CD patients than in normal small bowel mucosa (odds ratio [OR] 7.974, 95% confidence interval [95%CI] (1.599-39.763), P = 0.011] (random-effect model). Heterogeneity was significant: Q = 35.743, df (Q) = 7, P < 0.0001, I2 = 80.416%. ORs for MUC2 and MUC5AC expression in the small bowel mucosa of untreated CD patients were 8.837, 95%CI 0.222-352.283, P = 0.247 and 21.429, 95%CI 3.883-118.255, P < 0.0001, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of certain mucin genes in the small bowel mucosa of CD patients is increased and may serve as a diagnostic tool and assist in surveillance programs.
37394667	Efficacy of Using Maryland Forceps Versus Electrocoagulation Hooks in RATS Lung Cancer Surgery: A Propensity Score-Matched Study.	BACKGROUND: Here we compare the difference in recent outcomes between the use of Maryland forceps (MF) and electrocoagulation hooks (EH) in robotic-assisted thoracoscopic radical lung cancer resection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyze the clinical data of 247 patients with lung cancer who underwent robotic-assisted thoracoscopic surgery from February 2018 to December 2022. On the basis of the intraoperative use of energy devices, we divided the clinical data into two groups, including 84 cases in the MF group and 163 cases in the EH group, respectively. The patients in the two groups were matched with propensity score matching analysis, and further, the perioperative clinical data of the two groups were compared. RESULTS: Compared with the EH group, patients in the MF group had shorter operative time, lesser intraoperative bleeding, shorter postoperative drainage time, and shorter postoperative hospital stay (P < 0.05). By comparing the intraoperative and postoperative complications in the two groups, it was found that the incidence of intraoperative lymph node fragmentation, the incidence of postoperative celiac disease, and the incidence of postoperative food choking were significantly lower in the MF group than that in the EH group. The increase of CRP, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha levels in the MF group was less than that in the EH group. CONCLUSIONS: The use of MF in robotic-assisted thoracoscopic radical lung cancer surgery is safe and effective, with advantages in lymph node dissection, reduced surgical trauma, and fewer postoperative complications.
30592872	[Development and evaluation of efficiency of inclusion of specialized meat semi-finished products in the diet of children and teenager with celiac disease].	The purpose of the study is to evaluate the possibility and effectiveness of inclusion of specialized semi-finished meat products in the gluten-free diet of children and adolescents with celiac disease. In the article the authors present the recipe for a new type of specialized meat semi-finished products - gluten-free dumplings. As ingredients of semi-finished products rice flour, amaranth flour, flax flour, chickpea flour, corn starch, curd whey, beef, poultry, goose fat and other auxiliary ingredients were used. The results of studies of the main quality indicators (nutritional value) of a new specialized meat semi-finished product have been presented. The results of studies of the protein component of the product, related both to protein digestibility (evaluated in vitro) and to the degree of its amino acid balance, confirmed its high biological value. To substantiate the effectiveness of the inclusion of gluten-free dumplings in the diet of patients with celiac disease, clinical approbation has been carried out. In an open, prospective, nonrandomized study, 20 children with celiac disease consumed gluten-free diet for 6 months and more were included. Based on the results of the clinical and serological survey, a group of 13 children aged 7 to 15 years (mean age 9.4+-0.8 years), strictly adherent to a gluten-free diet, was identified. Children received a portion of the cooked product (15-20 dumplings, which amounted to 180-250 g per day) within 1 month. Against the background of strict adherence to the gluten-free diet and a monthly course of dumplings intake, all children and adolescents were noted to have no elevation, and in some cases, a decrease in the level of specific autoantibodies, which is a proof of the absolute safety of the product for patients. The level of anti-tTG IgA decreased from 1.3 (0.5, 2.3) to 0.6 (0.1, 1.3) U/ml (p<0.05), a decrease in the level of anti-DPG IgA from 4.0 (1.1, 5.0) to 1.8 (1.3, 4.1) U/ml (p<0, 05) was also detected. Patients showed a tendency to improve anthropometric indices in the form of a decrease in the lag in the body mass from -0.22+-0.3sigma to 0.01+-0.3sigma and BMI from -0.64+-0.4sigma to -0.52+-0.4sigma (p>0.05). The hematological indices remained unchanged, while iron blood serum indexes on the background of the product intake improved: ferritin concentration increased from 27.4+-3.6 to 37.7+-6.0 mug/l (p<0.05), latent iron binding capacity decreased by 9.6% (p<0.05); total iron binding capacity tended to decrease by 6.4% (p=0.055) with a slight increase in iron transferrin saturation. The data obtained testify a positive effect of a new product intake on quality of a life and improvement of the general condition of patients that gives the basis to recommend the developed dumplings for inclusion in diets of patients with celiac disease.
32083821	[The role of nutritional factors and food allergy in the development of psoriasis].	Psoriasis is a chronic relapsing disease that affects about 2% of the world's population and leads to medical and social losses. There is evidence of the effect of nutritional factors on the course of psoriasis in modern literature. The aim of the research was to analyze modern domestic and foreign literature on the role of nutritional factors, food allergies and the state of the gastrointestinal tract in the etiopathogenesis of psoriasis Material and methods. The electronic resources were used in preparing the article: the PubMed/MEDLINE portal, "Scientific Electronic Library eLIBRARY.RU". The following filters and keywords were requested: psoriasis and nutrition, food allergies and psoriasis, gastrointestinal manifestations and psoriasis, diet and psoriasis, obesity and psoriasis. Results and discussion. The role of nutrition as a predictor of the development of psoriatic skin rashes and exacerbation of the disease has been discussed. The mechanisms of the positive influence of the correction of metabolic disorders on skin processes in patients with psoriasis have been analyzed. It has been noted that further studies are needed to study the effectiveness of a lowcalorie diet for psoriasis treatment. Particular attention has been paid to the role of food allergy and pathology of the gastrointestinal tract in the etiopathogenesis of psoriatic disease. It is noted that in patients with psoriasis, structural and functional disorders in the gastrointestinal tract are observed, which lead to metabolic changes, endotoxinemia and autosensitization of the body. The role of intolerance to certain foods in the development of psoriasis has been discussed. Most of the available data indicate a high incidence of celiac disease and gluten intolerance in patients with psoriasis, however, information about the effectiveness of a gluten-free diet is controversial. Attention is drawn to the "non-celiac gluten sensitivity" associated with psoriasis, which represents a syndrome of neither allergic nor autoimmune genesis, which is manifested by gluten intolerance and characterized by symptoms similar to celiac disease. An increase in the frequency of occurrence of a high concentration of specific IgE to potato and carrot allergens in patients with psoriasis is noted, which most likely reflects cross-reactions with pollen allergens. An interesting hypothesis is the discussion of a lesion of the gastrointestinal tract in the presence of food allergies in patients with psoriasis, which may be a reflection of the systemic dermatogastrointestinal process and manifest psoriatic rashes on the skin. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory effect associated with adhering to the Mediterranean diet for psoriasis is described in detail. Conclusion. The data presented allow us to consider the role of nutrition in the etiopathogenesis of psoriasis as significant, both from the point of view of the influence of nutritional factors and food allergens, that must be taken into account when prescribing therapeutic nutrition and elimination diet in combination with standard systemic therapy.
31351508	Adalimumab - Safe and Effective Therapy for an Adolescent Patient with Severe Psoriasis and Immune Thrombocytopenia.	Psoriasis has been linked to several comorbidities, including metabolic syndrome, atopy, and celiac disease. However, the association between immune thrombocytopenia and psoriasis has rarely been described. We report the case of an adolescent with severe psoriasis and concomitant immune thrombocytopenia who obtained remission during treatment with adalimumab. Increased concentration of tumor necrosis factor-alpha seems to be a pathogenic linkage and therapeutic target for both diseases.
34984588	Family ties: the impact of celiac disease on children and caregivers.	PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of celiac disease (CD) and the gluten-free diet (GFD) on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in children with CD in the United States using validated measures. We hypothesize that CD negatively impacts the child and caregivers' HRQoL. METHODS: Participants included children with a confirmed diagnosis of CD and their caregivers (n = 246) seen in a CD multidisciplinary clinic. Caregivers completed the Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL) parent-proxy scale to report on their child's HRQoL and the Family Impact Module (FIM), which assesses the impact of caring for a child with a chronic illness. Their children completed the age-appropriate PedsQL. PedsQL and FIM results were compared to published data for children with gastroenterological conditions and a healthy cohort using non-parametric tests. RESULTS: Children with CD reported significantly lower HRQoL than reports from healthy controls across all PedsQL domains (P < 0.001, Cohen d = 0.8), and lower compared to children with other organic gastrointestinal conditions in Social Functioning (P < 0.001, Cohen d = 0.5) and overall Psychosocial Functioning (P < 0.001, Cohen d = 0.3) domains. Results from the caregiver's report on their own HRQoL were significantly worse than that reported by historical controls in the domains of Communication (P < 0.001, Cohen d = 0.3) and Worry (P < 0.001, Cohen d = 0.8), yet similar on all other domains. CONCLUSIONS: In our population, CD is associated with low HRQoL scores for both children and their caregivers. Screening children and families for HRQoL can identify patients and families in need of additional support in this higher-risk population.
30958273	Symptoms Prompting Interest in Celiac Disease and the Gluten-Free Diet: Analysis of Internet Search Term Data.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease, a common immune-based disease triggered by gluten, has diverse clinical manifestations, and the relative distribution of symptoms leading to diagnosis has not been well characterized in the population. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to use search engine data to identify a set of symptoms and conditions that would identify individuals at elevated likelihood of a subsequent celiac disease diagnosis. We also measured the relative prominence of these search terms before versus after a search related to celiac disease. METHODS: We extracted English-language queries submitted to the Bing search engine in the United States and identified those who submitted a new celiac-related query during a 1-month period, without any celiac-related queries in the preceding 9 months. We compared the ratio between the number of times that each symptom or condition was asked in the 14 days preceding the first celiac-related query of each person and the number of searches for that same symptom or condition in the 14 days after the celiac-related query. RESULTS: We identified 90,142 users who made a celiac-related query, of whom 6528 (7%) exhibited sustained interest, defined as making a query on more than 1 day. Though a variety of symptoms and associated conditions were also queried before a celiac-related query, the maximum area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.53. The symptom most likely to be queried more before than after a celiac-related query was diarrhea (query ratio [QR] 1.28). Extraintestinal symptoms queried before a celiac disease query included headache (QR 1.26), anxiety (QR 1.10), depression (QR 1.03), and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (QR 1.64). CONCLUSIONS: We found an increase in antecedent searches for symptoms known to be associated with celiac disease, a rise in searches for depression and anxiety, and an increase in symptoms that are associated with celiac disease but may not be reported to health care providers. The protean clinical manifestations of celiac disease are reflected in the diffuse nature of antecedent internet queries of those interested in celiac disease, underscoring the challenge of effective case-finding strategies.
31981420	The gluten-free diet: an historical perspective and its use by people without coeliac disease.	
33675212	Significant improvement in bone mineral density in pediatric celiac disease: even at six months with gluten-free diet.	OBJECTIVES: Patients with celiac disease had significantly decreased bone mineral density even in patients with no gastrointestinal symptoms. Only few bone studies are available on pediatric patients with celiac disease. METHODS: Forty-six patients underwent measurement of areal bone mineral density (aBMD) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) before the initiation of gluten-free diet. Anthropometric, laboratory and DXA measurements at baseline and at sixth month of the treatment were compared. RESULTS: The frequency of low aBMD Z-score (<=-1 SDS) in both or any site was found to be 78.2% in this study. Of 16 patients with an aBMD Z-score of <-2 SDS five gained more than 1 SDS, and one gained more than 2 SDS. Nine of 20 patients with an aBMD Z-score of <-1 SDS completely normalized. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study showed that low BMD is common in children with celiac disease at the time of diagnosis and could improve in a short period of six months with a strict gluten-free diet and adequate supplementation of calcium and vitamin D.
29469935	Are children with chronic illnesses requiring dietary therapy at risk for disordered eating or eating disorders? A systematic review.	OBJECTIVE: Pediatric chronic illnesses (CI) can affect a child's mental health. Chronic illnesses with treatment regimens that specify a therapeutic diet may place the child at increased risk for disordered eating and specific eating disorders (ED). The aim of this review is to examine the relation between diet-treated CI and disordered eating and to determine the order of onset to infer directionality. Diet-treated CI is hypothesized to precede and to be associated with disordered eating. METHOD: A comprehensive search of empirical articles that examine the relation between diet-treated CI (diabetes, cystic fibrosis, celiac disease, gastrointestinal disorders, and inflammatory bowel diseases) and disordered eating was conducted in Medline and PsycINFO using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A table of the sample's characteristics, ED measures, major pertinent findings, and the onset of CI in relation to ED were provided. RESULTS: Diet-treated CI was associated with disordered eating and ED. Diet-treated CI had onset prior to disordered eating in most studies, except for inflammatory bowel diseases. Disordered eating and unhealthy weight management practices put children at risk for poor medical outcomes. DISCUSSION: Interventions for diet-treated CI require a focus on diet and weight, but may increase the risk for disordered eating. Future research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms that transform standard treatment practices into pathological eating, including characteristics and behaviors of the child, parents/care providers, family, and treatment providers.
33321006	Celiac disease and COVID-19 pandemic: should we worry?	BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic especially worries people with chronic diseases the entire world. In this study, the frequency, and clinical course of COVID-19 infection in patients with Celiac disease (CD) were investigated. CD patients' adherence to purchasing gluten free products (GFPs), the strict diet, and how patients' anxiety affects CD symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak were also examined. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A detailed questionnaire was administered by telephone and emailed to the CD patients to determine the status of these patients in obtaining GFPs, and dietary compliance during the COVID-19 pandemic. State and trait anxiety levels of patients were evaluated using the State-trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) scale. Additionally, whether patients with CD were diagnosed with COVID-19, and if diagnosed, their clinical course of the disease were investigated. RESULTS: One hundred and one patients were included in the study. The total number of patients who could obtain GFPs decreased significantly in the pandemic than before the pandemic. The patients' state anxiety index was 40.7+-7.9, and the trait anxiety index was 44.5+-8.5, and all patients were evaluated as mildly anxious. During the pandemic, two female patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: CD patients did not have any additional risk compared to other individuals in terms of becoming infected with COVID-19 for patients under gluten free diet, and these patients will have a similar clinical course as individuals without CD.
34978602	Newly Diagnosed Celiac Disease and Bone Health in Young Adults: A Systematic Literature Review.	Celiac disease (CD), a gluten-induced autoimmune disease, is associated with low bone mineral density (BMD) among children. Unfortunately, it is often diagnosed in adulthood, which may lead to an increased risk of fragile bones. The aim of this systematic review was to report on BMD status among young adults newly diagnosed with CD, and to examine the effect of a gluten-free diet (GFD), nutritional supplements, such as vitamin D, or antiresorptive medications on BMD recovery. Databases searched were Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library up to July 2nd, 2020. Both observational studies and clinical trials were considered, if patients were newly diagnosed and between 20 and 35 years of age and reported on BMD. We critically appraised the identified studies using ROBINS-I and summarized the findings narratively. Out of 3991 references, we identified 3 eligible studies: one cross-sectional study and two longitudinal studies. In total, 188 patients were included, and the study population consisted primarily of women with an age range between 29 and 37 years old. Compared to healthy controls, our target population had lower BMD. Moreover, a strict GFD may increase BMD during a follow-up period of up to 5 years. Newly diagnosed CD patients aged 20-35 years are at risk of lower BMD. Therefore, it may be crucial to assess BMD at time of diagnosis in young women. Whether the results can be extrapolated to young men is unknown. While strict GFD may improve BMD over time, there is a lack of robust evidence to demonstrate that nutritional supplements or antiresorptive agents are beneficial in the prevention of fragile bones in this age group.
36653177	Diet quality, ultra-processed food consumption, and quality of life in a cross-sectional cohort of adults and teens with celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease (CeD), a common autoimmune condition, requires strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). Adherence to the GFD has been associated with quality of life (QOL). However, there may be other diet-related concerns, such as overall diet patterns, including diet quality or ultra-processed food (UPF) consumption, possibly associated with QOL among people with CeD following a GFD that have not been examined. METHODS: Diet quality was determined based on 24-h diet recalls of a cross-sectional prospectively recruited sample of 80 participants (50 adults and 30 teens) with biopsy-confirmed CeD ('Study Sample') using the Healthy Eating Index and Alternate Mediterranean Diet score. The amount of UPF consumed was assessed using Nova, a food processing classification system. QOL was measured using Celiac Disease-Specific Quality of Life (CDQOL) and Celiac Disease Pediatric-Specific Quality of Life (CDPQOL). The Study Sample's diet patterns were compared with National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) groups (25 adults reporting prior CeD and GFD; 51 adults with new CeD and no GFD; 15,777 adults and 2296 teens without CeD). The relationship of the Study Sample's diet patterns with CDQOL/CDPQOL was assessed using analysis of covariance. RESULTS: The Study Sample's diet patterns were suboptimal but generally favourable compared with all NHANES groups. Compared to Study Adults with the highest tertile of UPF, those with the lowest tertile had significantly higher CDQOL (mean: 67.6 vs. 78.3, p < 0.001). Compared to Study Teens with the lowest tertile of AMED, those with the highest tertile had significantly higher CDPQOL (mean: 67.0 vs. 79.9, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Maintaining high diet quality and minimising UPF may be important for CeD-specific QOL among individuals with CeD maintaining a GFD.
30954342	Adults following a gluten-free diet report little dietary guidance in a pilot survey exploring relationships between dietary knowledge, management, and adherence in Nova Scotia, Canada.	The strict nature of a gluten-free diet (GFD) poses a challenge for patient adherence and for clinicians to provide comprehensive client-centered care. Evidence on the relationship between nutrition knowledge, food skills, dietary management, and adherence can guide healthcare professionals counseling patients following this diet. In this explanatory pilot study, a province-wide survey (phase I) with 68 community-dwelling Nova Scotians following a GFD was conducted to investigate relationships between personal, social, and health care factors and dietary adherence using a mixed-methods approach. A sub-sample of 19 survey respondents were interviewed (phase II) to explore contextual experiences related to GFD knowledge, food skills, dietary management, and adherence using a food literacy lens. Here, we report findings from phase I, in which 37 participants with self-reported celiac disease (CD) and 31 participants reporting non-celiac reasons for wheat restriction (NCWR) completed a detailed 41-item online questionnaire. Self-reported data combined for both CD and NCWR respondents showed 76% perceived their health status as good to excellent. Most (62%) reported not receiving GFD advice from a health professional. Respondents with higher frequency of intentional consumption of gluten were more likely to have fewer correct answers to a food label quiz (rho = -0.44; P = .0002). Most participants (75%) made at least one error in identifying gluten-free and gluten-containing foods, which may lead to unintentional gluten consumption and/or unnecessarily restricting safe foods. Findings from this exploratory study suggest patients may lack adequate referrals and support within the health care system and the community, adding to individual challenges of GFD adherence.
35156701	Gluten-free diet - remedy for infertility or dangerous trend?	Association between celiac disease (CD) and infertility has been a point of consideration for many years. There are lots of studies which present contradictory results. It is accepted that women with unexplained infertility have three times higher risk of CD compared to the healthy women. This finding leads to the conclusion that a gluten-free diet (GFD), as the only effective method of treatment CD, is important to improve fertility. It is observed that women diagnosed with CD and treated by GFD, have positive pregnancy outcomes including better effects of assisted reproductive technology (ART). Excluding gluten from diet by women without CD diagnosis could bring adverse outcomes, because the risk of malnutrition if diet is unbalanced. On the other hand, some research show that not only GFD but CD is related to malnutrition which could be the cause of problems with getting pregnant or with termination of pregnancy. Regarding CD influence on women's reproductive system, it is not only connected with unexplained infertility and adverse pregnancy outcomes, but also with delayed menarche, early menopause and decrease of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH). What is more, non-celiac wheat sensitivity affects the reproductive system by increasing risk of menstrual disorders too. The main aim of this paper is presenting scientific facts about the link between gluten elimination and fertility. It is very important to provide patients with reliable fact-checked information in the context of their symptoms.
35208504	Expression of Selected Genes and Circulating microRNAs in Patients with Celiac Disease.	Background and Objectives: Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy with characteristic intestinal alterations. CD occurs as a chronic inflammation secondary to gluten sensitivity in genetically susceptible individuals. Until now, the exact cause of the disease has not been established, which is why new studies have appeared that address the involvement of various genes and microRNAs (miRNAs) in the pathogenesis. The aim of the study is to describe the expression of selected genes (Wnt family member 3, WNT3; Wnt family member 11, WNT11; tumor necrosis factor alpha, TNFalpha; mitogen-activated protein kinase 1, MAPK1; AKT serine/threonine kinase 3, AKT3; phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha, PIK3CA; and cyclin D1, CCND1) and miRNAs (miR-192-5p, miR-194-5p, miR-449a and miR-638) in adult patients with CD. Materials and Methods: In total, 15 patients with CD at diagnosis (newly diagnosed), 33 patients on a gluten-free diet (GFD) for at least 1 year and 10 controls (control) were prospectively included. Blood samples were evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results: The results show that TNFalpha, MAPK1 and CCND1 were significantly overexpressed (p = 0.0249, p = 0.0019 and p = 0.0275, respectively) when comparing the newly diagnosed group to the controls. The other genes studied in CD patients were mostly with high values compared to controls, without reaching statistical significance. Among the miRNAs, the closest to a statistically significant value was miR-194-5p when the newly diagnosed group versus control (p = 0.0510) and GFD group versus control (p = 0.0671) were compared. The DIANA and miRNet databases identified significant functional activity for miR-449a and miR-192-5p and an interconnection of miR-194-5p and miR-449a with CCND1. Conclusions: In conclusion, genes and circulating miRNAs require further studies as they could represent important biomarkers in clinical practice.
31149937	Psychological Comorbidities in Childhood Celiac Disease: A Systematic Review.	OBJECTIVES: Mental health disorders comorbid to chronic illness are associated with higher medical care utilization and costs for adults and children. Celiac disease (CD) has a substantial perceived treatment burden and is associated with higher rates of psychopathology in adults. However, establishing the risk for psychological comorbidities in children with CD is still needed. This study aimed to review existing research on mental health concerns in pediatric CD and propose an initial psychosocial research and clinical agenda. METHODS: Databases, including Scopus and PubMed. Additional publications were accessed and reviewed from the references provided by initially identified publications. Two investigators screened studies using predetermined criteria (peer-reviewed, published in English, electronically available, inclusive of child participants, and examining CD). One investigator initially extracted data, with subsequent review by the second investigator. RESULTS: Twenty-six publications met criteria for the current review (16 case-control, 9 observational, and 1 clinical trial). Publications were heterogeneous in symptoms examined, methodology, and population characteristics. Several studies found elevated risk for psychological comorbidities and poorer quality of life in children with CD. However, many studies were limited by small sample sizes and inconsistent or nonvalidated approaches to measuring psychological symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Many existing studies have found increased prevalence of comorbid CD and psychological symptoms or diagnoses. Therefore, screening for psychological symptoms in CD and also screening for CD in psychological clinic populations is needed. We have identified the importance for further study of mechanisms and risk, and identify preliminary priorities for psychosocial research and clinical care in pediatric CD.
35879335	Population-based screening for celiac disease reveals that the majority of patients are undiagnosed and improve on a gluten-free diet.	The impact of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on screen-detected celiac disease (CD) is currently ambiguous. We aimed to identify the population-based prevalence of undiagnosed adult CD and examine the impact of a GFD on screen-detected CD. In total, 12,981 adults participated in a population-based health study in Tromso, Norway. Participants with increased levels of anti-tissue transglutaminase-2 IgA or anti-deamidated gliadin peptide IgG were invited to undergo gastroduodenoscopy with both histological and immunohistochemical examination of small-bowel biopsies. The prevalence of previously diagnosed CD was 0.37%. Additionally, the prevalence of previously undiagnosed CD was 1.10%. Thus, 1.47% of the population had CD, of whom 75% were previously undiagnosed. A GFD resulted in significant improvements in overall gastrointestinal symptoms, diarrhea, and health-related quality of life, with reduced abdominal discomfort (76%) and improved levels of energy (58%). The large majority of patients with adult CD were undiagnosed and benefited from a GFD with reduced gastrointestinal symptoms and improved health-related quality of life. In clinical practice, there should be a low threshold for CD testing even in the absence of abdominal complaints because most adult patients appear to consider their symptoms a part of their normal state and therefore remain untested and undiagnosed.Trial registration: Clinical Trials. Gov Identifier: NCT01695681.
32965317	Anxiety and depression: a study of psychoaffective, family-related, and daily-life factors in celiac individuals.	OBJECTIVE: To identify the prevalence of anxiety and depression and its association with psychoaffective, family-related, and daily-life variables of celiac individuals. METHODS: Crosssectional study, developed with 83 celiac patients in Fortaleza. An instrument was applied with variables grouped in the categories: psychoaffective, family-related, and daily-life. RESULTS: It was found that 52 celiac patients (62.7%) had anxiety and 29 (34.9%) had depression. The clinical conditions found and the number of symptoms increased the chance of anxiety/depression. The predominant factors in those with anxiety were Lack of control of the celiac disease (98.1%), Perceived clinical condition (75.0%), Daily obstacles for maintaining a gluten-free diet (63.4%), and Daily activities (55.8%). In those with depression, there was a higher prevalence of Lack of control of the celiac disease (100.0%), Perceived clinical condition (82.2%), and Daily obstacles for maintaining a gluten-free diet (69.0%). CONCLUSION: Celiac individuals with anxiety and depression frameworks presented a higher frequency of Perceived clinical condition, Insufficient social support (psychoaffective factors) and Daily obstacles for maintaining a gluten-free diet (daily-life factor).
30739797	Chronic Inflammation Permanently Reshapes Tissue-Resident Immunity in Celiac Disease.	Tissue-resident lymphocytes play a key role in immune surveillance, but it remains unclear how these inherently stable cell populations respond to chronic inflammation. In the setting of celiac disease (CeD), where exposure to dietary antigen can be controlled, gluten-induced inflammation triggered a profound depletion of naturally occurring Vgamma4+/Vdelta1+ intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) with innate cytolytic properties and specificity for the butyrophilin-like (BTNL) molecules BTNL3/BTNL8. Creation of a new niche with reduced expression of BTNL8 and loss of Vgamma4+/Vdelta1+ IELs was accompanied by the expansion of gluten-sensitive, interferon-gamma-producing Vdelta1+ IELs bearing T cell receptors (TCRs) with a shared non-germline-encoded motif that failed to recognize BTNL3/BTNL8. Exclusion of dietary gluten restored BTNL8 expression but was insufficient to reconstitute the physiological Vgamma4+/Vdelta1+ subset among TCRgammadelta+ IELs. Collectively, these data show that chronic inflammation permanently reconfigures the tissue-resident TCRgammadelta+ IEL compartment in CeD. VIDEO ABSTRACT.
36986205	Nutritional Considerations in Celiac Disease and Non-Celiac Gluten/Wheat Sensitivity.	A gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only available treatment for celiac disease (CeD), and it may also improve symptoms in non-celiac gluten/wheat sensitivity (NCGWS). In CeD, gluten triggers an immune reaction leading to enteropathy, malabsorption, and symptoms; in NCGWS, the mechanism leading to symptoms is unknown, and neither wheat nor gluten triggers enteropathy or malabsorption. A strict GFD is, therefore, necessary for CeD, but a gluten-restricted diet (GRD) may suffice to achieve symptom control for NCGWS. Regardless of this distinction, the risk of malnutrition and macro- and micronutrient deficiencies is increased by the adoption of a GFD or GRD. Thus, patients with CeD or NCGWS should undergo nutritional assessment and subsequent monitoring, based on evidence-based tools, under the care of a multidisciplinary team involving physicians and dietitians, for the long-term management of their nutrition. This review gives an overview of available nutrition assessment tools and considerations for the nutritional management of CeD and NCGWS populations.
30893404	Headache in Patients with Celiac Disease and Its Response to the Gluten-Free Diet.	AIMS: To describe headache characteristics among celiac disease (CD) patients and to analyze the relationship between CD and headache. METHODS: An online survey analyzing the characteristics of headache and its response to the gluten-free diet (GFD) in celiac patients was published on Argentinean Celiac social networks, open to the public to complete. The results were analyzed using chi-square test or Mann-Whitney test accordingly. RESULTS: A total of 1,517 subjects completed the survey, and 866 (55.2%) met the inclusion criteria (headache and CD confirmed with positive biopsy). The subjects were predominantly female (94.5%) and had a median age of 39 +- 11.27 years. Tension-type headache was the most prevalent headache type (52%), followed by migraine without (32.5%) and with aura (15.4%), respectively. Of the included participants, 24% reported headache as the main symptom that resulted in the diagnosis of CD. Following initiation of GFD, headache frequency and intensity improved significantly more in participants with migraine than tension-type headache (P = .02 and P = .013, respectively). Compliance to GFD was higher among subjects with severe manifestations (77% vs 66%, P = .05), and compliant individuals showed a 48% improvement in headache frequency (P = .049). An association between food transgressions and headache was better recognized by migraineurs (P = .02). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that strict compliance to the GFD could improve headache in celiac patients with headache, even in those without gastrointestinal symptoms. This observation could provide an additional factor when convincing patients to follow a GFD, thus reducing the morbidity related to CD.
29132529	Celiac Disease and Gluten Sensitivity.	Celiac disease is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by gluten that affects genetically predisposed individuals, typically causing intestinal symptoms and malabsorption. Diagnosis requires stepwise evaluation with anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA and histologic analysis of the small bowel. Strict adherence to a gluten-free diet is the primary treatment. Patients with symptoms thought to be related to gluten but without evidence of celiac disease are difficult to diagnose and treat. Consider first advising general nutritional improvements. If symptoms persist, involve a trained dietitian for restrictive diets and consider evaluation for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth or other treatments for irritable bowel syndrome.
31370243	Food Neophobia in Celiac Disease and Other Gluten-Free Diet Individuals.	The only treatment currently available to combat celiac disease (CD) is strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD), but there may be various determinants of its adherence, including food neophobia (FN), that is associated with sensory aversions, or fears of negative consequences of eating specific food products, that may be crucial for CD patients following a GFD. The aim of the present study was to analyze food neophobia levels and its determinants in CD patients in comparison with other individuals who follow a GFD based on their own decision. The study was conducted in two independent groups of individuals following a GFD: those diagnosed with CD (n = 101) and those following a GFD based on their own decision (n = 124). Each group was recruited with cooperation from the local CD and GFD societies located in Poland. The FN was assessed using the Food Neophobia Scale (FNS) and compared between groups, as well as the influence of gender, age, body mass index, educational level, place of residence and employment status was assessed. It was stated, that for the individuals following a GFD, CD was the major determinant of FN. The FNS score values were higher (indicating higher food neophobia) for CD individuals (39.4 +- 9.2), than for those following a GFD based on their own decision (33.6 +- 8.7; p < 0.0001) and it was observed both for general group and for sub-groups stratified by assessed variables. Moreover, the indicated variables did not influence the FNS in any of the analyzed groups. The influence of CD with no influence of other variables was confirmed in the regression analysis. It may be concluded that CD is a major contributor to FN, which can be attributed to fear of developing adverse reactions to gluten-contaminated food products, which is more pronounced in CD patients compared to non-CD patients following a GFD based on their own decision.
30201860	Gluten-Free Diet: From Development to Assessment of a Check-List Designed for the Prevention of Gluten Cross-Contamination in Food Services.	Gluten cross-contamination in gluten-free food may jeopardize treatment of celiac patients. Considering the deficit of appropriate instruments to enable the implementation of safe production practices for gluten-free food, this study aimed to evaluate the application of a check-list elaborated for gluten cross-contamination prevention in food services. The instrument was applied in 60 Brazilian food services. Interobserver reproducibility and internal consistency of the check-list were tested. A score classification was created for establishments according to the food contamination risk assessment. Subsequent to the application and statistical analysis, the original instrument was reduced to a 30-item check-list. In the reproducibility analysis, none of the 30 items showed significant divergence among the evaluators (p > 0.05 in the Cochran Q test). The 30-item version of the check-list presented Kuder-Richardson Formula 20 (KR-20) = 0.771, indicating good internal consistency. The proposed classification score is obtained by adding 1 point for each item with an "adequate" response; therefore, the final score may vary between 0 and 30 points. Establishments with up to 15 points exhibit risk of gluten contamination, while establishments with a score above 16 points exhibit low risk of contamination. The check-list displayed good reproducibility and internal consistency, suggesting that it could be a useful gluten contamination control instrument in food services.
33193357	Intestinal Dysbiosis in, and Enteral Bacterial Therapies for, Systemic Autoimmune Diseases.	Recent studies have shown that a number of common autoimmune diseases have perturbations of their intestinal microbiome (dysbiosis). These include: Celiac Disease (CeD), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), Sjogren's Syndrome (SS), and Type 1 diabetes (T1D). All of these have intestinal microbiomes that are different from healthy controls. There have been numerous studies using animal models of single probiotics (monoclonal) or mixtures of probiotics (polyclonal) and even complete microbiota transfer (fecal microbial transfer-FMT) to inhibit or delay the onset of autoimmune diseases such as the aforementioned common ones. However, proportionally, fewer clinical trials have utilized monoclonal therapies or FMT than polyclonal therapies for treating autoimmune diseases, even though bacterial mono-therapies do inhibit the development of autoimmune diseases and/or delay the onset of autoimmune diseases in rodent models of those autoimmune diseases. In this review then, we review the previously completed and currently ongoing clinical trials that are testing bacterial therapies (FMT, monoclonal, and polyclonal) to treat common autoimmune dseases and discuss the successes in using bacterial monotherapies to treat rodent models of these common autoimmune diseases.
30287732	Adherence to Gluten-Free Diet in Children with Celiac Disease.	Celiac disease (CD) can only be treated by rigorous life-long gluten-free diet (GFD). The study included 102 mothers and their CD children treated with GFD for at least two years. Frequency and cause of diet failure in children treated at present (54 children) and 10 years ago (48 children) were compared. Dietary adherence was evaluated serologically (tTG), while diet management difficulties were examined by means of a questionnaire. The study shows that one-third of patients fail to follow GFD, more often 10 years ago than now (40% vs. 26%; p < 0.05), mainly children aged 13-18 (54% vs. 40% now; p < 0.05). Younger children (up to 12) are less likely to abandon the diet (27% vs. 8%; p < 0.05). In this age group non-intentional diet failure prevails, while teenagers interrupt their diet intentionally (45% vs. 33%; p = ns (small population of children in this groups)). Currently, the most common causes of teenage diet failure are the absence of symptoms after consuming a small amount of gluten and, even more often, troublesome diet administration. Previously, the absence of peer acceptance prevailed. With this study we found that: 1. In West Pomerania, every fourth CD child does not follow GFD. 2. For years, teenagers have failed to follow GFD due to the absence of symptoms after consuming small amounts of gluten. 3. The incidence of non-intentional failure to follow GFD has significantly decreased over years, which indicates better dietary care.
34333499	Adult-Onset Autoimmune Enteropathy in an European Tertiary Referral Center.	INTRODUCTION: Adult-onset autoimmune enteropathy (AIE) is a rare cause of severe chronic diarrhea because of small intestinal villous atrophy. We report on patients with adult-onset AIE in an European referral center. METHODS: Retrospective study including patients diagnosed with AIE in the Amsterdam UMC, location VUmc, between January 2003 and December 2019. Clinical, serological, and histological features and response to treatment were reported. The specificity of antienterocyte antibodies (AEA) was evaluated by examining the prevalence of AEA in (i) controls (n = 30) and in patients with (ii) AIE (n = 13), (iii) celiac disease (CD, n = 52), (iv) refractory celiac disease type 2 (n = 18), and (v) enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL, n = 10). RESULTS: Thirteen AIE patients were included, 8 women (62%), median age of 52 years (range 23-73), and 6 (46%) with an autoimmune disease. AEA were observed in 11 cases (85%), but were also found in CD (7.7%), refractory celiac disease type 2 (16.7%), and EATL (20%). Ten patients (77%) were human leukocyte antigen DQ2.5 heterozygous. Total parenteral nutrition was required in 8 cases (62%). Steroids induced clinical remission in 8 cases (62%). Step-up therapy with rituximab, cyclosporine, infliximab, and cladribine in steroid-refractory patients was only moderately effective. Four patients died (31%), but 4 (31%) others are in long-term drug-free remission after receiving immunosuppressive treatment, including 1 patient who underwent autologous stem cell transplantation. DISCUSSION: Adult-onset AIE is a rare but severe enteropathy that occurs in patients susceptible for autoimmune disease. Four patients (31%) died secondary to therapy-refractory malabsorption, while immunosuppressive therapy leads to a long-lasting drug-free remission in one-third of patients.
33230758	A serial SPECT-CT study in a celiac disease patient with cerebellar ataxia and psychiatric symptoms.	Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated systemic disorder triggered by gluten and related prolamins in genetically predisposed individuals. Here, we described a case of a 31-year-old Caucasian woman who exhibited cerebellar and psychiatric dysfunctions. The patient underwent single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT-CT) before and after a gluten-free diet (GFD). There was an improvement in cerebellar perfusion accompanied by a remission of cerebellar manifestations. The maintenance of the psychiatric manifestations was related to the persistence of the hypoperfusion in the frontal lobes. The patient's psychiatric symptoms did not change after 4 months under a GFD in the hospital. To our knowledge, this is the first case that shows the relationship between improvement in cerebellar perfusion and remission of cerebellar clinical manifestations in a CD patient under a GFD.
33435453	Quantification of Accidental Gluten Contamination in the Diet of Children with Treated Celiac Disease.	A strict gluten-free diet is extremely difficult to maintain. Protracted ingestion of gluten traces (>10 mg/day) is sufficient to cause significant damage in the architecture of the small intestinal mucosa in patients on treatment for celiac disease. The aim of this study was to directly measure the level of contaminating gluten in the daily diet of celiac children following a gluten-free diet. From April 2019 to December 2019, celiac disease children (2-18 years old) on a gluten-free diet for >=6 months were offered to participate in this prospective-observational study. Patients and their caregivers were invited to provide a representative portion (about 10 g) of all meals consumed during a 24-h period. Participants were requested to weigh all ingested food and report items in a 24-h food diary. The gluten content was quantified by the R5 sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Sixty-nine children completed the protocol. Overall, 12/448 (2.7%) food samples contained detectable amounts of gluten; of them, 11 contained 5-20 ppm and 1 >20 ppm. The 12 contaminated food samples belonged to 5/69 enrolled patients. In these 5 children, the daily gluten intake was well below the safety threshold of 10 mg/day. The present findings suggest that in a country characterized by high celiac disease awareness, the daily unintended exposure to gluten of treated celiac children on regular follow-up is very low; reassuringly, the presence of gluten traces did not lead to exceed the tolerable threshold of 10 mg/day of gluten intake in the gluten-free diet.

33741317	Gluten Degradation, Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Tolerability of TAK-062, an Engineered Enzyme to Treat Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Celiac disease (CeD) is an immune-mediated disorder triggered by the ingestion of gluten. Despite adhering to a gluten-free diet (the only management option available to patients with CeD), many patients continue to experience symptoms and intestinal injury. Degradation of immunogenic fractions of gluten peptides in the stomach has been proposed as an approach to reduce toxicity of ingested gluten; however, no enzymes evaluated to date have demonstrated sufficient gluten degradation in complex meals. TAK-062 is a novel, computationally designed endopeptidase under development for the treatment of patients with CeD. METHODS: Pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of TAK-062 100-900 mg were evaluated in a phase I dose escalation study in healthy participants and patients with CeD. Gluten degradation by TAK-062 was evaluated under simulated gastric conditions in vitro and in healthy participants in the phase I study, with and without pretreatment with a proton pump inhibitor. Residual gluten (collected through gastric aspiration in the phase I study) was quantified using R5 and G12 monoclonal antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. RESULTS: In vitro, TAK-062 degraded more than 99% of gluten (3 g and 9 g) within 10 minutes. In the phase I study, administration of TAK-062 was well tolerated and resulted in a median gluten degradation ranging from 97% to more than 99% in complex meals containing 1-6 g gluten at 20-65 minutes postdose. CONCLUSIONS: TAK-062 is well tolerated and rapidly and effectively degrades large amounts of gluten, supporting the development of this novel enzyme as an oral therapeutic for patients with CeD.

34066195	Nutritional Status in Spanish Adults with Celiac Disease Following a Long-Term Gluten-Free Diet Is Similar to Non-Celiac.	The only available treatment for celiac disease is life-long gluten exclusion. We conducted a cross-sectional age- and gender-matched study in 64 celiac adults on a long-term (>1 year) gluten-free diet and 74 non-celiac volunteers from Spain, using dietary, anthropometric, and biochemical parameters, as well as assessing bone mineral density and physical activity. Celiac adults had deficient intake (below 2/3 of the recommended intake) for folates, vitamin E, and iodine and low intake of calcium (below 80% of the recommended intake). Iron intake was also below 2/3 of the recommended intake in celiac women. Vitamin D intake was extremely low, and 34% of celiac patients had moderately deficient plasma levels. According to bone mineral density, celiac women may be more prone to osteopenia and osteoporosis. However, we found a perfectly analogous nutritional status scenario in celiac as compared to healthy volunteers, with the dietary deviations found being similar to those of the Spanish population, i.e., both groups followed a high-lipid, high-protein, and low-carbohydrate diet. Values for biochemical parameters were found within the reference ranges. Celiac disease had no influence on body weight, but body fat in celiac patients tended to be higher. According to our results, vitamin D, calcium, folates, vitamin E, iodine, and iron nutritional status should be specifically assessed and monitored in the celiac population.
37903705	Impact of Gluten-Free Diet on Anthropometric Indicators in Individuals With and Without Celiac Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.	PURPOSE: Previous studies have found that a gluten-free diet (GFD) may have improve obesity-related factors. For this reason, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the effect of a GFD on anthropometric indicators. METHODS: We performed a systematic search in databases from inception until July 12, 2022. We included all relevant articles that evaluate efficacy of a GFD on anthropometric indicators in patients with and without celiac disease (CD). Random-effects models were applied to combine the data. The main outcomes were then analyzed using weight mean differences (WMDs) and 95% CIs. FINDINGS: A total of 27 articles met the eligible criteria and were included. Pooled results from the random-effects model indicated that the GFD has no significant effect on any of the factors of anthropometry, including weight (WMD, 1.20 kg; 95% CI, -1.16 to 3.55 kg; P = 0.319), body mass index (WMD, 0.70 kg/m2; 95% CI, -0.45 to 1.84 kg/m2; P = 0.233), waist circumference (WMD, 0.92 cm; 95% CI, -1.34 to 3.17 cm; P = 0.497), and body fat (WMD, 1.02%; 95% CI, -0.38% to 2.42%; P = 0.153). The subgroup results indicated that after implementation of a GFD significant increased weight and body fat occurred in patients with compared with without CD. In addition, the effect of this diet on the increase of BMI and body fat in the intervention of more than 48 weeks was significantly higher. IMPLICATIONS: The results of the present study indicate that a GFD can have a significant and beneficial effect on weight and body fat in patients with CD.
37120973	Standard addition method (SAM) in LC-MS/MS to quantify gluten-derived metabolites in urine samples.	A tight adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD), the most effective treatment currently available for celiac disease, is important to reduce symptoms, avoid nutritional deficiencies and improve quality of life in celiac patients. The development of analytical methods allowing detecting gluten exposure due to occasional or involuntary food transgressions could represent a useful tool to monitor patient habits and conditions and prevent long-term complications. The aim of this work was to develop and validate an approach based on the standard addition methodology (SAM) for the detection and quantification of two main metabolites of alkylresorcinols, 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA) and 3-(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl)-propanoic acid (DHPPA), whose presence in urine samples is related to the intake of gluten-containing foods. Analytically, the method consisted of a protein precipitation step followed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. The chromatographic method involved the use of a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) in a direct phase approach; LC-MS/MS analyses were performed in selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode. Manipulation and instrumental errors were normalised using stable isotopic standards (ISs). The SAM approach here described requires less than 1 mL of urine per sample, thus greatly reducing the sample volume needed. Noteworthy, despite the small cohort of samples analysed, our data allowed to identify a potential "threshold" value, around 200 ng/mL for DHBA and 400 ng/mL for DHPPA, to discriminate between a GFD and a gluten rich diet (GRD).
36002677	Bi-directional Relationship Between Celiac Disease and Liver Chemistries: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	AIMS: Previous studies have reported conflicting results regarding prevalence of elevated LC (2-70%) in celiac disease (CD). This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the prevalence of elevated LC at time of CD diagnosis and associated response to GFD. We also report the prevalence of CD in patients with unexplained elevation of LC. METHODS: Studies assessing LC (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) in CD patients were eligible. Studies with < 50 cases or in pediatric populations were excluded. RESULTS: In total, 20 studies assessing prevalence of elevated LC in 4,265 participants with newly diagnosed CD (mean age = 35.6 +- 6.5 years, 69.8% female) were included. Pooled prevalence of elevated LC was 18.7% (95% CI 13.8-24.8; I2 = 95%). Normalization of elevated LC was seen in 83.1% (95% CI 73.4-89.7; I2 = 79%, 11 studies) of patients after GFD. On meta-regression, age at CD diagnosis, gender, and Marsh grading were not associated with elevated LC. Among 979 participants (7 studies) with unexplained elevation of LC, pooled seroprevalence and biopsy-proven CD was 6.4% (95% CI 2.9-10.3, I2 = 71%) and 4.5% (95% CI 2.6-7.7, I2 = 67%), respectively. CONCLUSION: Elevated LC are seen in approximately one-fifth of patients at CD diagnosis with majority normalizing after GFD. Age, gender, and degree of intestinal damage are not predictive of elevated LC. In the appropriate clinical scenario, liver tests should be serially monitored in CD reserving workup for additional causes after a trial of GFD. Patients with unexplained elevation of liver tests should be screened for celiac disease.
29763907	Beyond Irritable Bowel Syndrome: The Efficacy of the Low Fodmap Diet for Improving Symptoms in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases and Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: To evaluate the usefulness of a low FODMAP (Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, and Polyols) diet on patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), non-active inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), and celiac disease (CD) on a gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: Dietetic interventional prospective study. IBS, IBD, and CD subjects were evaluated to check if they fulfilled the Rome III criteria. Each subject was educated to follow a low FODMAP diet after being evaluated by filling out questionnaires that assessed the quality of life (QoL) and symptoms experienced (IBS-SSS and SF-36), and was reevaluated after 1 and 3 months. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-seven subjects were enrolled: 56 with IBS, 30 with IBD, and 41 with CD. IBS-SSS showed that abdominal symptoms improved after 1 and 3 months of diet in all subjects, with significant difference among the 3 groups at T0 (average scores IBS: 293 +- 137, IBD: 206 +- 86, CD: 222 +- 65, p < 0.001), but no difference at T3 (IBS: 88 +- 54, IBD: 73 +- 45, CD: 77 +- 49, p = ns). By analyzing the SF-36 questionnaire, we did not observe any difference between the 3 groups, in terms of response to diet (p = ns), we observed a clinical improvement from T0 to T3 for most of the questionnaire's domains. CONCLUSIONS: A low FODMAP diet could be a valid option to counter -abdominal symptoms in patients with IBS, non-active IBD, or CD on a GFD, and thus, improve their QoL and social -relations.
30045167	Autoimmune and Allergic Disorders are More Common in People With Celiac Disease or on a Gluten-free Diet in the United States.	GOALS: We analyzed demographics, lifestyle patterns, and clinical characteristics of people with celiac disease (CD) and people without CD avoiding gluten (PWAG) to better understand associations with medical conditions and consumer behavior. BACKGROUND: Clinical significance of CD and gluten avoidance in the general population is incompletely understood. Recently, a high incidence of CD in adolescents with susceptibility genotypes, similar to other autoimmune or allergic disorders, and regional differences in consumer practices of gluten avoidance were reported. METHODS: Among 22,277 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2009-2014, we identified persons with CD by testing CD serology or by both a health care provider diagnosis and adherence to a gluten-free diet. Similarly, PWAG were defined as adherent to a gluten-free diet without a CD diagnosis. Consumer behavior and characteristics of both groups, CD and PWAG were compared with those without these conditions, using survey-weighted generalized logistic regression. RESULTS: Participants with CD considered nutrition very important when grocery shopping and tended to have more constipation and thyroid disease. PWAG tended to spend more money on groceries, purchase organic foods, and check food labels more frequently during grocery shopping. They also reported having more food allergies, asthma, and thyroid disease. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that CD and PWAG share comorbidities of autoimmune nature. PWAG had more autoimmune/allergy-related disorders that may be associated with non-celiac gluten sensitivity a self-justifiable reason to be on the diet.
33079752	"ASKing" the Right Questions About Screening for Celiac Disease.	ABSTRACT: Make a distinction between investigating symptoms and screening for disease. Understand the performance characteristics of a test for those with symptoms and for screening those without symptoms, whether at elevated risk or average risk of disease. Positive test results require patient education and follow-up. Importantly, screening should be advantageous to an individual, and disease treatment should be in their interest. The practical application of these principles in relation to population-based Celiac disease screening may be difficult, as a large Colorado study has found.
32599449	Nutritional management of celiac crisis in an elderly adult: A case report of the rare presentation of celiac disease in a 75-y-old woman.	In adults, a very uncommon presentation of celiac disease (CD) is a celiac crisis, a life-threatening and severe form of the disease having a dramatic onset with diarrhea and metabolic acidosis with electrolyte and fluid imbalance. Treatment of celiac crisis requires a gluten-free diet; however, the risk for refeeding syndrome (RFS) should be considered in patients showing marked malabsorption symptoms and important unintentional weight loss. Therefore, to avoid metabolic and potentially fatal complications of re-nutrition, nutritional management is crucial for a safe recovery after a celiac crisis. This review reports the rare onset of celiac crisis in a 75-y-old woman presenting with severe malnutrition resulting in >40% weight loss in 3 mo, after a period of severe diarrhea and vomiting. She arrived at the hospital showing electrolyte imbalance, hypoalbuminemia, lower limb edema, multiple bowel movements (>10/d) with steatorrhea, sarcopenia with profound asthenia, hyporexia due to intolerance to any food, and vomiting after meals. After being diagnosed with CD, the first approach was a gluten-free diet, which demonstrated only small and slow improvements of gastrointestinal symptoms. Therefore, a second approach was parenteral nutrition (PN) support that dramatically helped the patient's recovery. Here we describe the nutritional management during the inpatient stay for clinical stabilization and the following outpatient visits during and after the support with PN, until the patient's complete recovery to a regular follow-up.
36597078	Extra-intestinal manifestations of Celiac disease in children: their prevalence and association with human leukocyte antigens and pathological and laboratory evaluations.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease caused by gluten intake. Traditionally CD was believed to be a disease of the gut, although a wide range of extra-intestinal manifestations (EIM) was recognized. The exact prevalence of EIM and the associated risk factors have not been well studied. AIM: We aimed to assess the prevalence of EIM in children with CD and their association with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing, and pathological and laboratory indices. METHOD: We conducted a cross-sectional study on children and adolescents with a definite diagnosis of CD. They were followed in the main Celiac Clinic of Southern Iran. RESULTS: We included 204 children who were visited between 2012 and 2017. Nearly 85% of them were positive for HLA-DQ2 and 40.6% for HLA-DQ8. The most prevalent intestinal complaints reported were abdominal pain (42.6%) and chronic constipation (19.1%). Failure-to-thrive (32.7%), iron deficiency anemia (25%), short stature (20.5%), and eczema (18.6%) were the most common EIMs. However, failure-to-thrive and short stature were presented at significantly younger ages, whereas those patients with concomitant type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) were significantly older. We also found significant relationships between autoimmune thyroid disease and HLA-DQ5, and the presence of headaches with HLA-DQ7. The prevalence of HLA types of DQ2, DQ8, DQ6, and DQ7 significantly varied among different Marsh groups. Patients who were positive for HLA-DQ8, were significantly older, taller, and weightier. No significant association was found between HLA types and any of the gastrointestinal symptoms, anti-tTG and compliance to gluten free diet. Moreover, there were no statistically significant differences detected between the presence of each individual EIM, the level of IgA anti-tTG, sex, and Marsh typing. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the presence of EIM in CD and their associated factors. We show the potential role of HLA typing in some EIMs, which may shed light for future studies.
30725059	[Characterization of celiac disease in chilean public hospitals].	INTRODUCTION: The worldwide prevalence of celiac disease (CD) is ~1% of the population. In Chile, the National Health Survey 2009-2010 showed a serological prevalence in individuals older than 15 years of 0.76% (IgA-tTG2), which corresponded in Concepcion to 0.6%. OBJECTIVE: Determine cli nical characteristics, search, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of CD in the two public hospitals in Concepcion that have a Gastroenterology Department. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Descriptive study. Data were collected from electronic medical records (CIE10 code) and medical records of patients youn ger than 18 years of age, assessed for CD during 2010 - 2016 from two public hospitals in the city of Concepcion, Chile. Cases whose diagnostic protocol met the ESPGHAN 2012 criteria (confirmation with intestinal biopsy), 207 out of 216 identified patients met the inclusion criteria. The nutritional status was classified according to age group (in children under five years old by WHO 2006 and in children between five and 18 years old by WHO 2007). The Z-score (Z) was calculated using the WHO Anthro software (in children under five years old) and WHO Anthro Plus software (in those between five and 18 years old). Antiendomysial antibodies were assessed by immunofluorescence test in cuts of the esophagus of mono, IgA and IgG anti-transglutaminase antibodies via ELISA, as well as serum IgA. RESULTS: CD was confirmed by duodenal biopsies in 33.8% of the patients. IgA-tTG was identified in 70% and IgG-tTG in 52.9%, although only two patients had IgA deficiency. The main reasons for consultation were gastrointestinal (80%) and/or referral by an endocrinologist (45.7%). The main clinical presentation was gastrointestinal, with diarrhea (71.4%). 17.1% of the patients had Down syndrome (DS), 11.4% short stature, and 5.7% had type 1 diabetes mellitus. At diagnosis, the obesitymalnutrition ratio (Z-score BMI) was 2:1 and 6.8% of the patients were obese. One year after diagnosis, in 26 patients without DS, the frequency of eutrophic patients decreased from 65.4% to 42.3%, increasing overweight from 23.1% to 34.6% and obesity from 0 to 7.7%. CONCLUSIONS: In Con cepcion, endocrinologists conduct a significant and successful active search of CD, being responsible for 47.3% of the diagnoses. The high proportion of overweight/obese patients is consistent with the phenomenon currently described in Chile and other countries.
30513876	Are Gluten-Free Diets More Nutritious? An Evaluation of Self-Selected and Recommended Gluten-Free and Gluten-Containing Dietary Patterns.	Gluten-free (GF) eating patterns are frequently perceived to be healthier than gluten-containing (GC) ones, but there has been very little research to evaluate this viewpoint. The effect of GF eating patterns on dietary composition was assessed using two independent approaches. One approach compared macronutrients and typical shortfall nutrients between MyPlate example menus developed with either GC or equivalent GF foods. In this analysis, the GF menus were significantly lower in protein, magnesium, potassium, vitamin E, folate, and sodium (p = 0.002-0.03), with suggestive trends towards lower calcium and higher fat (p = 0.06-0.08). The second approach was a meta-analysis of seven studies comparing information on the nutrient intakes of adults with celiac disease following a GF diet with control subjects eating a GC diet, and differences were evaluated using paired t-tests or Wilcoxon Signed rank tests. In this analysis, consuming a GF diet was associated with higher energy and fat intakes, and lower fiber and folate intakes compared to controls (p < 0.001 to p = 0.03). After adjusting for heterogeneity and accounting for the large mean effect size (-0.88 +- 0.09), the lower fiber remained significant (p < 0.001). These combined analyses indicate that GF diets are not nutritionally superior except for sodium, and in several respects are actually worse.
37554764	Effect of gluten-free diet on autoimmune thyroiditis progression in patients with no symptoms or histology of celiac disease: a meta-analysis.	Background: Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is the most common autoimmune disease. HT may be associated with nonthyroidal autoimmune diseases, including celiac disease (CD) or other gluten-related conditions (GRC). In the last years, interest about gluten-free diet (GFD) has increased for its supposed extraintestinal anti-inflammatory effect; thus, many patients with HT initiate GFD on their own. Objectives: The aim of this meta-analysis is to examine all available data in literature about the effect of a GFD on TgAb, TPOAb, TSH, FT4, and FT3 levels in patients with HT and no symptoms or histology of CD. Methods: The study was conducted according to MOOSE (Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology). The search was performed on databases PubMed and Scopus. The last search was performed on 7 February 2023. Quality assessment was performed. Meta-analyses were performed using the random-effect model. Hedges' g was used to measure the effect size (ES). Statistical analyses were performed using StataSE 17. Results: The online search retrieved 409 articles, and 4 studies with a total of 87 patients were finally included for quantitative analysis. The risk of bias was generally low. The mean period of GFD was almost 6 months. The meta-analyses showed reduction in antibody levels with ES: -0.39 for TgAb (95% CI: -0.81 to +0.02; p = 0.06; I2 = 46.98%) and -0.40 for TPOAb (95% CI: -0.82 to +0.03; p = 0.07; I2 = 47.58%). TSH showed a reduction with ES: -0.35 (95% CI: -0.64 to -0.05; p = 0.02; I2 = 0%) and FT4 showed an increase with ES: +0.35% (95% CI: 0.06 to 0.64; p = 0.02; I2 = 0%). FT3 did not display variations (ES: 0.05; 95% CI: -0.38 to +0.48; p = 0.82; I2 = 51%). The heterogeneity of TgAb, TPOAb, and FT3 data was solved performing sub-analyses between patients with or without GRC (TgAb p = 0.02; TPOAb p = 0.02; FT3 p = 0.04) and only for FT3, performing a sub-analysis between patients taking and not taking LT4 (p = 0.03). Conclusion: This is the first meta-analysis investigating the effect of GFD on HT. Our results seem to indicate a positive effect of the gluten deprivation on thyroid function and its inflammation, particularly in patients with HT and GRC. However, current lines of evidence are not yet sufficient to recommend this dietary approach to all patients with a diagnosis of HT.
31953154	Nutrition Assessment, Interventions, and Monitoring for Patients with Celiac Disease: An Evidence Analysis Center Scoping Review.	The objectives of this scoping review were to identify and characterize studies examining nutrition assessment, interventions, and measures to monitor gluten-free diet (GFD) adherence/compliance in patients with celiac disease (CD). An electronic literature search of four databases (Cochrane Database for systematic reviews, CINAHL, Embase, and Ovid MEDLINE) was conducted to identify articles examining nutrition care in CD individuals. Except for narrative review, grey literature, and case study/report, all types of peer-reviewed articles published between January 2007 and August 2018 were eligible. There were a total of 10,823 records; 10,368 were excluded during the first round of screening due to irrelevancy and/or duplication. Of the 455 full-text articles that were assessed, 292 met the criteria and were included. Most of the studies were observational studies (n=212), followed by experimental trials (n=50), evidence-based practice guideline (EBPG)/report/statement (n=16), and systematic review (SR) (n=14). Nine original studies examined assessment, focusing mainly on different tools/ways to assess GFD adherence. The majority of the included original articles (n=235) were in the nutrition intervention category with GFD, oats, and prebiotics/probiotics as the top-three most studied interventions. There were eight SRs on GFD and five on oats. One SR and 21 original studies investigated the effectiveness of different measures to monitor GFD adherence/compliance. Although recent CD EBPGs were identified, different methods with varying levels of rigor, in terms of literature search and assessment of evidence strength, were used. Based on this scoping review, interventions focused on gluten-free diet and oats have been significantly covered by either SRs or EBPGs. Studies related to prebiotics/probiotics and education program/counseling focused interventions, as well as assessment, in CD patients have increased in recent years. Thus, it might be beneficial to conduct SRs/EBPGs focused on these topics to guide practitioners.
34797778	Plasma IL-2 and Symptoms Response after Acute Gluten Exposure in Subjects With Celiac Disease or Nonceliac Gluten Sensitivity.	INTRODUCTION: Treated patients with celiac disease (CeD) and nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) report acute, transient, incompletely understood symptoms after suspected gluten exposure. To determine whether (i) blinded gluten exposure induces symptoms, (ii) subjects accurately identify gluten exposure, and (iii) serum interleukin-2 (IL-2) levels distinguish CeD from NCGS subjects after gluten exposure. METHODS: Sixty subjects (n = 20 treated, healed CeD; n = 20 treated NCGS; n = 20 controls) were block randomized to a single, double-blind sham (rice flour) or 3-g gluten challenge with 72-hours follow-up. Twelve serial questionnaires (100 mm visual analog scale; pain, bloating, nausea, and fatigue) and 10 serial plasma samples were collected. Mucosal permeability was assessed using both urinary lactulose-13C mannitol ratios and endoscopic mucosal impedance. RESULTS: Thirty-five of 40 (83%) subjects with CeD and NCGS reported symptoms with gluten (8 CeD, 9 NCGS) and sham (9 CeD, 9 NCGS) compared with 9 of 20 (45%) controls after gluten (n = 6) and sham (n = 3). There was no significant difference in symptoms among groups. Only 2 of 10 subjects with CeD and 4 of 10 NCGS identified gluten, whereas 8 of 10 subjects with CeD and 5 of 10 NCGS identified sham. A significant plasma IL-2 increase occurred only in subjects with CeD after gluten, peaking at 3 hours and normalizing within 24 hours postchallenge despite no significant intestinal permeability change from baseline. DISCUSSION: Symptoms do not reliably indicate gluten exposure in either subjects with CeD or NCGS. IL-2 production indicates a rapid-onset gluten-induced T-cell activation in CeD despite long-standing treatment. The effector site is unknown, given no increased intestinal permeability after gluten.
32126832	Folate content of gluten-free food purchases and dietary intake are low in children with coeliac disease.	The lack of mandated folate enrichment of gluten-free (GF) grains in Canada has been suspected to contribute to suboptimal folate intake among children suffering from Celiac disease (CD). Children with CD on the gluten-free diet (GFD) face nutrient imbalances (higher fat/sugar, lower folate) from processed GF foods. The study objective examined folate intake in children with CD and folate content of household food purchases. Households collected food receipts for 30 days to assess folate content. Folate-rich foods were defined as >=60 microg dietary folate equivalent (DFE)/100g. Two 24-hour recalls assessed children's intake. Households (n = 73) purchased >17,000 food items. Median child age was 10.5 y (IQR: 8.4-14.1). GF folate-rich foods represented <15% of all household food purchases and 69% of children had low folate intakes. Folate-rich foods consumed included legumes/GF-breakfast cereals. These represented 5% of GF-food purchases/intake. Few were fortified with folate. Findings highlight the need for mandated GF folate food fortification policy.
34053062	Gut Microbiota, the Immune System, and Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes.	Gut microbiota, the largest microbial community living in the human body, exerts a variety of metabolic, structural, and functional actions. In particular, it is essential for the full immune system development and maturation, as demonstrated by studies on germ-free animals, showing immune impairment at different levels. Gut microbiota shapes the immune responses by promoting immune tolerance toward food antigens and commensals in the steady state. This process is orchestrated by a complex network of both microbial and human cells and molecular mediators. Microbiota eubiosis is fundamental in establishing a correct balance between tolerance and immunity. Contrarily, microbiota dysbiosis is correlated with alterations in the immune balance, as evidenced in intestinal pathologies characterized by aberrant immune responses, such as inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease, in which either break of tolerance against commensals or microbial dysbiosis is reported. On the other hand, a role for gut microbiota in stimulating the cytotoxic immune response in contexts of immunosuppression, like the ones featuring tumors and vaccinations, is emerging. The bifaceted role of gut microbiota in the delicate balance between tolerance and immunity could be exploited in order to develop pioneering therapeutic strategies, complementary to the pharmacological ones, thus representing a field worthy of further studies specifically focused on this topic.
35048685	Response to Screening-detected positive serology for celiac disease: is there always mucosal damage?	
32686439	A comparison of the nutritional profile and price of gluten-free products and their gluten-containing counterparts available in the Spanish market.	INTRODUCTION: Background: to date, gluten-free (GF) diet is the only treatment available for individuals with celiac disease. Both individual and collective food intake assessments are a challenge because a food composition database of GF products (GFPs) is lacking. Objectives: to describe the process of developing a food composition database of GFPs, and to compare the nutritional profile and price of some GFPs and non-GFPs. Methods: initially, a total of 216 brands of GFPs marketed in Spain were recorded. Nutritional information was collected from nutritional labels and product fact sheets that had been provided by food companies or collected first-hand by researchers. Then, the nutritional profile and price of the cereal and cereal byproducts foodstuff groups, including 19 types of products, were compared. Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS statistical program (22.0 edition; SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Results: a total of 2,247 GFPs from 126 different foodstuff brands were included in the food composition database of GFPs (CELIAC-BASE). We classified these products into 14 foodstuff groups. The protein content of the GFPs studied was significantly lower, and the price was higher, than that of their non-GFP counterparts. Some, but not all, GFPs had a higher content of fat and sugar, and a lower content of dietary fiber as compared to their non-GFP counterparts. Some GFPs were up to 6 times more expensive than the corresponding non-GFPs. Conclusions: CELIAC-BASE is a pioneering tool for dietitians. Many GFPs have poor nutritional profiles and should be consumed only occasionally in a balanced GF diet.
29799889	[Perception of following gluten-free diet and adherence to treatment in pediatric patients with celiac disease].	INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic immune-mediated enteropathy present in ~1% of population. Gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only treatment for this condition and the main limitation of its efficacy is the lack of adherence. OBJECTIVE: To assess factors influencing adherence to GFD in pediatric patients and measure the concordance between serological results and a nutritional adhe rence questionnaire. PATIENTS AND METHODS: celiac patients younger than 18 years of age, diagnosed CD following ESPGHAN criteria, on GFD for at least 6 months and consulting at Hospital Roberto del Rio, Santiago, in 2008-2016, were assessed. Clinical presentation, nutritional evaluation and fac tors related to adherence to treatment (diet) were registered. A subsample answered Biaggi's nutri tional questionnaire. RESULTS: Of 65 evaluated patients, 44% and 30,1% adhered to GFD according to blood autoantibodies (TTG and EMA) and the adherence questionnaire, respectively. "Age at debut" (p = 0.049), "perception of following GFD correctly" (p = 0.002) and "behavior in social events" (p = 0.005) were significantly associated with adherence to GFD. There was concordance between serological test and Biagi's questionnaire (p = 0.0001). DISCUSSION: Adherence to GFD was lower than reported in literature. Intervention of some of the identified variables associated with adherence may help improving follow-up of celiac patients, especially those that due to diverse situations cannot measure their antibodies periodically.
38147608	Celiac Disease: Promising Biomarkers for Follow-Up.	Celiac disease is a common gastroenterological illness. Current diagnostics of the disease are based on serological markers and histology of duodenal biopsies. Hitherto, a strict gluten-free diet is the only effective treatment and is necessary for good control of the disease. Serological tests in current use have very high specificity and sensitivity for diagnostics, but in follow-up they have some limitations. Their levels do not accurately reflect mucosal healing, and they are unable to detect minimal transgressions in the diet. This problem is significant in patients with IgA deficiency, and there exist no robust follow-up tools for monitoring these patients' adherence to treatment. For their follow-up, we currently use IgG-based tests, and these antibodies persist for a long time even when a patient has stopped consuming gluten. More accurate and specific biomarkers are definitely needed. Adherence to a gluten-free diet is essential not only for intestinal mucosa healing and alleviation of symptoms but also for preventing complications associated with celiac disease. Here, we summarize current evidence regarding noninvasive biomarkers potentially useful for follow-up not only of patients with IgA deficiency but for all patients with celiac disease. We describe several very promising biomarkers with potential to be part of clinical practice in the near future.
29773507	The value and significance of 25(OH) and 1,25(OH) vitamin D serum levels in adult coeliac patients: A review of the literature.	Within the wide spectrum of symptoms and alteration of systems that characterizes CeD, several studies indicate a low-level of vitamin D, therefore recent guidelines suggest its evaluation at the time of diagnosis. This review examines the data from existing studies in which vitamin D has been assessed in CeD patients. Our review indicates that most of the studies on vitamin D in adult CeD report a 25 (OH) vitamin D deficiency at diagnosis that disappears when the patient goes on a gluten-free diet, independently of any supplementation. Instead, when the calcitriol, the active 1,25 (OH) vitamin D form, was evaluated, it resulted in the normal range at the time of CeD diagnosis. A strict and lifelong gluten-free diet can help recover vitamin D level without any supplementation.
32348008	Facilitators and barriers to adherence to gluten-free diet among adults with celiac disease: a systematic review.	BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease (CD) is a chronic, autoimmune disease that prevents individuals from processing gluten, leading to adverse health effects. People with CD should adhere to a gluten-free diet (GFD); however, adherence rates are well below optimal in adults with CD, ranging between 42% and 91%. To date, limited evidence is available on the nature and magnitude of factors that affect adherence to GFD. The present study aimed to develop a systematic review that critically appraises and synthesises evidence on facilitators and barriers that affect adherence to GFD among adults with CD. METHODS: Four databases were searched (Ovid Medline, CINAHL, PsychInfo and Embase) using variant keywords to identify empirical studies meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria. A coding scheme was developed to extract relevant information from each article. RESULTS: Forty articles were included. Grounded in the bioecological theory of development, we synthesised the facilitators and barriers in the literature into a social ecological model with multiple levels: system, community, organisational, interpersonal and individual. The studies varied by design and level of evidence; only one randomised trial was identified. The most significant facilitators include (% of studies): increased education (22.5%); increased knowledge of a GFD (20%); increased intention/self-regulatory efficacy (17.5%); and coeliac association membership (12.5%). The most significant barriers include: lower knowledge of CD (35%); restaurant/supermarket shopping (30%); poor patient education from practitioner (17.5%); and low intention/motivation to adhere to a GFD (17.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Improving knowledge of a GFD, becoming a member of a coeliac association, and improving practitioners' abilities to educate patients on CD will create opportunities for improved adherence to GFD among adults with CD.
37282444	Complementary and alternative medicine use and its association with medication adherence in inflammatory bowel disease and other gastrointestinal diseases.	Background: The use of complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs) has been embedded in populations for decades. In this study, we aimed to determine the rate of their usage among inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients and their association with adherence to conventional therapies. Methods: In this cross sectional, survey-based study, IBD patients' (n=226) adherence and compliance were evaluated using the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-8. A control sample of 227 patients with other gastrointestinal diseases was included to compare trends of CAM use. Results: Crohn's disease represented 66.4% of those with IBD, with a mean age of 35 +- 13.0 years (54% males). The control group had either chronic viral hepatitis B, gastroesophageal reflux disease, Celiac disease, or other non-IBD diseases, with a mean age of 43.5 +- 16.8 years (55% males). Overall, 49% of patients reported using CAMs (54% in IBD group and 43% in the non-IBD group, P =0.024). Across both groups, the most used CAMs were honey (28%) and Zamzam water (19%). There was no significant association between the severity of the illness and use of CAMs. Patients who used CAMs had a lower adherence to conventional therapies vs. those who did not use CAMs (39% vs. 23%, P =0.038). Using the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-8, low adherence to medications was reported in 35% of the IBD group vs. 11% of non-IBD group (P = 0.01). Conclusion: In our population, patients with IBD are more likely to use CAMs and are less adherent to medications. Furthermore, the use of CAMs was associated with a lower adherence rate to conventional therapies. Consequently, further studies assessing the causes associated with the use of CAMs and nonadherence to conventional therapies should be explored and interventions designed to mitigate nonadherence.
33518167	All Things Gluten: A Review.	Gluten is a common dietary component with a complex protein structure. It forms incomplete products of digestion, which have the potential to mount an immune response in genetically predisposed individuals, resulting in celiac disease. It also has been linked with nonceliac gluten sensitivity and irritable bowel syndrome due to wheat allergy. A gluten-free diet is an effective treatment of these conditions; however, it can lead to micronutrient and mineral deficiencies and a macronutrient imbalance with higher sugar and lipid intake. Recent popularity has led to greater availability, but increasing cost, of commercially available gluten-free products.
29216605	Gluten peptides drive healthy and celiac monocytes toward an M2-like polarization.	Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by ingested gluten in genetically susceptible individuals and sustained by both adaptive and innate immune responses. Recent studies in murine macrophages demonstrated that the activation of arginase (ARG) metabolic pathway by gluten peptides contributes to the modulation of intestinal permeability in vitro. Here we characterize the effects of gluten on arginine metabolism and cell polarization in human monocytes from both healthy and CD subjects; both a simplified enzymatic digestion of gliadin and a physiological digestion of whole wheat have been tested. Results indicate that gluten digests induce the onset of an M2-like phenotype in activated macrophages; more precisely, both isoforms of arginase, ARG1 and ARG2, are induced likely due to the inhibition of mTOR and the consequent induction of C/EBPbeta transcription factor. These effects are independent from the origin of gluten as well as from the digestive protocol employed; moreover, no statistical difference can be evidenced between healthy and CD patients, excluding a diverse predisposition of CD monocytes to gluten-triggered polarization with respect to healthy immune cells. Overall, the present findings sustain a role for arginase pathway in the immune response elicited by human monocytes toward ingested gluten that, hence, deserves particular attention when addressing the pathogenesis of CD.
29102613	Fructan, Rather Than Gluten, Induces Symptoms in Patients With Self-Reported Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Non-celiac gluten sensitivity is characterized by symptom improvement after gluten withdrawal in absence of celiac disease. The mechanisms of non-celiac gluten sensitivity are unclear, and there are no biomarkers for this disorder. Foods with gluten often contain fructans, a type of fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols. We aimed to investigate the effect of gluten and fructans separately in individuals with self-reported gluten sensitivity. METHODS: We performed a double-blind crossover challenge of 59 individuals on a self-instituted gluten-free diet, for whom celiac disease had been excluded. The study was performed at Oslo University Hospital in Norway from October 2014 through May 2016. Participants were randomly assigned to groups placed on diets containing gluten (5.7 g), fructans (2.1 g), or placebo, concealed in muesli bars, for 7 days. Following a minimum 7-day washout period (until the symptoms induced by the previous challenge were resolved), participants crossed over into a different group, until they completed all 3 challenges (gluten, fructan, and placebo). Symptoms were measured by Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale Irritable Bowel Syndrome (GSRS-IBS) version. A linear mixed model for analysis was used. RESULTS: Overall GSRS-IBS scores differed significantly during gluten, fructan, and placebo challenges; mean values were 33.1 +- 13.3, 38.6 +- 12.3, and 34.3 +- 13.9, respectively (P = .04). Mean scores for GSRS-IBS bloating were 9.3 +- 3.5, 11.6 +- 3.5, and 10.1 +- 3.7, respectively, during the gluten, fructan, and placebo challenges (P = .004). The overall GSRS-IBS score for participants consuming fructans was significantly higher than for participants consuming gluten (P = .049), as was the GSRS bloating score (P = .003). Thirteen participants had the highest overall GSRS-IBS score after consuming gluten, 24 had the highest score after consuming fructan, and 22 had the highest score after consuming placebo. There was no difference in GSRS-IBS scores between gluten and placebo groups. CONCLUSIONS: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of individuals with self-reported non-celiac gluten sensitivity, we found fructans to induce symptoms, measured by the GSRS-IBS. Clinicaltrials.gov no: NCT02464150.
36281172	Diagnostic dilemma of celiac disease presenting with weight loss and secondary amenorrhea: A case report.	RATIONALE: Celiac disease (CD) is autoimmune enteropathy affecting the proximal small intestinal mucosa. It is caused by insensitivity to gluten, a protein predominantly presented in wheat. CD is classically associated with gastrointestinal symptoms. The non-classic clinical presentation of CD can present with other organ involvement. Non-human leukocyte antigens genes are associated with atypical forms. PATIENTS CONCERN: We reported a case of 30-year-old female who presented with progressive pallor, amenorrhea, and unexplained weight loss with generalized body weakness. Her body mass index was 20. The patient was having no other systemic manifestations. DIAGNOSIS: This paper reports a case of a female patient having CD without its typical features. Her laboratory evaluation revealed microcytic anemia. Anti-TTg IgA and Anti-TTG IgG antibodies were raised, ferritin and folate were low, and there was mild hyperbilirubinemia. However, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and serum estradiol levels were normal. She was diagnosed with a case of anemia resulting from malabsorption caused by CD. INTERVENTIONS: A management plan was devised based on a strict gluten-free diet. The patient received supplements containing folates, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamins A, D, E, B6, and B12. OUTCOMES: After 3 months of treatment with strict gluten-free diet patient showed remarkable improvement. Her hemoglobin level raised with weight gain. Her normal menstrual cycle was restored with complete resolution of symptoms at 1 year follow-up. LESSONS: The pathogenesis of the atypical CD is multifactorial, but impaired uptake of micronutrients from the duodenum is the most likely cause, even if other common features of classical forms, such as bloating and diarrhea, are absent. Lack of awareness about atypical forms may lead to under-diagnoses of the disease. The physicians should consider the atypical presentations of CD to avoid the under-diagnoses of this multisystem disorder.
29594339	Obesogenic habits among children and their families in response to initiation of gluten-free diet.	Initiation of a lifelong, gluten-free diet (GFD) in children with celiac disease (CD) influences the child's life in many ways. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of GFD on the child and his/her family's eating habits and lifestyle behaviors. To study this, we asked children and their parents completed the Family Eating and Activity Habits Questionnaire (FEAHQ) at the time of diagnosis of CD and at least 6 months after initiation of GFD and a questionnaires assessing symptoms related to CD and adherence to the GFD diet. We analyzed questionnaires from 40 children with CD and their families. There were 21 females, ranging in age from 4 to 15.7 years (median age 7.4 years+-2.8 years). The control group comprised 15 healthy children. After initiation of GFD the family ate more junk food including snacks and candies (p = 0.05), with the significant change reported by children and fathers (p = 0.001 and 0.03 respectively). All family members in the control group had significantly less snacks. Parents and children reported a significant increase in obesogenic eating styles, such as eating from the cooking pot and eating while doing other activities (mothers, p = 0.001; fathers, 0.02; and children, 0.02 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that initiation of GFD in children with CD leads to changes in eating habits and staple food eating that may lead to a more obesogenic environment. Care givers, pediatricians, gastroenterologists, and dieticians alike should be aware of these implications and educate families towards a healthier lifestyle and diet beyond the GFD itself. What's Known:   Gluten-free diet has been shown to affect various psychosocial aspects of children with celiac disease.   Obesity and celiac are associated. What is New:   Initiation of gluten-free diet led to increased eating of junk food both in the patient and his/her family.   After initiation of GFD pro-obesogenic eating habits is increased.
33705679	Celiac disease antibody levels reflect duodenal mucosal damage but not clinical symptoms.	OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate, in a real-world population, whether the histological and clinical phenotype differ at baseline and during follow-up in patients with high and low CD (celiac disease) antibody titers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study cohort consisted of 96 consecutive patients diagnosed to have CD during the years 2010-2018. The clinical parameters, symptoms and laboratory results were registered and histomorphometry was analyzed from the available duodenal biopsies taken during the primary and follow-up esophageal-gastricduodenoscopies. Patients having immunoglobulin A transglutaminase antibody (tTG-ab) levels above 70 U/mL were classified as high titer patients. RESULTS: Measured by the villous-crypt ratio, the duodenal mucosa was more severely damaged in the high tTG-ab group than in the low tTG-group at baseline (n = 70, 0.61 +- 0.63 vs. 1.02 +- 0.87, p = .003) and during the follow-up when the patients were on gluten-free diet (n = 27, 1.80 +- 0.72 vs. 2.35 +- 0.64, p = .041). Interestingly, the high tTG-ab group members had fewer gastrointestinal symptoms at baseline than those in the low tTG-ab group (43% vs. 68%, p = .013) but lower vitamin D levels (68 +- 34 nmol/L vs. 88 +- 29 nmol/L, p = .034) and more often microcytosis (28% vs. 10%, p = .040). During the follow-up, these differences were no longer detected. CONCLUSIONS: At baseline, CD patients with high tTG-ab have more severe duodenum injury and signs of malabsorption but fewer symptoms. After gluten-free diet has been initiated, the mucosal healing in the high tTG-ab group is prolonged, but symptoms and signs of malabsorption recover equally in both groups.
37273133	Transition of Care in Celiac Disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is a gluten related disorder which affects all age-groups and occurs in genetically susceptible population after introduction of gluten in diet. The worldwide prevalence of CD is ~1% and it is higher in certain "at-risk groups". The clinical features are variable, ranging from classical diarrhea to an asymptomatic state. Diagnosis requires serology and duodenal histology although a non-biopsy diagnosis is recommended by European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) for a select group of children. Treatment of CD is with a life-long strict gluten free diet (GFD) along with correction of nutritional deficiencies. Regular follow-up to assess compliance and efficacy of GFD is mandatory. Non-responsive CD needs evaluation by a specialist as it can be due to incorrect diagnosis, poor dietary compliance, coexisting conditions like small bowel bacterial overgrowth, pancreatic insufficiency etc. and lastly, refractory CD. Most patients diagnosed as CD in childhood receive no medical or dietary supervision after transition to adulthood and nearly a third are non-compliant to GFD. No requirement of medications, patient's perception of understanding GFD and absence of symptoms with intermittent non-compliance leads to neglect of care after transition. Poor dietary adherence leads to nutritional deficiencies, osteoporosis, fertility issues and risk of malignancy. It is mandatory that the patients know about CD, need of strict GFD, regular follow-up, disease complications, and are capable of communicating with the health-care personnel before transition. Formulating a phased transition care program with joint pediatric and adult clinics is required for a successful transition and improving the long-term outcome.
37364982	Persistent villous atrophy predicts development of complications and mortality in adult patients with coeliac disease: a multicentre longitudinal cohort study and development of a score to identify high-risk patients.	OBJECTIVE: Persistent villous atrophy (pVA) in coeliac disease (CD) despite a gluten-free diet (GFD) has unclear meaning. We aimed to (i) study the relationship between pVA and long-term outcomes and (ii) develop a score to identify patients at risk of pVA. DESIGN: This is a multicentre retrospective-prospective study consisting of a study cohort (cohort 1) and an external validation cohort (cohort 2) of patients with biopsy-proven CD diagnosed between 2000 and 2021. Cohort 1 was used to (i) compare long-term outcomes between patients with and without pVA (Marsh >=3a) at follow-up biopsy and (ii) to develop a score to evaluate the risk of pVA, which was validated in cohort 2. RESULTS: Of 2211 patients, 694 (31%) underwent follow-up duodenal biopsy and were included in the study cohort (491F, 44+-16 years). 157/694 (23%) had pVA. Risk of complications (HR 9.53, 95% CI 4.77 to 19.04, p<0.001) and mortality (HR 2.93, 95% CI 1.43 to 6.02, p<0.01) were increased in patients with pVA. A 5-point score was developed and externally validated (receiver operating characteristic area under the curve 0.78, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.89) to stratify patients by risk of pVA: low (0-1 points, 5% pVA), intermediate (2 points, 16% pVA) and high (3-5 points, 73% pVA). Predictors for pVA used in the score were age at diagnosis >=45 years (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.21 to 3.34, p<0.01), classical pattern of CD (OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.28 to 3.58, p<0.01), lack of clinical response to GFD (OR 2.40, 95% CI 1.43 to 4.01, p<0.001) and poor GFD adherence (OR 48.9, 95% CI 26.1 to 91.8, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Risk of complications and mortality were increased in patients with pVA. We developed a score to identify patients at risk of pVA and in need of histological reassessment and closer follow-up.
37257483	Endocrinological, immunological and metabolic features of patients with Fabry disease under therapy.	OBJECTIVES: Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal disorder caused by decreased or absent alpha galactosidase enzyme. The enzyme deficiency leads to progressive accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb-3) and its deacetylated form lyso-Gb3 in various tissue lysosomes that results in primarily lysosomal deterioration and subsequently mitochondrial, endothelial, and immunologic dysfunctions. METHODS: The endocrinological, metabolic, immunological and HLA status of 12 patients were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 11 patients (91.6 %) had immunologic and/or endocrinologic abnormalities. fT4, anti-TPO, and anti-TG levels were increased in 1, 2, and 2 patients, respectively. Three patients had elevated proinflammatory cytokines. ANA profile, p-ANCA and c-ANCA were positive in 1, 1, and 2 patients, respectively. Tissue transglutaminase antibody was negative in all patients however P5 was diagnosed with Celiac disease at the age of 12 and on gluten free diet. All patients had distinct types of HLA apart from 2 patients with anti-TG and anti-TPO positive and there was no relationship between the HLA types and the autoimmunity biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: FD may have impact on endocrinologic and immunologic abnormalities even in the patients under ERT, therefore prevalence of these abnormalities may be higher in ERT naive patients. However, apparently, they are less likely to cause clinical symptoms. Certain HLA alleles may contribute to the direct impact of immunological pathogenesis in FD by developing abnormal autoimmune biomarkers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating HLA status of FD patients; therefore further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanism of action.
35902684	Rotavirus vaccination is not associated with incident celiac disease or autoimmune thyroid disease in a national cohort of privately insured children.	Rotavirus infection is a potential trigger for autoimmune diseases, and previous reports note associations between rotavirus vaccination and type 1 diabetes. In this report, we examine the association between rotavirus vaccination and autoimmune diseases associated with type 1 diabetes: celiac disease and autoimmune thyroiditis. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using de-identified claims data (Optum Clinformatics  Data Mart). Eligible infants were born between 2001 and 2018 and continuously enrolled from birth for at least 365 days (n = 2,109,225). Twenty-nine percent (n = 613,295) of infants were born prior to the introduction of rotavirus vaccine in 2006; 32% (n = 684,214) were eligible for the vaccine but were not vaccinated; 9.6% (n = 202,016) received partial vaccination, and 28.9% received full vaccination (n = 609,700). There were 1379 cases of celiac disease and 1000 cases of autoimmune thyroiditis. Children who were born prior to the introduction of rotavirus vaccine in 2006 had lower risk of celiac disease compared to unvaccinated children born after 2006 (hazard ratio [HR] 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59, 0.85). However, children who were partially vaccinated (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.73, 1.11) or fully vaccinated (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.88, 1.21) had similar risk to eligible, unvaccinated children. Risk of autoimmune thyroiditis was similar by vaccination status. We conclude that rotavirus vaccination is not associated with increased or decreased risk for celiac disease or autoimmune thyroiditis.
29787419	A locus at 7p14.3 predisposes to refractory celiac disease progression from celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: Approximately 5% of patients with celiac disease (CeD) do not respond to a gluten-free diet and progress to refractory celiac disease (RCD), a severe progression that is characterized by infiltration of intraepithelial T lymphocytes. Patients with RCD type II (RCDII) show clonal expansions of intraepithelial T lymphocytes that result in a poor prognosis and a high mortality rate through development of aggressive enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma. It is not known whether genetic variations play a role in severe progression of CeD to RCDII. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed the first genome-wide association study to identify the causal genes for RCDII and the molecular pathways perturbed in RCDII. The genome-wide association study was performed in 38 Dutch patients with RCDII, and the 15 independent top-associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants (P<5x10) were replicated in 56 independent French and Dutch patients with RCDII. RESULTS: After replication, SNP rs2041570 on chromosome 7 was significantly associated with progression to RCDII (P=2.37x10, odds ratio=2.36) but not with CeD susceptibility. SNP rs2041570 risk allele A was associated with lower levels of FAM188B expression in blood and small intestinal biopsies. Stratification of RCDII biopsies based on rs2041570 genotype showed differential expression of innate immune and antibacterial genes that are expressed in Paneth cells. CONCLUSION: We have identified a novel SNP associated with the severe progression of CeD to RCDII. Our data suggest that genetic susceptibility to CeD might be distinct from the progression to RCDII and suggest a role for Paneth cells in RCDII progression.
31706435	Turner syndrome and osteoporosis.	Turner syndrome is one of the most common sex chromosomal anomalies, characterized by the complete or partial loss of one X chromosome. Females with Turner syndrome are characterized by skeletal abnormalities, short stature and primary ovarian insufficiency. The aim of this narrative review was to identify the underlying mechanisms of osteoporosis in Turner syndrome, summarize its clinical manifestations and provide suggestions regarding the management of osteoporosis. Girls and women with Turner syndrome have lower bone mineral density and a higher fracture rate than healthy individuals. The most important risk factors for osteoporosis are inadequately treated primary ovarian insufficiency, followed by intrinsic bone abnormalities. Comorbidities that further increase the risk of osteoporosis include vitamin D deficiency, celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease. In addition, hearing problems can predispose to falls. Early initiation of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) at the age of 11-13 years, prompt titration to the adult dose after 2 years and long-term follow-up to ensure compliance with HRT are the cornerstones of osteoporosis prevention in women with Turner syndrome.
32133597	Oats as a Safe Alternative to Triticeae Cereals for People Suffering from Celiac Disease? A Review.	Oats represent a promising alternative to small-grain cereals from Triticeae group (wheat, barley, rye) for persons suffering from any form of gluten intolerance, especially celiac disease (CD), since oat-specific prolamins avenins reveal generally lower gluten content and immunoreactivity. Recent studies on avenin molecular structure revealed large genetic variability in avenin sequences affecting the spectrum of gluten peptides produced by hydrolases in human digestive tract. The aim of the present review is to summarise recent knowledge obtained in laboratory studies focused on the effect of avenin-derived peptides on reactivity of crucial components of human immune system such as dendritic cells (DC) and T-cells. The other part of the review summarises the results of clinical studies with CD patients including oat products in their diet. Since different clinical studies revealed contradictory results regarding potential safety of oats for CD patients, the focus has to be directed at genetic variability in oat avenins. Identification of avenin isoforms with minimum CD immunoreactivity will open up ways leading to designing novel oat cultivars suitable for CD patients. Knowledge on immunoreactivity of gluten peptides together with breeding new oat cultivars revealing minimum avenin immunoreactivity with respect to CD as well as application of food processing technologies leading to gluten content reduction should result in development of gluten-free oats safe for celiacs.
32418261	Gluten-free diet impact on dynamics of pancreatic islet-specific autoimmunity detected at celiac disease diagnosis.	OBJECTIVE: Almost 6% of celiac disease (CD) patients at diagnosis are positive for at least one of the main pancreatic islet autoantibodies that characterize type 1 diabetes (T1D). Few information, dated back to almost two decades ago, exist as to whether a gluten-free diet (GFD) could reduce the islet-specific autoimmunity detected in patients at CD diagnosis. Aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of GFD on 31 patients who presented islet-specific autoimmunity at CD diagnosis. METHODS: CD patient sera collected at diagnosis and throughout the GFD were analyzed for the main humoral autoantibodies so far identified in T1D, directed against one or more among insulin, glutamic-acid decarboxylase, tyrosine-phosphatase 2, and zinc cation-efflux transporter autoantigens. RESULTS: GFD (median duration 39 months) was associated to a decrease or disappearance of the islet-specific autoantibodies in 71% of CD patients. Almost 80% of the patients who became autoantibody-negative during the GFD were positive for only one of the islet-specific autoimmune markers at CD diagnosis, with none of them developing diabetes. Conversely, 80% of the CD patients positive at diagnosis for >=2 islet-specific autoantibodies were still positive after more than two years of GFD, with 25% of them developing T1D. CONCLUSIONS: Various factors appear to influence, individually or in combination, the effects of the GFD on pancreatic islet-specific autoimmune response detected at CD diagnosis. These factors include the number of diabetes autoantibodies found at CD diagnosis, the adherence to the GFD, its duration and an asymptomatic clinical presentation of CD.
33327648	Prototype Gluten-Free Breads from Processed Durum Wheat: Use of Monovarietal Flours and Implications for Gluten Detoxification Strategies.	In this investigation, we reported the production of prototype breads from the processed flours of three specific Triticum turgidum wheat genotypes that were selected in our previous investigation for their potential low toxic/immunogenic activity for celiac disease (CD) patients. The flours were subjected to sourdough fermentation with a mixture of selected Lactobacillus strains, and in presence of fungal endoproteases. The breads were characterized by R5 competitive enzyme linked immunosorbent assay in order to quantify the residual gluten, and the differential efficacy in gluten degradation was assessed. In particular, two of them were classified as gluten-free (<20 ppm) and very low-gluten content (<100 ppm) breads, respectively, whereas the third monovarietal prototype retained a gluten content that was well above the safety threshold prescribed for direct consumption by CD patients. In order to investigate such a genotype-dependent efficiency of the detoxification method applied, an advanced proteomic characterization by high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry was performed. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first proteomic investigation which benefitted, for protein identification, from the full sequencing of the Triticum turgidum ssp. durum genome. The differences of the proteins' primary structures affecting their susceptibility to hydrolysis were investigated. As a confirmation of the previous immunoassay-based results, two out of the three breads made with the processed flours presented an exhaustive degradation of the epitopic sequences that are relevant for CD immune stimulatory activity. The list of the detected epitopes was analyzed and critically discussed in light of their susceptibility to the detoxification strategy applied. Finally, in-vitro experiments of human gastroduodenal digestion were carried out in order to assess, in-silico, the toxicity risk of the prototype breads under investigation for direct consumption by CD patients. This approach allowed us to confirm the total degradation of the epitopic sequences upon gastro-duodenal digestion.
35745182	Adherence to Gluten-Free Diet Restores Alpha Diversity in Celiac People but the Microbiome Composition Is Different to Healthy People.	Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease with the destruction of small intestinal villi, which occurs in genetically predisposed individuals. At the present moment, a gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only way to restore the functionality of gut mucosa. However, there is an open debate on the effects of long-term supplementation through a GFD, because some authors report an unbalance in microbial taxa composition. METHODS: For microbiome analysis, fecal specimens were collected from 46 CD individuals in GFD for at least 2 years and 30 specimens from the healthy controls (HC). Data were analyzed using an ensemble of software packages: QIIME2, Coda-lasso, Clr-lasso, Selbal, PICRUSt2, ALDEx2, dissimilarity-overlap analysis, and dysbiosis detection tests. RESULTS: The adherence to GFD restored the alpha biodiversity of the gut microbiota in celiac people but microbial composition at beta diversity resulted as different to HC. The microbial composition of the CD subjects was decreased in a number of taxa, namely Bifidobacterium longum and several belonging to Lachnospiraceae family, whereas Bacteroides genus was found to be more abundant. Predicted metabolic pathways among the CD bacterial communities revealed an important role in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis. CONCLUSIONS: CD patients in GFD had a non-dysbiotic microbial composition for the crude alpha diversity metrics. We found significant differences in beta diversity, in certain taxon, and pathways between subjects with inactive CD in GFD and controls. Collectively, our data may suggest the development of new GFD products by modulating the gut microbiota through diet, supplements of vitamins, and the addition of specific prebiotics.
31898646	Health related quality of life among Saudi children and adolescents with celiac disease.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by gluten ingestion in genetically susceptible individuals. This study reports on the quality of life (QOL) of Saudi children and adolescents with CD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a case control study that included Saudi patients with CD, aged 9-18 years, who attended CD Clinic at KAU between February 2017 and July 2018. The study was conducted using the Short-Form (SF-36) questionnaire for all candidates, CD-specific QOL questionnaire for the CD patients group, and CD screen questionnaire for the control group. RESULTS: Overall, 354 subjects were studied (111 CD patients and 243 control). Female subjects constituted 56.8% of both patient and control groups. In the generic SF-36 questionnaire, QOL was comparable between patients and controls in all domains except for the general health domain, which showed difference in favor of the controls (55.01 +- 26.41 and 62.96 +- 18.16, P = 0.005). We also found that males have lower QOL scores in the domains comprising health change (P = 0.02), physical functioning (P = 0.04, role functioning/emotional and emotional well-being (P = 0.049). The CD-specific QOL showed excellent and good scores for 79.3% of patients overall in the tested domains. Patients with poor adherence showed poor QOL in all generic (SF-36) domains but not in CD-specific domains. CONCLUSION: The HRQOL for Saudi CD children on GFD is generally comparable to the healthy control with exception of the general health domain. Adherence to the GFD improves the generic (SF-36) QOL domains.
32453819	Osteoporosis in Premenopausal Women: A Clinical Narrative Review by the ECTS and the IOF.	CONTEXT: Consensus regarding diagnosis and management of osteoporosis in premenopausal women (PW) is still lacking due to few studies carried out in this population. DESIGN: The European Calcified Tissue Society and the International Osteoporosis Foundation convened a working group to produce an updated review of literature published after 2017 on this topic. RESULTS: Fragility fractures in PW are rare and mostly due to secondary osteoporosis (ie, in presence of an underlying disease such as hormonal, inflammatory, or digestive disorders). In absence of another disorder, low bone mineral density (BMD) together with fragility fractures qualifies as idiopathic osteoporosis. In contrast, low BMD alone does not necessarily represent osteoporosis in absence of bone microarchitectural abnormalities. BMD increases in PW with osteoporosis when the underlying disease is treated. For example, in celiac disease, an increase of 9% in radius trabecular volumetric density was achieved after 1 year of gluten-free diet, while anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha improved BMD in PW with inflammatory bowel diseases. In amenorrhea, including anorexia nervosa, appropriately delivered estrogen replacement therapy can also improve BMD. Alternatively, antiresorptive or anabolic therapy has been shown to improve BMD in a variety of conditions, the range of improvement (3%-16%) depending on skeletal site and the nature of the secondary cause. No studies were powered to demonstrate fracture reduction. The effects of bisphosphonates in childbearing women have been scantly studied and caution is needed. CONCLUSION: The majority of PW with osteoporosis have an underlying disease. Specific therapy of these diseases, as well as antiresorptive and anabolic drugs, improve BMD, but without evidence of fracture reduction.
31603739	A case of celiac disease with type I enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma in a Japanese male patient.	A 45-year-old Japanese male patient who was diagnosed with celiac disease (CeD) developed type I enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL). In 2013, the patient was admitted to our hospital with worsening of diarrhea and weight loss. Pathological examination of biopsy specimens from the duodenum and ileum led to a diagnosis of suspected EATL. A previous total colonoscopy (TCS) indicated villous atrophy in the terminal ileum. The patient was changed to a gluten-free diet, and the nutritional status gradually improved. In September 2014, he experienced acute right lower abdominal pain. He underwent urgent surgery, and a perforation was identified in the ileum. A diagnosis of type I EATL was made following histopathological examination. After eight courses of CHOP therapy, the patient entered complete remission. TCS and esophagogastroduodenoscopy with magnifying narrow-band imaging performed in 2015 identified villous regrowth in the distal ileum and duodenum. Capsule endoscopy also found villous regrowth in the entire small intestine. To our knowledge, this is the first case of type I EATL following CeD with villous atrophy before EATL occurrence in a Japanese HLA-DQ2 carrier. The possibility of type I EATL occurring after CeD should be recognized, although CeD is quite rare in Japan.
37024737	Maladaptive Food Attitudes and Behaviors in Individuals with Celiac Disease and Their Association with Quality of Life.	BACKGROUND: The only treatment for celiac disease (CeD) is strict lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). In some individuals the demands of a GFD may contribute to maladaptive eating attitudes and behaviors that impair quality of life (QOL). The Celiac Disease Food Attitudes and Behaviors (CD-FAB) is an easily administered and scored 11-item tool querying potentially maladaptive food attitudes and behaviors resulting from beliefs around gluten exposures and food safety. OBJECTIVES: To assess the usefulness of the CD-FAB in establishing the presence of maladaptive food attitudes and behaviors among adults with CeD and to explore the relationship between these attitudes and behaviors and other factors including QOL, anxiety, depression, CeD symptoms and personality traits. METHODS: The study is a cross-sectional pilot of 50 adults (mean age 29.6 years) with biopsy-proven CeD who followed a GFD for at least one year and had no self-reported eating disorder diagnosis. High scores on the CD-FAB tool suggest higher disordered eating attitudes and beliefs. RESULTS: Compared to lower scores (mean 20.2), higher (worse) CD-FAB scores (mean 54.5) were positively associated with recency of diagnosis, number of CeD-related gastrointestinal symptoms, and the personality trait of neuroticism. Higher CD-FAB scores were statistically and clinically significantly associated with diminished QOL (p < 0.001). The relationship with anxiety and depression was less clear but trended in the expected direction. CONCLUSION: The CD-FAB may be a useful tool for dietitians who wish to monitor maladaptive food attitudes and behaviors among their CeD patients, especially in the first-year post-diagnosis.
35921776	Celiac disease: New therapies on the horizon.	Celiac Disease (CeD) is a chronic intestinal disease which occurs in 0.7-1.4% of the global population. Since the discovery of gluten as its disease-inducing antigen, CeD patients are treated with a gluten-free diet which is effective but has limitations for certain groups of patients. Accordingly, over the past few years, there is a growing interest in alternative treatment options. This review summarizes emerging pharmacological approaches, including tolerance induction strategies, tissue transglutaminase inhibition, gluten degradation, and inhibition of interleukin (IL)-15.
29710789	Daily Intake of Milk Powder and Risk of Celiac Disease in Early Childhood: A Nested Case-Control Study.	Milk powder and gluten are common components in Swedish infants' diets. Whereas large intakes of gluten early in life increases the risk of celiac disease in genetically at-risk Swedish children, no study has yet evaluated if intake of milk powder by 2 years of age is associated with celiac disease. A 1-to-3 nested case-control study, comprised of 207 celiac disease children and 621 controls matched for sex, birth year, and HLA genotype, was performed on a birth cohort of HLA-DR3-DQ2 and/or DR4-DQ8-positive children. Subjects were screened annually for celiac disease using tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies (tTGA). Three-day food records estimated the mean intake of milk powder at ages 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months. Conditional logistic regression calculated odds ratios (OR) at last intake prior to seroconversion of tTGA positivity, and for each time-point respectively and adjusted for having a first-degree relative with celiac disease and gluten intake. Intake of milk powder prior to seroconversion of tTGA positivity was not associated with celiac disease (OR = 1.00; 95% CI = 0.99, 1.03; p = 0.763). In conclusion, intake of milk powder in early childhood is not associated with celiac disease in genetically susceptible children.
36730234	Gluten-free diet adherence in children with screening-detected celiac disease using a prospective birth cohort study.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease has an increasing incidence worldwide and is treated with lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet. We aimed to describe gluten-free diet adherence rates in children with screening-identified celiac disease, determine adherence-related factors, and compare adherence to food records in a multinational prospective birth cohort study. METHODS: Children in The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young study with celiac disease were included. Subjects had at least annual measurement of adherence (parent-report) and completed 3-day food records. Descriptive statistics, t-tests, Kruskal-Wallis tests and multivariable logistic and linear regression were employed. RESULTS: Two hundred ninety (73%) and 199 (67%) of subjects were always adherent to a gluten-free diet at 2 and 5 years post celiac disease diagnosis respectively. The percentage of children with variable adherence increased from 1% at 2 years to 15% at 5 years. Children with a first-degree relative with celiac disease were more likely to be adherent to the gluten-free diet. Gluten intake on food records could not differentiate adherent from nonadherent subjects. Adherent children from the United States had more gluten intake based on food records than European children (P < .001 and P = .007 at 2 and 5 years respectively). CONCLUSION: Approximately three-quarters of children with screening-identified celiac disease remain strictly adherent to a gluten-free diet over time. There are no identifiable features associated with adherence aside from having a first-degree relative with celiac disease. Despite good parent-reported adherence, children from the United States have more gluten intake when assessed by food records. Studies on markers of gluten-free diet adherence, sources of gluten exposure (particularly in the United States), and effects of adherence on mucosal healing are needed.
36094456	Gluten-free grains: Importance, processing and its effect on quality of gluten-free products.	Gluten-enteropathy affects a significant number of people, making gluten a major concern in the food industry. With medical advancements, the diagnosis of allergies is becoming easier, and people who are allergic to gluten are recommended a complete gluten-free diet. Since wheat provides a major part of the energy and nutrition in the diet, its elimination affects nutrition intake of allergic population. Food scientists are working to formulate products using protein-rich gluten-free grains with quality attributes at par with gluten-containing products. Focused research has been done to provide nutrition and a variety of food to people suffering from gluten-related disorders. Efforts are being made to remove the gluten from the wheat and other gluten-containing grains, while applying different processing/treatments to enhance the properties of gluten-free grains. Hence, the present review summarizes the importance, processing, and products of different gluten-free grains. It also highlights the digestibility of gluten-free grains with clinical trials and gluten elimination strategies for gluten-containing grains.
35820710	Burden of persistent symptoms in treated coeliac disease: cause, aftermath or merely association?	
33218785	Non-classical clinical presentation at diagnosis by male celiac disease patients of older age.	BACKGROUND: . In a biopsy-proven adult celiac disease (CeD) cohort from the Netherlands, male patients were diagnosed with CeD at significantly older ages than female patients. OBJECTIVES: To identify which factors contribute to diagnosis later in life and whether diagnostic delay influences improvement of symptoms after starting a gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: . We performed a questionnaire study in 211 CeD patients (67:144, male:female) with median age at diagnosis of 41.8 years (interquartile range: 25-58) and at least Marsh 2 histology. RESULTS: . Classical symptoms (diarrhea, fatigue, abdominal pain and/or weight loss) were more frequent in women than men, but sex was not significantly associated with age at diagnosis. In a multivariate analysis, a non-classical presentation (without any classical symptoms) and a negative family history of CeD were significant predictors of older age at diagnosis (coefficients of 8 and 12 years, respectively). A delay of >3 years between first symptom and diagnosis was associated with slower improvement of symptoms after start of GFD, but not with sex, presentation of classical symptoms or age at diagnosis. CONCLUSION: . Non-classical CeD presentation is more prevalent in men and is associated with a diagnosis of CeD later in life. Recognizing CeD sooner after onset of symptoms is important because a long diagnostic delay is associated with a slower improvement of symptoms after starting a GFD.
31810336	Gluten Detection Methods and Their Critical Role in Assuring Safe Diets for Celiac Patients.	Celiac disease, wheat sensitivity, and allergy represent three different reactions, which may occur in genetically predisposed individuals on the ingestion of wheat and derived products with various manifestations. Improvements in the disease diagnostics and understanding of disease etiology unveiled that these disorders are widespread around the globe affecting about 7% of the population. The only known treatment so far is a life-long gluten-free diet, which is almost impossible to follow because of the contamination of allegedly "gluten-free" products. Accidental contamination of inherently gluten-free products could take place at any level from field to shelf because of the ubiquity of these proteins/grains. Gluten contamination of allegedly "gluten-free" products is a constant threat to celiac patients and a major health concern. Several detection procedures have been proposed to determine the level of contamination in products for celiac patients. The present article aims to review the advantages and disadvantages of different gluten detection methods, with emphasis on the recent technology that allows identification of the immunogenic-gluten peptides without the use of antibodies. The possibility to detect gluten contamination by different approaches with similar or better detection efficiency in different raw and processed foods will guarantee the safety of the foods for celiac patients.
30711208	Nonceliac Wheat Sensitivity: An Immune-Mediated Condition with Systemic Manifestations.	Non-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCWS) is characterized by gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms following the ingestion of gluten-containing cereals in subjects without celiac disease or wheat allergy. The identity of the molecular triggers in these cereals responsible for the symptoms of NCWS remains to be delineated. Recent research has identified a biological basis for the condition, with the observation of systemic immune activation in response to microbial translocation that appears to be linked to intestinal barrier defects. Ongoing research efforts are aimed at further characterizing the etiology, mechanism, and biomarkers of the condition.
34227075	COVID-19 in celiac disease: a multicentric retrospective cohort study.	OBJECTIVE: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder, characterized by increased susceptibility to bacterial and viral infections. Therefore, the CD patients could be exposed to an increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2, a virus for which the WHO declared a pandemic status in March 2020. This study aims to investigate the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in CD patients, to assess the impact of CD on the risk of contracting this virus. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective multicentric cohort study evaluated 542 celiac patients, who answered a questionnaire concerning both the underlying disease (adherence to the gluten-free diet, residual symptoms) and the possible SARS-CoV-2 infection (swab outcome, presence and characteristics of symptoms and type of treatment received), referring to the period between 20th January 2020 and 27th October 2020. RESULTS: Five patients (0.92%) tested positive; of these, 2 were asymptomatic and 3 developed symptoms of COVID-19. The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in CD patients was not significantly different from the general population. The ratio of positive/diagnostic swabs tends to be higher in CD patients than in the general population (IR: 0.15; 0.06; p=0.06), whereas the number of subjects who performed the swab in this group is significantly lower (IR: 0.06; 0.15; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Although CD patients are more susceptible to infections, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in our sample was not significantly different from the general population. However, the positive/diagnostic swabs ratio seems to be higher, probably also due to the lower number of patients tested.
34524598	Long-Term Adherence to a Gluten-Free Diet and Quality of Life of Celiac Patients After Transition to an Adult Referral Center.	BACKGROUND: Modalities for the transition to adult care of celiac patients diagnosed during childhood/adolescence and their impact on long-term adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD-A), quality of life (QOL) and maintenance of follow-up in adulthood are unknown. AIMS: To evaluate whether timing of transition affects long-term GFD-A, QOL, and continuity of follow-up in adulthood and to identify predictors of long-term GFD-A. METHODS: Clinical and demographic data about pediatric care and adult follow-up at our center were retrospectively collected from clinical notes of celiac patients diagnosed during childhood/adolescence and then referred to our tertiary center. QOL and adult long-term GFD-A were prospectively evaluated with validated questionnaires. These parameters were studied by means of univariate and multivariate statistical analysis. RESULTS: 183 patients (130F, mean age at diagnosis 7.6 +- 5.8 years) were enrolled. Median age at transition to adult care was 20 years (IQR 17-25). There was no relationship between age at transition to adult care, long-term GFD-A, QOL, and continuity of follow-up. GFD-A tended to improve overall from pediatric care to adult referral (OR 2.92, 95% CI 1.13-7.87, p = 0.02) and also throughout adult follow-up (OR 9.0, 95% CI 4.2-19.7, p < 0.01). On multivariable logistic regression analysis, classical symptoms at diagnosis of celiac disease (p = 0.02) and good GFD-A at adult referral (p < 0.01) predicted good long-term GFD-A, while being lost to follow-up predicted poorer long-term GFD-A (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical characteristics can guide development of personalized strategies for implementing long-term GFD-A and ensure maintenance of regular follow-up in celiac patients diagnosed in childhood/adolescence and transitioning to adult care.
30671907	Exit Gluten-Free and Enter Low FODMAPs: A Novel Dietary Strategy to Reduce Gastrointestinal Symptoms in Athletes.	Exercise-associated physiological disturbances alter gastrointestinal function and integrity. These alterations may increase susceptibility to dietary triggers, namely gluten and a family of short-chain carbohydrates known as FODMAPs (fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols). A recent surge in the popularity of gluten-free diets (GFDs) among athletes without celiac disease has been exacerbated by unsubstantiated commercial health claims and high-profile athletes citing this diet to be the secret to their success. Up to 41% of athletes at least partially adhere to a GFD diet, with the belief that gluten avoidance improves exercise performance and parameters influencing performance, particularly gastrointestinal symptoms (GIS). In contrast to these beliefs, seminal work investigating the effects of a GFD in athletes without celiac disease has demonstrated no beneficial effect of a GFD versus a gluten-containing diet on performance, gastrointestinal health, inflammation, or perceptual wellbeing. Interestingly, the subsequent reduction in FODMAPs concurrent with the elimination of gluten-containing grains may actually be the factors affecting GIS improvement, not gluten. Pre-existent in the gastrointestinal tract or ingested during exercise, the osmotic and gas-producing effects of variably absorbed FODMAPs may trigger or increase the magnitude of exercise-associated GIS. Research using FODMAP reduction to address gastrointestinal issues in clinically healthy athletes is emerging as a promising strategy to reduce exercise-associated GIS. Applied research and practitioners merging clinical and sports nutrition methods will be essential for the effective use of a low FODMAP approach to tackle the multifactorial nature of gastrointestinal disturbances in athletes.
34960101	Oral Consumption of Bread from an RNAi Wheat Line with Strongly Silenced Gliadins Elicits No Immunogenic Response in a Pilot Study with Celiac Disease Patients.	Celiac disease (CD) is a genetically predisposed, T cell-mediated and autoimmune-like disorder caused by dietary exposure to the storage proteins of wheat and related cereals. A gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only treatment available for CD. The celiac immune response mediated by CD4+ T-cells can be assessed with a short-term oral gluten challenge. This study aimed to determine whether the consumption of bread made using flour from a low-gluten RNAi wheat line (named E82) can activate the immune response in DQ2.5-positive patients with CD after a blind crossover challenge. The experimental protocol included assessing IFN-gamma production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), evaluating gastrointestinal symptoms, and measuring gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) in stool samples. The response of PBMCs was not significant to gliadin and the 33-mer peptide after E82 bread consumption. In contrast, PBMCs reacted significantly to Standard bread. This lack of immune response is correlated with the fact that, after E82 bread consumption, stool samples from patients with CD showed very low levels of GIP, and the symptoms were comparable to those of the GFD. This pilot study provides evidence that bread from RNAi E82 flour does not elicit an immune response after a short-term oral challenge and could help manage GFD in patients with CD.
37608439	A Clinician's Guide to Gluten Challenge.	Gluten challenge is an essential clinical tool that involves reintroducing or increasing the amount of gluten in the diet to facilitate diagnostic testing in celiac disease (CD). Nevertheless, there is no consensus regarding the applications of gluten timing, dosing, and duration in children. This review aims to summarize the current evidence, discuss practical considerations, and proposes a clinical algorithm to help guide testing in pediatric patients. Childhood development, social circumstances and long-term health concerns must be considered when identifying a candidate for gluten challenge. Based on previous studies, the authors suggest baseline serology followed by a minimum of 3-6 grams of gluten per day for over 12 weeks to optimize diagnostic accuracy for evaluation of CD. A formal provider check-in at 4-6 weeks is essential so the provider and family can adjust dosing or duration as needed. Increasing the dose of gluten further may improve diagnostic yield if tolerated, although in select cases a lower dose and shorter course (6-12 weeks) may be sufficient. There is consensus that mild elevations in celiac serology (<10 times the upper limit of normal) or symptoms, while supportive are not diagnostic for CD. Current North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition guidelines recommend histologic findings of intraepithelial lymphocytosis, crypt hyperplasia, and villous atrophy as the accurate and most appropriate endpoint for gluten challenge.
36602836	American College of Gastroenterology Guidelines Update: Diagnosis and Management of Celiac Disease.	This guideline presents an update to the 2013 American College of Gastroenterology Guideline on the Diagnosis and Management of Celiac Disease with updated recommendations for the evaluation and management of patients with celiac disease (CD). CD is defined as a permanent immune-mediated response to gluten present in wheat, barley, and rye. CD has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations that resemble a multisystemic disorder rather than an isolated intestinal disease, and is characterized by small bowel injury and the presence of specific antibodies. Detection of CD-specific antibodies (e.g., tissue transglutaminase) in the serum is very helpful for the initial screening of patients with suspicion of CD. Intestinal biopsy is required in most patients to confirm the diagnosis. A nonbiopsy strategy for the diagnosis of CD in selected children is suggested and discussed in detail. Current treatment for CD requires strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) and lifelong medical follow-up. Most patients have excellent clinical response to a GFD. Nonresponsive CD is defined by persistent or recurrent symptoms despite being on a GFD. These patients require a systematic workup to rule out specific conditions that may cause persistent or recurrent symptoms, especially unintentional gluten contamination. Refractory CD is a rare cause of nonresponsive CD often associated with poor prognosis.
34067622	Iron Deficiency Anemia in Celiac Disease.	The iron absorption process developsmainly in the proximal duodenum. This portion of the intestine is typically destroyed in celiac disease (CD), resulting in a reduction in absorption of iron and subsequent iron deficiency anemia (IDA). In fact, the most frequent extra-intestinal manifestation (EIM) of CD is IDA, with a prevalence between 12 and 82% (in relation with the various reports) in patients with new CD diagnosis. The primary treatment of CD is the gluten-free diet (GFD), which is associated with adequate management of IDA, if present. Iron replacement treatment historically has been based on oral products containing ferrous sulphate (FS). However, the absorption of FS is limited in patients with active CD and unpredictable in patients on a GFD. Furthermore, a poor tolerability of this kind of ferrous is particularly frequent in patients with CD or with other inflammatory bowel diseases. Normalization from anemic state typically occurs after at least 6 months of GFD, but the process can take up to 2 years for iron stores to replenish.
29701659	The Effect of Depressive Symptoms on the Association between Gluten-Free Diet Adherence and Symptoms in Celiac Disease: Analysis of a Patient Powered Research Network.	BACKGROUND: The prevalence of depression in celiac disease (CD) is high, and patients are often burdened socially and financially by a gluten-free diet. However, the relationship between depression, somatic symptoms and dietary adherence in CD is complex and poorly understood. We used a patient powered research network (iCureCeliac ) to explore the effect that depression has on patients' symptomatic response to a gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: We identified patients with biopsy-diagnosed celiac disease who answered questions pertaining to symptoms (Celiac Symptom Index (CSI)), GFD adherence (Celiac Dietary Adherence Test (CDAT)), and a 5-point, scaled question regarding depressive symptoms relating to patients' celiac disease. We then measured the correlation between symptoms and adherence (CSI vs. CDAT) in patients with depression versus those without depression. We also tested for interaction of depression with regard to the association with symptoms using a multiple linear regression model. RESULTS: Among 519 patients, 86% were female and the mean age was 40.9 years. 46% of patients indicated that they felt "somewhat," "quite a bit," or "very much" depressed because of their disorder. There was a moderate correlation between worsened celiac symptoms and poorer GFD adherence (r = 0.6, p < 0.0001). In those with a positive depression screen, there was a moderate correlation between worsening symptoms and worsening dietary adherence (r = 0.5, p < 0.0001) whereas in those without depression, the correlation was stronger (r = 0.64, p < 0.0001). We performed a linear regression analysis, which suggests that the relationship between CSI and CDAT is modified by depression. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with depressive symptoms related to their disorder, correlation between adherence and symptoms was weaker than those without depressive symptoms. This finding was confirmed with a linear regression analysis, showing that depressive symptoms may modify the effect of a GFD on celiac symptoms. Depressive symptoms may therefore mask the relationship between inadvertent gluten exposure and symptoms. Additional longitudinal and prospective studies are needed to further explore this potentially important finding.
32651744	Safety of a GFD in Pregnant Women Without Celiac Disease: Investigating Ingrained Habits.	
32708019	Persistent Iron Deficiency Anemia in Patients with Celiac Disease Despite a Gluten-Free Diet.	Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by intolerance to dietary gluten in genetically predisposed subjects. Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a common sign in CD, being the only abnormality in approximately 40% of celiac patients. A multifactorial etiology leads to IDA in CD. The two main causes are the villous atrophy of the mucosa at the site of iron absorption (the duodenum) and the resulting inflammation, which triggers the mechanism that leads to the anemia of chronic disease. Until now, it has been unclear why some patients with CD continue to have IDA despite a careful gluten-free diet (GFD) and the normalization of villous atrophy. Furthermore, some celiac patients are refractory to oral iron supplementation despite the healing of the mucosa, and they thus require periodic intravenous iron administration. The Marsh classification evaluates the degree of inflammation and villous atrophy, but it does not assess the possible persistence of ultrastructural and molecular alterations in enterocytes. The latter was found in CD in remission after adopting a GFD and could be responsible for the persistently reduced absorption of iron and IDA. Even in non-celiac gluten sensitivity, anemia is present in 18.5-22% of patients and appears to be related to ultrastructural and molecular alterations in intestinal microvilli. It is possible that a genetic component may also play a role in IDA. In this review, we evaluate and discuss the main mechanisms of IDA in CD and the possible causes of its persistence after adopting a GFD, as well as their therapeutic implications.

36401140	High Prevalence of Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders in Celiac Patients with Persistent Symptoms on a Gluten-Free Diet: A 20-Year Follow-Up Study.	BACKGROUND: Ongoing symptoms in treated celiac disease (CD) are frequent and are commonly thought of as being due to infractions to a gluten-free diet (GFD) or complications. AIMS: To study the etiology and natural history of clinically relevant events (CREs) throughout follow-up and identify predictors thereof to guide follow-up. METHODS: CREs (symptoms/signs requiring diagnostic/therapeutic interventions) occurring in celiac patients between January-2000 and May-2021 were retrospectively collected between June and September 2021 and analysed. RESULTS: One-hundred-and-eighty-nine adult patients (133 F, age at diagnosis 36 +- 13 years, median follow-up 103 months, IQR 54-156) were enrolled. CREs were very common (88/189, 47%), but hardly due to poor GFD adherence (4%) or complications (2%). Interestingly, leading etiologies were functional gastrointestinal disorders (30%), reflux disease (18%) and micronutrient deficiencies (10%). Age at diagnosis >= 45 years (HR 1.68, 95%CI 1.05-2.69, p = 0.03) and classical pattern of CD (HR 1.63, 95%CI 1.04-2.54, p = 0.03) were predictors of CREs on a multivariable Cox model. At 5 years, 46% of classical patients >= 45 years old at diagnosis were event-free, while this was 62% for non-classical/silent >= 45 years, 60% for classical < 45 years, and 80% for non-classical/silent < 45 years. CONCLUSIONS: CREs occurred in almost half of CD patients during follow-up, with functional disorders being very common. New follow-up strategies for adult CD may be developed based on age and clinical pattern at diagnosis.
33432477	Dermatitis Herpetiformis: An Update on Diagnosis and Management.	Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), presenting with an intense itch and blistering symmetrical rash, typically on the elbows, knees, and buttocks, is a cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease. Though overt gastrointestinal symptoms are rare, three-fourths of patients with DH have villous atrophy in the small bowel, and the rest have celiac-type inflammatory changes. DH affects mostly adults and slightly more males than females. The mean age at onset is about 50 years. DH diagnosis is confirmed by showing granular immunoglobulin A deposits in the papillary dermis. The DH autoantigen, transglutaminase 3, is deposited at the same site in tightly bound immune complexes. At present, the DH-to-celiac disease prevalence is 1:8. The incidence of DH is decreasing, whereas that of celiac disease is increasing, probably because of improved diagnostics. In DH, the treatment of choice for all patients is a gluten-free diet (GFD) in which uncontaminated oats are allowed. At onset, most patients need additional dapsone to rapidly control the rash and itching. Dapsone can be stopped after a mean of 2 years, and a strict lifelong GFD alone is required. Dietary adherence offers an excellent long-term prognosis for patients with DH, with a normal quality of life and all-cause mortality.
31935859	Changes in Age at Diagnosis and Nutritional Course of Celiac Disease in the Last Two Decades.	The frequency of celiac disease (CD) has increased along time, with relevant changes reported in geographical variations, clinical presentation and nutritional repercussions. In recent years, some celiac patients are presenting overweight/obesity, but it is unclear how frequent this is and to what extent undernutrition remains a concern. This is relevant because CD tends to be overlooked in overweight patients. With this in mind, we assessed age at diagnosis, clinical characteristics and nutritional status of 155 celiac patients diagnosed between 1994-2017 in four pediatric hospitals in Santiago, Chile. Since 2003, the number of patients diagnosed has increased (p < 0.0033), coinciding with antitransglutaminase and antiendomysial antibodies becoming available to public health systems. In 2000, 4.5% of patients were asymptomatic at diagnosis, suggesting that active search is not routinely applied. Gastrointestinal symptoms plus failure to thrive were significantly more frequent under 2 years (p = 0.0001). Nutritional status has improved at diagnosis and during follow up, but undernutrition remains more frequent in children <2 and <5 years (p < 0.002 and p < 0.0036, respectively). Overweight at diagnosis was reported in 2002 and obesity in 2010. After initiating treatment, since 2010, patients changing from undernourishment to overweight has sometimes been observed after only 6 months on a gluten-free diet.
30293993	First Degree Relatives of Patients with Celiac Disease Harbour an Intestinal Transcriptomic Signature that Might Protect them from Enterocyte Damage.	INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease (CeD) is an autoimmune enteropathy which affects approximately 0.7% of the global population. While first-degree relatives (FDR) of patients with CeD have a 7.5% risk of developing enteropathy, many remain protected. Therefore, intestinal mucosa of FDR might have protective compensatory mechanisms against immunological injury. We have explored the protective mechanisms that may be active in intestinal mucosa of FDR. METHODS: Intestinal mucosal biopsies (4-5 pieces) from treatment naive patients with CeD (n = 12), FDR (n = 12) (anti-tTG negative) and controls (n = 12) (anti-tTG negative) were obtained from each individual and subjected to microarray analysis using HT-12-v4 Human Expression BeadChips (Illumina). Differential gene expression analysis was carried out among CeD, FDR and controls; and resulting gene lists were analyzed using gene ontology and pathway enrichment tools. RESULTS: Patients with CeD, FDR and control groups displayed significant differential gene expression. Thirty seven genes were upregulated and 372 were downregulated in the intestinal mucosa of FDR in comparison to CeD and controls. Pseudogenes constituted about 18% (315/1751) of FDR differentially expressed genes, and formed "clusters" that associated uniquely with individual study groups. The three study groups segregated into distinct clusters in unsupervised (PCA) and supervised (random forests) modelling approaches. Pathways analysis revealed an emphasis on crypt-villous maintenance and immune regulation in the intestinal mucosa of FDR. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that the intestinal mucosa of celiac FDR consist of a unique molecular phenotype that is distinct from CeD and controls. The transcriptomic landscape of FDR promotes maintenance of crypt-villous axis and modulation of immune mechanisms. These differences clearly demonstrate the existence of compensatory protective mechanisms in the FDR intestinal mucosa.
34068001	Influence of Mediterranean Diet Adherence and Physical Activity on Bone Health in Celiac Children on a Gluten-Free Diet.	We aimed to assess the influence of the Mediterranean Diet adherence and physical activity (PA) on body composition, with a particular focus on bone health, in young patients with celiac disease (CD). The CD group (n = 59) included children with CD with a long (>18 months, n = 41) or recent (<18 months, n = 18) adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). The non-celiac group (n = 40) included non-celiac children. After adjusting for potential confounders, the CD group showed lower body weight (p = 0.034), lean mass (p = 0.003), bone mineral content (p = 0.006), and bone Z-score (p = 0.036) than non-celiac children, even when the model was further adjusted for adherence to a GFD for at least 18 months. Among CD children, spending greater time in vigorous physical activity was associated with higher lean mass (p = 0.020) and bone mineral density with evidence of statistical significance (p = 0.078) regardless of the time they followed a GFD. In addition, a greater Mediterranean Diet adherence was associated with a higher bone Z-score (p = 0.020). Moreover, lean mass was strongly associated with bone mineral density and independently explained 12% of its variability (p < 0.001). These findings suggest the importance of correctly monitoring lifestyle in children with CD regarding dietary habits and PA levels to improve lean mass and, consequently, bone quality in this population.
29948993	Prevalence of celiac disease among pediatric patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis and effect of gluten-free-diet.	BACKGROUND: Liver involvement in celiac disease (CD) is classified into autoimmune and cryptogenic. The association between CD and autoimmune liver diseases like autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis is well-established; however, the data on patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis, particularly from India, are scanty. So we did this study to find the prevalence of CD in patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis. METHODS: This was a prospective observational study, involving children of less than 18 years old attending Pediatric and Gastroenterology clinic with a diagnosis of cryptogenic cirrhosis. The patients were evaluated for CD and divided into two groups: chronic liver disease (CLD) with CD, and CLD without CD. Both the groups were followed up for 6 months. CLD with CD group was treated with gluten-free-diet (GFD) and CLD without CD group was followed up without any specific intervention except standard care of CLD. RESULTS: Out of 84 patients, 11 (13.1%) were diagnosed as CLD with CD. There was an improvement in hemoglobin levels, liver function tests, and Child-Pugh score after initiation of GFD in CLD with CD group. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of CD in cryptogenic cirrhosis was 13.1%. Screening for CD is recommended for cryptogenic cirrhosis. Hepatic functions improve with a GFD in CD patients with cirrhosis.
36234700	Safety Assessment of Foods and Drinks Consumed by People on a Gluten-Free Diet.	Naturally gluten-free foods and processed foods that do not contain information about the potential presence of gluten in them pose a hypothetical threat to people with food allergies and celiac disease. Patients who should follow a strict gluten-free diet do not always do so. Therefore, the aim of this research was to analyze certified "gluten-free" and naturally gluten-free products without labeled "may contain gluten" information in terms of their content of gluten proteins. The enzyme immunoassay AgraQuant Gluten G12 ELISA test kit was used for the analysis. Of all the products used in the research, only 5.8% were found to contain gluten above 20 ppm. Only one product labeled "gluten-free" was contaminated with gluten at 79.3 ppm (cider cake). In addition, our research also examined the gluten content of commercial beers containing barley malt not labeled as "gluten-free". Research has shown that 60% of samples are not safe for those on a strict gluten-free diet. Our research clearly shows that many manufacturers, although they do not monitor their products for the presence of gluten in them, offer safe products, although they cannot be recommended in a gluten-free diet. Therefore, there is a strong need to increase the frequency of testing by food manufacturers for the presence of gluten in their products, so that the number of products approved for people on a gluten-free diet continues to increase.
37049456	The Role of Gluten in Gastrointestinal Disorders: A Review.	Gluten is only partially digested by intestinal enzymes and can generate peptides that can alter intestinal permeability, facilitating bacterial translocation, thus affecting the immune system. Few studies addressed the role of diet with gluten in the development of intestinal inflammation and in other gastrointestinal disorders. The aim of this narrative review was to analyse the role of gluten in several gastrointestinal diseases so as to give a useful overview of its effectiveness in the prevention and management of these disorders.
30778350	Protective Effects of Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Signaling in Celiac Disease Mucosa and in Poly I:C-Induced Small Intestinal Atrophy Mouse Model.	Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a transcription factor activated by a large number of natural and synthetic agents, modulates the activity of immune cells in the gut and represents an important link between the environment and immune-mediated pathologies. In this study, we investigated the role of AhR in celiac disease (CD), a gluten-driven enteropathy. AhR expression was evaluated in intestinal biopsies taken from patients with CD and controls by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. AhR was also analyzed in ex vivo organ cultures of duodenal biopsies taken from inactive CD patients incubated in presence or absence of peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin. IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, granzyme B, and perforin expression was evaluated in anti-CD3/CD28-activated intestinal lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) and intestinal intra-epithelial cells (IEL) of active CD patients cultured in the presence or absence of the AhR agonist 6-formylindolo(3, 2-b)carbazole (Ficz). Finally, the protective role of AhR was evaluated in a mouse model of poly I:C-driven small intestine damage. AhR RNA transcripts were reduced in active CD samples as compared to inactive CD and normal controls. Flow cytometry confirmed such results and showed a reduction of AhR in both IEL and LPMC of active CD patients. The addition of a peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin to ex vivo organ cultures of duodenal biopsies taken from inactive CD patients reduced AhR expression. Treatment of CD IEL and LPMC with Ficz reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines, granzyme B and perforin. Mice injected with Ficz were protected against poly I:C-induced intestinal lesions. Our findings suggest that defective AhR-driven signals could contribute to amplify pathogenic responses in the gut of CD patients.
31608661	The effect of self-efficacy expectations in the adherence to a gluten free diet in celiac disease.	Objective: To analyse the effect of general and specific self-efficacy on the adherence to a gluten free diet (GFD) in patients with celiac disease along with the effect of other relevant variables.Design: 271 patients with celiac disease participated in this transversal descriptive study and completed a series of questionnaires regarding adherence (CDAT), general self-efficacy (GSES) and specific self-efficacy (Celiac-SE) and quality of life (CD-Qol), among others.Main Outcome Measures: Dependent variable was adherence to the Gluten Free Diet (GFD). Main independent variables were general self-efficacy, specific self-efficacy and quality of life. Model tests were conducted using regression analysis.Results: 71.9% of patients show an excellent or good adherence to the diet. Higher levels of adherence are positively associated to a high expectancy of specific self-efficacy, to the perceived adoption of recommended behaviours, risk perception and better quality of life (these variables accounted for 36.4% of the variance in the adherence to a GFD, p < .001).Conclusions: Specific self-efficacy rather than general has a predictive value in adherence to a GFD. Therefore, we need to develop and transculturally adapt new instruments to assess specific self-efficacy. Celiac-SE has proved to be a useful scale for this objective.
32022573	Duodenal lymphogram as a complementary tool in the diagnosis of celiac disease in adults.	INTRODUCTION: celiac disease (CD) patients have a specific pattern of lymphocytic infiltrate in the duodenal mucosa. Flow cytometry is a complementary tool for the diagnosis of CD, which allows the quantification and characterization of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) by what is commonly called a lymphogram. Here we describe our experience with this technique in the diagnosis of CD in adult patients. METHODS: lymphograms from 157 patients performed in our center between 2009 and 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. Fourteen patients had a previous diagnosis of CD and followed a gluten-free diet (GFD), 21 had a new diagnosis of CD and the remaining were considered as non-celiac. The association of the lymphogram results (total IELs, CD3- lymphocytes and TcRgammadelta lymphocytes) with the CD diagnosis, compliance with the GFD, time since diagnosis and IgA anti-TG2 titer were determined. RESULTS: the area under the ROC curve of TcRgammadelta lymphocytes for CD patients varied between 0.86 and 0.86. The percentage of TcRgammadelta lymphocytes in GFD-treated patients was lower; 12 (8.5) vs 20.5 (8.7), p = 0.0153. However, it remained high compared to non-CD; 12 (8.5) vs 6.7 (6), p = 0.135. The time since diagnosis and IgA anti-TG2 titer correlated with the lymphogram results. Helicobacter pylori infection and treatment with angiotensin receptor antagonist 2 (ARA2) were associated with differences in the lymphogram results in patients without CD. CONCLUSIONS: the duodenal lymphogram is a reliable complementary tool in adults for the diagnosis of CD. However, compliance and duration of the GFD and other factors may condition its diagnostic capacity.
30098695	Celiac disease is not more prevalent in patients undergoing in vitro fertilization and does not affect reproductive outcomes with or without treatment: a large prospective cohort study.	OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence of celiac disease in the infertile population undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) and assess outcomes. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: A single infertility center from January 2016 to March 2017. PATIENT(S): Women 18-45 years of age participating in IVF. INTERVENTION(S): Patients had serum tissue transglutaminase (tTG) and endomysial (EMA) IgA testing to screen for celiac disease and completed a 10-question "yes or no" survey to assess their medical history, previous testing, dietary habits, and pertinent symptoms. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): IVF cycle outcomes were compared between seronegative and seropositive patients. RESULT(S): Of 1,000 patients enrolled, 995 completed serologic screening and 968 underwent oocyte retrieval. Eighteen patients screened positive for both tTG and EMA (1.8%) and 10 additional patients (1.0%) screened positive for one of the two antibodies. The number of mature oocytes retrieved, fertilization rates, and blastulation rates were equivalent between seronegative and seropositive patients. There were 987 patients who completed the questionnaire (98.7%), and 84 reported being gluten free (8.5%). Those who reported being gluten free were no more likely to be antibody positive than the general population. Furthermore, a low-gluten diet was not associated with markers of ovarian reserve, oocytes retrieved, fertilization, blastulation, sustained implantation and pregnancy loss rates. CONCLUSION(S): The prevalence of seropositive celiac disease was consistent with that of the general population (2.8%). Patients who were seropositive for celiac disease-related antibodies had outcomes equivalent to seronegative patients, and patients with a gluten-free diet did not have improved outcomes.
32558265	Gluten-Free Diet in IBD: Time for a Recommendation?	Patients and providers alike are highly interested in identifying potentially useful dietary interventions in the management of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). This review examines the clinical associations of celiac disease (CeD), non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), and IBD with a focus on available data of the therapeutic efficacy of gluten-free diet (GFD) or low-gluten-containing diets in the therapy of IBD. There is a strong association between CeD and microscopic colitis, but the prevalence of CeD among IBD patients is similar to that of the general population. Interestingly, in cross-sectional studies nearly one-third of IBD patients report a diagnosis of NCGS, and many follow a GFD. Although animal studies have shown that gluten ingestion may promote intestinal inflammation and increase intestinal permeability, there have been no prospective studies evaluating the role of a GFD in the induction and maintenance of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Several cross-sectional reports suggest that a GFD may improve symptoms in IBD patients, but due to a lack of high-quality prospective clinical studies, current data do not support the universal use of a GFD in IBD.
29142467	Non-celiac gluten sensitivity: All wheat attack is not celiac.	Currently, 1% of the United States population holds a diagnosis for celiac disease (CD), however, a more recently recognized and possibly related condition, "non-celiac gluten sensitivity" (NCGS) has been suggested to affect up to 6% of the United States public. While reliable clinical tests for CD exist, diagnosing individuals affected by NCGS is still complicated by the lack of reliable biomarkers and reliance upon a broad set of intestinal and extra intestinal symptoms possibly provoked by gluten. NCGS has been proposed to exhibit an innate immune response activated by gluten and several other wheat proteins. At present, an enormous food industry has developed to supply gluten-free products (GFP) with GFP sales in 2014 approaching $1 billion, with estimations projecting sales to reach $2 billion in the year 2020. The enormous demand for GFP also reflects a popular misconception among consumers that gluten avoidance is part of a healthy lifestyle choice. Features of NCGS and other gluten related disorders (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome) call for a review of current distinctive diagnostic criteria that distinguish each, and identification of biomarkers selective or specific for NCGS. The aim of this paper is to review our current understanding of NCGS, highlighting the remaining challenges and questions which may improve its diagnosis and treatment.
29880966	Celiac Disease and Fecal Microbiota Transplantation: A New Beginning?	
37952478	Polysomnographic profile in children diagnosed with celiac disease before starting on a gluten free diet.	STUDY AIMS: The study assessed the presence of sleep abnormalities in children who had recently been diagnosed with celiac disease (CD) and not started a gluten free diet (GFD). The children's polysomnographic profiles were also characterized and further compared with healthy children of the same age. METHODS: This prospective cross-sectional study involved 46 pediatric subjects (aged 1-19 years) who had recently been diagnosed with CD and not started a GFD. The control group consisted of 32 healthy children (aged 2-17 years). All children underwent anthropometric measurement, laboratory testing and standard overnight observation with in-laboratory video-PSG. The study and control group were divided into subgroups according to the subjects' median ages (8.1 years): celiac children aged less than 8.1 years (n = 23) and more than 8.1 years (n = 23), healthy children less aged than 8.1 years (n = 16) and more than 8.1 years (n = 16). RESULTS: No significant differences in the basic demographic and anthropometric parameters between the celiac and control group were observed. Significantly prolonged sleep latency (SOL) was evident in the celiac subjects (21.89 +- 20.77 min. vs. 10.99 +- 7.94 min, p = 0.02), with a probability of prolonged SOL of 4.23-fold greater (OR = 4.23; 95 % CI 1.1-16.22) than the healthy controls, especially in the subgroup of older celiac patients. No significant differences in the sleep period time (SPT), total sleep time (TST), wake during sleep (WASO), sleep efficiency (SE) and sleep stage distribution and cyclization were found. The respiratory rates during sleep indicated a significantly greater incidence of the central apnea-hypopnea index (CAHI) (0.54 +- 0.78 vs. 0.18 +- 0.24, p = 0.03) with a 3.16-fold greater probability of pathological CAHI (OR = 3.16; 95 % CI 1.02-9.77) than the control group. An increased incidence of CSA in the subgroup of younger celiac patients compared to younger healthy controls was especially evident. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of our study suggest a difference in sleep architecture and an increased incidence of CSA in children with untreated CD, but additional research is required to verify the results.
29616378	Diagnosis of Celiac Disease: Taking a Bite Out of the Controversy.	Celiac disease is a common autoimmune disorder of the small intestine, triggered by an immunological response to the gluten present in wheat, barley, and rye in individuals who are genetically at risk. A key to reducing the complications of this disease is early diagnosis, preferably in childhood, and consuming a lifelong gluten-free diet once diagnosis is confirmed. Yet, the diagnosis of celiac disease is often considerably delayed, exposing patients to needless suffering and morbidity. It is also difficult to confirm histologically if dietary gluten has been restricted prior to obtaining a diagnostic biopsy, a significant problem given the current growing popularity of gluten-free diets. Furthermore, failure to understand or follow current guidelines means physicians may recommend patients commence the gluten-free diet before initiating referral to a gastroenterologist. Finally, adding further confusion, pediatric guidelines in Europe support a diagnosis based on serology rather than on histology, whereas those based in North America do not. The purpose of this review is to discuss these issues and other controversies in the diagnosis of celiac disease and to consider ways to optimize diagnosis across the lifespan.
30978535	Nonceliac Gluten and Wheat Sensitivity.	Non-celiac gluten and/or wheat sensitivity (NCGS) is thought to be an immune-mediated reaction to gluten or other components of wheat (eg, fructans or amylase trypsin inhibitors) with intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms which improve once gluten and/or wheat is eliminated from the diet and after a diagnosis of celiac disease and wheat allergy have been excluded with appropriate testing. However, there is a great deal of skepticism within the scientific community questioning the existence of NCGS as a distinct clinical disorder. There are no strict diagnostic criteria and a placebo-controlled rechallenge trial has been recommended for diagnosis. In research settings, a double-blind placebo-controlled rechallenge trial has been recommended for diagnosis. There are limited studies estimating the prevalence of NCGS using this study design. The existing studies have variable results likely due to the lack of a uniform diagnostic criterion, a great deal of dependence on the patient's perception of symptoms and a large nocebo effect in existing studies. In clinical practice, a single blind placebo-controlled rechallenge trial has been recommended for diagnosis. The pathogenesis of NCGS is unclear and there is no known biomarker or diagnostic histologic lesion for this condition. It is important to adopt a multidisciplinary team approach to patients with suspected NCGS with involvement of the primary care doctor, gastroenterologist, pathologist and nutritionist who may play an important role in diagnosis and treatment. There may especially be a role in elimination of food containing high quantity of both gluten and fructans. Furthermore, patients should be educated on the nutritional implications of consuming a long-term gluten-free diet.
34495570	Pathogenic T Cells in Celiac Disease Change Phenotype on Gluten Challenge: Implications for T-Cell-Directed Therapies.	Gluten-specific CD4+ T cells being drivers of celiac disease (CeD) are obvious targets for immunotherapy. Little is known about how cell markers harnessed for T-cell-directed therapy can change with time and upon activation in CeD and other autoimmune conditions. In-depth characterization of gluten-specific CD4+ T cells and CeD-associated (CD38+ and CD103+ ) CD8+ and gammadelta+ T cells in blood of treated CeD patients undergoing a 3 day gluten challenge is reported. The phenotypic profile of gluten-specific cells changes profoundly with gluten exposure and the cells adopt the profile of gluten-specific cells in untreated disease (CD147+ , CD70+ , programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)+ , inducible T-cell costimulator (ICOS)+ , CD28+ , CD95+ , CD38+ , and CD161+ ), yet with some markers being unique for day 6 cells (C-X-C chemokine receptor type 6 (CXCR6), CD132, and CD147) and with integrin alpha4beta7, C-C motif chemokine receptor 9 (CCR9), and CXCR3 being expressed stably at baseline and day 6. Among gluten-specific CD4+ T cells, 52% are CXCR5+ at baseline, perhaps indicative of germinal-center reactions, while on day 6 all are CXCR5- . Strikingly, the phenotypic profile of gluten-specific CD4+ T cells on day 6 largely overlaps with that of CeD-associated (CD38+ and CD103+ ) CD8+ and gammadelta+ T cells. The antigen-induced shift in phenotype of CD4+ T cells being shared with other disease-associated T cells is relevant for development of T-cell-directed therapies.
30453686	Gluten-Free Diet in Celiac Disease-Forever and for All?	The gluten-free diet is the only effective treatment available for celiac disease. However, it is difficult to adhere to and a closer look on the diet's implementation and indications reveals several ambiguities: Not only is there controversy on the threshold of gluten that can be tolerated in the frame of a strict gluten-free diet, but it is also unclear whether the gluten-free diet is an appropriate treatment in patient subgroups with asymptomatic or potential celiac disease. Reports from a number of research groups suggest that a certain proportion of patients may effectively develop tolerance to gluten and thus become suitable for gluten reintroduction over time. In this review, we set out to create an overview about the current state of research as regards the definition of a strict gluten-free diet in terms of the gluten thresholds considered tolerable and the indication for a gluten-free diet in the absence of histological abnormalities or symptoms. Furthermore, we discuss the concept that a gluten-free diet must be followed for life by all patients.
33233787	The Diverse Potential of Gluten from Different Durum Wheat Varieties in Triggering Celiac Disease: A Multilevel In Vitro, Ex Vivo and In Vivo Approach.	The reasons behind the increasing prevalence of celiac disease (CD) worldwide are still not fully understood. This study adopted a multilevel approach (in vitro, ex vivo, in vivo) to assess the potential of gluten from different wheat varieties in triggering CD. Peptides triggering CD were identified and quantified in mixtures generated from simulated gastrointestinal digestion of wheat varieties (n = 82). Multivariate statistics enabled the discrimination of varieties generating low impact on CD (e.g., Saragolla) and high impact (e.g., Cappelli). Enrolled subjects (n = 46) were: 19 healthy subjects included in the control group; 27 celiac patients enrolled for the in vivo phase. Celiacs were divided into a gluten-free diet group (CD-GFD), and a GFD with Saragolla-based pasta group (CD-Sar). The diet was followed for 3 months. Data were compared between CD-Sar and CD-GFD before and after the experimental diet, demonstrating a limited ability of Saragolla to trigger immunity, although not comparable to a GFD. Ex vivo studies showed that Saragolla and Cappelli activated immune responses, although with great variability among patients. The diverse potential of durum wheat varieties in triggering CD immune response was demonstrated. Saragolla is not indicated for celiacs, yet it has a limited potential to trigger adverse immune response.
36096056	Micronutrient deficiencies are frequent in adult patients with and without celiac disease on a gluten-free diet, regardless of duration and adherence to the diet.	OBJECTIVES: The only treatment for celiac disease (CD) is a strict gluten-free diet (GFD). Nutritional deficiencies are common in CD; however, how this is influenced by the presence of symptoms, duration of CD, and compliance of GFD is less clear. The objective of this study was to compare nutritional deficiencies in patients with CD to those of nonceliac populations on a GFD. The secondary outcomes were to compare deficiencies in short- (<2 y) versus long-term (>=2 y) GFD, and in those with persistent symptoms versus asymptomatic. METHODS: We included patients seen at the McMaster Celiac Clinic from June 2018 to August 2020. GFD adherence was assessed with the Celiac Dietary Adherence Test, and CD serology, vitamins, and trace minerals were measured in blood samples. We enrolled 221 patients, including 182 patients with CD and 39 controls. RESULTS: Overall, 103 of 182 patients with CD (56.6%) were following a GFD for >2 y and 119 patients (69.2%) were symptomatic. The most common micronutrient deficiencies were zinc (48.3%), ferritin (16.9%), and vitamin D (33.3%). There were no differences in micronutrient deficiencies between patients with CD and nonceliac controls, short- and long-term GFDs, or those strictly compliant with GFD and those who were fairly compliant (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that nutrient deficiencies may be related more to GFD nutritional inadequacy rather than malabsorption.
29287928	Making All Medications Gluten Free.	Gluten is found in food containing wheat, rye, and barley, and it may be introduced into medicines through the use of starch or any modified form of starch derived from these grains. The ingestion of gluten poses serious health hazards to people with celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity, and they must avoid the oral ingestion of gluten. In 2011, the Food and Drug Administration solicited information and public comments on 'gluten in drug products.' However, the 'final rule' that the Agency issued in 2013 involved only the voluntary 'gluten-free' labeling of food, and it did not include drug products. In this commentary, we are proposing that all drug products can and should be made gluten free. This is especially important since there is currently a global trade in medicines, and patients and health care providers do not know whether a product is gluten free or not unless they are labeled as such. All drug products can be made gluten free as there are many alternatives to gluten-containing starch that can be used as excipients during their formulation. Global collaborative efforts of regulatory agencies, pharmaceutical companies, and excipient manufacturers will be needed to implement a gluten-free medication policy and new regulatory guidelines.

37556743	EATING HABITS AND NUTRITIONAL STATUS OF PATIENTS WITH CELIAC DISEASE IN SOUTH BRAZIL.	 Most patients with celiac disease from South Brazil do not consume gluten.  Patients with celiac disease are more careful about gluten cross-contamination in their homes than in restaurants.  Patients with celiac disease from South Brazil have adopted good eating habits with a balanced gluten-free diet.  Nutritional status improved after diagnosis of celiac disease according to body mass index. Background - Celiac disease is defined as a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the small intestine in genetically predisposed people, triggered by exposure to gluten. The only treatment for celiac disease to date is a lifelong gluten-free diet. Eating habits of celiacs play an important role in their nutritional status.Objective - To evaluate the eating habits and nutritional status of patients with celiac disease in Rio Grande do Sul.Methods - This is a cross-sectional study with patients diagnosed with celiac disease residing in Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil) over 18 years of age. An online questionnaire was applied with calls through social networks and also by the Associacao dos Celiacos do Brasil - Rio Grande do Sul Section. Sociodemographic data, history of celiac disease, general medical history, reported weight and height and food consumption data (SISVAN food frequency questionnaire and general questions) were collected. Results - The sample consisted of 142 individuals with a mean age of 39.75+-11.5 years, 94.4% were women and 93% were white. The patients showed care regarding a gluten-free diet, with the majority not ingesting gluten (82.2%) and being careful regarding cross-contamination by gluten in their homes (85.9%) and in restaurants (62, 4%). Most patients also had good eating habits, with frequent consumption of fruits, vegetables, meats, eggs and low frequency of processed foods and fats. Body weight before and after the diagnosis of celiac disease did not show significant changes (62.3+-13.8 versus 63.6+-11.7 kg; P=0.147); however, there was an improvement in the classification of nutritional status by body mass index (malnourished: 11.6% before versus 2.3% after; P=0.016). Conclusion - Most celiac disease patients in this study have good eating habits with a balanced gluten-free diet and improved nutritional status after diagnosis according to body mass index classification.
35815825	Review article: Becoming and being coeliac-special considerations for childhood, adolescence and beyond.	Classically considered a disease of early childhood characterised by malabsorption and failure to thrive, coeliac disease is now recognised to arise in genetically susceptible individuals at any age. Although permissive HLA genotypes are the strongest predictor of coeliac disease, they are not sufficient. Several prospective cohort studies enrolling genetically at-risk infants have investigated the role of potential triggers of coeliac disease autoimmunity, such as timing of gluten introduction, viral infections and dietary patterns. Much less is known about triggers of coeliac disease in adulthood. Better understanding of factors leading to coeliac disease may be helpful in the management of those with potential coeliac disease (elevated serum celiac antibodies without villous atrophy in the small intestine), many of whom initiate a gluten-free diet without demonstration of villous atrophy. There are a range of clinical presentations of celiac disease in childhood and patterns of coeliac serology, including fluctuation and spontaneous reversion on a gluten-containing diet, vary. There is a current debate over best strategies to manage adults and children with potential coeliac disease to avoid over-treatment and under-treatment. Childhood and adolescence carry unique issues pertaining to the diagnosis and management of coeliac disease, and include nutrition and growth, rescreening, repeat biopsy, dietary adherence concerns and transition to adult care. In conclusion, while coeliac disease has similar pathogenesis and general clinical manifestations in paediatric and adult populations, diagnostic and management approaches need to adapt to the developmental stages.

31277328	Micronutrients Dietary Supplementation Advices for Celiac Patients on Long-Term Gluten-Free Diet with Good Compliance: A Review.	Background and objective: Often micronutrient deficiencies cannot be detected when patient is already following a long-term gluten-free diet with good compliance (LTGFDWGC). The aim of this narrative review is to evaluate the most recent literature that considers blood micronutrient deficiencies in LTGFDWGC subjects, in order to prepare dietary supplementation advice (DSA). Materials and methods: A research strategy was planned on PubMed by defining the following keywords: celiac disease, vitamin B12, iron, folic acid, and vitamin D. Results: This review included 73 studies. The few studies on micronutrient circulating levels in long-term gluten-free diet (LTGFD) patients over 2 years with good compliance demonstrated that deficiency was detected in up to: 30% of subjects for vitamin B12 (DSA: 1000 mcg/day until level is normal, then 500 mcg), 40% for iron (325 mg/day), 20% for folic acid (1 mg/day for 3 months, followed by 400-800 mcg/day), 25% for vitamin D (1000 UI/day or more-based serum level or 50,000 UI/week if level is <20 ng/mL), 40% for zinc (25-40 mg/day), 3.6% of children for calcium (1000-1500 mg/day), 20% for magnesium (200-300 mg/day); no data is available in adults for magnesium. Conclusions: If integration with diet is not enough, starting with supplements may be the correct way, after evaluating the initial blood level to determine the right dosage of supplementation.

34613954	Determination of Urinary Gluten Immunogenic Peptides to Assess Adherence to the Gluten-Free Diet: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Controlled Study.	INTRODUCTION: The adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) is a trending topic in the management of celiac disease. The aim of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of urinary gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) determination to detect gluten contamination of the GFD. METHODS: In study A, 25 healthy adults on a standard GFD performed 6 gluten challenges (0, 10, 50, 100, 500, and 1,000 mg) with quantification of urinary GIP before (T0) and during the following 24 hours. In study B, 12 participants on a gluten contamination elimination diet underwent urinary GIP determination at T0 and after challenge with 5 or 10 mg gluten. Urine GIP concentration was determined by an immunochromatographic assay. RESULTS: In study A, 51 of 150 baseline urine samples were GIP+ on GFD and 7 of 17 were GIP+ after the zero-gluten challenge, whereas only 55 of 81 were GIP+ after the 10-1,000 mg gluten challenges. There was no significant change in the 24-hour urinary GIP when increasing gluten from 10 to 1,000 mg. In study B, 24 of 24 baseline urine samples were GIP-, whereas 8 of 24 were GIP+ after 5 or 10 mg of gluten. DISCUSSION: Traces of gluten in the standard GFD may cause positivity of urinary GIP determination, whereas a false negativity is common after a gluten intake of 10-1,000 mg. Owing to the impossibility of standardizing the test in normal conditions, it seems unlikely that urinary GIP determination may represent a reliable tool to assess the compliance to the GFD of patients with celiac disease or other gluten-related disorders.
30945820	[Psychiatric symptoms in a child with gluten sensitivity].	BACKGROUND: Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a diagnosis that is increasingly being reported. Psychiatric symptoms can be a rare but serious manifestation of this new clinical entity. CASE REPORT: A 13-year-old girl consulted the paediatrician with abdominal pain, diarrhoea, bloating, and compulsive thoughts and fears; these disappeared on a gluten-free diet. Celiac disease and wheat allergy were excluded. Double-blind placebo-controlled gluten challenge confirmed the diagnosis NCGS. CONCLUSION: Consider a diagnosis of NCGS in patients with psychiatric symptoms in combination with abdominal symptoms.
34975913	Celiac Disease After Administration of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors: A Case Report.	Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) reinvigorate the immune system to recognize and destroy tumor cells. Because of this biological mechanism, patients might develop autoimmune toxicities, notably in the digestive tract (most frequently, hepatitis or colitis). A 70-year-old man with relapsed mesothelioma was treated with nivolumab in 3rd line. He was hospitalized for watery and foul-smelling diarrhea. He underwent gastrointestinal endoscopy, showing duodenitis and villous atrophy and measurement of serum IgA antibodies to tissue transglutaminase (tTG-IgA+), leading to the diagnosis of ICI-induced celiac disease. He was treated with steroids, proton pump inhibitors, and a gluten-free diet. If ICI-induced celiac disease is rare in the literature, increasing reports suggest that celiac disease might represent an underestimated ICI toxicity. This case highlights the necessity of complementary investigation (including tTG-IgA and endoscopic biopsies) in patients with atypical digestive symptoms during immunotherapy.
33804451	Iodine Absorption in Celiac Children: A Longitudinal Pilot Study.	Background: non-autoimmune thyroid disorder is a common finding in celiac patients, more frequent than in the general population. An impairment of iodine absorption has been hypothesized, but it has never been investigated so far. We aimed to evaluate the iodine absorption in children and adolescents with newly diagnosed celiac disease. Methods: 36 consecutive celiac patients (age 7.4 years, range 2.4-14.5 years) before starting a gluten-free diet (GFD) were enrolled. We assayed the urinary iodine concentration (UIC) in a 24-h urine sample, at baseline (T0) after 3 (T1) and 12 months (T2) of GFD. Results: UIC at T0 was 64 mug/L (IQR 45-93.25 mug/L) with an iodine deficiency rate of 77.8%. UIC was not different according to histological damage, clinical presentation (typical vs atypical); we found no correlation with the thyroid function tests and auxological parameters. UIC was not statistically different at T1 (76 mug/L) and T2 (89 mug/L) vs T0. UIC at T2 was similar between patients with positive and negative anti-transglutaminase antibodies at T2. No patients presented overt hypothyroidism during the study. Conclusions: We found that iodine absorption in celiac children is impaired compared to the general population; it increases slightly, but not significantly, during the GFD. We should regularly reinforce the need for a proper iodine intake in celiac disease patients to reduce iodine deficiency risk.
31450806	Gluten-Free Products: From Dietary Necessity to Premium Price Extraction Tool.	Every year, the Italian National Health Service (NHS) provides about 200,000 celiac people (based on 2017 data) living in Italy with financial support of about 250 million euro to cover the cost of their specific dietary constrains. The existence of gluten-free products of high quality and affordable price is very important for the quality of life of celiac people and the sustainability of public support. Over the last decade, the market for gluten-free products has experienced a dramatic surge, with an increasing shelf space dedicated to these products in supermarkets, and a large variety of products both in terms of kind of agricultural inputs and processing and packaging methods. This study aimed at assessing the offer of gluten-free (GF) pasta in Italian supermarkets, with respect to its ability to meet the needs of celiac people in terms of variety, prices and safety. A hedonic price analysis was performed. Results indicated that GF pasta is sold only in 44% of the 212 stores of the sample, with a price equal to more than twice that of conventional pasta. A premium price was found for the following attributes: small packages, brands specialized in GF products, content in fiber and the presence of quinoa as ingredient.
37943101	Monitoring patients with celiac disease on gluten free diet: different outcomes comparing three tissue transglutaminase IgA assays.	OBJECTIVES: Tissue transglutaminase (tTG) IgA antibodies are a hallmark for celiac disease (CD). In CD patients on gluten free diet (GFD) these antibodies are transient. Few studies are available comparing the tTG-IgA assay characteristics for monitoring response to GFD. Since discrepant results were reported in patients on GFD after switching tTG-IgA assays, we conducted a retrospective observational study to monitor GFD response using three different tTG-IgA assays. METHODS: Diagnostic samples from 44 adults and 17 children with CD were included. Of most patients two follow-up samples after introduction of GFD were available. In all samples tTG-IgA were assessed using one fluorochrome-enzyme immuno-assay (FEIA) and two chemiluminescence immuno-assays (CLIA) and intestinal fatty acid binding protein (i-FABP) as surrogate marker for intestinal epithelial damage was measured. RESULTS: Using CLIA assays, normalization of antibody levels was delayed compared to FEIA (p<0.001). Of all samples taken after at least 6 months on GFD with elevated i-FABP indicating intestinal epithelial damage, 40 % had positive tTG-IgA according to the FEIA, 85 and 90 % according to the two CLIA. CONCLUSIONS: Normalization of tTG-IgA in patients on GFD depends on the assay used. Both CLIA appear to be more sensitive in detecting suboptimal treatment response in CD-indicated by elevated i-FABP - when applying the manufacturer's recommended cut-off for the diagnosis of CD.
28870408	Thyroid storm and warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia.	Graves' disease is often associated with other autoimmune disorders, including rare associations with autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). We describe a unique presentation of thyroid storm and warm AIHA diagnosed concurrently in a young female with hyperthyroidism. The patient presented with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and altered mental status. Laboratory studies revealed hemoglobin 3.9g/dL, platelets 171x109L-1, haptoglobin <5mg/dL, reticulocytosis, and positive direct antiglobulin test (IgG, C3d, warm). Additional workup revealed serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) <0.01muIU/mL and serum free-T4 (FT4) level 7.8ng/dL. Our patient was diagnosed with concurrent thyroid storm and warm AIHA. She was started on glucocorticoids to treat both warm AIHA and thyroid storm, as well as antithyroid medications, propranolol and folic acid. Due to profound anemia and hemodynamic instability, the patient was transfused two units of uncrossmatched packed red blood cells slowly and tolerated this well. She was discharged on methimazole as well as a prolonged prednisone taper, and achieved complete resolution of the thyrotoxicosis and anemia at one month. Hyperthyroidism can affect all three blood cell lineages of the hematopoietic system. Anemia can be seen in 10-20% of patients with thyrotoxicosis. Several autoimmune processes can lead to anemia in Graves' disease, including pernicious anemia, celiac disease, and warm AIHA. This case illustrates a rarely described presentation of a patient with Graves' disease presenting with concurrent thyroid storm and warm AIHA.
33708175	L-T4 Therapy in Enteric Malabsorptive Disorders.	Levothyroxine (L-T4) absorption can be impaired by various causes: a) L-T4 ingestion during breakfast, or with food; b) conditions of reduced gastric acidity; c) intestinal procedures and diseases such as bariatric surgery, lactose intolerance (LI), celiac disease (CD), inflammatory bowel disease; d) drugs that alter L-T4 absorption, increasing the gastric pH, or preventing the dissolution of tablets. The development of new oral formulations, i.e. the liquid preparation and the soft gel capsule, represents the most recent advance regarding L-T4 therapy. Treating hypothyroidism with L-T4 tablets can lead to an improper control of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in ~10%-15% of patients. The improperly elevated TSH is usually managed by increasing the L-T4 daily dose, and revaluating TSH upon 2-6 months. The increase of the L-T4 dosage may cause iatrogenic hyperthyroidism, especially when the underlying disorders are cured. Liquid L-T4 can be administered in patients unable to swallow capsules or tablets, and this is one of its major benefits. Liquid L-T4 can: 1- overcome food and beverages interference; 2- bypass the malabsorption associated with an increased gastric pH; 3- circumvent the issue of malabsorption in patients who underwent bariatric surgery; 4-maintain TSH values under control better than L-T4 tablets in hypothyroid patients with typical or atypical CD, or in patients with LI. Few clinical studies evaluated soft gel L-T4 with encouraging findings in patients with gastric- or coffee-related malabsorption, or hypothyroid patients without malabsorption. Additional research is necessary to investigate liquid L-T4, or soft gel capsule, in other conditions of altered L-T4 absorption.
31082858	Persistent Alterations in Plasma Lipid Profiles Before Introduction of Gluten in the Diet Associated With Progression to Celiac Disease.	OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic enteropathy characterized by an autoimmune reaction in the small intestine of genetically susceptible individuals. The underlying causes of autoimmune reaction and its effect on host metabolism remain largely unknown. Herein, we apply lipidomics to elucidate the early events preceding clinical CD in a cohort of Finnish children, followed up in the Type 1 Diabetes Prediction and Prevention study. METHODS: Mass spectrometry-based lipidomics profiling was applied to a longitudinal/prospective series of 233 plasma samples obtained from CD progressors (n = 23) and healthy controls (n = 23), matched for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) risk, sex, and age. The children were followed from birth until diagnosis of clinical CD and subsequent introduction of a gluten-free diet. RESULTS: Twenty-three children progressed to CD at a mean age of 4.8 years. They showed increased amounts of triacylglycerols (TGs) of low carbon number and double bond count and a decreased level of phosphatidylcholines by age 3 months as compared to controls. These differences were exacerbated with age but were not observed at birth (cord blood). No significant differences were observed in the essential TGs. DISCUSSION: Our preliminary findings suggest that abnormal lipid metabolism associates with the development of clinical CD and occurs already before the first introduction of gluten to the diet. Moreover, our data suggest that the specific TGs found elevated in CD progressors may be due to a host response to compromised intake of essential lipids in the small intestine, requiring de novo lipogenesis.
33276620	Alterations in One-Carbon Metabolism in Celiac Disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune enteropathy associated with alterations of metabolism. Metabolomics studies, although limited, showed changes in choline, choline-derived lipids, and methionine concentrations, which could be ascribed to alterations in one-carbon metabolism. To date, no targeted metabolomics analysis investigating differences in the plasma choline/methionine metabolome of CD subjects are reported. This work is a targeted metabolomic study that analyzes 37 metabolites of the one-carbon metabolism in 17 children with CD, treated with a gluten-free diet and 17 healthy control siblings, in order to establish the potential defects in this metabolic network. Our results demonstrate the persistence of defects in the transsulfuration pathway of CD subjects, despite dietary treatment, while choline metabolism, methionine cycle, and folate cycle seem to be reversed and preserved to healthy levels. These findings describe for the first time, a metabolic defect in one-carbon metabolism which could have profound implications in the physiopathology and treatment of CD.
35125825	Current guidelines for the management of celiac disease: A systematic review with comparative analysis.	BACKGROUND: Wheat and other gluten-containing grains are widely consumed, providing approximately 50% of the caloric intake in both industrialised and developing countries. The widespread diffusion of gluten-containing diets has rapidly led to a sharp increase in celiac disease prevalence. This condition was thought to be very rare outside Europe and relatively ignored by health professionals and the global media. However, in recent years, the discovery of important diagnostic and pathogenic milestones has led to the emergence of celiac disease (CD) from obscurity to global prominence. These modifications have prompted experts worldwide to identify effective strategies for the diagnosis and follow-up of CD. Different scientific societies, mainly from Europe and America, have proposed guidelines based on CD's most recent evidence. AIM: To identify the most recent scientific guidelines on CD, aiming to find and critically analyse the main differences. METHODS: We performed a database search on PubMed selecting papers published between January 2010 and January 2021 in the English language. PubMed was lastly accessed on 1 March 2021. RESULTS: We distinguished guidelines from 7 different scientific societies whose reputation is worldwide recognized and representative of the clinical practice in different geographical regions. Differences were noted in the possibility of a no-biopsy diagnosis, HLA testing, follow-up protocols, and procedures. CONCLUSION: We found a relatively high concordance between the guidelines for CD. Important modifications have occurred in the last years, especially about the possibility of a no-biopsy diagnosis in children. Other modifications are expected in the next future and will probably involve the extension of the non-invasive diagnosis to the adult population and the follow-up modalities.
38139373	The Role of NKG2D and Its Ligands in Autoimmune Diseases: New Targets for Immunotherapy.	Natural killer (NK) cells and CD8+ T cells can clear infected and transformed cells and generate tolerance to themselves, which also prevents autoimmune diseases. Natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) is an important activating immune receptor that is expressed on NK cells, CD8+ T cells, gammadelta T cells, and a very small percentage of CD4+ T cells. In contrast, the NKG2D ligand (NKG2D-L) is generally not expressed on normal cells but is overexpressed under stress. Thus, the inappropriate expression of NKG2D-L leads to the activation of self-reactive effector cells, which can trigger or exacerbate autoimmunity. In this review, we discuss the role of NKG2D and NKG2D-L in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), multiple sclerosis (MS), type I diabetes (T1DM), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and celiac disease (CeD). The data suggest that NKG2D and NKG2D-L play a pathogenic role in some autoimmune diseases. Therefore, the development of strategies to block the interaction of NKG2D and NKG2D-L may have therapeutic effects in some autoimmune diseases.
34950132	Circulating miRNAs as Potential Biomarkers for Celiac Disease Development.	Background & Aims: Celiac disease (CeD), an immune-mediated disease with enteropathy triggered by gluten, affects ~1% of the general European population. Currently, there are no biomarkers to predict CeD development. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short RNAs involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation, and certain disease- and stage-specific miRNA profiles have been found previously. We aimed to investigate whether circulating miRNAs can predict the development of CeD. Methods: Using next-generation miRNA-sequencing, we determined miRNAs in >200 serum samples from 53 participants of the PreventCD study, of whom 33 developed CeD during follow-up. Following study inclusion at 3 months of age, samples were drawn at predefined ages, diagnosis (first anti-transglutaminase antibody (TGA) positivity or diagnostic biopsy) and after the start of a gluten-free diet (GFD). This allowed identification of circulating miRNAs that are deregulated before TGA positivity. For validation of the biomarkers for CeD and GFD response, two additional cohorts were included in subsequent meta-analyses. Additionally, miRNAs were measured in duodenal biopsies in a case-control cohort. Results: 53 circulating miRNAs were increased (27) or decreased (26) in CeD versus controls. We assessed specific trends in these individual miRNAs in the PreventCD cohort by grouping the pre-diagnostic samples of the CeD patients (all had negative TGA) by how close to seroconversion (first sample positive TGA) the samples were taken. 8/53 miRNAs differed significantly between controls and samples taken <1 year before TGA positivity: miR-21-3p, miR-374a-5p, 144-3p, miR-500a-3p, miR-486-3p let-7d-3p, let-7e-5p and miR-3605-3p. 6/26 downregulated miRNAs reconstituted upon GFD, including miR-150-5p/-3p, whereas no upregulated miRNAs were downregulated upon GFD. 15/53 biomarker candidates also differed between CeD biopsies and controls, with a concordant direction, indicating that these circulating miRNAs might originate from the intestine. Conclusions: We identified 53 circulating miRNAs that are potential early biomarkers for CeD, of which several can be detected more than a year before TGA positivity and some start to normalize upon GFD.
