27620860	Comparison of clinical features, treatment, and outcomes of collagenous sprue, celiac disease, and collagenous colitis.	BACKGROUND: Collagenous sprue (CS) is a rare form of enteropathy that had been reported to be associated with celiac disease (CD) and collagenous colitis (CC). The aim of our study was to compare the clinical features, treatments, and outcomes of CS, CD, and CC. METHODS: All patients with histologic diagnosis of CS, CD, or CC with complete clinical data were extracted from our pathology database between 1990 and 2015. Demographic and clinical features were recorded along with treatments and outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 21 patients with CS were included. Overall CS patients were more symptomatic with 17 (81.0%) patients with diarrhea and 15 (71.4%) with unintentional weight loss. Positive celiac serology was noted in 5 (23.8%) CS patients. CS patients had higher rates for disease-related temporary total parenteral nutrition (TPN) use (38.1% vs. 1.1% vs. 1.0%, P < 0.0001) and disease-related hospitalization (52.4% vs. 3.3% vs. 8.2%, P < 0.0001) than that in CD and CC patients. Twenty CS patients received treatments, including the combination of gluten-free diet (GFD) and corticosteroids (n = 12), GFD only (n = 2), and corticosteroids only (n = 6). All CS patients showed symptomatic reliefs with treatment. Although CS patients had a higher rate for hospitalization and TPN use, disease-related death was not observed in all three groups. CONCLUSIONS: Collagenous sprue patients had more severe clinical presentation than patients with CD and CC and therefore had higher demand for temporary TPN and hospitalization. Nevertheless, a prompt use of steroids and/or GFD upon histologic diagnosis of CS may have contributed to an overall excellent prognosis.
24603159	Prolactin may be increased in newly diagnosed celiac children and adolescents and decreases after 6 months of gluten-free diet.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Prolactin (PRL) is produced by the anterior pituitary gland. It exerts its role on the breast gland but also plays a modulatory role in autoimmune mechanisms. Celiac disease (CD) is a gluten-sensitive autoimmune enteropathy sometimes associated with autoimmune endocrinopathies. No data on PRL levels in CD patients are available at diagnosis, and no conclusive data are reported. METHODS: We aimed to evaluate PRL secretion in newly diagnosed CD pediatric patients and, in the case of hyperprolactinemia, any changes in its levels while the patients were on a gluten-free diet (GFD). We recruited 67 patients and 39 healthy controls. RESULTS: PRL was statistically higher in the CD patients (13.5+-9.2 ng/ml) than in the controls (8.5+-5.0 ng/ml). In the CD group, PRL was inversely correlated with the age at diagnosis (r=-0.326; p=0.007). In patients with hyperprolactinemia at diagnosis, PRL decreased after 6 months of GFD. CONCLUSION: This paper confirms that PRL may be increased at diagnosis of CD and shows, for the first time, that it decreases after a short course of GFD. Changes in the levels of inflammatory cytokines in CD may account for changes in PRL levels. Younger patients seem more prone to develop hyperprolactinemia than older ones.
21695949	[Bone mineral density in patients with celiac disease and medical treatment of the disorder].	The article presents the results of a bone mineral density study in patients with glutensensitive celiac disease. Was discussed problem of malabsorption syndrome with clinical and pathogenetic point of view, which can lead to bone loss due to malabsorption of calcium and vitamin D for celiac disease. Also was take into account the effect of inflammatory cytokines and hormones on calcium regulating processes of bone remodeling. The role of adherence to a gluten-free diet in the formation of bone loss. The article is illustrated with three tables, one figure and two schedules.
28102654	Tuberculosis and tuberculin skin test reactivity in pediatric patients with celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to determine tuberculin skin test reactivity and associated factors in pediatric patients with celiac disease (CD). METHODS: Tuberculin skin test (TST) was performed on 28 patients with CD aged from 1 year to 15 years (mean, 6.64+-4.8) and 28 healthy age and sex-matched children. The association between TST reactivity and parameters such as age, gender, malnutrition, clinical presentation, compliance to gluten free diet and response to hepatitis A and B vaccinations were determined. RESULTS: No difference was observed in TST reactivity (induration size) between the patients with CD and healthy controls. Thirty-two percent (9/28) of the patients were anergic, and one-third of these nine patients had malnutrition. No significant difference was observed between TST-positive and TST-negative patients in terms of age, gender, malnutrition, compliance to gluten-free diet and response to hepatitis A and B vaccinations (P>0.05). One of 11 patients with positive TST had tuberculosis disease and 10 had latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), whereas none of the controls had LTBI or tuberculosis disease (P=0.0007). CONCLUSIONS: Although based on a small number of cases, it seems that children with CD are more susceptible to tuberculosis than healthy children. TST can be used to identify BCG-vaccinated children with CD who are probably infected with M. tuberculosis, similarly to healthy children.
37131195	Clinical features, treatment, and outcomes of celiac-associated arthritis: a retrospective cohort study.	BACKGROUND: Although arthritis is recognized as an extra-intestinal manifestation of celiac disease, little is known about the clinical course and outcomes of pediatric celiac-associated arthritis. This study describes clinical characteristics, treatments, and outcomes of children with celiac-associated arthritis. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of children with celiac disease seen in pediatric rheumatology clinic between 2004 and 2021 for joint complaints. Data was abstracted from electronic health records. Patient demographics and clinical manifestations were evaluated using standard descriptive statistics. Physician- and patient-reported outcomes were evaluated at the index visit, 6-month follow-up, and last recorded visit, and were compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients with celiac disease were evaluated for joint complaints, and 13 were diagnosed with arthritis. Their mean age was 8.9 years (SD 5.9), and 61.5% were female. Celiac disease diagnosis was made before arthritis diagnosis in only 2 cases (15.4%). Initial testing that led to the celiac disease diagnosis was obtained by the rheumatologist in 6 cases (46.2%). Only 8 patients (61.5%) had concomitant GI symptoms, and of these, 3 patients had BMI z-scores <-1.64 and 1 had impaired linear growth. Arthritis presentation was most often oligoarticular (76.9%) and asymmetric (84.6%). Most cases required systemic therapy (n = 11, 84.6%) with DMARDs, biologics, or both. Of the 10 patients who required systemic therapy and reported compliance with the gluten-free diet, 3 (30%) were able to stop systemic medications. Two of 3 patients who cleared celiac serologies came off systemic medications. Statistically significant improvement was noted in the number of joints involved (p = 0.02) and physician global assessment of disease activity (p = 0.03) between the index and final visit. CONCLUSIONS: Rheumatologists play an important role in the identification of celiac disease, as arthritis was the presenting symptom in most cases and was not always associated with GI symptoms or poor growth. The arthritis was most often oligoarticular and asymmetric. Most children required systemic therapy. The gluten-free diet may not be sufficient to manage arthritis, but antibody clearance may be an indicator of higher likelihood of disease control off medications. Outcomes are promising with a combination of diet and medical therapy.
28617328	The Long-Term Consumption of Oats in Celiac Disease Patients Is Safe: A Large Cross-Sectional Study.	A strict gluten-free diet (GFD) can be diversified by non-contaminated oats, but there is a shortage of long-term studies concerning its safety. We compared long-term treatment outcomes and factors associated with the introduction of oats between celiac patients on a GFD with or without oats. Eight hundred sixty-nine previously diagnosed celiac patients were interviewed. The validated Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS), Psychological General Well-Being (PGWB), and Short-Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaires were used to assess symptoms and quality of life, serological tests were performed, and results of histology were confirmed from patient records. We found the median duration of GFD to be 10 years and 82% using oats. Factors predicting the consumption of oats were diagnosis after the year 2000, advice from a dietitian, detection by screening, and mild clinical presentation. Oat consumers and non-consumers did not differ in dietary adherence (96.5% vs. 97.4%, p = 0.746), the prevalence of symptoms (22.9% vs. 22.5%, p = 0.931), positivity for endomysial antibodies (8.8% vs. 6.0%, p = 0.237), histological recovery after one year (63.1% vs. 60.0%, p = 0.773), malignancy (4.8% vs. 3.3%, p = 0.420), osteoporosis/osteopenia (9.2% vs. 11.0%, p = 0.489), or fractures (26.9% vs. 27.9%, p = 0.791). The oat consumers had better SF-36 physical role limitations and general health scores. Based on our results, the long-term consumption of oats in celiac disease patients is safe and may improve quality of life.
31173891	Rate, Risk Factors, and Outcomes of Nonadherence in Pediatric Patients With Celiac Disease: A Systematic Review.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The only treatment for celiac disease is strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). We performed a systematic review to investigate the rate of adherence to a GFD in children with celiac disease, risk factors that affect adherence, and outcomes of non-adherence. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, EBSCO, and Scopus for studies through January 2019. We included observational studies of >=50 children diagnosed with celiac disease and recommended for placement on a GFD. We collected data on adherence assessment (self-report, serology tests, structured dietary interview, biopsies, or assays for gluten immunogenic peptides), risk factors, and outcomes related to adherence. Findings were presented with medians, range, and a narrative synthesis. RESULTS: We identified 703 studies; of these, 167 were eligible for full-text assessment and 49 were included in the final analysis, comprising 7850 children. Rates of adherence to a GFD ranged from 23% to 98%. Comparable rates (median rates of adherence, 75%-87%) were found irrespective of how assessments were performed. Adolescents were at risk of non-adherence and children whose parents had good knowledge about celiac disease adhered more strictly. Non-adherence associated with patient growth, symptoms, and quality of life. CONCLUSION: In a systematic review of 49 studies of children with celiac disease, we found substantial variation in adherence to a GFD among patients. Rate of adherence was not associated with method of adherence measurement, so all methods appear to be useful, with lack of consensus on the ideal metric. Studies are needed to determine the best method to ensure adherence and effects on long-term health.
36097404	Anti-inflammatory effects of vagal nerve stimulation with a special attention to intestinal barrier dysfunction.	The vagus nerve (VN), the longest nerve of the organism innervating the gastrointestinal tract, is a mixed nerve with anti-inflammatory properties through its afferents, activating the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis, and its efferents through the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNFalpha) by splenic and gut macrophages. In addition, the VN is also able to modulate the permeability of the intestinal barrier although the VN does not innervate directly the intestinal epithelium. Targeting the VN through VN stimulation (VNS) has been developed in experimental model of intestinal inflammation and in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and might be of interest to decrease intestinal permeability in gastrointestinal disorders with intestinal barrier defect such as IBD, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and celiac disease. In this issue of neurogastroenterology and motility, Mogilevski et al. report that a brief non-invasive transcutaneous auricular VNS in healthy volunteers consistently reduces the permeability of the small intestine induced by intravenous administration of the stress peptide corticotropin releasing hormone, known to increase intestinal permeability and to inhibit the VN. In this review, we outline the mechanistic underpinning the effect of stress, of the VN and VNS on intestinal permeability. In particular, the VN can act on intestinal permeability through enteric nerves, and/or cells such as enteric glial cells. We also review the existing evidence of the effects VNS on intestinal permeability in models such as burn intestinal injury and traumatic brain injury, which pave the way for future clinical trials in IBD, IBS, and celiac disease.
24137952	[Successful therapy for enteropathy-associated peripheral T-cell lymphoma using high-dose polychemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation].	Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL) is a rare disease that accounts for not more than 1.4% of all lymphomas. It is most common in Europe, followed by North America and Asia. The disease is associated with gluten-sensitive celiac disease in 50% of cases and divided into types I and II. Mean-dose CHOP-like therapy is ineffective, with a median overall survival of 7-10 months. With high-dose therapy, 5-year survival rates can be 60%, but it can be used in not more than half of the cases. This is associated with the serious somatic status of most patients at diagnosis and with a median age of 57-64 years. The article presents a literature review and a case of successful therapy in a 58-year-old patient with type I EATL using the mNHL-BFM-90 protocol and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
25499458	Celiac disease: an immune dysregulation syndrome.	Celiac disease is a chronic immune-mediated condition that develops in genetically predisposed individuals. It is characterized by the presence of circulating auto-antibodies in addition to an enteropathy and at times, other extra-intestinal manifestations triggered by exposure to the gliadin fraction of gluten, a family of proteins found in wheat, barley, and rye. There seems to be a rise in reported adverse reactions to gluten, an entity currently termed non-celiac gluten (or perhaps more accurately, wheat) sensitivity, where neither the enteropathy nor the auto-antibodies are present. Celiac disease has protean extra-intestinal manifestations, and an accurate diagnosis should be sought in people suffering from seemingly unrelated complaints, such as fatigue, anorexia, delayed puberty, short stature, decreased bone density, unusual skin rashes, unexplained iron deficiency, and infertility. The presence of an enteropathy, in conjunction with the positive serology, is considered the diagnostic gold standard for making the diagnosis of celiac disease. It is important to stress that the elimination of gluten, even in asymptomatic patients, brings about health benefits, particularly in relation to bone health, as well as a decrease in the incidence of small bowel malignancy, especially lymphoma. Better understanding of the pathophysiology of celiac disease and the molecular mechanisms involved in antigen recognition and processing has provided the impetus for the development of pharmacologic agents that might block the recognition of gluten and its conversion to a toxic antigenic target. Inhibition of tight junction dysregulation could also prevent or minimize the damage triggered by gluten. Work on genetically modified wheat cultivars has progressed, and the possibility of a vaccine to block the immune mediated trigger is being actively investigated. Education and guidance by a knowledgeable nutritionist or registered dietitian can go a long way in minimizing the stress and facilitating the acceptance of the diet and the life-style changes that it represents. 
36674460	New Developments in Celiac Disease Treatment.	Celiac disease (CD) is a common autoimmune disease affecting around 1% of the population. It consists of an immune-mediated enteropathy, triggered by gluten exposure in susceptible patients. All patients with CD, irrespective of the presence of symptoms, must endure a lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD). This is not an easy task due to a lack of awareness of the gluten content in foods and the extensive incorporation of gluten in processed foods. Furthermore, a GFD imposes a sense of limitation and might be associated with decreased quality of life in CD patients. This results in gluten contamination in the diet of four out of five celiac patients adhering to a GFD. Furthermore, one in three adult patients will report persistent symptoms and two in three will not achieve full histological recovery when on a GFD. In recent years, there has been extensive research conducted in the quest to find the holy grail of pharmacological treatment for CD. This review will present a concise description of the current rationale and main clinical trials related to CD drug therapy.
23936873	Clinical features and symptom recovery on a gluten-free diet in Canadian adults with celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease can present with mild or nongastrointestinal symptoms, and may escape timely recognition. The treatment of celiac disease involves a gluten-free diet, which is complex and challenging. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clinical features and symptom recovery on a gluten-free diet in a Canadian adult celiac population. METHODS: All adult members (n=10,693) of the two national celiac support organizations, the Canadian Celiac Association and Fondation quebecoise de la maladie coeliaque, were surveyed using a questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 5912 individuals (>=18 years of age) with biopsy-confirmed celiac disease and/or dermatitis herpetiformis completed the survey. The female to male ratio was 3:1, and mean (+- SD) age at diagnosis was 45.2 +- 16.4 years. Mean time to diagnosis after onset of symptoms was 12.0 +- 14.4 years. Abdominal pain and bloating (84.9%), extreme weakness/tiredness (74.2%), diarrhea (71.7%) and anemia (67.8%) were the most commonly reported symptoms at the time of diagnosis. Many respondents continued to experience symptoms after being on a gluten-free diet for >5 years. Sex differences were reported in clinical features before diagnosis, recovery after being on gluten-free diet and perceived quality of life, with women experiencing more difficulties than men. CONCLUSIONS: Delays in diagnosis of celiac disease in Canada remain unacceptably long despite wider availability of serological screening tests. Many patients report continuing symptoms despite adhering to a gluten-free diet for >5 years, with women experiencing more symptoms and a lower recovery rate than men. Awareness of celiac disease needs improvement, and follow-up with a physician and a dietitian is essential for all patients with celiac disease.
24852733	Histopathological findings in the oral mucosa of celiac patients.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by the ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible subjects. Although the small intestinal mucosa is the main site of the gut's involvement in CD, other mucosal surfaces belonging to the gastrointestinal tract and the gut-associated lymphoid tissue are known to be affected. AIM: Assuming that the oral mucosa could reflect the histopathological inflammatory alterations of the intestine in CD patients, this study wishes to assess the pattern of T-cell subsets in the oral mucosa of young adults with CD. METHODS: A group of 37 patients (age range 20-38 years; female: male ratio 28:9) with CD were enrolled. Out of 37 patients, 19 patients (group A) followed a gluten free diet (GFD) -2 patients from less than one year; 6 patients between 1 and 5 years; 11 patients more than 5 years- while 18 patients (group B) were still untreated. Fifteen healthy volunteers (age range 18-35 years, female: Male ratio 11:4) served as controls for the CD patients. Ethical approval for the research was granted by the Ethics Committee. Biopsy specimens were taken from normal looking oral mucosa. The immunohistochemical investigation was performed with monoclonal antibodies to CD3, CD4, CD8, and gamma/delta-chains T cell receptor (TCR). RESULTS: The T-lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate was significantly (p < 0.0001) increased in group B (both compared with group A and with the control group). CONCLUSION: This study confirms the oral cavity to be a site of involvement of CD and its possible diagnostic potentiality in this disease.
38769762	Outcome in pediatric celiac disease is independent of the diagnostic approach in patients with high antibody levels.	OBJECTIVES: European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition guidelines enable the diagnosis of celiac disease (CD) without biopsies in patients with immunoglobulin A (IgA)-antibodies against tissue transglutaminase (TGA-IgA) >= 10x the upper limit of normal (ULN) and positivity of endomysial antibodies in a second blood sample. Limited data exist comparing the biopsy versus the nonbiopsy diagnostic approach regarding long-term outcomes in CD patients. Our study aimed to investigate the influence of the diagnostic approach on adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD), serological remission (defined as normalization of TGA-IgA during follow-up (FU)) and clinical remission in CD patients with TGA-IgA >= 10x ULN. METHODS: Retrospective multicenter study. Patients with CD and TGA-IgA >= 10x ULN at diagnosis were included in the study. Patients with confirmed diagnosis by biopsy were compared to patients diagnosed by nonbiopsy approach using univariate analysis, Kaplan-Meier survival curve, and logistic regression models. RESULTS: A total of 282 CD patients (192 [68.1%] in the biopsy group; 90 [31.9%] in the nonbiopsy group) were analyzed. The median time to normalization of TGA-IgA was 16.5 months [interquartile range, IQR: 13, 28] in the biopsy and 15 months [IQR: 12, 26] in the nonbiopsy group; p = 0.14). Rates of normalized TGA-IgA at first to third-year FU were comparable between both groups. Adherence to GFD did not seem to be influenced by the diagnostic approach. CONCLUSIONS: The nonbiopsy approach is not inferior to the biopsy approach in terms of adherence to GFD and serological remission in patients with CD.
22877432	Unrecognized and unappreciated secondary causes of osteoporosis.	There are a substantial number of secondary causes of osteoporosis that can be identified through appropriate evaluation. Unrecognized celiac disease, Monoclonal gamopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), impaired renal function, diabetes mellitus, and renal tubular acidosis are just a few of the more common secondary causes of osteoporosis. Through targeted laboratory tests, many secondary causes of osteoporosis can be identified.
30346951	Pancreatic autoimmunity: An unknown etiology on patients with assisted reproductive techniques (ART)-recurrent reproductive failure.	Pancreatic Autoimmunity is defined as the presence of autoantibodies and more frequent need for insulin treatment. Affected women presenting recurrent implantation failure (RIF) or recurrent miscarriage (RM) are often misdiagnosed. The objective of thestudy was to describe clinical and metabolic profiles suggestive of Pancreatic Autoimmunity and therapeutic strategy in patients with RIF/RM. We analyzed retrospectively 735 patients, and have identified a subset (N = 20) with similar metabolic characteristics. At the same time, we included a control group (n = 39), with similar demographic characteristics and negative for pancreatic, thyroid or celiac disease autoimmunity. The patients identified with autoimmune metabolic problem (N = 20) had relatives with diabetes mellitus. At 120 minutes after Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) low level of insulin secretion (<2 IU/ml) was found in 70% of patients. Glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD 65) antibodies, with or without other autoantibodies, were positive in80% of patients and anti-IA2 alone were positive I the rest. Since pregestational period, insulin administration was recommended for 10 patients, metformin for 4 patients and exclusively diet control in 5 of them. Significantly increased live bith rates (LBR) per cycle were observed after metabolic control (52%) compared with live birth rate (LBR) after cycles without control (7.5%) (p<0.0001). We noticed 2 cases of pre-eclampsia and 6 low-birth weights. Insulin administration was needed during the pregnancy in 68% of patients and after childbirth in 31.57% of them. In our control group, all of patients (n = 39) underwent ART (53.8% SET and 46.1% DET) with a 50% (SET) and 61.9% (DET) live birth rate (LBR) per cycle. Patients with RIF/RM, normal BMI, low insulin levels after OGTT could benefit from additional metabolic immune testing. A correct diagnosis and treatment could have a positive impact on their reproductive results and live birth rate.

37299417	Determinants of Adherence to a Gluten-Free Diet in Children with Celiac Disease and the Influence of the Methods Used to Assess It.	Lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) is the cornerstone of management of celiac disease (CD), but adhering to a GFD can be hard. Although several factors are positively associated with adherence of pediatric CD patients to a GFD, it is unknown whether these are influenced by variability caused by the specific tool used to assess adherence to a GFD. Here, we aimed to evaluate how individual patient characteristics and dietary counselling by a trained dietitian influence adherence to a GFD in children with CD, as assessed by two validated questionnaires: the Biagi questionnaire and the Leffler short questionnaire adapted for pediatric patients. Some 139 children and adolescents were recruited in a cross-sectional, multicenter study. Concordance between the two questionnaires in defining adherence was fair (weighted Cohen's kappa coefficient 0.39, 95%CI 0.19-0.60). Upon regression analysis, having a cohabiting family member with CD, being of Italian origin, and receiving specialized dietary counselling during follow-up were found to positively influence stricter adherence to a GFD for children with CD. Neither questionnaire detected a significant relationship between adherence to a GFD and the presence of symptoms after gluten ingestion. This study provides important new data on the factors influencing GFD adherence in the pediatric population, and highlights the importance of dietician input and overcoming language and cultural barriers when educating patients.
25701700	Small Amounts of Gluten in Subjects With Suspected Nonceliac Gluten Sensitivity: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Cross-Over Trial.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: There is debate over the existence of nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms in response to ingestion of gluten-containing foods by people without celiac disease or wheat allergy. We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial to determine the effects of administration of low doses of gluten to subjects with suspected NCGS. METHODS: We enrolled 61 adults without celiac disease or a wheat allergy who believed ingestion of gluten-containing food to be the cause of their intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms. Participants were assigned randomly to groups given either 4.375 g/day gluten or rice starch (placebo) for 1 week, each via gastrosoluble capsules. After a 1-week gluten-free diet, participants crossed over to the other group. The primary outcome was the change in overall (intestinal and extraintestinal) symptoms, determined by established scoring systems, between gluten and placebo intake. A secondary outcome was the change in individual symptom scores between gluten vs placebo. RESULTS: According to the per-protocol analysis of data from the 59 patients who completed the trial, intake of gluten significantly increased overall symptoms compared with placebo (P = .034). Abdominal bloating (P = .040) and pain (P = .047), among the intestinal symptoms, and foggy mind (P = .019), depression (P = .020), and aphthous stomatitis (P = .025), among the extraintestinal symptoms, were significantly more severe when subjects received gluten than placebo. CONCLUSIONS: In a cross-over trial of subjects with suspected NCGS, the severity of overall symptoms increased significantly during 1 week of intake of small amounts of gluten, compared with placebo. Clinical trial no: ISRCTN72857280.

35807860	Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity and Protective Role of Dietary Polyphenols.	Pathogenetically characterized by the absence of celiac disease and wheat allergy, non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a clinical entity triggered by the consumption of gluten-containing foods that relieved by a gluten-free diet. Since it is very difficult to maintain a complete gluten-free diet, there is a high interest in discovering alternative strategies aimed at reducing gluten concentration or mitigating its toxic effects. Plant-based dietary models are usually rich in bioactive compounds, such as polyphenols, recognized to prevent, delay, or even reverse chronic diseases, including intestinal disorders. However, research on the role of polyphenols in mitigating the toxicity of gluten-containing foods is currently limited. We address the metabolic fate of dietary polyphenols, both as free and bound macromolecule-linked forms, with particular reference to the gastrointestinal compartment, where the concentration of polyphenols can reach high levels. We analyze the potential targets of polyphenols including the gluten peptide bioavailability, the dysfunction of the intestinal epithelial barrier, intestinal immune response, oxidative stress and inflammation, and dysbiosis. Overall, this review provides an updated overview of the effects of polyphenols as possible dietary strategies to counteract the toxic effects of gluten, potentially resulting in the improved quality of life of patients with gluten-related disorders.
24710505	Novel role of the serine protease inhibitor elafin in gluten-related disorders.	OBJECTIVES: Elafin, an endogenous serine protease inhibitor, modulates colonic inflammation. We investigated the role of elafin in celiac disease (CD) using human small intestinal tissues and in vitro assays of gliadin deamidation. We also investigated the potential beneficial effects of elafin in a mouse model of gluten sensitivity. METHODS: Epithelial elafin expression in the small intestine of patients with active CD, treated CD, and controls without CD was determined by immunofluorescence. Interaction of elafin with human tissue transglutaminase-2 (TG-2) was investigated in vitro. The 33-mer peptide, a highly immunogenic gliadin peptide, was incubated with TG-2 and elafin at different concentrations. The degree of deamidation of the 33-mer peptide was analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Elafin was delivered to the intestine of gluten-sensitive mice using a recombinant Lactococcus lactis vector. Small intestinal barrier function, inflammation, proteolytic activity, and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) expression were assessed. RESULTS: Elafin expression in the small intestinal epithelium was lower in patients with active CD compared with control patients. In vitro, elafin significantly slowed the kinetics of the deamidation of the 33-mer peptide to its more immunogenic form. Treatment of gluten-sensitive mice with elafin delivered by the L. lactis vector normalized inflammation, improved permeability, and maintained ZO-1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: The decreased elafin expression in the small intestine of patients with active CD, the reduction of 33-mer peptide deamidation by elafin, coupled to the barrier enhancing and anti-inflammatory effects observed in gluten-sensitive mice, suggest that this molecule may have pathophysiological and therapeutic importance in gluten-related disorders.
29351811	Rate and determinants of non-adherence to a gluten-free diet and nutritional status assessment in children and adolescents with celiac disease in a tertiary Brazilian referral center: a cross-sectional and retrospective study.	BACKGROUND: Compliance with a gluten-free diet (GFD) is difficult at all ages but particularly for teenagers due to social, cultural, economic, and practical pressures. The multidisciplinary team responsible for the treatment of patients with celiac disease and give support to their parents plays a special role on strengthening GFD and assessing the nutritional and physical health. METHODS: A cross-sectional and retrospective study including patients under 20 years of age, with biopsy-confirmed CD, followed regularly at the Department of Pediatrics, Division of Gastroenterology, Hospital das Clinicas, University of Sao Paulo, School of Medicine, Sao Paulo, Brazil, were surveyed using a questionnaire and serologic test applied between November 2011 and February 2012. A retrospective chart review of these patients was performed to collect the anthropometric data along with the results of the serologic test performed at the time of diagnosis and after at least 1 year of treatment with a GFD. RESULTS: We evaluated 35 patients aged between 2.4 and 19.9 years. Of these 68.6% were female, 88.6% had the typical form of the disease and 51.4% had other comorbidities. The mean age at diagnosis was 5.4 years. Despite dietary guidance, 20% reported non-adherence to the diet. Most children recovered the weight and height deficit after 5 years of treatment, and in some children, excessive weight gain became a concern. CONCLUSION: The majority of transgressions occurred intentionally at home or at parties. There was a risk of excessive weight gain, especially in the first two years of treatment. More alternatives and easier access to low cost gluten-free foods, increasing the discussion about the benefits of adhering to a GFD among patients, families, and the general population, besides the acquisition of self-management skills, are crucial to fostering independent children and adolescents who have the knowledge and tools to manage life with CD.
32459902	[Gluten-free diet in the treatment of extra-intestinal forms of gluten intolerance].	Following a gluten-free diet is recommended by clinical guidelines in the presence of gluten intolerance. However, due to the variety of clinical picture of various forms of intolerance, the elimination of gluten occurs not always timely. There are also diseases that classic treatment regimen does not include diet therapy, however, studies have confirmed the effectiveness of its use. The aim of the research - to study current data on the effectiveness of a gluten-free diet for extra-intestinal manifestations of gluten intolerance. Material and methods. Literature data concerning the effectiveness of including a gluten-free diet in the treatment of various diseases according to the PubMed and eLIBRARY portal were studied. Results. Modern data on the forms of gluten intolerance and their clinical manifestations are presented. The results of both randomized studies and individual clinical cases of gluten intolerance that occurred under the guise of other diseases are presented. A clinical case of an acute onset of the disease - celiac crisis, accompanied by acute diarrheal syndrome with subsequent malabsorption and progressive loss of body weight, anasarca and electrolyte disorders is considered. Neurological and psycho-neurological manifestations of celiac disease are described, including current data on the results of including a glutenfree diet in the treatment of autism spectrum disorders. The question of using dietary therapy for autism remains controversial to nowadays. The article outlines the arguments of supporters and opponents of excluding gluten in this pathology. Particular attention is paid to the diagnosis of gluten intolerance in patients with hematological disorders. The significance of a complete survey to identify celiac disease and timely diet therapy of the disease under stunted growth in children, after excluding other causes of malabsorption and even in the presence of negative serological markers of celiac disease is shown. The article also contains information on the pathology of kidneys and reproductive system, which were leveled only after the exclusion of gluten from the diet. Conclusion. The presented cases demonstrate a wide variety of clinical forms of gluten intolerance, examples of diagnostic search and dynamics of the clinical picture with the timely appointment of a gluten-free diet are given.
22037405	[Treatment perspectives].	Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory enteropathy caused by the ingestion of gluten. A safe and efficient but unpleasant treatment exists for CD in form of a strict gluten-free diet. Thus, there is a need for new treatment strategies, which are based on the improved and advanced understanding of the pathophysiology of CD. The first strategy consists in reducing or even eliminating major antigenic motifs in gluten, responsible for the inflammatory reaction. The use of less immunogenic wheat was suggested but this seems rather difficult to realize. However, a complete digestion of the immunogenic parts of gluten looks very promising. This can be obtained by the use of polymers, capable to sequester gluten proteins or even better via the exogenous administration of propyl-endopeptidases, with two different enzymes under development. Another approach could be the use of inhibitors of tissue transglutaminase, a strategy which is under clinical investigation. Alternatively, inhibition of the site of liaison of immunostimulatory peptides with HLA molecules was suggested and is also under investigation in vivo. For patients suffering from refractory sprue, the inhibition of IL15 might be of therapeutic interest with the hope to improve the fatal outcome of many of these patients. However, the ultimate treatment approach is in form of prevention and the role of infectious agents, such as Rotavirus, in disease onset has to be considered.
33317091	Influence of HLA-DQ2.5 Dose on Clinical Picture of Unrelated Celiac Disease Patients.	The clinical phenotype of celiac disease varies considerably among patients and the dosage of HLA-DQ2.5 alleles has been suggested to be a contributing factor. We investigated whether HLA-DQ2.5 allele dosage is associated with distinct clinical parameters at the time of diagnosis and with patients' response to a gluten-free diet. The final cohort included 605 carefully phenotyped non-related Finnish celiac disease patients grouped as having 0, 1 or 2 copies of HLA-DQ2.5. Clinical data at the time of diagnosis and during gluten-free diet were collected systematically from medical records and supplementary interviews. An increasing HLA-DQ2.5 dose effect was detected for celiac disease antibody positivity at diagnosis (p = 0.021) and for the presence of any first-degree relatives with celiac disease (p = 0.011 and p = 0.031, respectively). Instead, DQ2.5-negative patients were suffering most often from classical symptoms at diagnosis (p = 0.007 between HLA groups). In addition, during follow-up they were most often symptomatic despite a gluten-free diet (p = 0.002 between groups). Our results thus suggest that increasing HLA-DQ2.5 dose only has a minor effect on the clinical picture of celiac disease. However, HLA-DQ2.5-negative patients should not be overlooked in clinical practice and particular attention should be paid to this patient group during gluten-free diet.
27363236	Contemporary Dietary Practices: FODMAPs and Beyond.	There is no diet that is recommended for all individuals. Some special diets (eg, gluten-free for celiac disease) are necessary for health and quality of life. Other diets may be recommended for a short period of time to aid in symptom relief but may not be recommended for the long- term (eg, LFD). Popular diets continue to come and go with varying levels of success. When considering adolescents, continued growth and development are most important, and restrictive diets can lead to nutrient inadequacies and poor growth. Before making any recommendation, it is important to consider the goal of the diet and the cost versus benefits associated with following the diet. Adherence is always a challenge, regardless of the type of diet implemented. If a special diet is not warranted for the health, safety, and desired quality of life of the individual, it should not be implemented.
25961322	Bones of contention: bone mineral density recovery in celiac disease--a systematic review.	Metabolic bone disease is a frequent co-morbidity in newly diagnosed adults with celiac disease (CD), an autoimmune disorder triggered by the ingestion of dietary gluten. This systematic review of studies looked at the efficacy of the gluten-free diet, physical activity, nutrient supplementation, and bisphosphonates for low bone density treatment. Case control and cohort designs were identified from PubMed and other academic databases (from 1996 to 2015) that observed newly diagnosed adults with CD for at least one year after diet treatment using the dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan. Only 20 out of 207 studies met the inclusion criteria. Methodological quality was assessed using the Strengthening of the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement checklist. Gluten-free diet adherence resulted in partial recovery of bone density by one year in all studies, and full recovery by the fifth year. No treatment differences were observed between the gluten-free diet alone and diet plus bisphosphonates in one study. For malnourished patients, supplementation with vitamin D and calcium resulted in significant improvement. Evidence for the impact of physical activity on bone density was limited. Therapeutic strategies aimed at modifying lifestyle factors throughout the lifespan should be studied. 
31393225	Insights in the Evaluation of Gluten Dietary Avoidance in Healthy Subjects.	Background: The amount of healthy subjects adopting a gluten-free diet (GFD) for nonmedical reasons actually surpasses the numbers of those who are dealing with a permanent gluten-related disorder.Objective: The study aimed to better clarify the interactions between a GFD and physical and psychological well-being.Methods: Sixty healthy subjects with normal weight were enrolled. Thirty subjects (15 female) were submitted to a normocaloric GFD and considered as the experimental group (EG), and 30 subjects (15 female) were submitted to a normocaloric diet (CG) for 6 months. The hematochemical and psychological parameters before and after the diet were recorded.Results: Significant improvement was demonstrated in red blood count, hemoglobin, total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein parameters in the EG after the gluten-free diet. However, a significant increase of alpha-amylase pancreatic activity and reduction of vitamin B12 and magnesium levels in the EG were observed. Regarding the psychological parameters, the GFD significantly improved scores assessing body satisfaction, but increased social insecurity.Conclusions: The study is the first to consider significant modulation in hematochemical parameters as well as psychological ones by gluten avoidance in healthy individuals. Although these subjects were not characterized by intestinal mucosa damage, some of the effects were similar to those observed in celiac disease patients who began to adhere to a GFD.
33122841	HLA class II genes in precision-based care of childhood diseases: what we can learn from celiac disease.	Celiac disease (CeD) is a chronic immuno-mediated enteropathy caused by dietary gluten with marked autoimmunity traits. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II heterodimers represent the main predisposing factor, although environmental agents, as viral infection, gut microbiota, and dietary regimen, also contribute to CeD risk. These molecules are involved in autoimmunity as they present self-antigens to autoreactive T cells that have escaped the thymic negative selection. In CeD, the HLA class II risk alleles, DQA1*05-DQB1*02 and DQA1*03-DQB1*03, encode for DQ2.5 and DQ8 heterodimers, and, furthermore, disease susceptibility was found strictly dependent on the dose of these genes. This finding questioned how the expression of HLA-DQ risk genes, and of relative surface protein on antigen-presenting cells, might be relevant for the magnitude of anti-gluten inflammatory response in CeD patients, and impact the natural history of disease, its pathomechanisms, and compliance to dietary treatment. In this scenario, new personalized medical approaches will be desirable to support an early, accurate, and non-invasive diagnosis, and to define genotype-guided preventive and therapeutic strategies for CeD. To reach this goal, a stratification of genetic risk, disease outcome, and therapy compliance based on HLA genotypes, DQ2.5/DQ8 expression measurement and magnitude of T cell response to gluten is mandatory. IMPACT: This article revises the current knowledge on how different HLA haplotypes, carrying the DQ2.5/DQ8 risk alleles, impact the onset of CeD. This review discusses how the expression of susceptibility HLA-DQ genes can determine the risk assessment, outcome, and prevention of CeD. The recent insights on the environmental factors contributing to CeD in childhood are reviewed. This review discusses the use of HLA risk gene expression as a tool to support medical precision approaches for an early and non-invasive diagnosis of CeD, and to define genotype-guided preventive and therapeutic strategies.
22388615	A child with atypical celiac disease and recurrent urolithiasis.	A young boy with prior constipation developed recurrent severe calcium phosphate kidney calculi, sometimes sufficient to cause acute kidney failure and hydronephrosis. After several major surgeries, food allergies were determined by serum immunoglobulin E testing, and when he finally went on a gluten-free diet, he stopped forming calculi and has had no surgeries related to kidney calculi since. Hyperoxaluria was not identified in this child by 24-hour urine analysis, unlike most other reports of kidney calculus formation in individuals with gluten intolerance.
22899947	Reintroduction of gluten following flour transamidation in adult celiac patients: a randomized, controlled clinical study.	A lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD) is mandatory for celiac disease (CD) but has poor compliance, justifying novel strategies. We found that wheat flour transamidation inhibited IFN-gamma secretion by intestinal T cells from CD patients. Herein, the primary endpoint was to evaluate the ability of transamidated gluten to maintain GFD CD patients in clinical remission. Secondary endpoints were efficacy in prevention of the inflammatory response and safety at the kidney level, where reaction products are metabolized. In a randomized single blinded, controlled 90-day trial, 47 GFD CD patients received 3.7 g/day of gluten from nontransamidated (12) or transamidated (35) flour. On day 15, 75% and 37% of patients in the control and experimental groups, respectively, showed clinical relapse (P = 0.04) whereas intestinal permeability was mainly altered in the control group (50% versus 20%, P = 0.06). On day 90, 0 controls and 14 patients in the experimental group completed the challenge with no variation of antitransglutaminase IgA (P = 0.63), Marsh-Oberhuber grading (P = 0.08), or intestinal IFN-gamma mRNA (P > 0.05). Creatinine clearance did not vary after 90 days of treatment (P = 0.46). In conclusion, transamidated gluten reduced the number of clinical relapses in challenged patients with no changes of baseline values for serological/mucosal CD markers and an unaltered kidney function.
31755668	Complementary feeding: new styles versus old myths.	Early life feeding habits may potentially alter future metabolic programming and body composition. Complementary feeding is the period of time when infants introduce food different from milk in their diet, together with a gradual reduction of the intake of milk (either breast milk or formula), to finally acquire the diet model of their family. This period is important in the transition of the infant from milk feeding to family foods, and is necessary for both nutritional and developmental reasons. The timing for introducing complementary foods and the method of feeding have changed over time. Available literature data show increasing interest and concerns about the impact of complementary feeding timing and modality on the onset of later non-communicable disorders, such as overweight and obesity, allergic diseases, celiac disease, or diabetes. While international scientific guidelines on complementary feeding have been published, many baby food companies' websites, blogs, and books, in most European countries exist. The aim of this manuscript is to look over current recommendations, and to revise "old myths." The adoption of an adequate weaning method is a cornerstone in the development of life-long health status. A correct strategy could reduce the risk of feeding disorders and other health problems later in life.
22903368	Celiac disease presentation in a tertiary referral centre in India: current scenario.	BACKGROUND: Nondiarrheal celiac disease (NDCD) is being increasingly reported but data from India is limited. AIM: We undertook this study to compare the clinical spectrum of NDCD with that of diarrheal/classical celiac disease (CCD). METHOD: This facility-based retrospective observational study included consecutive patients diagnosed with celiac disease (CD) (as per modified ESPGHAN criteria) from October 2009 to August 2011. RESULTS: A total of 381 patients were diagnosed with CD during the study period. NDCD was present in 192 (51.8 %). NDCD had higher mean age at presentation (5.8 +- 2.8 vs. 6.9 +- 2.9 years respectively; p = 0.003) and longer duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis (2.9 +- 1.7 years vs. 3.6 +- 2.2 years; p = 0.02) as compared to CCD. In the NDCD group, the most frequent gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms were recurrent abdominal pain [122 (63.5 %)] and abdominal distension [102 (53.1 %)] followed by constipation [48 (25 %)], vomiting [76 (39.6 %)] and recurrent oral ulcers [89 (46.4 %)]. Vomiting and constipation were more frequently seen in NDCD as compared to CCD (p < 0.001 in both). Commonly enumerated extraintestinal manifestations in NDCD included failure to thrive [109 (56.8 %)], isolated short stature [36 (18.8 %)], persistent anemia [83 (43.2 %)] and hepatomegaly/splenomegaly or both [56 (29.2 %)]. Associated comorbidities included autoimmune thyroiditis [11 (5.7 %)], type 1 diabetes mellitus [8 (4.2 %)], bronchial asthma [23 (11.9 %)], idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis [4 (2.1 %)], Down's syndrome [3 (1.6 %)], alopecia areata [6 (3.1 %)], polyarthritis [2 (1.0 %)], dermatitis herpetiformis [6 (3.1 %)] and chronic liver disease [6 (3.1 %)]. The number of patients with a Marsh score IIIb and above of duodenal biopsy was significantly more in the CCD group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: NDCD is not uncommon in India. Long-term follow up is needed to evaluate the impact of the disease and of treatment in these children.
32109493	Impact of gastrointestinal physiology on drug absorption in special populations--An UNGAP review.	The release and absorption profile of an oral medication is influenced by the physicochemical properties of the drug and its formulation, as well as by the anatomy and physiology of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. During drug development the bioavailability of a new drug is typically assessed in early clinical studies in a healthy adult population. However, many disease conditions are associated with an alteration of the anatomy and/or physiology of the GI tract. The same holds true for some subpopulations, such as paediatric or elderly patients, or populations with different ethnicity. The variation in GI tract conditions compared to healthy adults can directly affect the kinetics of drug absorption, and thus, safety and efficacy of an oral medication. This review provides an overview of GI tract properties in special populations compared to healthy adults and discusses how drug absorption is affected by these conditions. Particular focus is directed towards non-disease dependent conditions (age, sex, ethnicity, genetic factors, obesity, pregnancy), GI diseases (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, celiac disease, cancer in the GI tract, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, lactose intolerance, Helicobacter pylori infection, and infectious diseases of the GI tract), as well as systemic diseases that change the GI tract conditions (cystic fibrosis, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, HIV enteropathy, and critical illness). The current knowledge about GI conditions in special populations and their impact on drug absorption is still limited. Further research is required to improve confidence in pharmacokinetic predictions and dosing recommendations in the targeted patient population, and thus to ensure safe and effective drug therapies.
28338063	Greater postprandial glucose excursions and inadequate nutrient intake in youth with type 1 diabetes and celiac disease.	The gluten free diet (GFD) has a high glycemic index and low-fiber content, which potentially influences glycemic excursions in type 1 diabetes (T1D) and celiac disease (CD). Participants in this case-control study of youth with T1D+CD (n = 10) and T1D only (n = 7) wore blinded continuous glucose monitoring systems for six days. Blood glucose levels (BGLs) were compared between groups for each meal, including pre-meal, peak, 2-hour postprandial and time-to-peak. Participants consumed a test-breakfast of GF cereal and milk for three days and kept weighed food diaries; nutrient intake was analyzed and compared to national recommendations. Youth with T1D+CD had shorter time-to-peak BGL (77 vs 89 mins, P = 0.03), higher peak (9.3 vs 7.3 mmol/L, P = 0.001) and higher postprandial BGLs than T1D (8.4 vs 7.0 mmol/L, P = 0.01), despite similar pre-meal BGLs (9.2 vs 8.6 mmol/L, P = 0.28). Regarding test breakfast, greater pre and post-meal BGL difference correlated with longer CD duration (R = 0.53, P = 0.01). Total energy and macronutrient intake didn't differ between groups; however the majority of participants collectively had inadequate intake of calcium (76%), folate (71%) and fiber (53%), with excessive saturated fat (12%) and sodium (>2,000 mg/day). The GFD is associated with greater glycemic excursions and inadequate nutritional intake in youth with T1D+CD. Clinical management should address both glycemic variability and dietary quality.
25639558	Celiac disease evolving into dermatitis herpetiformis in patients adhering to normal or gluten-free diet.	OBJECTIVE: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a cutaneous form of celiac disease affecting ~ 17% of celiac disease patients. The aim was to determine how often celiac disease precedes the development of DH, and what is the impact of gluten-free diet (GFD) in this phenotype change. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Our prospectively collected DH series from 1970 comprised 514 patients. We analyzed all DH patients who at least 2 years earlier had been diagnosed with celiac disease. DH diagnosis was confirmed by showing immunoglobulin A deposits in dermis. Serological and small bowel mucosal findings were analyzed, and the strictness of GFD treatment before and after the diagnosis of DH was evaluated. RESULTS: Twenty (4%) DH patients had a prior diagnosis of celiac disease. The median time interval between celiac disease and DH detection was 9.5 years. Before DH appeared 4 patients had been on a normal gluten-containing diet, 10 had dietary lapses on a GFD, and 6 were on a strict GFD. Celiac autoantibodies were positive in 7 out of 19 patients, and 5 out of 7 undergoing small bowel biopsy had partial villous atrophy. Following DH diagnosis the rash was controlled after a median of 6 months on a strict GFD. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with celiac disease may develop DH by time. This is most often an indicator of poor adherence to GFD, and a rigorous dietary intervention is necessary. In the majority of cases, DH will be detected without prior celiac disease diagnosis, but the physicians should recognize this phenotype alteration.
22318493	Oral tolerance to food protein.	Oral tolerance is the state of local and systemic immune unresponsiveness that is induced by oral administration of innocuous antigen such as food proteins. An analogous but more local process also regulates responses to commensal bacteria in the large intestine and, together, mucosally induced tolerance appears to prevent intestinal disorders such as food allergy, celiac disease, and inflammatory bowel diseases. Here we discuss the anatomical basis of antigen uptake and recognition in oral tolerance and highlight possible mechanisms underlying the immunosuppression. We propose a model of stepwise induction of oral tolerance in which specialized populations of mucosal dendritic cells and the unique microenvironment of draining mesenteric lymph nodes combine to generate regulatory T cells that undergo subsequent expansion in the small intestinal lamina propria. The local and systemic effects of these regulatory T cells prevent potentially dangerous hypersensitivity reactions to harmless antigens derived from the intestine and hence are crucial players in immune homeostasis.
26371035	Seronegative Celiac Disease and Immunoglobulin Deficiency: Where to Look in the Submerged Iceberg?	In the present narrative review, we analyzed the relationship between seronegative celiac disease (SNCD) and immunoglobulin deficiencies. For this purpose, we conducted a literature search on the main medical databases. SNCD poses a diagnostic dilemma. Villous blunting, intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) count and gluten "challenge" are the most reliable markers. Immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence tissue transglutaminase (tTG)-targeted mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA) immune complexes in the intestinal mucosa of SNCD patients may be useful. In our experience, tTG-mRNA was similarly increased in seropositive celiac disease (CD) and suspected SNCD, and strongly correlated with the IELs count. This increase is found even in the IELs' range of 15-25/100 enterocytes, suggesting that there may be a "grey zone" of gluten-related disorders. An immune deregulation (severely lacking B-cell differentiation) underlies the association of SNCD with immunoglobulin deficiencies. Therefore, CD may be linked to autoimmune disorders and immune deficits (common variable immunodeficiency (CVID)/IgA selective deficiency). CVID is a heterogeneous group of antibodies dysfunction, whose association with CD is demonstrated only by the response to a gluten-free diet (GFD). We hypothesized a familial inheritance between CD and CVID. Selective IgA deficiency, commonly associated with CD, accounts for IgA-tTG seronegativity. Selective IgM deficiency (sIgMD) is rare (<300 cases) and associated to CD in 5% of cases. We diagnosed SNCD in a patient affected by sIgMD using the tTG-mRNA assay. One-year GFD induced IgM restoration. This evidence, supporting a link between SNCD and immunoglobulin deficiencies, suggests that we should take a closer look at this association. 
35418551	Survey-Based Study on Food Insecurity During COVID-19 for Households With Children on a Prescribed Gluten-Free Diet.	Gluten-free (GF) foods are generally costlier than their gluten-containing counterparts. We conducted an anonymous electronic survey to assess food insecurity in households with a child on a prescribed GF diet and how this relates to GF diet adherence during the COVID-19 pandemic. The proportion of households who screened positive using the Hunger Vital Sign was similar to national rates (19%-24%). Approximately 5% of families who screened food secure reported GF food insecurity. Parent-reported intentional gluten consumption due to limited GF food availability in the household increased during the pandemic (7.5%). Food insecurity should be considered in the management of celiac disease.
21523256	Advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of celiac disease.	
21390139	Primary gastrointestinal lymphoma.	Gastrointestinal tract is the most common extranodal site involved by lymphoma with the majority being non-Hodgkin type. Although lymphoma can involve any part of the gastrointestinal tract, the most frequent sites in order of its occurrence are the stomach followed by small intestine and ileocecal region. Gastrointestinal tract lymphoma is usually secondary to the widespread nodal diseases and primary gastrointestinal tract lymphoma is relatively rare. Gastrointestinal lymphomas are usually not clinically specific and indistinguishable from other benign and malignant conditions. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common pathological type of gastrointestinal lymphoma in essentially all sites of the gastrointestinal tract, although recently the frequency of other forms has also increased in certain regions of the world. Although some radiological features such as bulky lymph nodes and maintenance of fat plane are more suggestive of lymphoma, they are not specific, thus mandating histopathological analysis for its definitive diagnosis. There has been a tremendous leap in the diagnosis, staging and management of gastrointestinal lymphoma in the last two decades attributed to a better insight into its etiology and molecular aspect as well as the knowledge about its critical signaling pathways.
37447198	Metabolomic Profiling in Children with Celiac Disease: Beyond the Gluten-Free Diet.	Celiac disease (CD) is included in the group of complex or multifactorial diseases, i.e., those caused by the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. Despite a growing understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease, diagnosis is still often delayed and there are no effective biomarkers for early diagnosis. The only current treatment, a gluten-free diet (GFD), can alleviate symptoms and restore intestinal villi, but its cellular effects remain poorly understood. To gain a comprehensive understanding of CD's progression, it is crucial to advance knowledge across various scientific disciplines and explore what transpires after disease onset. Metabolomics studies hold particular significance in unravelling the complexities of multifactorial and multisystemic disorders, where environmental factors play a significant role in disease manifestation and progression. By analyzing metabolites, we can gain insights into the reasons behind CD's occurrence, as well as better comprehend the impact of treatment initiation on patients. In this review, we present a collection of articles that showcase the latest breakthroughs in the field of metabolomics in pediatric CD, with the aim of trying to identify CD biomarkers for both early diagnosis and treatment monitoring. These advancements shed light on the potential of metabolomic analysis in enhancing our understanding of the disease and improving diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. More studies need to be designed to cover metabolic profiles in subjects at risk of developing the disease, as well as those analyzing biomarkers for follow-up treatment with a GFD.
21147329	An electronic tongue for gliadins semi-quantitative detection in foodstuffs.	An all-solid-state potentiometric electronic tongue with 36 polymeric membranes has been used for the first time to detect gliadins, which are primarily responsible for gluten intolerance in people suffering from celiac disease. A linear discriminant model, based on the signals of 11 polymeric membranes, selected from the 36 above using a stepwise procedure, was used to semi-quantitatively classify samples of a "Gluten-free" foodstuff (baby milked flour), previously contaminated with known amounts of gliadins (<10, 20-50 or >50mg/kg), as "Gluten-free", "Low-Gluten content" or "Gluten-containing". For this food matrix, the device had sensitivity towards gliadins of 1-2mg/kg and overall sensitivity and specificity of 77% and 78%, respectively. Moreover, the device never identified an ethanolic extract containing gliadins as "Gluten-free". Finally, the system also allowed distinguishing "Gluten-free" and "Gluten-containing" foodstuffs (15 foods, including breads, flours, baby milked flours, cookies and breakfast cereals) with an overall sensitivity and specificity greater than 83%, using the signals of only 4 selected polymeric membranes (selected using a stepwise procedure). Since only one "Gluten-containing" foodstuff was misclassified as "Gluten-free", the device could be used as a preliminary tool for quality control of foods for celiac patients.
34579108	Quality of Life and Psychological Disorders in Coeliac Disease: A Prospective Multicentre Study.	Coeliac disease (CeD) has been associated with psychological disorders and reduced quality of life. Our prospective study evaluated the changes in the quality of life, anxiety and depression in CeD patients up to two years after diagnosis. We recruited adult patients residing in the Veneto region with a new diagnosis of CeD. Several validated questionnaires were administered to measure quality of life, psychological symptoms and adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) at the time of diagnosis and after 1 and 2 years. Ninety-three patients reached the 1-year follow-up (81.7% were females with a median age at diagnosis of 35 years), and 55 patients reached the 2-year follow-up. We observed a significant improvement in quality of life, anxiety and depression scores at 1 year after diagnosis, particularly in patients who complied with a GFD. The improvements among classical CeD patients were similar to those observed in nonclassical patients except for anxiety, which improved only in patients with a classical presentation at diagnosis. Age, sex and other disease factors did not affect the change in quality of life (QoL) or other mood disorders. Most of the improvements measured 1 year after diagnosis and 2 years after diagnosis were not significant. In conclusion, QoL and mood disorders must be considered, and psychological counselling should be used when needed.
21718231	Pharmacotherapy and management strategies for coeliac disease.	INTRODUCTION: Coeliac disease is a common disease that affects approximately 1% of Northern European and American populations. Evidence suggests it is caused by an inappropriate immune response in genetically susceptible patients to dietary gluten found in wheat, rye, barley and, in a small minority of patients, oats. Treatment involves a lifelong gluten-free diet. This diet limits nutritional variety and is costly and difficult to maintain. AREAS COVERED: This review covers the current treatment options available and discusses novel emerging therapies for coeliac disease. EXPERT OPINION: Novel therapies are still in early stages of development and therefore, at present, a gluten-free diet remains the treatment of choice in coeliac disease due to its low side-effect profile. A replacement for a gluten-free diet would be superior to an adjunct; in this case dietary modification of gluten may well have the least side effects, be tolerated by a wider group of coeliac patients and therefore be accepted. Search terms used: Pubmed, Medline and clinicaltrials.gov were searched with 'celiac disease' and 'therapy' as MESH terms. Patent database was searched using the term 'celiac disease'. Conference attendance at DDW Chicago 2011 and Columbia 2010 was also used to gain further information from conference abstracts.
25662623	Advances in diagnosis and management of celiac disease.	Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder that is induced by dietary gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. It has a prevalence of approximately 1% in many populations worldwide. New diagnoses have increased substantially, owing to increased awareness, better diagnostic tools, and probable real increases in incidence. The breadth of recognized clinical presentations continues to expand, making the disorder highly relevant to all physicians. Newer diagnostic tools, including serologic tests for antibodies against tissue transglutaminase and deamidated gliadin peptide, greatly facilitate diagnosis. Tests for celiac-permissive HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 molecules are useful in defined clinical situations. Celiac disease is diagnosed by histopathologic examination of duodenal biopsy specimens. However, according to recent controversial guidelines, a diagnosis can be made without a biopsy in certain circumstances, especially in children. Symptoms, mortality, and risk for malignancy each can be reduced by adherence to a gluten-free diet. This treatment is a challenge, however, because the diet is expensive, socially isolating, and not always effective in controlling symptoms or intestinal damage. Hence, there is increasing interest in developing nondietary therapies. 
22516707	[Evaluation of infant feeding practices after implementation of recommendations for coeliac disease prophylaxis - pilot study].	UNLABELLED: Recent research data concerning the risk of coeliac disease confirm that introduction of food containing gluten during breast-feeding not later than 6 months of life is justified. According to ESPGHAN and EFSA introduction of solid foods in the diet of infants between 4-6 months of age is safe. AIM OF STUDY: Evaluation of feeding practices in healthy full-term infants after implementation of the recommendations of coeliac disease prevention. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Conducted analysis concerned 54 healthy full-term infants, living in Warsaw, aged 6 to 12 months. Of these, 27 children were exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months of life and 27 children were non-breastfed. The differences between selected parameters of nutritional status and diets of breastfed and nonbreastfed infants were evaluated by using t-Student test. Relations between quantitative variables were assessed by chi2 test. RESULTS: Products containing gluten were introduced into the breastfed children's diet in the 5th month of life in 22% of studied subgroup, in the 6th month - in 15%, in the 7th or 8th month - in 30%, between 9th and 11th month - in 22% and 11% of these children have not received food containing gluten in the first year of life. In the group of non-breastfed infants 15% received products with gluten before 5th month of life, 15% in 5th month, 11% at age of 6 months, 22% between 7th and 8th month, 15% in 11th month and 22% of children have not received food containing gluten in the first 12 months of life. An average daily intake of foods with varying content of gluten amounted to 55 g in breastfed infants and 70.5 g in non-breastfed infants (p <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In the pilot study it was found out that nutritional recommendations concerning prophylaxis of coeliac disease were not implemented correctly by the majority of mothers of studied infants. Products containing gluten were introduced to the infant's diet too early or too late and mostly in larger quantities than it was recommended. Due to the small number of studied children it is important to carry out the investigation on a larger sample. At the same time it is necessary to introduce more effective methods of implementing nutritional recommendations concerning prophylaxis of celiac disease.
25039328	Immunotherapy trial as diagnostic test in evaluating patients with presumed autoimmune gastrointestinal dysmotility.	BACKGROUND: Chronic gastrointestinal dysmotility greatly impacts the quality of life. Treatment options are limited and generally symptomatic. Neural autoimmunity is an under-recognized etiology. We evaluated immunotherapy as an aid to diagnosing autoimmune gastrointestinal dysmotility (AGID). METHODS: Twenty-three subjects evaluated at the Mayo Clinic for suspected AGID (August 2006-February 2014) fulfilled the following criteria: (1) prominent symptoms of gastrointestinal dysmotility with abnormalities on scintigraphy-manometry; (2) serological evidence or personal/family history of autoimmune disease; (3) treated by immunotherapy on a trial basis, 6-12 weeks (intravenous immune globulin, 16; or methylprednisolone, 5; or both, 2). Response was defined subjectively (symptomatic improvement) and objectively (gastrointestinal scintigraphy/manometry studies). KEY RESULTS: Symptoms at presentation: constipation, 18/23; nausea or vomiting, 18/23; weight loss, 17/23; bloating, 13/23; and early satiety, 4/23. Thirteen patients had personal/family history of autoimmunity. Sixteen had neural autoantibodies and 19 had extra-intestinal autonomic testing abnormalities. Cancer was detected in three patients. Preimmunotherapy scintigraphy revealed slowed transit (19/21 evaluated; gastric, 11; small bowel, 12; colonic, 11); manometry studies were abnormal in 7/8. Postimmunotherapy, 17 (74%) had improvement (both symptomatic and scintigraphic, five; symptomatic alone, eight; scintigraphic alone, four). Nine responders re-evaluated had scintigraphic evidence of improvement. The majority of responders who were re-evaluated had improvement in autonomic testing (six of seven) or manometry (two of two). CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: This proof of principle study illustrates the importance of considering an autoimmune basis for idiopathic gastrointestinal dysmotility and supports the utility of a diagnostic trial of immunotherapy.
32146601	Gynecological Disorders in Patients with Non-celiac Wheat Sensitivity.	BACKGROUND: Non-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCWS) most frequently presents clinically with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like symptoms, although many extra-intestinal manifestations have also been attributed to it. No studies to date have evaluated the presence and frequency of gynecological symptoms in NCWS. AIM: To evaluate the frequency of gynecological disorders in patients with NCWS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-eight women with NCWS were included in the study. A questionnaire investigating gynecological symptoms and recurrent cystitis was administered, and patients reporting symptoms were then examined by specialists. Three control groups were selected: 52 patients with IBS not related to NCWS, 56 patients with celiac disease (CD), and 71 healthy controls. RESULTS: 59% of the patients with NCWS showed gynecological symptoms, a higher frequency than in healthy controls (P = 0.04), IBS controls (P = 0.01) and CD controls (P = 0.02). Menstrual cycle alterations were more frequent in patients with NCWS than in healthy controls (26.5% vs 11.3%; P = 0.03); the patients with NCWS suffered from recurrent vaginitis (16%) and dyspareunia (6%) significantly more frequently than healthy controls. Twenty-nine percent of patients with NCWS reported recurrent cystitis, a finding higher than in the control groups (vs healthy P = 0.0001, vs IBS P = 0.001, vs CD controls P = 0.04). Microbiological examinations were negative in most of the patients with NCWS and recurrent vaginitis or cystitis. During the 1-year follow-up, 46% of patients with menstrual disorders and 36% with recurrent vaginitis reported resolution of symptoms on a wheat-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with NCWS showed a significantly higher frequency of gynecological symptoms and recurrent cystitis than patients with IBS.
22271451	How I treat enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma.	Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL) is a complication of celiac disease (CD). This tumor derives from the neoplastic transformation of aberrant intraepithelial T lymphocytes emerging in celiac patients unresponsive to a gluten-free diet. Poor adherence to a gluten-free diet, HLA-DQ2 homozygosity, and late diagnosis of CD are recognized as risk factors for malignant evolution of CD. Recurrence of diarrhea, unexplained weight loss, abdominal pain, fever, and night sweating should alert physicians to this complication. The suspicion of EATL should lead to an extensive diagnostic workup in which magnetic resonance enteroclysis, positron emission tomography scan, and histologic identification of lesions represent the best options. Treatment includes high-dose chemotherapy preceded by surgical resection and followed by autologous stem cell transplantation, although biologic therapies seem to be promising. Strict adherence to a gluten-free diet remains the only way to prevent EATL.
35394589	Consumption of Yeast-Fermented Wheat and Rye Breads Increases Colitis and Mortality in a Mouse Model of Colitis.	BACKGROUND: Cereals are known to trigger for wheat allergy, celiac disease and non-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCWS). Inflammatory processes and intestinal barrier impairment are suspected to be involved in NCWS, although the molecular triggers are unclear. AIMS: We were interested if different bread types influence inflammatory processes and intestinal barrier function in a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: Epithelial caspase-8 gene knockout (Casp8DeltaIEC) and control (Casp8fl) mice were randomized to eight groups, respectively. The groups received different diets for 28 days (gluten-free diet, gluten-rich diet 5 g%, or different types of bread at 50 g%). Breads varied regarding grain, milling and fermentation. All diets were isocaloric. RESULTS: Regardless of the diet, Casp8DeltaIEC mice showed pronounced inflammation in colon compared to ileum, whereas Casp8fl mice were hardly inflamed. Casp8fl mice could tolerate all bread types. Especially yeast fermented rye and wheat bread from superfine flour but not pure gluten challenge increased colitis and mortality in Casp8DeltaIEC mice. Hepatic expression of lipopolysaccharide-binding protein and colonic expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha genes were inversely related to survival. The bread diets, but not the gluten-rich diet, also decreased colonic tight junction expression to variable degrees, without clear association to survival and inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Bread components, especially those from yeast-fermented breads from wheat and rye, increase colitis and mortality in Casp8DeltaIEC mice highly susceptible to intestinal inflammation, whereas control mice can tolerate all types of bread without inflammation. Yet unidentified bread components other than gluten seem to play the major role.
26332816	[Is it time for mass screening for celiac disease?].	Celiac disease is a common condition with a variable presentation, and is frequently not recognized by the physician. Although a gluten-free diet has a positive effect on the health of the celiac patient, prevention would be even more beneficial. In this article we outline the different possibilities for primary and secondary prevention of celiac disease. Results of recent prospective studies show that at this moment primary prevention is not possible, but secondary preventive strategies can be applied to decrease the morbidity associated with this disease; mass screening is one option. Results of recent studies concerning this topic will be discussed. 
22173747	Spontaneous normalization of anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody levels is common in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus.	BACKGROUND: The prevalence of celiac disease among type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) patients is 5-10 times higher than in the general population. Thus, evaluation of celiac serology is indicated at diagnosis of T1DM and on follow up. AIM: This study was prompted by the observation that elevated anti-TTG antibody levels in diabetic children may spontaneously normalize despite continued consumption of gluten. The objective of the study was to investigate the prevalence of this phenomenon and associated factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The files of all children diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus from 2003-2009 at a tertiary pediatric medical center were reviewed for those with elevated serum levels of anti-TTG antibody. Clinical, medical, laboratory, and treatment data were collected. Findings were compared between patients diagnosed with celiac disease and patients with initially elevated anti-TTG antibody levels that spontaneously normalized. RESULTS: Forty-eight of the 738 patients with type 1 diabetes attending our center (6.5%) had elevated anti-TTG antibody blood levels. Celiac disease was diagnosed in 23, and anti-TTG antibody levels normalized in 17 (35.4%), all of whom consumed gluten. At one-year follow-up, there was no significant difference between the groups in HbA1c level or change in anthropometric measurements. CONCLUSION: Physicians treating children with type 1 diabetes and mildly elevated anti-TTG antibody levels might consider 12-month serologic follow-up on a gluten-containing diet rather than immediate duodenal biopsy.
21912848	Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma: epidemiology, clinical features, and current treatment strategies.	Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL) is a rare non-Hodgkin lymphoma of T-cell origin. The recent 2008 World Health Organization classification of hematologic malignancies distinguishes between two types of EATL. The disease is associated with celiac disease, particularly with its late, adult onset. Currently, there are no standardized diagnostic or treatment protocols for EATL, mostly because of its rarity. Historically, the patients have been treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy with or without surgery. The outcome of patients with EATL treated with these approaches is poor. The reported death rates in the biggest studies are approximately 80-84%, with median progression-free survival (PFS) of 3.4-6.0 months and overall survival of 7.1-10.0 months. The 5-year PFS ranged from 3.2% to 18% and OS from 19.7% to 20%. The results of a novel induction regimen with ifosfamide, etoposide, and epirubicin alternating with intermediate-dose methotrexate followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) are more promising, with a 5-year PFS of 52% and OS of 60%. The alternative approach, with a more common induction with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, etoposide, and prednisone followed by ASCT has also delivered promising results, with a 3-year PFS of 52% and OS of 47%. This review summarizes recently published data on epidemiology and clinical features, as well as standard and novel treatments including high-dose chemotherapy with ASCT and their outcome in EATL.
30637519	Letter: Celiac Disease Presenting After a Single Anastomosis Duodeno-Ileal Bypass and Sleeve Gastrectomy.	
33897715	The Evolving Landscape of Biomarkers in Celiac Disease: Leading the Way to Clinical Development.	Celiac disease is a common immune-mediated disease characterized by abnormal T-cell responses to gluten. For many patients, symptoms and intestinal damage can be controlled by a gluten-free diet, but, for some, this approach is not enough, and celiac disease progresses, with serious medical consequences. Multiple therapies are now under development, increasing the need for biomarkers that allow identification of specific patient populations and monitoring of therapeutic activity and durability. The advantage of identifying biomarkers in celiac disease is that the underlying pathways driving disease are well characterized and the histological, cellular, and serological changes with gluten response have been defined in gluten challenge studies. However, there is room for improvement. Biomarkers that measure histological changes require duodenal biopsies and are invasive. Less invasive peripheral blood cell and cytokine biomarkers are transient and dependent upon gluten challenge. Here, we discuss established biomarkers and new approaches for biomarkers that may overcome current limitations.
23830446	Sensitive detection and quantification of gliadin contamination in gluten-free food with immunomagnetic beads based liposomal fluorescence immunoassay.	Gliadin from wheat is a common food allergen that can induce baker's asthma, wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis, atopic dermatitis, and celiac disease. This gliadin assay focuses on rapidly screen and check for gluten contamination in raw materials and in the gluten-free food production process, not only for wheat-sensitive patients but also for the industries producing gluten-free foodstuffs. The developed assay incorporates the use of anti-gliadin antibody-conjugated immunomagnetic beads (IMBs) to capture the gliadin in samples and fluorescent dyes-loaded immunoliposomal nanovesicles (IMLNs) to produce and enhance the detection signal. Hence, a sandwich complex is formed as "IMBs-gliadin-IMLNs". Experimental results indicate that this detection platform exhibits good sensitivity for gliadin with a detection limit as low as 0.6 mug mL(-1) of gliadin; as the polyclonal antibody showed slight cross-reactions with barley and rye. Excellent recovery rates were found ranging from 83.5 to 102.6% as testing the spiked samples. Moreover, the CV (%) of intra- and inter-assay of this developed assay are 4.8-10.6% and 3.5-9.9%, respectively. Based on a parallel analysis of twenty food samples, the results of this developed assay provide a good consistency with those of an AOAC-approved ELISA kit without any false-negative results. The proposed assay method is thus a highly promising alternative method for detecting the contamination of gliadin in the food industry.
20978483	The role of endoscopic imaging of the small bowel in clinical practice.	Enteroscopy, defined as direct visualization of the small bowel (SB) with the use of a fiberoptic or wireless endoscope, has progressed considerably over the past several years. Technological advancements in the field have facilitated endoscopic evaluation of the SB. This comprehensive clinical review summarizes the latest modalities available to aid gastroenterologists in exploring the SB for evaluation of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, tumors, inflammatory bowel disease, and celiac disease. Previous physical limitations in equipment that made a complete evaluation of the SB difficult have all but disappeared with the advent of capsule endoscopy, balloon-assisted enteroscopy, and spiral enteroscopy.
32425731	COVID-19 pandemic perception in adults with celiac disease: an impulse to implement the use of telemedicine.	Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes severe complications and deaths all over the world. COVID-19 also has indirect effects from the lockdown and the possible lack of food. We aimed to evaluate the perception of this in Celiac Disease (CeD) patients who require a lifelong gluten-free diet as a therapy. Methods: We invited by e-mail CeD adult patients from the University of Salerno (Campania, South Italy) and the University of Padua (Veneto, North Italy) to answer an ad hoc COVID-19 survey. Results: We sent the web survey to 651 email addresses and we received 276 answers (42,4%). CeD patients did not feel more vulnerable because they had CeD (not at all 56.6%) and they did not worry much about the possible shortness of gluten-free food during the epidemic (not at all 48.5%). The most worried were the elderly patients, patients with other comorbidities and females. Finally, CeD patients were happy with remote consultations and explicitly asked to have them. Discussion: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted a proportion of patients with CeD; in particular, women, elderly patients, patients with other comorbidities. COVID-19, although a challenging experience from the medical and the psychological point of view, has offered an opportunity to practice, on a large-scale, a remote consultation approach for CeD healthcare.
26414923	Pharmacological approaches in celiac disease.	Celiac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy triggered by the ingestion of gluten, characterized by immune responses toward gluten constituents and the autoantigen transglutaminase 2. The only current treatment available for celiac disease is a gluten-free diet, however there are a plethora of therapies in development for the treatment of celiac disease (e.g. vaccine), management of symptoms while consuming gluten (e.g. Necator americanus) or adjuvant therapies in conjunction with the gluten-free diet (e.g. larazotide acetate). Current approaches in development target barrier function, immune responses, detoxifying gluten or sequestering gluten. Developing therapies include those targeting environmental factors, such as the microbiota or proteases. 
31851101	Bone Mineral Density in Patients With Celiac Disease: A Further Association With Extent of Disease on Capsule Endoscopy.	
35129887	[Cereal related complaints in children].	There's a lot of attention for gluten-free diets on social media. Doctors get many questions about gluten sensitivity or possible wheat allergy. With some basic knowledge, it's easier to give answers to these questions and to prevent unnecessary and sometimes harmful diets. This article gives basic information about cereals, gluten, grasses and their crossreactivity. We give an overview about the differences between celiac disease, gluten sensitivity and IgE-mediated wheat allergy. We also describe diagnostics, treatment and natural history of coeliakie, gluten sensitivity and wheat or cereal allergy.
27236159	 An autoimmune polyglandular syndrome complicated with celiac disease and autoimmune hepatitis.	 Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome (APS) is a combination of different autoimmune diseases. The close relationship between immune-mediated disorders makes it mandatory to perform serological screening periodically in order to avoid delayed diagnosis of additional autoimmune diseases. We studied a patient with type 1 diabetes (T1D) who later developed an autoimmune thyroid disease (ATD) and was referred to our hospital with a serious condition of his clinical status. The patient was suffering from an advance stage of celiac disease (CD), the delay in its diagnosis and in the establishment of a gluten-free dietled the patient to a severe proteincalorie malnutrition. Later, the patient developed an autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). We consider that clinical deterioration in patients with APS should alert physicians about the possible presence of other immune-mediated diseases. Periodic screening for autoantibodies would help to prevent delayed diagnosis and would improve patient's quality of life. 
26258714	Utilization of sorghum, rice, corn flours with potato starch for the preparation of gluten-free pasta.	The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of mixture of sorghum-rice-corn flour and potato starch in the development of gluten-free pasta for celiac disease patients. The experiment was designed according to simplex-lattice method and different types of gluten-free flours were used, such as sorghum, rice, corn, and potato starch. The fifteen formulations were subjected to sensory analysis (Mixed Structured Scale - MSS) and seven formulations were selected in respect to taste and grittiness. These formulations were subjected to Quantitative Descriptive Analysis (QDA), which evaluated the attributes: appearance, color, odor, hardness, elasticity, stickiness, grittiness, taste, residual bitterness and overall quality. Results showed significant difference in appearance, color and hardness. The formulations that showed the best sensory results were submitted to chemical analysis and cooking quality of pasta. It was observed that the best results for mixing is sorghum flour, rice flour and potato starch. 
31344206	[Clinical features and management of 205 adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus].	BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated the details of insulin therapy for type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) in Chile. AIM: To describe clinical features and treatment details of adults with T1D and its association with metabolic control. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Review of medical records of patients with T1D treated in a clinical network. Demographic and clinical features, types and doses of insulin and glycated hemoglobin levels were registered. The use flash glucose monitors (FGM) and insulin pumps (CSII) were also recorded. RESULTS: 205 records were reviewed, with T1d lasting 12 +- 10 years. Twenty six percent had hypothyroidism, 1% had celiac disease, 12% had hypertension, 20% had dyslipidemia; 13% had diabetic retinopathy, 2% had diabetic nephropathy, 8% had neuropathy and 2% cardiovascular diseases. Mean body mass index was 25 kg/ m2 and mean glycated hemoglobin was 8%. Eighty-two percent used multiple daily injections, 18% used CSII and 24% used FGM. As basal insulin, 35% used slow acting analogs and 65% used ultra-slow analogs. As rapid acting insulin, 69 patients used Lispro, 79 Aspart and 50 Glulisin. Bolus doses were calculated using only capillary glucose in 22%, while 78% also considered carbohydrate consumption. Variables significantly associated to better control were the use of carbohydrates for dosing rapid insulin (A1c 7,85% vs 8,59%, p = 0,008), use of CSII (A1c 7,36% vs 8,16%, p = 0,008), and basal dose < 0,4 U/kg (A1c 7,81% vs 8,58%, p = 0,003). There were no differences regarding insulin type or use of FGM. CONCLUSIONS: The use of formulas considering carbohydrates for dosing rapid insulin, use of infusion pumps and physiological doses of basal insulin are significantly associated with a better metabolic control in adults with T1d.
33837830	Gluten-degrading bacteria: availability and applications.	Gluten is a mixture of storage proteins in wheat and occurs in smaller amounts in other cereal grains. It provides favorable structure to bakery products but unfortunately causes disease conditions with increasing prevalence. In the human gastrointestinal tract, gluten is cleaved into proline and gluten rich peptides that are not degraded further. These peptides trigger immune responses that might lead to celiac disease, wheat allergy, and non-celiac gluten sensitivity. The main treatment option is a gluten-free diet. Alternatively, using enzymes or microorganisms with gluten-degrading properties might alleviate the disease. These components can be used during food production or could be introduced into the digestive tract as food supplements. In addition, natural food from the environment is known to enrich the microbial communities in gut and natural environmental microbial communities have high potential to degrade gluten. It remains to be investigated if food and environment-induced changes in the gut microbiome could contribute to the triggering of gluten-related diseases. KEY POINTS:   Wheat proteins, gluten, are incompletely digested in human digestive tract leading to gluten intolerance.   The only efficient treatment of gluten intolerance is life-long gluten-free diet.   Environmental bacteria acquired together with food could be source of gluten-degrading bacteria detoxifying undigested gluten peptides.
26964284	Refractory Hypoparathyroidism in a Child with Celiac Disease.	
26206401	Factors governing long-term adherence to a gluten-free diet in adult patients with coeliac disease.	BACKGROUND: A strict gluten-free diet is the cornerstone of treatment for coeliac disease. Studies of gluten-free diet adherence have rarely used validated instruments. There is a paucity of data on long-term adherence to the gluten-free diet in the adult population. AIMS: To determine the long-term adherence to the gluten-free diet and potential associated factors in a large coeliac disease referral centre population. METHODS: We performed a mailed survey of adults with clinically, serologically and histologically confirmed coeliac disease diagnosed >=5 years prior to survey. The previously validated Celiac Disease Adherence Test was used to determine adherence. Demographic, socio-economic and potentially associated factors were analysed with adherence as the outcome. RESULTS: The response rate was 50.1% of 709 surveyed, the mean time on a gluten-free diet 9.9 +- 6.4 years. Adequate adherence (celiac disease adherence test score <13) was found in 75.5% of respondents. A higher level of education was associated with adequate adherence (P = 0.002) even after controlling for household income (P = 0.0220). Perceptions of cost, effectiveness of the gluten-free diet, knowledge of the gluten-free diet and self-effectiveness at following the gluten-free diet correlated with adherence scores (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Long-term adherence to a gluten-free diet was adequate in >75% of respondents. Perceived cost remains a barrier to adherence. Perceptions of effectiveness of gluten-free diet as well as its knowledge, are potential areas for intervention.
22850429	The prevalence of celiac disease in the United States.	OBJECTIVES: The prevalence of celiac disease (CD) in the United States is unknown. We sought to estimate CD prevalence nationwide by using a nationally representative sample. METHODS: This study included 7,798 persons aged 6 years or older who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2009-2010. Serum samples from all participants were tested for immunoglobulin A (IgA) tissue transglutaminase antibodies and, if findings were abnormal, also for IgA endomysial antibodies. Information about prior diagnosis of CD and use of a gluten-free diet (GFD) was obtained by direct interview. CD was defined as having either double-positive serology (serologically diagnosed CD) or a reported diagnosis of CD by a doctor or other health-care professional and being on a GFD (reported clinical diagnosis of CD). RESULTS: CD was found in 35 participants, 29 of whom were unaware of their diagnosis. Median age was 45 years (interquartile range, 23-66 years); 20 were women and 29 were non-Hispanic white. The prevalence of CD in the United States was 0.71% (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.58-0.86%), with 1.01% (95% CI, 0.78-1.31%) among non-Hispanic whites. In all, 55 participants reported following a GFD, which corresponded to a prevalence of 0.63% (95% CI, 0.36-1.07%). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of CD in the United States was 0.71% (1 in 141), similar to that found in several European countries. However, most cases were undiagnosed. CD was rare among minority groups but affected 1% of non-Hispanic whites. Most persons who were following a GFD did not have a diagnosis of CD.
34787864	The role of gluten-free diet in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease development.	OBJECTIVE: Celiac Disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease involving the small bowel, generated by the ingestion of gluten-containing foods in genetically predisposed subjects. Currently, the unique therapy for CD is the absolute adherence to gluten-free diet, but this treatment has been related to the onset of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In this systematic review, we provide an update from the most recent studies on the risk of developing NAFLD patients adhering to GFD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: According to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Statement (PRISMA) criteria, we performed a systematic literature search on PubMed and Google Scholar from 2012 to 2021. RESULTS: In the present systematic review, eight studies investigated how GFD in CD patients may be a risk factor for the onset of NAFLD from a minimum of six months to the maximum follow-up period represented by a median of 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: Present systematic review evaluates how GFD plays a key role in NAFLD for consumption of products rich in saturated fats and carbohydrates that promotes accumulation of lipids and lead to hepatic steatosis and inflammation.
25823767	Evaluation of the ESPGHAN Celiac Guidelines in a North American Pediatric Population.	OBJECTIVES: We retrospectively examined the performance of the tissue transglutaminase (TTG), endomysial antibody (EMA) tests, and the ESPGHAN (European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition) nonbiopsy criteria in a pediatric population. METHODS: Consecutive celiac serologies and corresponding intestinal biopsy results were obtained on children <18 years old over 3.5 years. Patients were classified into three categories: positive TTG, negative TTG, and IgA deficiency. RESULTS: Of the 17,505 patients with celiac serology performed, 775 had a positive TTG, 574 with a negative TTG were biopsied, and 25 were IgA deficient. Of the patients with a TTG >=10 x upper limit of normal (ULN), positive EMA, and symptoms, 98.2% had biopsies consistent with celiac disease (CD). Four human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQ2/DQ8-positive patients who met the ESPGHAN nonbiopsy criteria did not have CD. In the group with a TTG 3-10 x ULN, 75.7% EMA-positive patients and only 40% EMA-negative patients had CD (P<0.001). Of those with a TTG 1-3 x ULN, 52.2% EMA-positive patients vs. only 13.3% EMA-negative patients had CD (P<0.01). Of the patients with bulbar and duodenal biopsies, 9.8% had CD confined only in the bulb, especially those with a low titer TTG (P<0.01). CD prevalence in our cohort was 34.6%. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of the TTG were 98.7%, 86.4%, and 79.4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The TTG is a very sensitive screen for CD, but positive predictive value improves with a positive EMA titer. To apply the new ESPGHAN guidelines, clinicians must understand the performance of their celiac serology tests.
26447157	Gluten consumption during late pregnancy and risk of celiac disease in the offspring: the TEDDY birth cohort.	BACKGROUND: Maternal diet during pregnancy has been proposed to increase the risk of autoimmune diseases. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to investigate the association between maternal consumption of gluten-containing foods during late pregnancy and subsequent risk of celiac disease in the offspring. DESIGN: Genetically susceptible children prospectively followed from birth were screened annually for tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies (tTGAs). Children testing persistently positive for tTGAs were further evaluated for celiac disease. Diagnosis of celiac disease was confirmed by intestinal biopsy or was considered likely if the mean tTGA concentration was >100 units in 2 consecutive samples. A questionnaire on the mother's diet in late pregnancy was completed by 3-4.5 mo postpartum. Mothers were divided into 3 groups based on the tertiles of their consumption of gluten-containing foods (servings/d). The association between maternal gluten-containing food consumption and the risk of celiac disease was studied by using a time-to-event analysis. RESULTS: At the time of analysis, 359 (5%) of the 6546 children developed celiac disease. Compared with the middle category of maternal gluten-containing food consumption (servings/d), low (HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.67, 1.13; P = 0.296) and high (HR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.65, 1.09; P = 0.202) consumption was not associated with risk of celiac disease in the child after adjustment for country, human leukocyte antigen genotype, family history of celiac disease, maternal education, and sex of the child. Median maternal daily consumption frequency of gluten-containing foods was higher (P < 0.0001) in Finland (5.3; IQR: 3.9-6.9), Germany (4.3; IQR: 3.1-5.5), and Sweden (3.7; IQR: 2.8-4.9) than in the United States (3.4; IQR: 2.3-4.9). No significant interaction was found between country of residence and the mothers' consumption of gluten-containing foods in relation to risk of celiac disease. CONCLUSION: The frequency of gluten-containing food consumption during late pregnancy is not associated with risk of celiac disease in the offspring.
23478068	Vaccine against autoimmune disease: antigen-specific immunotherapy.	Recent interest in testing whether the success of antigen-specific immunotherapy (ASIT) for autoimmune diseases in mice can be translated to humans has highlighted the need for better tools to study and understand human autoimmunity. Clinical development of ASIT for allergy has been instructive, but limited understanding of CD4 T cell epitope/determinant hierarchies hampers the rational design and monitoring of ASIT. Definitive identification of pathogenic T cell epitopes as is now known in celiac disease and recent initiatives to optimize immune monitoring will facilitate rational design, monitoring and mechanistic understanding of ASIT for human autoimmune diseases. 
22645170	Case study: nutritional strategies of a cyclist with celiac disease during an ultraendurance race.	Food intolerance is becoming increasingly prevalent, and increasing numbers of athletes have celiac disease. This poses challenges as dietary recommendations for exercise are largely based on gluten-containing carbohydrate-rich foods. The K4 cycle race covers 384 km around the Coromandel Peninsula, New Zealand. Lack of sleep, darkness, and temperature variations pose a number of nutritional challenges. Limited food choices present those with celiac disease with even greater challenges. This case study describes the intakes of one such athlete during training and competing in the K4. Nutritional intakes were obtained during training using weighed-food records and during the race via dietary recall and the weighing of foods pre- and post-race. As simple substitution of gluten-containing foods for gluten-free foods leads to increased energy intake, alternatives need to be considered. During the race, insufficient energy was consumed to meet the nutritional guidelines for endurance performance. This was probably due to the nature of the course, racing conditions, the consistency of gluten-free food, and, toward the end of the race, sensory-specific satiety.
21408161	Effect of hookworm infection on wheat challenge in celiac disease--a randomised double-blinded placebo controlled trial.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The association between hygiene and prevalence of autoimmune disease has been attributed in part to enteric helminth infection. A pilot study of experimental infection with the hookworm Necator americanus was undertaken among a group of otherwise healthy people with celiac disease to test the potential of the helminth to suppress the immunopathology induced by gluten. METHODS: In a 21-week, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study, we explored the effects of N. americanus infection in 20 healthy, helminth-naive adults with celiac disease well controlled by diet. Staged cutaneous inoculations with 10 and 5 infective 3(rd) stage hookworm larvae or placebo were performed at week-0 and -12 respectively. At week-20, a five day oral wheat challenge equivalent to 16 grams of gluten per day was undertaken. Primary outcomes included duodenal Marsh score and quantification of the immunodominant alpha-gliadin peptide (QE65)-specific systemic interferon-gamma-producing cells by ELISpot pre- and post-wheat challenge. RESULTS: Enteric colonisation with hookworm established in all 10 cases, resulting in transiently painful enteritis in 5. Chronic infection was asymptomatic, with no effect on hemoglobin levels. Although some duodenal eosinophilia was apparent, hookworm-infected mucosa retained a healthy appearance. In both groups, wheat challenge caused deterioration in both primary and several secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Experimental N. americanus infection proved to be safe and enabled testing its effect on a range of measures of the human autoimmune response. Infection imposed no obvious benefit on pathology. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00671138.
24077239	Non-Celiac Gluten sensitivity: the new frontier of gluten related disorders.	Non Celiac Gluten sensitivity (NCGS) was originally described in the 1980s and recently a "re-discovered" disorder characterized by intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms related to the ingestion of gluten-containing food, in subjects that are not affected with either celiac disease (CD) or wheat allergy (WA). Although NCGS frequency is still unclear, epidemiological data have been generated that can help establishing the magnitude of the problem. Clinical studies further defined the identity of NCGS and its implications in human disease. An overlap between the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and NCGS has been detected, requiring even more stringent diagnostic criteria. Several studies suggested a relationship between NCGS and neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly autism and schizophrenia. The first case reports of NCGS in children have been described. Lack of biomarkers is still a major limitation of clinical studies, making it difficult to differentiate NCGS from other gluten related disorders. Recent studies raised the possibility that, beside gluten, wheat amylase-trypsin inhibitors and low-fermentable, poorly-absorbed, short-chain carbohydrates can contribute to symptoms (at least those related to IBS) experienced by NCGS patients. In this paper we report the major advances and current trends on NCGS. 
24428915	Late diagnosis of celiac disease in an asymptomatic infant with growth failure.	The clinical spectrum for celiac disease (CD) is broad and includes cases with either typical (intestinal) or atypical (extraintestinal) features, often making the diagnosis of CD very difficult.We describe the case of a girl presenting with stunted growth and malnourishment. She was evaluated at 14 months for decreased growth rate without any signs of gastrointestinal, renal or endocrine disorders. She was evaluated for CD, but resulted negative for anti-tTG antibodies.At the age of 4.1 years, she exhibited basal dental enamel hypoplasia, iron deficiency anaemia despite repeated iron supplementation, with persistent reduced height (-2.79 SDS), BMI (-0.76 SDS), growth velocity (-1.79 SDS) and delayed bone age (1.5 year). The CD screening was repeated and very high anti-tTG-IgA (128 IU/ml, normal values < 7 IU/ml) and anti-tTG-IgG (77 IU/ml, normal values < 7 IU/ml) values were found. HLA genotyping revealed an HLA DQ2 haplotype. A duodenal biopsy revealed severe villous atrophy with crypt hyperplasia and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (> 40 IELs/100 epithelial cells) confirming the diagnosis of CD. A gluten-free diet was started and after only four months, her growth velocity increased from 4.83 cm/year (-1.79 SDS) to 6.53 cm/year (-0.15 SDS).In conclusion, we report the development of a positive serology for CD in an asymptomatic child with growth retardation, who previously was investigated for CD and resulted negative. Therefore, when faced with retarded growth in young patients, after excluding other malabsorption conditions and even when CD serological markers are negative, the paediatric endocrinologist should request HLA genotyping, before the intestinal biopsy, in order to check for the presence of risk alleles.
31627463	New Software for Gluten-Free Diet Evaluation and Nutritional Education.	Following a gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only treatment for celiac disease. This diet must ensure the absence of gluten but also needs to be nutritionally balanced. Dietitians working in this field cannot properly evaluate energy and nutrient intake of celiac people because dietary programs available on the market do not contain the nutritional composition of gluten-free products (GFP). Here we present a new GFD evaluation software that contains more than 700 gluten-free rendered foodstuffs and their macronutrient composition. Apart from diet evaluation and design, the software represents a tool for nutritional education as well, since it shows diet appropriacy and indicates how to promote balanced self-care. Moreover, anthropometric and biochemical data or symptoms presence and diet adherence can be recorded and evaluated. This open free software, can be downloaded in its app format for mobiles and tablets. Software evaluation indicated its correct functionality and the importance of assessing a GFD with GFP instead of with their gluten-containing analogues. Thus, this software represents an essential e-Health tool, not only for proper GFD evaluation, but also for improving life quality of celiac and gluten sensitive people.
30791371	The Impact of Autoantibodies on IVF Treatment and Outcome: A Systematic Review.	The role of autoantibodies in in vitro fertilization (IVF) has been discussed for almost three decades. Nonetheless, studies are still scarce and widely controversial. The aim of this study is to provide a comprehensive systematic review on the possible complications associated to autoantibodies (AA) impeding the chances of a successful IVF cycle. An Embase, PubMed/Medline and Cochrane Central Database search was performed on 1 December 2018, from 2006 until that date. From the 598 articles yielded in the search only 44 relevant articles ultimately fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were qualitatively analyzed. Five subsets of results were identified, namely, thyroid related AA, anti-phospholipid antibodies, anti-nuclear antibodies, AA affecting the reproductive system and AA related to celiac disease. It may be implied that the majority of auto-antibodies exert a statistically significant effect on miscarriage rates, whereas the effects on clinical pregnancy and live birth rates differ according to the type of auto-antibodies. While significant research is performed in the field, the quality of evidence provided is still low. The conduction of well-designed prospective cohort studies is an absolute necessity in order to define the impact of the different types of autoantibodies on IVF outcome.
29741603	Phenotype and Clinical Course of Inflammatory Bowel Disease With Co-existent Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammatory bowel diseases, principally Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, and celiac disease are among the most common immune-mediated gastrointestinal diseases. We aim to elucidate the clinical course and outcomes of patients with concomitant inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease, a unique population that remains scarcely studied to date. METHODS: A retrospective matched case-control study of adults with co-existent inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] and celiac disease was performed at a tertiary referral institution in North America. Logistic regression and Kaplan-Meier curves compared disease characteristics and clinical outcomes of the two groups. RESULTS: A total of 342 inflammatory bowel disease patients were included in this study, of whom 114 had co-existent celiac disease and 228 did not. Patients with co-existent inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease had higher rates of primary sclerosing cholangitis [19.3% vs 5.7%; odds ratio, 4.4; 95% confidence interval, 2.1-9.4; p <0.001], extensive ulcerative colitis [78.1% vs 59.0%; odds ratio, 2.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-5.5; p =0.002], and family history of celiac disease [10.5% vs 3.5%; odds ratio 3.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-8.2; p =0.01], compared with patients without concomitant celiac disease. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease with concomitant celiac disease have unique phenotypic features compared with non-celiac inflammatory bowel disease, with higher risks for colitis-related hospitalisations, extensive colitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Increased recognition of co-existent IBD and celiac disease can prompt clinicians to investigate for concomitant disease sooner, particularly in patients with seemingly refractory disease.
26681604	Health Coaching the Worker With Celiac Disease.	L.Y., a 52-year-old project manager, had a series of minor epistaxis episodes while at work. After seeing his primary care physician, he was diagnosed with anemia which was attributed to the epistaxis. After being evaluated by an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist for treatment of the epistaxis, anemia continued. Eventually, he was diagnosed with celiac disease. Implications for health coaching are explored. 
38355059	A look into the future: Are we ready for an approved therapy in celiac disease?	As it appears that we are currently at the cusp of an era in which drugs that are new, re-purposed or as "supplements", will be introduced to the management of celiac disease, we need to reflect if the framework is set for celiac disease to be increasingly treated by pharmaceuticals as well as diet. This refers to reflecting on the rigor of current diagnostic practices, the limitations of the current standard of care that is gluten-free diet, and that we lack objective markers of disease severity. Interrogating these issues will help us to identify gaps in technology and practices that could be critical for selecting patients with a well-defined need for an improved or alternative treatment. Both aspects, circumscribed limitations of the gluten-free diet and diagnostics helping to define celiac disease target groups, together with the guiding requirements by the responsible regulatory authorities will contribute to defining the subgroups of patients with confirmed celiac disease eligible for distinct pharmacological strategies. Because many celiac disease patients are diagnosed in childhood, these aspects need to be differentially discussed for the pediatric setting. In this perspective, we aim to describe these contextual issues and then look ahead to the future. What might be the major challenges in celiac disease clinics in the coming years once drugs are an option alongside the diet? And what will be future objectives for researchers who further decipher the mucosal immunology of celiac disease? Speculating on the answers to these questions is as stimulating as it is fascinating to be part of this turning point.

37242250	Nutritional Composition of Breakfast in Children and Adolescents with and without Celiac Disease in Spain-Role of Gluten-Free Commercial Products.	Eating a nutritionally balanced breakfast can be a challenge when following a gluten-free diet (GFD). We assessed the ingredients and nutrient composition of 364 gluten-free breakfast products (GFPs) and 348 gluten-containing counterparts (GCCs), and we analysed the nutritional quality of breakfast in a group of Spanish children and adolescents with celiac disease (CD) (n = 70), as compared to controls (n = 67). Food intakes were estimated using three 24 h dietary records. The composition of GFPs and GCCs was retrieved from the package labels of commercially available products. Most participants (98.5%) ate breakfast daily, and only one person in each group skipped breakfast once. The breakfast contribution of the total daily energy was 19% in participants with CD and 20% in controls. CD patients managed a balanced breakfast in terms of energy (54% from carbohydrates; 12% from proteins; 34% from lipids) and key food groups (cereals, dairy, fruits), but their intake of fruits needs improvement. Compared to controls, breakfast in the CD group provided less protein and saturated fat, a similar amount of carbohydrates and fibre, and more salt. Fibre is frequently added to GFPs, but these contain less protein because of the flours used in formulation. Gluten-free bread contains more fat and is more saturated than is GCC. Sugars, sweets, and confectionery contribute more to energy and nutrient intakes in participants with CD, while grain products do so in controls. Overall, breakfast on a GFD can be adequate, but can be improved by GFPs reformulation and a lower consumption of processed foods.
22217351	Cavitating mesenteric lymph node syndrome: a rare complication of celiac disease.	Among the many complications of celiac disease, mesenteric lymph node syndrome cavitated is considered one of the rarest, there is few case series published in the literature. The etiology and pathophysiology are unknown but because of its high mortality rate, estimated to be around 50%, it should recognize at an early stage in order to institute appropriate therapy as soon as possible.
27356007	Truths, Myths and Needs of Special Diets: Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Autism, Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity, and Vegetarianism.	Different dietary approaches have been attempted for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism, but only three of them have been subjected to clinical trials: education in healthy nutritional habits, supplementation and elimination diets. On the other hand, for multiple reasons, the number of people who adopt vegetarian and gluten-free diets (GFD) increases daily. More recently, a new entity, non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), with a still evolving definition and clinical spectrum, has been described. Although, the benefits of GFD are clearly supported in this condition as well as in celiac disease, in the last two decades, GFD has expanded to a wider population. In this review, we will attempt to clarify, according to the existing evidence, which are the myths and facts of these diets.
28532727	Experiences and own management regarding residual symptoms among people with coeliac disease.	CONTEXT: Between 7% and 30% of people with treated coeliac disease suffer from residual symptoms, and there is a knowledge gap about their own management of these symptoms. AIM: To explore experiences and management concerning residual symptoms despite a gluten-free diet in people with coeliac disease. METHODS: A qualitative explorative design with semi-structured interviews with 22 adults with coeliac disease in Sweden. Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: The informants had, at diagnosis, thought that their symptoms would disappear if they followed a gluten-free diet, but the disease was continuing to have a substantial impact on their lives, despite several years of treatment. They experienced cognitive, somatic as well as mental symptoms, including impact on personality (e.g. having a "shorter fuse", being more miserable or tired). However, only a few informants had sought medical care for persistent symptoms. Instead they tried to manage these by themselves, e.g. abstaining from food during periods of more intense symptom, or using distraction. The management of persistent symptoms resembled thorough detective work. To prevent problems related to residual symptoms the informants used withdrawal of social contact as well as acceptance of their situation. CONCLUSION: People with treated coeliac disease may experience residual symptoms of both a physical and psychological nature, causing major negative impacts on their lives in different ways. In the light of this, healthcare staff should change their practices regarding the follow-up of these people, and in addition to medical care should provide guidance on management strategies to facilitate the daily life. Furthermore, information to newly diagnosed persons should make them aware of the possibility to experience continued symptoms, despite treatment.
23899485	Everyday life for women with celiac disease.	The aim of this research was to explore how women with celiac disease experience everyday life. It is important that healthcare professionals understand what it is like to live with a chronic illness, and also the factors that affect the lives of women who have celiac disease. The study has a qualitative approach and the data were collected using interviews with 16 women. A conventional content analysis was used for the subjective interpretation of the qualitative interviews. Three main themes emerged in the analysis: illness trajectory and treatment, socializing with others, and feelings of loneliness and worry. The findings indicate that living with celiac disease affects the person's entire life from the past, in the present, and into the future, especially when daily routines must be altered. The women expressed a sense of loneliness and invisibility, especially when socializing with others. The diet could be a friend, enemy, obstacle, or opportunity in terms of enjoying a good life. Supporting women diagnosed with celiac disease appears to be a major task for healthcare professionals. Such professionals need to pay attention to women's symptoms, worries, and their feeling of being invisible. 
38615127	Maintaining a gluten-free diet is associated with quality of life in youths with type 1 diabetes and celiac disease.	AIM: Conflicting findings have been reported on whether in youths, the double diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and celiac disease (CD) substantially impacts quality of life QoL, compared to subjects with T1D only. METHODS: In this study, 86 youths with double diagnosis and their parents were compared to 167 subjects with T1D only. QoL was assessed through the KINDL questionnaire. Anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies and dietary interviews evaluated the degree of maintaining a gluten-free diet (GFD). RESULTS: We found that having CD in addition to T1D has little effect on overall QoL. However, analysis of the degree of maintaining GFD revealed significantly lower total QoL scores in groups with T1D + CD not strictly maintaining GFD compared to T1D only (p = 0.0014). The multivariable linear regression model confirmed the importance of maintaining GFD on QoL in subjects (p = 0.0066) and parents (p = 0.023). CONCLUSION: The coexistence of T1D and CD and the adoption of a GFD resulted in poor QoL levels, as in youth as in their parents, when difficulties implementing the GFD are present. Psychological support should consider the importance of maintaining GFD not only to prevent potential complications in the future but also to improve actual QoL in different subdomains.
31008803	Protocol for the transition of pediatrics for adult medicine in celiac disease: a proposal approach.	
37204826	Gluten Immunogenic Peptides are not correlated with reported adherence to gluten-free diet in children with celiac disease.	OBJECTIVE: There is no gold standard to assess adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD) among patients with celiac disease (CeD). Gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) in urine and stool were suggested as novel markers for evaluating adherence to GFD. Our aim was to assess the presence of GIP in pediatric patients with CeD, and to compare the results with alternative methods for evaluating GFD adherence. METHODS: Pediatric patients diagnosed with CeD, who were on GFD for at least one year, were enrolled and followed prospectively between November 2018 and January 2021. Study visits included clinical assessment, a dietitian interview, Biagi score, food questionnaires, anthropometric and laboratory measurements; and urine and stool samples obtained for laboratory GIP analysis. RESULTS: The study included 74 patients (63.5% females), with median (IQR) age of 9.9 (7.8-11.7) years, and median (IQR) duration on GFD of 2.5 (2-5.5) years. Good GFD adherence, assessed by Biagi score, was reported in 93.1% of cases. GIP was evaluated during 134 visits, with GIP detected in 27/134 (20.1%) of the visits (16.3% of stool samples and 5.3% of urine samples). Positive GIP results were significantly more common in males compared to females (30.6% vs. 14.1%, respectively, p<0.05). Detection of positive GIP was not associated with dietary assessment of GFD adherence, celiac serology results, or reported symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Stool and urine GIP can be detected in children with CeD, even when dietary assessment indicate good adherence to GFD. The role of GIP testing in clinical practice should be further explored.
35893918	Dietary Acid Load in Gluten-Free Diets: Results from a Cross-Sectional Study.	The gluten-free diet (GFD) ensures improvement of clinical symptoms in the vast majority of celiac disease (CD) patients. Despite stable CD rates in many countries, an increasing number of healthy individuals are adopting gluten-free diets, believing that this diet is an inherently healthier choice. The health effects of gluten-free diets are controversial, and a recent study added to the debate by reporting a lower acidogenic potential of this diet. The effects of the GFD on potential renal acid load (PRAL) and net endogenous acid production (NEAP)-two important markers of dietary acid load (DAL)-are poorly understood, and have never been examined in a Western population. Using cross-sectional data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, we estimated DAL in U.S. individuals reporting a GFD and contrasted the results to the general U.S. population consuming gluten and denying special diets. The GFD was associated with significantly lower crude DAL scores, and after adjustments for confounders in multivariate regression, the results remain significant. Yet, our study could not confirm the reported alkalizing properties of the GFD. Although overall DAL scores were significantly lower in the GFD group, they were comparable to Western diets producing 50-75 mEq of acid per day.
29194702	The role of TMPRSS6 and HFE variants in iron deficiency anemia in celiac disease.	We investigated the role of HFE C282Y, H63D, and TMPRSS6 A736V variants in the pathogenesis of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in celiac disease (CD) patients, at diagnosis and after 1 year of gluten-free diet (GFD). Demographic and clinical features were prospectively recorded for all CD patients between 2013 and 2017. C282Y, H63D, and A736V variants were evaluated for CD patients and controls. Finally, 505 consecutive CD patients and 539 age-matched control subjects were enrolled. At diagnosis, 229 CD subjects had IDA (45.3%), with a subgroup of anemic patients (45.4%) presented persistent IDA at follow-up. C282Y allele frequency was significantly increased in CD compared with controls (1.1% vs 0.2%, P = .001), whereas H63D and A736V allele frequencies were similar among patients and controls (P = .92 and .84, respectively). At diagnosis, C282Y variant in anemic CD patients was significantly increased compared to nonanemic group (2% and 0.5%, P = .04). At follow-up, A736V was significantly increased in IDA persistent than in IDA not persistent (57.7% vs 35.2%, P < .0001). CD patients with H63D mutation showed higher Hb, MCV, serum iron, and ferritin levels than subjects without HFE mutations. Decreased hepcidin values were observed in anemic compared to nonanemic subjects at follow-up (1.22 +- 1.14 vs 2.08 +- 2.15, P < .001). This study suggests a protective role of HFE in IDA CD patients and confirms the role of TMPRSS6 in predicting oral iron response modulating hepcidin action on iron absorption. Iron supplementation therapeutic management in CD could depend on TMPRSS6 genotype that could predict persistent IDA despite iron supplementation and GFD.
33673062	Relationship between Persistent Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Duodenal Histological Findings after Adequate Gluten-Free Diet: A Gray Area of Celiac Disease Management in Adult Patients.	A gluten-free diet (GFD) leads to a rapid improvement in gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, biochemical alterations and duodenal histological damage in the majority of celiac disease (CD) patients. This study aimed to assess the frequency and factors associated with the persistence of GI symptoms/malabsorption signs and their relationship with duodenal histological findings among CD patients on an adequate GFD (mean duration 16 months, range 12-28 months). This longitudinal cohort study included 102 adult CD patients (median age 38.5 years, range 18-76 years, F = 71.6%) diagnosed between 2012 and 2018. A total of 36.3% of the included patients had persistent GI symptoms and/or malabsorption signs (Group 1), while the remaining patients had complete GI well-being without malabsorption signs (Group 2) at the time of histological re-evaluation. The persistence of GI symptoms/signs was associated with a long duration of symptoms/signs before CD diagnosis (>=5 years) (OR 5.3; 95% CI 1.3-21.8) and the presence of constipation at the time of CD diagnosis (OR 7.5; 95% CI 1.3-42) while for other variables, including age at CD diagnosis, sex, duration of GFD, comorbidities, CD serology positivity and severity of duodenal damage at histological re-evaluation, no association was found. According to our results, the persistence of symptoms/signs is not associated with histological findings, and their relationship could be a gray area in CD management.
34836247	The Gluten-Free Diet for Celiac Disease and Beyond.	The gluten-free diet (GFD) has gained popularity beyond its main medical indication as the treatment for gluten-induced immune-mediated disorders such as celiac disease (CD), dermatitis herpetiformis, gluten ataxia, wheat allergy, and non-celiac gluten sensitivity. However, the diet carries some disadvantages such as elevated costs, nutritional deficiencies, and social and psychological barriers. The present work aims to review indications, proven benefits, and adverse events of a gluten-free diet. Close follow-up with patients following the diet is recommended. More data is needed to assess the effectiveness of the diet in managing mental and cognitive disorders and to establish a connection between the brain and gluten.
32740074	Probiotics for Celiac Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.	INTRODUCTION: Many patients with celiac disease (CD) experience persistent symptoms despite adhering to the gluten-free diet. Different studies have assessed the use of probiotics as an adjuvant treatment for CD. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics in improving gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and quality of life (QOL) in patients with CD. METHODS: We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, CENTRAL, and DARE databases up to February 2019 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating probiotics compared with placebo for treating CD. We collected data on GI symptoms, QOL, adverse events, serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha, intestinal permeability, and microbiota composition. RESULTS: We screened 2,831 records and found that 7 articles describing 6 RCTs (n = 279 participants) were eligible for quantitative analysis. Probiotics improved GI symptoms when assessed by the GI Symptoms Rating Scale (mean difference symptom reduction: -28.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -43.96 to -13.52; P = 0.0002). There was no difference in GI symptoms after probiotics when different questionnaires were pooled. The levels of Bifidobacteria increased after probiotics (mean difference: 0.85 log colony-forming units (CFU) per gram; 95% CI 0.38-1.32 log CFU per gram; P = 0.0003). There were insufficient data on tumor necrosis factor-a levels or QOL for probiotics compared with placebo. No difference in adverse events was observed between probiotics and placebo. The overall certainty of the evidence ranged from very low to low. DISCUSSION: Probiotics may improve GI symptoms in patients with CD. High-quality clinical trials are needed to improve the certainty in the evidence (see Visual abstract, Supplementary Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/AJG/B595).
31688364	Effect of a Gluten-free Diet on Quality of Life in Patients With Nonclassical Versus Classical Presentations of Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) often presents with symptoms of diarrhea and malabsorption, termed classical CD. However, it can also present as nonclassical CD, which is commonly associated with nongastrointestinal symptoms. Studies suggest that nonclassical CD tends to have less severe symptoms than classical CD, which may affect both adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) and psychological stress. Therefore, we compared adherence to a GFD and psychological measures, including quality of life (QOL) and somatization, between patients with nonclassical and classical presentations of CD. METHODS: Patients at a tertiary care center with biopsy-proven CD, who completed a Talley Bowel Disease Questionnaire and the Short Form-36 at diagnosis and who had been on a GFD for at least 1 year, were included in this study. Patients were further surveyed to assess gastrointestinal symptoms, QOL, Somatization Symptom Checklist (SSC), and adherence to a GFD. Results were compared between patients with classical versus nonclassical CD presentation. RESULTS: Among 122 patients included in this study, 62 had classical CD and 60 had nonclassical CD. At diagnosis, health-related QOL was lower in the classical CD group than in the nonclassical CD group. After following a GFD, both groups had improved QOL after following a GFD, and body mass index significantly increased in both groups. Most subscales of QOL, SSC scores, and adherence to the GFD were similar between the groups, except the Short Form-36 Mental Component summary scores that were still lower in the classical CD (48.4 vs. 52.6 nonclassical CD group; P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Despite QOL at diagnosis being higher in those with nonclassical CD versus lower in those with classical CD, both groups had improved QOL and achieved a similar QOL after following a GFD.
33183548	Inconsistent effects of gluten on obesity: is there a role for the haptoglobin isoforms?	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There is no clear evidence about the effects of gluten intake on obesity. It is known that gluten's effects on gut permeability are mediated by zonulin, a protein identified as pre-haptoglobin 2, a physiological regulator of the intestinal barrier. We investigated the obesogenic and inflammatory effects of gluten and its association with the haptoglobin genotype. METHODS: This was a single blinded, crossover study, including 40 overweight or obesity women free of celiac disease. Participants adopted a gluten-free diet (GFD) for 8 weeks and consumed a gluten-free muffin (GF-M) or a gluten-containing muffin (GLU-M, 24 g gluten) for 4 weeks, switching muffin type during the subsequent 4 weeks. During a follow-up period of 4 weeks we evaluated the usual diet (UD). Food diaries were collected to estimate the macronutrient intake and dietary inflammatory index (DII ). Bodyweight and composition, resting energy expenditure (REE), and cytokines were assessed. Haptoglobin alleles (Hp1 and Hp2) were genotyped to characterize zonulin expression. RESULTS: Energy and macronutrient intakes were similar during both periods, except for protein intake, which was higher during GLU-M. DII scores indicated a more inflammatory profile during the GF-M and GLU-M periods compared to UD. No differences were observed in body composition or REE between interventions when the Hp genotype was not considered. Nonetheless, those carrying the Hp2-2 genotype (overexpressing zonulin) presented lower REE and higher levels of IL6 and IL1beta only during gluten intake (GLU-M and UD) compared to age- and body mass index-matched Hp1-1 carrier. These results suggest an obesogenic and inflammatory action of gluten only in those overexpressing zonulin (Hp2-2). CONCLUSION: These results highlight the importance of zonulin as the mediator of gluten obesogenic and inflammatory effects. Our data suggest that in the presence of gluten, zonulin release is associated with a reduction of REE and an increase of inflammatory markers that are not seen in zonulin low producers.
27405659	Celiac patients' attitudes regarding novel therapies.	BACKGROUND: The only current treatment for celiac disease (CD) is a gluten-free diet (GFD). Novel therapies are in development to supplement or replace a GFD. Knowledge of patients' attitudes toward these therapies is limited. The aim of this study was to determine attitudes about novel therapies in securely diagnosed patients with CD on a GFD and to correlate factors associated with these attitudes. METHODS: A survey was created with two scenarios: a novel therapy that protects against cross contamination while on a GFD and one that allows intentional gluten consumption. The survey also included the Celiac Dietary Adherence Test and the CD Quality of Life (QOL) surveys. RESULTS: A total of 182/284 (64%) CD patients completed the survey. Significantly more respondents would take a novel therapy to protect against cross contamination compared with one that allows intentional gluten consumption (87% vs. 65%; P<0.001). This difference was significant among women but not men. In both scenarios, protection against bowel inflammation was significantly more important than symptom control, and side effects were more important than cost. For a novel therapy that would allow intentional gluten consumption, a one-time injection was preferred over a daily pill, and patients willing to take this therapy had significantly lower QOL scores. CONCLUSIONS: CD patients on a GFD are interested in novel therapies. There were notable differences in attitudes by gender and QOL. Considering patient preferences, drugs with daily or less frequent dosing that protect against bowel inflammation from gluten cross contamination would be best accepted.
33267589	Adherence to a gluten-free diet and quality of life in Chilean celiac patients.	INTRODUCTION: a gluten-free diet (GFD) is the treatment for celiac disease (CD), with adherence oscillating between 42 % and 91 %. The purpose of this study was to assess adherence to GFD and its relation to quality of life in Chilean celiac patients. METHODS: three surveys were performed on-line: sociodemographic-health status, adherence to GFD and quality of life. RESULTS: forty-eight per cent of respondents reported an excellent adherence to GFD and 49 % a good quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: adherence to GFD is low among Chilean celiac patients.
25172576	What a practitioner needs to know about celiac disease?	Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated systemic disorder elicited by gluten and related prolamines in genetically susceptible individuals and is characterized by the presence of a variable combination of gluten-dependent clinical manifestations, CD-specific antibodies, HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 haplotypes and enteropathy. CD is triggered by wheat gluten and related prolamines in barley and rye. Worldwide, the disease affects approximately 1 % of the general population. Clinical features of CD vary considerably. Intestinal symptoms are more common in young children. In older children extra intestinal manifestations affecting almost all organs are seen. IgA tTG antibody, upper GI endoscopy with histological analysis of multiple biopsies of the duodenum and in selected cases HLA DQ2 and DQ8 positivity and endomysial antibodies (EMA) are needed for diagnosis. Currently, the only treatment for CD is a life-long gluten-free diet (GFD). Strict avoidance of wheat, rye, barley and their derivatives will result in intestinal healing and relief of symptoms for the majority of individuals with CD. The GFD is simple in principle, however, completely eliminating all foods and ingredients containing wheat, rye, barley, and most commercial oats can be very challenging. Newly diagnosed CD children should undergo testing and treatment for micronutrient deficiencies specially iron, folic acid, vitamin D, and vitamin B12. Long-term monitoring and follow up of patients with CD is necessary.
29670007	Prevalence of Self-Reported Gluten-Related Disorders and Adherence to a Gluten-Free Diet in Salvadoran Adult Population.	Gluten-related disorders are not considered of relevance at public health level in Central America. The prevalence of gluten-related disorders, and adherence to a gluten-free diet, remain unknown in the Central American region. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of the Central American population from San Salvador, El Salvador, to estimate the prevalence rates of self-reported gluten-related disorders and adherence to a gluten-free diet. 1326 individuals were surveyed. Self-reported prevalence rates were (95% Confidence Interval): gluten sensitivity 3.1% (2.3&ndash;4.2); physician-diagnosed celiac disease 0.15% (0.04&ndash;0.5); wheat allergy 0.75% (0.4&ndash;1.3); non-celiac gluten sensitivity 0.98% (0.5&ndash;1.6). The prevalence rate of adherence to a gluten-free diet was 7.0% (5.7&ndash;8.5). Seven self-reported physician diagnosed gluten-sensitive cases informed the co-existence of non-celiac gluten sensitivity with celiac disease and/or wheat allergy. Among the non-self-reported gluten sensitivity individuals following a gluten-free diet, 50% reported that they were seeing a health professional for gluten-free dietary advice. Gluten sensitivity is commonly reported in Salvadoran population, but some health professionals acknowledge the coexistence of wheat allergy, celiac disease, and non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Among studies at population level, the prevalence of adherence to a gluten-free diet in Salvadoran population is the highest reported until now. However, just a few of the gluten-free diet followers were doing it for health-related benefits; the others reported weight control and the perception that the diet is healthier as the main motivation for adopting such a diet.
30221333	Systematic Literature Review of the Economic Burden of Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND: The prevalence of celiac disease (CD) has rapidly increased over recent decades, but costs related to CD remain poorly quantified. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review assessed the economic burden of CD in North America and Europe. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, EconLit, and the Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched to identify English-language literature from 2007 to 2018 that assessed costs, cost effectiveness, and health resource utilization for CD. RESULTS: Forty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 28 (57.1%) addressed costs of testing and diagnosis; 33 (67.3%) were from Europe. The cost per positive CD diagnosis of testing patients already undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy for other indications ranged from 1300 Canadian dollars ($Can) in Canada (2016 value) to $44,712 in the Netherlands (2013 value). Adding the CD test was cost effective when it combined diagnostic modalities (e.g., serology and biopsy). Direct annual excess costs to a US payer per diagnosed CD patient totaled $US6000 (2013 value) more than for a person without CD, chiefly due to outpatient care. Hospitalizations, emergency visits, and medication use were more common with CD. After initiating a gluten-free diet (GFD), patients visited primary care providers less often, used more medications, and missed fewer days from school and work. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the few available economic studies of CD assess testing and diagnosis costs, especially in Europe. Methods of testing generally are considered cost effective when they combine diagnostic modalities in symptomatic patients. Most costs to a payer of managing CD derive from outpatient care. Following GFD initiation, patients lose fewer days from work and school than pretreatment.
29561985	REVIEW OF CELIAC DISEASE PRESENTATION IN A PEDIATRIC TERTIARY CENTRE.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is an immune-mediated disorder with a multiform presentation and therefore a challenging diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: Our purpose is to identify the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and histologic characteristics of children with celiac disease at diagnosis and on follow-up. METHODS: Children with previously established or newly diagnosed celiac disease, admitted in a tertiary centre in a two-year period (2014-2016) were recruited. Data was collected retrospectively from electronic medical records and clinical notes, and subsequently analysed with SPSS version 20.0. RESULTS: A total of 159 patients, out of 312, were included. Age ranged from 1 to 17 years (mean +- SD: 8.5+-4.5 years, 69% girls). Disease presentation was classical in 60%, non-classical in 25%, subclinical in 10% and 5% classified as potential celiac disease. Non-classical and subclinical profiles had a higher mean age at presentation but not statistically significant (P-value 0.24). The most frequent gastrointestinal features at presentation were abdominal pain (58%), diarrhea (43%) and bloating (27%). A positive family history for celiac disease was present in 24% (n=35). We found anaemia in 23%, low ferritin in 63% and a moderate to severe deficiency of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in 62%. celiac disease -specific serologic testing and esophagogastroduodenoscopy were performed in 99%. Histology revealed modified Marsh 2 or 3 enteropathy in 94%, the remaining had normal histology but positive human leukocyte antigen typing. Clinical improvement at 12 months of gluten-free diet was complete in 51% and partial in 49%. IgA tTG normalized after 12-30 months of gluten-free diet in 45%. On growth assessment at diagnosis and after 12-28 months of gluten-free diet, 100% had height increase (mean +-SD: 7.11+-4.43 cm) and 96% weight gain (mean +-SD: 5.60+-4.91 kg). CONCLUSION: Our findings outline the diverse clinical presentations of pediatric celiac disease that should be considered irrespective of age. Increased clinician's awareness will enable an early diagnosis and treatment, with subsequent symptom and nutritional status improvement.
30833539	Severe Coagulopathy as a Rare Feature of Celiac Crisis in a Patient Previously Diagnosed with Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND Celiac crisis is an uncommon but critical complication of celiac disease (CD) manifesting with copious diarrhea, dehydration, and severe metabolic imbalances. Celiac crisis occurring in individuals who have been formerly diagnosed with CD and displaying severe coagulopathy is tremendously rare. CASE REPORT We report a case of a 76-year-old male, previously diagnosed with CD and non-compliant with gluten free diet, who presented with severe coagulopathy manifesting as gastrointestinal bleeding in addition to other features of celiac crisis, including severe diarrhea, dehydration, metabolic acidosis, electrolyte disturbances, and renal dysfunction. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed flattened mucosa and mucosal nodularity in the duodenum. Duodenal biopsies exhibited active chronic inflammation with intraepithelial lymphocytosis and subtotal villous blunting. The patient was diagnosed with celiac crisis and treatment with vitamin K, parenteral nutrition, and steroids was commenced. After initial clinical improvement, a gluten-free diet was implemented with complete resolution of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Though celiac crisis typically presents in patients with undiagnosed CD, it should be considered in patients who have been previously diagnosed CD but who are non-compliant with gluten free diet. Severe coagulopathy, though extremely rare, can be a feature of celiac crisis and should be consider when encountered in a patient with history of steatorrhea and gastrointestinal bleeding.
30562306	The Effect of Gluten-free Diet on Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Newly Diagnosed Pediatric Celiac Disease Patients.	OBJECTIVES: Although gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only proven therapy for celiac disease (CD), its effect on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors is still unclear. Our aim was to determine whether adherence to GFD affects CVD risk factors among newly diagnosed pediatric CD subjects. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled pediatric subjects undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for suspected CD. We collected anthropometric and laboratory parameters related to CVD risk factors at the time of CD diagnosis and 1 year after initiation of a GFD and evaluated changes in CVD risk factors. Paired t tests or Wilcoxon nonparametric tests were used, each when appropriate. RESULTS: One hundred ten newly diagnosed CD pediatric subjects were included in the analysis. There were 64 (58.2%) girls and the mean age at diagnosis was 6.8 +- 3.4 years. Median body mass index z scores (P = 0.84), rates of underweight or overweight (P = 0.32), and rates of elevated blood pressure (P = 0.78) remained unchanged. Although median fasting insulin levels increased (1.9 vs 5.4 muU/mL, P < 0.001), insulin resistance as measured by homeostatic model assessment did not increase after 1 year of GFD (P = 0.16). Although rates of dyslipidemia remained unchanged, median high-density lipoprotein levels increased on GFD (47 vs 51 mg/dL, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In this pediatric CD cohort, GFD for 1 year was not associated with increased CVD risk factors. The long-term significance of these mild changes is yet to be determined.
22228003	Protective antibody responses to influenza A/H1N1/09 vaccination in children with celiac disease.	Patients with celiac disease have an increased risk for severe influenza infection and they show less of a response to certain vaccine types. During the influenza A/H1N1/09 pandemic, we prospectively investigated pandemic vaccine responses in 14 pediatric patients with celiac disease and age-/sex-matched controls. All of the children with celiac disease reached protective antibody titers (>=40) and showed a geometric mean titer comparable with the control group (530 vs 573).
32751809	Celiac Dietary Adherence Test and Standardized Dietician Evaluation in Assessment of Adherence to a Gluten-Free Diet in Patients with Celiac Disease.	Adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) is currently the mainstay of treatment strategy for celiac disease (CD). The aim of our study was measuring a GFD adherence in CD patients using two newly validated methods of dietary assessment-Standardized Dietician Evaluation (SDE) and the Celiac Dietary Adherence Test (CDAT). Ninety-two adults with CD were evaluated by a registered dietitian with extensive experience with the use of SDE and CDAT. Duodenal biopsy was performed and blood was drawn for serum anti-endomysial, anti-deamidated gliadin peptide and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies in forty four of those patients. The results of CDAT and SDE were very convergent, but SDE scores better correlated with serologic and histologic findings. As many as 24-52% of study participants did not adhere well enough to a GFD. Insufficient adherence to a GFD in CD patients is still a significant problem. The knowledge about gluten content in food ingredients and additives is very low among adults with CD. SDE is the most accurate method in assessing compliance with a GFD and is especially helpful in determining hidden sources of gluten. The CDAT may be a fast tool for screening for a GFD adherence in CD patients.
30413127	Celiac Male's Gluten-Free Diet Profile: Comparison to that of the Control Population and Celiac Women.	The aim of the present work was to analyze the body composition and dietary profile of Spanish celiac men and to compare them to control men and celiac women from our previous studies. Forty-two celiac men (31.5 +- 11.9 years) were recruited and anthropometric measurements were taken. Analysis of energy consumption, macro- and micronutrient intake and food frequency consumption was carried out. Celiac men were more overweight and obese than celiac women, but less than the control population, reporting the same energy intake and macronutrient distribution. Most micronutrient deficiencies in celiac men were not directly related to a gluten free diet; these were also observed for the entire population. The least adherence to Dietary Reference Intakes in women was reported for iron, iodine, potassium and selenium, whereas magnesium intake was higher than in men. Among celiac participants (both genders), cereal, vegetable and legume consumption was poor and meat intake was contrastingly excessive. In conclusion, the dietary profile of celiac men is as unbalanced as that of control men but slightly more than that of celiac women. General nutritional education should be given to both general and celiac populations, and specific advices to celiac men, in order to decrease the risk of celiac disease-related pathologies.
28724585	Effect of gluten-free diet on cerebellar MR spectroscopy in gluten ataxia.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of gluten free diet (GFD) on magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of the cerebellum in patients with gluten ataxia (GA). METHODS: Patients with GA, defined as sporadic ataxia with positive antigliadin antibodies in the absence of an alternative cause, routinely undergo MRS at baseline and after the introduction of GFD as part of their clinical care. We present our experience of the effect of GFD on MRS of the cerebellum. RESULTS: A total of 117 consecutive patients with GA were included in this report. Sixty-three were on strict GFD with elimination of antigliadin antibodies, 35 were on GFD but were still positive for antigliadin antibodies, and 19 patients opted not to go on GFD. The N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr) area ratio from the cerebellar vermis increased in 62 out of 63 (98%) patients on strict GFD, in 9 of 35 (26%) patients on GFD but positive antibodies, and in only 1 of 19 (5%) patients not on GFD. The NAA/Cr ratio decreased in all 14 ataxia control patients (cerebellar variant of multisystem atrophy). There were no differences in the MRS results between those patients who had and those who did not have enteropathy (celiac disease) within each group. CONCLUSIONS: The demonstration of increased NAA/Cr ratio on repeat scanning following strict GFD strengthens previous findings of clinical improvement of the ataxia in patients with GA. The presence of enteropathy is not a prerequisite for such improvement; therefore patients with positive serology and negative duodenal biopsy should still be treated with strict GFD.
23934474	Cirrhosis and intestinal B-cell lymphoma: two entities that are rarely associated with celiac disease.	
29797748	When your patient's parent asks: "My child's alopecia areata is not getting better. Should he or she get tested for celiac disease?"	The relationship between alopecia areata and celiac disease has been suspected for more than 20 years. For a particular individual with alopecia areata, the risk of coexisting celiac disease and the potential benefit of a gluten-free diet on hair loss or regrowth is known. Despite this limited information, patients often aske dermatologists whether they should undergo celiac disease testing or begin a gluten-free diet. We reviewed all available studies of the relationship between alopecia areata and celiac disease to provide guidance to practicing clinicians.
32654085	Enteric-Release Budesonide May Be Useful in the Management of Non-Responsive Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND: Non-responsive celiac disease (NRCD) has many aetiologies, including gluten exposure. Budesonide may be used for refractory celiac disease (RCD) and celiac crisis. AIMS: We reviewed the effectiveness of budesonide to induce clinical and histologic response in NRCD with villous atrophy (VA). METHODS: Case series of adult cases with NRCD and VA prescribed budesonide at two celiac centers. Clinical variables and mucosal recovery (i.e., normal villous architecture within 1 year of treatment) were evaluated. RESULTS: Forty-two cases [77% female, median age 45.0 (IQR 28.3-60.0) years] were included. Most common symptoms were diarrhea (64%) and abdominal pain (62%). Budesonide was initiated at 9 mg (83%) for a median duration of 16.0 weeks (IQR 6.8-25.0 weeks). In total, 57% exhibited a clinical response, positively associated with diarrhea (adjusted OR 6.08 95% CI 1.04-35.47) and negatively with fatigue (adjusted OR 0.18 95% CI 0.03-0.98). Clinical response was higher among those with dietitian counseling prior to budesonide (n = 29, 70 vs. 23%, p < 0.01). Mucosal recovery was observed in 11/24 with follow-up duodenal biopsies. There was no association between clinical response and mucosal recovery, and 79% of clinical responders had a symptomatic relapse. RCD (48%) and chronic gluten exposure (24%) were the main suspected aetiologies of NRCD. Most individuals without a clinical response subsequently received an IBS-related diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Budesonide may be effective to induce clinical response in NRCD presenting with diarrhea and VA, but clinical recurrence and lack of mucosal recovery are frequent after tapering. Other diagnoses, including coexisting IBS, may be considered in non-responders to budesonide therapy.
38931169	Associations between Celiac Disease, Extra-Gastrointestinal Manifestations, and Gluten-Free Diet: A Narrative Overview.	Millions of children and adults worldwide suffer from undiagnosed and untreated celiac disease (CeD). The clinical picture of CeD is highly heterogeneous and comprises manifestations that can affect almost the whole body. This narrative overview is aimed at characterizing diseases and complaints that are associated with unrecognized CeD and that frequently involve sites other than the gastrointestinal (G.I.) tract, i.e., dental, otorhinolaryngological, and ocular complications; skin and hair abnormalities; afflictions of the bones, joints, and muscles; cardiovascular affectations; kidney diseases; neuro-psychiatric disorders; and gynecological-obstetrical manifestations. The association between CeD and extra-GI manifestations is frequently overlooked, which leads to a delay in diagnosis. Most CeD-mediated disorders can be treated with a strict gluten-free diet (GFD), but some of them are irreversible unless CeD is diagnosed in time. Some manifestations can be classified as risk factors for CeD, and CeD screening tests for affected patients should be selectively considered. Apart from gastroenterologists, specialists in other medical disciplines can play an important role in identifying people with unrecognized CeD and may help prevent its progress and long-term complications. Further comprehensive investigations are necessary to clarify the pathogenesis of extra-GI manifestations and the effect of a GFD.
21990108	Acute watery diarrhea: are we missing celiac disease?	
29380821	Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Crossover Trial for the Diagnosis of Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity in Children.	OBJECTIVES: Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is characterized by intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms that are related to the ingestion of gluten in subjects who are not affected by either celiac disease (CD) or wheat allergy (WA). In this multicenter study, we aim for the first time to evaluate the prevalence of NCGS in pediatric subjects with chronic functional gastrointestinal symptoms associated with gluten ingestion using a double-blind placebo-controlled (DBPC) gluten challenge with crossover. METHODS: Among 1,114 children with chronic gastrointestinal symptoms (negative CD and WA), those exhibiting a positive correlation between symptoms and gluten ingestion were eligible for a diagnostic challenge including the following phases: run-in, open gluten-free diet (GFD) and DBPC crossover gluten challenge. Patients were randomized to gluten (10 g/daily) and placebo (rice starch) for 2 weeks each, separated by a washout week. The gluten challenge was considered positive in the presence of a minimum 30% decrease of global visual analogue scale between gluten and placebo. RESULTS: Out of 1,114 children, 96.7% did not exhibit any correlation with gluten ingestion. Thirty-six children were eligible; after the run-in and open GFD, 28 patients entered the gluten challenge. Eleven children (39.2%; 95% CI: 23.6-53.6%) tested positive. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first demonstration of the existence of NCGS in children that reinforce the need for a DBPC for the diagnosis as the diagnosis is ruled out in >60% of cases. The registration identifier in ClinicalsTrials.gov is NCT02431585.
24070155	Diagnostic dilemmas in celiac disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated systemic condition triggered by dietary gluten occurring in genetically susceptible individuals. Our understanding of its numerous and varied clinical presentations has evolved over time, which has contributed to the incidence of CD increasing. In most cases, the diagnosis is readily established and patients promptly improve after commencing a gluten-free diet (GFD). However, in some, the diagnosis is not straightforward and presents a challenge to clinicians. Potential dilemmas include those with positive serology but normal histology, negative serology but abnormal duodenal mucosal histology, failure to respond to a GFD or response to a GFD without evidence of CD. In recent years, development of new assays and modifications to existing diagnostic algorithms for CD has also challenged the traditional role of small-bowel histology as critical in CD diagnosis. 
30759766	The Impact of Low-FODMAPs, Gluten-Free, and Ketogenic Diets on Gut Microbiota Modulation in Pathological Conditions.	The gut microbiota performs several essential protective, structural, and metabolic functions for host health. The maintenance of a beneficial microbiota requires a homeostatic equilibrium within microbial communities, and between the microorganisms and the host. The gut microbiota composition may be affected by external factors, among them diet habits may be considered most important. In some pathological conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), celiac disease (CD), or neurological disorders (ND), specific dietary regimens as low-fermentable, oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyols (FODMAPs), ketogenic (KD), and gluten-free (GFD) diets are considered therapeutic. These kinds of diets are characterized by a reduction or exclusion of a specific nutrient from the entire dietary pattern. Despite these alimentary regimens showing beneficial effects on disease symptoms, they can affect microbiota composition, especially if they are protracted for a long time. To date, only a few studies have reported the effects of these diets on gut microbiota. In this review, we discuss the effects of low-FODMAPs, KD, and GFD on gut microbiota modulation in pathological conditions, advancing the possibility of depicting a balanced diet and developing personalized dietary intervention protocols.
36780094	Patterns of practice in the diagnosis, dietary counselling and follow-up of patients with celiac disease- A patient-based survey.	BACKGROUND: The pattern of practice regarding the diagnosis, dietary counselling and follow-up of patients with celiac disease (CeD) varies between practice to practice. METHODS: A web-based questionnaire based on review of literature, group discussions and expert group meetings was developed to understand the practice of CeD in India. The questionnaire was administered through social media (WhatsApp) to 18 Indian celiac support groups comprising 2980 patients with CeD. RESULTS: Overall, 970 (32.5%) patients responded to the questionnaire (median age: 21 years; females 63.9%). While 679 (71.1%) patients were diagnosed based on a combination of serology and biopsy, 214 (22.4%) were diagnosed based on serology alone. After diagnosis, 875 (91%) patients were counselled initially by physician and only 585 (61%) were referred to a dietician for dietary counselling. In a majority of cases, the time spent by doctors and dietitians during first counselling was between 10 and 20 minutes only. After first counselling, 191 (20%) and 355 (37.3%) patients did not re-visit the physician and the dietitian, respectively. Among those who followed up, structured follow-up was conducted in only 515 (53.8%) patients. Overall, 232 (24.3%) patients were self-monitoring their serological parameters, while 495 (51.8%) patients did not receive a formal assessment of dietary adherence during follow-up. CONCLUSION: The practice of diagnosis, dietary counselling and follow-up of patients with CeD in India is not as per standard guidelines. Most of the patients are not referred to a dietitian. There is a need for reinforcement of guidelines for proper care and management of patients with CeD.
22238404	Atypical celiac disease as cause of increased need for thyroxine: a systematic study.	OBJECTIVE: Replacement T4 dose in hypothyroid patients bearing both chronic autoimmune thyroiditis and atypical celiac disease (CD) has been analyzed. DESIGN: Replacement T4 dose has been analyzed in 35 hypothyroid patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) and atypical CD, as defined by the American Gastroenterological Association. We have evaluated the ability of the same dose of T4 to reach target TSH in 21 patients before and during gluten-free diet (GFD). In the remaining 14 patients, noncompliant with GFD, we analyzed replacement T4 dose and compared it with that in a similar group consisting of 68 patients with hypothyroid HT but no evidence of celiac sprue or other conditions interfering with T4 absorption. RESULTS: In patients with isolated HT, the desired serum TSH (median=1.02 mU/liter) was reached in all patients after 5+-2 months of treatment at a median T4 dose of 1.31 mug/kg d. After a similar period and dose of T4, higher levels of TSH (median=4.20 mU/liter) were observed in patients with HT and CD. In 21 CD patients, target TSH (median TSH=1.25 mU/liter) has been attained after 11+-3 months of GFD without increasing T4 dose (1.32 mug/kg d). In the remaining 14 patients, who were noncompliant with GFD, target TSH has also been achieved but at a higher T4 dose (median=1.96 mug/kg d; +49%; P=0.0002) than in hypothyroid patients without CD. CONCLUSIONS: Atypical CD increases the need for T4. The effect was reversed by GFD or by increasing T4 dose. Malabsorption of T4 may provide the opportunity to detect CD that was overlooked until the patients were put under T4 therapy.
30700359	Intestinal Spirocheteosis in a Patient with Celiac Disease.	A young girl presented to us with recurrent diarrhea along with a history of 5 kg weight loss in one year. On examination, she appeared pale, while her laboratory reports showed a low hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and serum albumin. Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was slightly raised with her iron profile suggestive of iron deficiency anemia. Viral markers, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serology along with thyroid profile were all unremarkable. There was no history of tuberculosis, and purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test was also negative. Computed tomography (CT) abdomen showed thickening of the terminal ileum with multiple enlarged lymph nodes. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) along with colonoscopy was done. Multiple biopsies were taken, which were suggestive of sprue along with intestinal spirochetosis. Her tissue transglutaminase (TTG) was negative while deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP) was positive. She was kept on gluten-free diet and started on tablet metronidazole. This case shows that intestinal spirochetosis should be kept in mind in patients belonging to lower socio-economic status, who present with chronic diarrhea symptoms.
28566880	Immune response to vaccines in children with celiac disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated systemic condition evoked by ingestion of gluten and related prolamines in genetically susceptible subjects. The disease is featured by a variable combination of clinical signs, specific antibodies, HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 haplotypes, and enteropathy. Vaccination is the most potent intervention for infectious disease prevention. Several factors including age, gender, ethnicity, quality and quantity of vaccine antigen, doses, and route of administration can influence immune response to vaccination, although the main cause of variation in the responsiveness among vaccine recipients is host genetic variability. The HLA system has a fundamental role in identifying the antigens introduced into the host with the vaccines and in the development of specific antibodies, and some HLA phenotypes have been associated with a less effective immunological response. The available literature indicates that the immunological response to vaccines in CD children does not differ markedly from that of general population and antibody titres are high enough to provide long-term protection, except for hepatitis B virus vaccine. In this article, we review and discuss the scarce literature in this field in order to provide clinical practice guidelines to achieve the most efficient monitoring of the response to vaccines in pediatric CD patients.
29382373	Refeeding syndrome in adults with celiac crisis: a case report.	BACKGROUND: Refeeding syndrome is a rare and life-threatening pathology with polyvisceral manifestations occurring in severely malnourished patients. It is rarely described in adults with celiac disease. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 28-year-old Tunisian woman followed up for celiac disease, who did not adhere to the gluten-free diet. She presented to our hospital with celiac crisis manifested by severe diarrhea, and metabolic and electrolyte disturbances. The treatment of electrolyte abnormalities, hydration, and nutritional support was marked by the occurrence on the fifth day of refeeding syndrome with psychomotor agitation followed by respiratory distress and a state of cardiogenic shock. CONCLUSIONS: Refeeding syndrome is still under-recognized. It should be systematically prevented for high-risk patients. Nutritional support in patients with celiac crisis should be monitored carefully since the risk of refeeding syndrome is very high with a poor prognosis.
31781909	A miRNA-Based Blood and Mucosal Approach for Detecting and Monitoring Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND: The role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in celiac disease (CD) is unclear. AIMS: We evaluated inflammation-related miRNA-146a, miRNA-155, miRNA-21, and miRNA-125b expression in peripheral blood and intestinal mucosa of CD adults. METHODS: Thirty patients with CD were included: patients with active CD on a gluten-containing diet (CD-active, n = 10), patients on a gluten-free diet (for at least 1 year), and patients with negative blood antibodies (CD-inactivePE, n = 10). In addition, ten healthy volunteers formed the comparison/control group. MiRNA expression was measured in duodenal biopsies from patients (CD-inactiveMU, n = 10) after in vitro exposure to PT gliadin and 33-mer peptide. MiRNAs expression was measured in plasma and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and monocytes, before and after in vitro exposure to native gliadin (gliadinN). RESULTS: Expression levels of miRNA-146a, miRNA-155, and miRNA-21 in PBMCs, miRNA-155 in monocytes and miRNA-155, miRNA-21, and miRNA-125b in plasma were elevated in both groups of celiac patients. After in vitro exposure with gliadinN, miRNA-146a and miRNA-155 expression markedly increased in PBMCs and monocytes, while miRNA-155 and miRNA-21 increased in the CD-active group. MiRNAs expression in intestinal mucosa did not change. MiRNA-146a and miRNA-155 expression showed high sensitivity and specificity for the presence of CD, irrespective of the current dietary treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Selected inflammation-related miRNAs expression is elevated in the peripheral blood of celiac. This suggests their participation in the immune processes underlying the pathology. Their similar response in active and inactive CD suggests that they should be further evaluated, as potential diagnostic biomarkers for CD.
24533607	Non-celiac gluten sensitivity: literature review.	BACKGROUND: A significant percentage of the general population report problems caused by wheat and/or gluten ingestion, even though they do not have celiac disease (CD) or wheat allergy (WA), because they test negative both for CD-specific serology and histopathology and for immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated assays. Most patients report both gastrointestinal and nongastrointestinal symptoms, and all report improvement of symptoms on a gluten-free diet. This clinical condition has been named non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). AIM: We attempt to define the current pathogenic, clinical, and diagnostic criteria of this "new" disease, to provide a practical view that might be useful to evaluate, diagnose, and manage NCGS patients. METHODS: We reviewed the international literature through PubMed and Medline, using the search terms "wheat (hyper)sensitivity," "wheat allergy," "wheat intolerance," "gluten (hyper)sensitivity," and "gluten intolerance," and we discuss current knowledge about NCGS. RESULTS: It has been demonstrated that patients suffering from NCGS are a heterogeneous group, composed of several subgroups, each characterized by different pathogenesis, clinical history, and, probably, clinical course. NCGS diagnosis can be reached only by excluding CD and WA. Recent evidence shows that a personal history of food allergy in infancy, coexistent atopy, positive for immunoglobulin G (IgG) antigliadin antibodies and flow cytometric basophil activation test, with wheat and duodenal and/or ileum-colon intraepithelial and lamina propria eosinophil counts, could be useful to identify NCGS patients. CONCLUSIONS: Future research should aim to identify reliable biomarkers for NCGS diagnosis and to better define the different NCGS subgroups. Key teaching points:   Most patients report both gastrointestinal and nongastrointestinal symptoms, and all agree that there is an improvement of symptoms on a gluten-free diet.   NCGS diagnosis can be reached only by excluding celiac disease and wheat allergy.   Patients suffering from NCGS are a heterogeneous group, composed of several subgroups, each characterized by different pathogenesis, clinical history, and, probably, clinical course.   A personal history of food allergy in infancy, coexistent atopy, positive IgG antigliadin antibodies (AGA) and flow cytometric basophil activation test, with wheat and duodenal and/or ileum-colon intraepithelial and lamina propria eosinophil counts, could be useful to identify NCGS patients.   Future research should aim to identify reliable biomarkers for NCGS diagnosis and to better define the different NCGS subgroup.
31888055	Celiac Disease: A Common Unrecognized Health Problem with a Very Delayed Diagnosis.	Celiac disease (CD) is a clinical entity of autoimmune nature, related to the presence of a permanent gluten intolerance that affects genetically predisposed individuals, producing a chronic inflammation process that usually occurs in the small bowel [...].
27021196	Current Status of Celiac Disease Drug Development.	Celiac disease (CeD) is one of the most common immune-mediated diseases. Symptoms and disease activity are incompletely controlled by the gluten-free diet, which is currently the only available therapy. Although no therapies are yet approved, there is a growing field of candidates and an improving understanding of the regulatory pathway. In this review, we briefly discuss the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and current treatment paradigm for CeD. We also review the major classes of therapies being considered for CeD and discuss extensively what is known and can be surmised regarding the regulatory pathway for approval of a CeD therapeutic. The coming years will see an increasing number and diversity of potential therapies entering clinical trials and hopefully the first approved agents targeting this significant unmet medical need. Although biomarkers including histology and serology will always be important in therapeutic clinical trials, they currently lack the necessary evidence linking them to improved patient outcomes required for use as primary outcomes for drug approval. For this reason, patient-reported outcomes will likely be primary end points in Phase III CeD trials for the foreseeable future.
22447132	The bowel and migraine: update on celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome.	This article explores possible relationships between migraine, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), celiac disease (CD), and gluten sensitivity. These seemingly distinct medical entities curiously share many common epidemiological, psychosocial, and pathophysiological similarities. Considerable evidence is emerging to support a concept that experiencing significant threatening adverse events creates a state of hypervigilance in the nervous system, which associates with exaggerated response to future threats and episodic attacks of migraine and IBS. While this sensitizing response is generally considered to reside in the central nervous system, it may be possible that the initiation resides in the enteric nervous system as well. What appears to link migraine, IBS, and CD is a disease model of a genetically sensitive nervous system transformed into one that is hypervigilant, and that over time can often develop disabling and pervasive disease.
36751856	Gluten-free diet affects fecal small non-coding RNA profiles and microbiome composition in celiac disease supporting a host-gut microbiota crosstalk.	Current treatment for celiac disease (CD) is adhering to a gluten-free diet (GFD), although its long-term molecular effects are still undescribed. New molecular features detectable in stool may improve and facilitate noninvasive clinical management of CD. For this purpose, fecal small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) and gut microbiome profiles were concomitantly explored in CD subjects in relation to strict (or not) GFD adherence over time. In this observational study, we performed small RNA and shotgun metagenomic sequencing in stool from 63 treated CD (tCD) and 3 untreated subjects as well as 66 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. tCD included 51 individuals on strict GFD and with negative transglutaminase (TG) serology (tCD-TG-) and 12 symptomatic with not strict/short-time of GFD adherence and positive TG serology (tCD-TG+). Samples from additional 40 healthy adult individuals and a cohort of 19 untreated pediatric CD subjects and 19 sex/age matched controls were analyzed to further test the outcomes. Several miRNA and microbial profiles were altered in tCD subjects (adj. p < .05). Findings were validated in the external group of adult controls. In tCD-TG-, GFD duration correlated with five miRNA levels (p < .05): for miR-4533-3p and miR-2681-3p, the longer the diet adherence, the less the expression differed from controls. tCD-TG+ and untreated pediatric CD patients showed a similar miRNA dysregulation. Immune-response, trans-membrane transport and cell death pathways were enriched in targets of identified miRNAs. Bifidobacterium longum, Ruminococcus bicirculans, and Haemophilus parainfluenzae abundances shifted (adj. p < .05) with a progressive reduction of denitrification pathways with GFD length. Integrative analysis highlighted 121 miRNA-bacterial relationships (adj. p < .05). Specific molecular patterns in stool characterize CD subjects, reflecting either the long-term GFD effects or the gut inflammatory status, in case of a not strict/short-time adherence. Our findings suggest novel host-microbial interplays and could help the discovery of biomarkers for GFD monitoring over time.
35404303	Evidence-Based and Emerging Diet Recommendations for Small Bowel Disorders.	Diet plays a key role in the manifestation and severity of gastrointestinal symptoms, with increasing research interest on the role of diet in small bowel disorders. There are predominantly 3 small bowel conditions that have potential dietary interventions. Self-reported nonceliac gluten/wheat sensitivity is prevalent. Although gluten is believed to be a potential trigger for symptoms, other components of wheat may also be triggers, including fructans, alpha-amylase trypsin inhibitors, and wheat germ agglutinins. The diagnosis can be challenging, given the lack of validated biomarkers. A gluten-free diet that excludes the abovementioned triggers is the cornerstone of treatment; however, unlike celiac disease, there is uncertainty about the level of adherence or whether the gluten-free diet is a lifelong intervention. Several primary gastrointestinal disorders are associated with an increase in inflammatory cells including eosinophils. Diet seems to be an important driver of disease pathogenesis in eosinophilic gastroenteritis, with elimination and elemental diets showing promise in management, with further robust trials required. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is an example of microbial dysbiosis, with renewed interest in diet being postulated to cause an adaptive change of the microbes colonizing the small intestine. However, the diagnosis of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is limited by a lack of sensitive and specific tests, with significant knowledge gaps in relation to therapeutic measures to manage and cure small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Currently, antimicrobials are the established management option. There have been significant clinical advances in dietary interventions related to the small bowel, but this area is currently a novel and advancing field for both patients and clinicians.
21152920	Celiac disease of the joint.	A 42-year-old woman presented with a 3-week history of left knee pain and swelling. She had suffered dermatitis herpetiformis for 12 years, proved by skin biopsy. She had never been on gluten-free diet. Knee pain increased with motion and her gait was antalgic. On admission, she was mainly dependent on wheelchair due to pain and limitation. Treatment plan consisted of gluten-free diet, stretching and strengthening exercises, analgesic or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs when needed. She responded well to gluten-free diet. Association of joint involvement and dermatitis herpetiformis is more than just coincidental. Possible immunopathogenesis and role of gluten-free diet on arthritis treatment are discussed.
22400905	In-vitro and in-vivo binding activity of chicken egg yolk immunoglobulin Y (IgY) against gliadin in food matrix.	Chicken egg yolk immunoglobulin Y (IgY) is a promising alternative for the prevention of enteric gliadin absorption, the predisposing factor of celiac disease (CD). IgY antibody was produced from the egg yolk of Single Comb White Leghorn chickens during the immunization period for the development of an oral immunotherapeutic agent. Here, we report the potential use of spray dried IgY antibody formulation using sugar protectants (mannitol, sorbitol, or microcrystalline cellulose powder (MCCP)). The long-term stability of the spray dried egg yolk powder formulated with 37.5% mannitol (EYP-M) preserved IgY antibody activity at 99.9%, which was significantly higher than that with other protectants (p < 0.05). In a dissolution test, the EYP-M shows 82.4% IgY activity after 2 h in simulated gastric fluid (SGF). A competitive ELISA at 50% inhibition (IC(50)) shows that 1.6 mg/mL EYP-M bound to 7.6 mg/mL and 10.5 mg/mL gliadin in SGF without and with food matrix conditions, respectively, whereas in simulated intestinal fluid, the formulation bound to 10 mg/mL gliadin, regardless of a food matrix. In-vivo study: BALB/c mice fed with EYP-M and gliadin at a ratio of 1:5 (w/w) demonstrated that gliadin absorption in the gastrointestinal tract was minimal at <1%. Thus, EYP-M containing IgY antibody may be used in CD patients to eliminate the effects of ingested toxic gliadin.
34684433	Iron Deficiency in Celiac Disease: Prevalence, Health Impact, and Clinical Management.	Iron is an essential nutrient to life and is required for erythropoiesis, oxidative, metabolism, and enzymatic activities. It is a cofactor for mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes, the citric acid cycle, and DNA synthesis, and it promotes the growth of immune system cells. Thus, iron deficiency (ID) leads to deleterious effects on the overall health of individuals, causing significant morbidity. Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is the most recognized type of anemia in patients with celiac disease (CD) and may be present in over half of patients at the time of diagnosis. Folate and vitamin B12 malabsorption, nutritional deficiencies, inflammation, blood loss, development of refractory CD, and concomitant Heliobacter pylori infection are other causes of anemia in such patients. The decision to replenish iron stores and the route of administration (oral or intravenous) are controversial due, in part, to questions surrounding the optimal formulation and route of administration. This paper provides an algorithm based on the severity of symptoms; its impact on the health-related quality of life (HRQL); the tolerance and efficiency of oral iron; and other factors that predict a poor response to oral iron, such as the severity of histological damage, poor adherence to GFD, and blood loss due to mucosal lesions.
36778054	Association of Serum Albumin, Globulin, and Transferrin Levels in Children of Poorly Managed Celiac Disease.	Background: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune genetic disorder in which gluten protein causes inflammation of the intestinal enterocytes. CD diagnosis in most cases is delayed or mistreated due to its varied clinical features. We aimed to evaluate the protein profile imbalance in different CD groups of children, which could help aid in the diagnosis and proper management of the disease. Methodology. This was a cross-sectional study with a nonrandom purposive sampling technique. All samples were taken from tertiary care hospitals of Hyderabad, Pakistan. In total, there were 175 children (age 3-15 years) divided into five equal groups (n = 35), namely, group A (control), group B (celiac diagnosed), group C (celiac-like symptoms), group D (celiac with type 1 diabetes mellitus), and group E (type 1 diabetes mellitus only). Clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters were analyzed among all the groups. Sera proteins, albumin, globulins, and transferrin levels were evaluated and compared with healthy individuals. Results: The albumin in serum of celiac groups B and C was 3.0 g/dl and 2.8 g/dl, respectively. While in diabetic patients with CD, it is 2.7 g/dl. The globulin levels were raised among all the celiac groups with typical GIT symptoms. The highest transferrin was observed in group B, celiac patients with severe anemia. Patients were not on GFD, hence had no or less recovery and had chronic symptoms of celiac. Conclusion: The misdiagnosis and poor management of celiac leads to chronic villous atrophy with imbalance in metabolic profile. Serum analysis of albumin, globulins, and transferrin may help in the diagnosis and proper management of the disease to recover the celiac symptoms.
38860336	Association between celiac disease and pneumococcal infections in hospitalized pediatric patients in the United States.	OBJECTIVE: Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy that is associated with pneumococcal infections in adults. The objective of this study is to evaluate the association between CD and pneumococcal infections in hospitalized pediatric patients in the United States (US). STUDY DESIGN: The triennial Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Kids' Inpatient Database was used in a retrospective analysis of children hospitalized in the US from 1997 to 2019. Billing codes were used to define patients with CD who were admitted with Streptococcus pneumoniae speciated infections or an infection commonly caused by S. pneumoniae. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to quantify increased odds of various types of infections for patients with CD. RESULTS: Among 55,080,914 pediatric hospital admissions, 15,412 were identified with CD, and 1,722,872 were admitted with the specified infections. CD was associated with both pneumococcus speciated infections (odd ratio [OR], 2.16, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38-3.38) and infections commonly caused by S. pneumoniae (OR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.61-1.96): pneumonia (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.53-1.89), sinusitis (OR, 2.41, 95% CI, 1.76-3.30), and bacteremia (OR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.56-2.88). Patients with CD had a significantly longer length of stay (p < 0.001) and a greater cost of hospitalization (p < 0.001) with pneumococcus associated infections. CONCLUSIONS: CD is associated with an increased risk of both pneumococcus speciated and pneumococcus-associated infections requiring hospitalization. CD admissions are associated with longer hospital stays and higher costs without increased risk of death. Routine pneumococcal vaccinations are strongly recommended for pediatric patients with CD.
33979762	Predictors of adherence to a gluten-free diet in celiac disease: Do knowledge, attitudes, experiences, symptoms, and quality of life play a role?	OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to identify the relationship between adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) and demographic characteristics, knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs regarding celiac disease (CD) and GFD, experiences of following a GFD, symptoms, and quality of life (QoL). METHODS: Patients with CD were recruited from outpatient clinics. Adherence to GFD was assessed using the CD adherence test (CDAT) and GFD score (GFD-S). Knowledge, attitudes, experiences, symptoms, and QoL were assessed using existing questionnaires. A multivariate logistic regression was performed. RESULTS: Overall, 116 patients with CD were included (48 +- 16 y; 70% female). Based on the CDAT, 58 patients (50%) were adequate adherers, but 86 patients (74%) were adequate adherers according to GFD-S. When adherence was measured using the CDAT, being female was associated with lower odds of adherence (odds ratio [OR]: 0.36; P = 0.028), and better emotional wellbeing was associated with higher odds of adherence (OR: 1.19; P < 0.001). When adherence was measured using GFD-S, membership in a support group (OR: 6.17; P = 0.002), stronger beliefs about the chronicity of CD (OR: 1.15; P = 0.059), and weaker beliefs on accident/chance causing CD (OR: 1.94; P = 0.05) were associated with greater odds of adherence. Difficulties when eating with family/friends (OR: 0.98; P = 0.005) and weaker beliefs on immunity causing CD (OR: 0.77; P = 0.031) were associated with lower odds of adherence. CONCLUSIONS: The association between gender, attending support groups, attitudes, experiences, and QoL with adherence to a GFD should be considered by health care professionals managing patients with CD.
23291460	Changed gluten immunity in celiac disease by Necator americanus provides new insights into autoimmunity.	We recently completed clinical trials in people with diet-treated celiac disease who were purposefully infected with the ubiquitous human hookworm, Necator americanus. Hookworm infection elicited not only parasite-specific immunity but also modified the host's immune response to gluten. After infection, mucosal IL-1beta and IL-22 responses were enhanced, but IFNgamma and IL-17A levels and circulating regulatory T cells following gluten challenge were suppressed, and the adaptive response to gluten acquired a helper T cell type-2 profile. In this review, we briefly, (i) highlight the utility celiac disease offers autoimmune research, (ii) discuss safety and personal experience with N. americanus, (iii) summarise the direct and bystander impact that hookworm infection has on mucosal immunity to the parasite and gluten, respectively, and (iv) speculate why this hookworm's success depends on healing its host and how this might impact on a propensity to autoimmunity.
30947869	The Liver and Celiac Disease.	Celiac disease is a multisystem disorder. Celiac hepatitis characterized by gluten-responsive mild elevation of transaminases is the more common liver manifestation of celiac disease. Celiac disease may also be associated or coexist with other chronic liver disorders. Shared genetic risk and increased intestinal permeability have been suggested to be the most relevant events in the pathogenesis of liver injury in celiac disease. The aim of this article is to review the full spectrum of liver disorders in patients with celiac disease.
24565339	Autoantibodies against MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A are associated with increased risk of concomitant autoimmune diseases in celiac patients.	BACKGROUND: Overexpression of autologous proteins can lead to the formation of autoantibodies and autoimmune diseases. MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A (MICA) is highly expressed in the enterocytes of patients with celiac disease, which arises in response to gluten. The aim of this study was to investigate anti-MICA antibody formation in patients with celiac disease and its association with other autoimmune processes. METHODS: We tested serum samples from 383 patients with celiac disease, obtained before they took up a gluten-free diet, 428 patients with diverse autoimmune diseases, and 200 controls for anti-MICA antibodies. All samples were also tested for anti-endomysium and anti-transglutaminase antibodies. RESULTS: Antibodies against MICA were detected in samples from 41.7% of patients with celiac disease but in only 3.5% of those from controls (P <0.0001) and 8.2% from patients with autoimmune disease (P <0.0001). These antibodies disappeared after the instauration of a gluten-free diet. Anti-MICA antibodies were significantly prevalent in younger patients (P <0.01). Fifty-eight patients with celiac disease (15.1%) presented a concomitant autoimmune disease. Anti-MICA-positive patients had a higher risk of autoimmune disease than MICA antibody-negative patients (P <0.0001; odds ratio = 6.11). The risk was even higher when we also controlled for age (odds ratio = 11.69). Finally, we found that the associated risk of developing additional autoimmune diseases was 16 and 10 times as high in pediatric patients and adults with anti-MICA, respectively, as in those without. CONCLUSIONS: The development of anti-MICA antibodies could be related to a gluten-containing diet, and seems to be involved in the development of autoimmune diseases in patients with celiac disease, especially younger ones.
27024530	Considering a gluten-free diet.  It's not just for people with celiac disease.  But is it for you?	
28209104	Impact of gluten-free diet on quality of life in celiac patients.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: Celiac disease (CD) is a common gluten-related disorder, whose only treatment is a gluten-free diet (GFD). Since a unique view on psychological consequences of a GFD still lacks, our aim was to assess the quality of life (QoL) and the depression state in symptomatic CD patients after GFD. Socio-demographic features were considered. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 210 adult CD patients were recruited and divided into 3 groups : 70 newly diagnosed patients (Group A),70 patients who have been on GFD for 6-12 months (Group B), and 70 patients who have been on GFD for more than 12 months (Group C). We recruited 210 healthy controls (Group D). Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWBI) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) questionnaires were administered. Each group was evaluated according to age, gender and school ranking. RESULTS: Groups A and B showed lower PGWBI scores compared with both Group C and D (p <0.001 for each comparison). Moreover, Groups A and B showed higher BDI scores compared with both Group C and D (p <0.001 for each comparison).Women, the elderly and the poorly educated seemed to suffer more psychological stress. CONCLUSION: GFD induces an improvement of well-being and a decrease of depression state after 12 months of strict GFD. Negative psychological implications were observed only in specific risk categories. (Acta gastroenterol. belg., 2016, 79, 447-453).
29793402	Gluten in "gluten-free" food from food outlets in Melbourne: a cross-sectional study.	
30400639	The Handbook of Minerals on a Gluten-Free Diet.	The importance of a gluten-free diet (GFD) in the treatment of celiac disease and other gluten-related disorders is undisputable. However, strict GFD often lead to nutritional imbalances and, therefore, to deficiencies. One of the most common deficiencies from a GFD are an insufficient amount of Ca, Fe, Mg, and Zn. This is mainly because the most of popular gluten-free (GF) raw materials are poor in minerals. Although the popularity of GFD is constantly growing, the data on minerals in GF products are still limited. More importantly, an access to the data is even more restricted. Therefore, the paper reviews the Ca, Fe, Mg, and Zn contents in hundreds of grain GF products available worldwide. The data for 444 products from categories of flours, mixes for cooking, bakery products, cereals, groats, rice, and pasta are obtained from research papers and nutritional databases. The calculation of the realization of mineral requirements from a portion of each product with its graphical classification as rich/average/poor source of each mineral is given. The review is a handbook of minerals for people on a GFD, dietitians, and food producers.

33057793	Analysis of gluten immunogenic peptides in feces to assess adherence to the gluten-free diet in pediatric celiac patients.	PURPOSE: In celiac disease (CD) there is a need for precise and non-invasive tools to assess dietary compliance to the gluten-free diet (GFD). Our aim is to evaluate the efficacy of the detection of gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) in feces, to monitor in real life, the adherence to GFD in pediatric patients with CD. METHODS: A cross-sectional, prospective study was conducted. Fecal samples from CD children were analyzed by a rapid immunochromatographic (IC) test and by an ELISA method, both based on the antigliadin 33-mer monoclonal antibody. RESULTS: Group 1 comprises 43 children on a GFD. According to the food records (FR), 39/43 patients were compliant with the GFD and gluten consumption was recorded in 4. GIP were detected in 15/43 individuals by the ELISA method and also in 7 by IC strips. Group 2: comprise 18 children at CD diagnosis; GIP levels decreased over time (p < 0.001) in a non-linear way (p = 0.028) after starting a GFD and were below the detection limit on the third day in most individuals. CONCLUSION: GIP were detected, both by ELISA and by IC strips, in CD patients on a GFD, in which no consumption of gluten had been registered on the FR, confirming GIP detection to be superior to FR discovering involuntary transgressions. Despite a positive correlation between the amount of gluten intake and the concentration of GIP in feces, the interindividual variations observed suggest gastrointestinal factors influencing GIP recovery need to be further investigated.
35810096	Adherence to a gluten-free diet in celiac disease patients from Paraguay.	INTRODUCTION AND AIM: The treatment for celiac disease is a gluten-free diet that should be strictly and permanently carried out. Our aims were to determine adherence to the gluten-free diet and the risk factors for non-adherence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An observational, cross-sectional, comparative study was conducted. It included individuals of both sexes and of any age that presented with celiac disease, lived in Paraguay from January to April 2021, and agreed to participate in the survey. Incomplete questionnaires were excluded. Non-probabilistic convenience sampling was utilized. Adherence was measured using the Leffler questionnaire. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Universidad Privada del Este. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 371 respondents, 322 (87%) of whom were adults, with a mean age of 38 +- 12 years, and 49 (13%) of whom were children and adolescents, with a mean age of 10 +- 5 years. Female sex was predominant (85%). Adherence to the gluten-free diet was detected in 59% of the adults and 73% of the children and adolescents. The factors significantly associated with adherence included belonging to the child and adolescent age group and having had the diagnosis for a longer time: 9 +- 8 years for the adherence group and 7 +- 8 years for the non-adherence group. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated the frequency of adherence to the gluten-free diet in celiac patients in Paraguay. Psychologic and nutritional support is recommended for individuals with celiac disease that do not adhere to their treatment.
21453693	IgA-class autoantibodies against neuronal transglutaminase, TG6 in celiac disease: no evidence for gluten dependency.	BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that antibodies against transglutaminase (TG) 6 could serve as a biomarker to identify a subgroup of gluten-sensitive patients who may be at risk of developing neurological disease. We here investigated whether TG6-targeted autoantibodies are a characteristic feature of celiac patients, especially those with neurological symptoms, and further, whether such antibodies are gluten-dependent. METHODS: Serum IgA-class TG6 autoantibodies were measured in untreated and treated celiac patients with and without neurological manifestions and in non-celiac controls. The results were compared to TG2 autoantibody levels. RESULTS: During a gluten-containing diet the number of TG6 autoantibody-positive celiac patients with neurological problems (25%) did not significantly differ from that of TG6-seropositive patients without neurological impairment (16%) or from non-celiac controls (15%). This was in contrast to our finding in TG2 autoantibody-positive individuals, whose numbers differed significantly between all three study groups. On a gluten-free diet the levels of TG6 autoantibodies remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the serum IgA-class TG6 autoantibody assay is not able to distinguish gluten-sensitive patients with neurological manifestations from celiac patients without neurological problems or from control subjects, and further, that TG6 autoantibodies are not gluten-dependent.

23149063	Porto-pulmonary hypertension exacerbated by platelet transfusion in a patient with ADAMTS13 deficiency.	We propose that porto-pulmonary hypertension (PPH) may arise as a consequence of deficiency of ADAMTS13 (a plasma metalloprotease that regulates von Willebrand factor size and reduces its platelet adhesive activity) and provide a clinical case history to support our hypothesis. A patient with non-cirrhotic intrahepatic portal hypertension (NCIPH), ulcerative colitis and celiac disease developed symptoms of PPH, which had advanced beyond levels which would have made her an eligible candidate for liver transplantation (mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) 49 mm Hg). She was known to have severe ADAMTS13 deficiency, which we considered to be causative of, or contributory to her NCIPH. We postulated that increasing porto-systemic shunting associated with advancing portal hypertension would make the next encountered vascular bed, the lung, susceptible to the pathogenic process that was previously confined to the portal system, with pulmonary hypertension as its consequence. Her pulmonary artery pressures fell significantly during the next year on weekly replacement of plasma ADAMTS13 by infusions of fresh frozen plasma and conventional drug treatment of her pulmonary hypertension. Her pulmonary artery pressures had fallen to acceptable levels when, in response to platelet infusion, it rose precipitously and dangerously. The sequence strongly supports our hypothesis that PPH is a consequence of ADAMTS13 deficiency and is caused by platelet deposition in afferent pulmonary vessels.
32439499	Celiac Disease Patients Should No Longer Be Consuming Measurable Amounts of Gluten.	
30711211	Nutritional Considerations of the Gluten-Free Diet.	Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune-related disease causing inflammation in the small intestine triggered by the ingestion of gluten in the diet. The gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only treatment. Nutritional deficiencies of macronutrients and micronutrients are frequently found in untreated or newly diagnosed CD. A registered dietitian nutritionist is uniquely qualified to educate on the GFD and assess and support nutritional status at diagnosis and long term as well as helping patients with nonresponsive CD. Quality of life is important to address in individuals with CD because the GFD affects all aspects of life.
29207559	Tooth Wear Is Frequent in Adult Patients with Celiac Disease.	(1) Background: Celiac disease (CD) patients can be affected by mouth and tooth disorders, which are influenced by their gluten-free diet. The aim of our research was to evaluate the pathological conditions of the stomatognathic system observed in celiac patients on a gluten-free diet. (2) Methods: we consecutively recruited celiac patients on a gluten-free diet at our celiac center, as well as healthy volunteers. Two dentists examined all patients/controls and checked them for any mouth disorder. (3) Results: Forty-nine patients affected by celiac disease (age at test 31.8 +- 11.58, time on GFD 8.73 +- 7.7) and 51 healthy volunteers (age at test 30.5 +- 8.7) were included. Recurrent aphthous stomatitis was reported in 26 patients (53.0%) and in 13 (25.5%) controls (p = 0.005). Dental enamel disorders were reported in 7 patients (14.3%) and in 0 controls (p = 0.002), with none having geographic tongue. We found non-specific tooth wear, characterized by loss of the mineralized tissue of the teeth, in 9 patients (18.3%) and in 3 (5.9%) controls (p = 0.05). (4) Conclusion: Recurrent aphthous stomatitis and enamel hypoplasia are "risk indicators" that may suggest that an individual has CD. We detected a high prevalence of non-specific tooth wear that can be caused by several factors such as malocclusion, sleep bruxism, parafunctional activity, and age.
31320223	Celiac Disease and Its Role in the Development of Metabolic Bone Disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy that occurs in genetically susceptible hosts with the ingestion of gluten-containing products. Ongoing gluten consumption leads to intestinal damage, characterized by villous blunting and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes, resulting in malabsorption. Pertinent to the development of bone disease, malabsorption of calcium and vitamin D leads to secondary hyperparathyroidism and metabolic bone disease among individuals with CD. In this article, we review the pathogenesis of CD and the effects of malabsorption on bone health. Imbalances in bone resorption and formation particularly in individuals with CD and persistent disease activity ultimately lead to a state of bone loss and impaired mineralization. Initiation of a gluten-free diet is critical in the management of CD-related metabolic bone disease, demonstrating improvements in bone mineral density within the first year of dietary adherence.

BACKGROUND: Nexvax2  is a novel, peptide-based, epitope-specific immunotherapy intended to be administered by regular injections at dose levels that increase the threshold for clinical reactivity to natural exposure to gluten and ultimately restore tolerance to gluten in patients with celiac disease. Celiac disease patients administered fixed intradermal doses of Nexvax2 become unresponsive to the HLA-DQ2 5-restricted gluten epitopes in Nexvax2, but gastrointestinal symptoms and cytokine release mimicking gluten exposure, that accompany the first dose, limit the maximum tolerated dose to 150mug. Our aim was to test whether stepwise dose escalation attenuated the first dose effect of Nexvax2 in celiac disease patients. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at four community sites in Australia (3) and New Zealand (1) in HLA-DQ2 5 genotype positive adults with celiac disease who were on a gluten-free diet. Participants were assigned to cohort 1 if they were HLA-DQ2 5 homozygotes; other participants were assigned to cohort 2, or to cohort 3 subsequent to completion of cohort 2. Manual central randomization without blocking was used to assign treatment for each cohort. Initially, Nexvax2-treated participants in cohorts 1 and 2 received an intradermal dose of 30mug (consisting of 10mug of each constituent peptide), followed by 60mug, 90mug, 150mug, and then eight doses of 300mug over six weeks, but this was amended to include doses of 3mug and 9mug and extended over a total of seven weeks. Nexvax2-treated participants in cohort 3 received doses of 3mug, 9mug, 30mug, 60mug, 90mug, 150mug, 300mug, 450mug, 600mug, 750mug, and then eight of 900mug over nine weeks. The dose interval was 3 or 4days. Participants, care providers, data managers, sponsor personnel, and study site personnel were blinded to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was the number of adverse events and percentage of participants with adverse events during the treatment period. This completed trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02528799. FINDINGS: From the 73 participants who we screened from 19 August 2015 to 31 October 2016, 24 did not meet eligibility criteria, and 36 were ultimately randomized and received study drug. For cohort 1, seven participants received Nexvax2 (two with the starting dose of 30mug and then five at 3mug) and three received placebo. For cohort 2, 10 participants received Nexvax2 (four with starting dose of 30mug and then six at 3mug) and four received placebo. For cohort 3, 10 participants received Nexvax2 and two received placebo. All 36 participants were included in safety and immune analyses, and 33 participants completed treatment and follow-up; in cohort 3, 11 participants were assessed and included in pharmacokinetics and duodenal histology analyses. Whereas the maximum dose of Nexvax2 had previously been limited by adverse events and cytokine release, no such effect was observed when dosing escalated from 3mug up to 300mug in HLA-DQ2 5 homozygotes or to 900mug in HLA-DQ2.5 non-homozygotes. Adverse events with Nexvax2 treatment were less common in cohorts 1 and 2 with the starting dose of 3mug (72 for 11 participants) than with the starting dose of 30mug (91 for six participants). Adverse events during the treatment period in placebo-treated participants (46 for nine participants) were similar to those in Nexvax2-treated participants when the starting dose was 3mug in cohort 1 (16 for five participants), cohort 2 (56 for six participants), and cohort 3 (44 for 10 participants). Two participants in cohort 2 and one in cohort 3 who received Nexvax2 starting at 3mug did not report any adverse event, while the other 33 participants experienced at least one adverse event. One participant, who was in cohort 1, withdrew from the study due to adverse events, which included abdominal pain graded moderate or severe and associated with nausea after receiving the starting dose of 30mug and one 60mug dose. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events in the Nexvax2 participants were headache (52%), diarrhoea (48%), nausea (37%), abdominal pain (26%), and abdominal discomfort (19%). Administration of Nexvax2 at dose levels from 150mug to 900mug preceded by dose escalation was not associated with elevations in plasma cytokines at 4h. Nexvax2 treatment was associated with trends towards improved duodenal histology. Plasma concentrations of Nexvax2 peptides were dose-dependent. INTERPRETATION: We show that antigenic peptides recognized by CD4-positive T cells in an autoimmune disease can be safely administered to patients at high maintenance dose levels without immune activation if preceded by gradual dose escalation. These findings facilitate efficacy studies that test high-dose epitope-specific immunotherapy in celiac disease.
29880904	Oxidative stress as a biomarker for monitoring treated celiac disease.	INTRODUCTION: High levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and impaired antioxidant defense systems lead to oxidative stress (OxS) and tissue injury in different intestinal and extra intestinal conditions, including celiac disease (CD). The aim of the present study was to investigate the role and potential use of ROS and other biomarkers of OxS in the clinical management of CD. METHODS: We collected duodenal specimens and blood samples from naive patients (N-CD), patients on a gluten free diet (GFD) including responders (CD-GFD) and non-responders (NRCD). We measured plasmatic ROS production (electron paramagnetic resonance, EPR), lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, TBARS), protein oxidation (protein carbonyl, PC), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), nitric oxides and glutathione (GSH) in erythrocytes. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients affected by CD were enrolled (17 N-CD, 18 CD-GFD and 19 NRCD; 44 F; age 44 +- 13 years). A significant increase of plasmatic OxS biomarkers (ROS, peroxidated lipids, oxidized proteins, and nitrate concentrations) and decrease of antioxidant species (TAC and GSH levels) were found in NRCD and N-CD compared to CD-GFD. Comparably, a significant direct relationship between the severity of duodenal atrophy, ROS production rates and TBARS was found; conversely, TAC and GSH presented an inverse correlation. DISCUSSION: OxS is involved in CD tissue damage and correlates with the degree of duodenal atrophy. These findings suggest the possible role of OxS biomarkers as indicators of CD activity during the clinical follow-up.
37447301	Heavy Metal and Rice in Gluten-Free Diets: Are They a Risk?	A gluten-free diet (GFD) is the treatment of choice for gluten-related disorders. It has been associated with macro- and micronutrient deficiencies. Recently, consumption of arsenic-contaminated rice has raised concern because of the potential greater risk that it may represent for people on GFDs, whose rice consumption is high, since it is a fundamental cereal in GFDs. We reviewed the data published over the last 20 years in Medline and Scielo, in English, French and Spanish, on four metals (As, Hg, Cd, and Pb), to assess whether the evidence suggests that celiac disease or consumption of a GFD is associated with increased levels of blood/urinary metal concentrations. The review revealed a few articles that were directly related to the four metals and their relationships with a GFD. The evidence supports that rice-based products are a relevant source of As and other metals. Clinical studies and evaluations based on NHANES have indicated that persons on GFDs have higher As and Hg blood/urinary levels, suggesting that the diet and not the disease is responsible for it. The levels described are statistically significant compared to those of persons on complete diets, but far from toxic levels. The question of whether higher exposure to heavy metals associated with a GFD is biologically relevant remains unanswered and deserves study.
30189691	PNPLA3 rs738409 Polymorphism Predicts Development and Severity of Hepatic Steatosis but Not Metabolic Syndrome in Celiac Disease.	Metabolic syndrome (MS) and hepatic steatosis (HS) have been described in patients with celiac disease (CD) after starting a gluten-free diet (GFD), but data on predictive factors for these conditions are scarce. Recently, the patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3) rs738409 has been identified as a key factor for HS development in the general population. The aim of the study was to evaluate the role of PNPLA3 rs738409 in the development of MS and HS in CD patients after starting GFD. Between June 2014 and September 2016, we consecutively enrolled CD patients with HS, while those without steatosis served as a control group. All patients underwent anthropometric and serologic investigations, ultrasonography (US) to assess the degree and severity of HS, and genotyping of the PNPLA3 rs738409 polymorphism. Finally, 370 subjects were enrolled (136 with and 234 without HS). At genotyping assays, the CC genotype was found in 194 subjects (52.4%), the CG genotype in 138 subjects (37.3%), and the GG genotype in 38 subjects (10.2%). At binary logistic regression, only CG and GG alleles were predictive for the development of HS (odds ratio (OR) 1.97; p < 0.01 for CG and OR 6.9; p < 0.001 for GG). Body mass index (BMI) (OR 3.8; p < 0.001) and waist circumference (OR 2.8; p = 0.03) at CD diagnosis were the only independent factors for the development of MS. Intergroup comparisons showed that the severe grade of HS was more frequently observed in GG than in CC carriers (74% vs. 11.3%, p < 0.001, OR 21.8). PNPLA3 CG and GG carriers with CD have a higher susceptibility to hepatic steatosis, but not to metabolic syndrome. Moreover, patients with GG alleles display more severe forms of HS based on ultrasound.
32919023	Determinants of gluten-free diet adoption among individuals without celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity.	OBJECTIVES: Gluten-free (GF) foods are typically less nutritious and more expensive than their gluten-containing variants, yet people without a diagnosed gluten sensitivity continue to adopt this diet. There is a lack of research about what factors drive people without Celiac disease or non-Celiac gluten sensitivity to follow the GF diet. METHODS: A nationally representative sample of 2982 US residents without a diagnosed gluten sensitivity were surveyed about their attitudes, perceptions, and experiences with the GF diet. Logistic regression was used to compare respondents who were currently avoiding or had avoided gluten previously (GF consumer) to respondents who had never tried a GF diet (non-GF consumer). RESULTS: Over one-fifth of respondents were GF consumers. Beliefs that a gluten-reduced diet is healthier (OR 1.69; 95% CI [1.30,2.18]), that GF products are more nutritious (OR 1.46, 95% CI [1.11,1.90), and that a GF diet can help clear acne (OR 1.46; 95% CI [1.13,1.88]) were all positively associated with trying a GF diet. Personal research was the most influential source of information associated with trying a GF diet (OR 2.92; 95% CI [1.91,4.52]). This was followed by "healthcare center or health professional" (OR 2.57; 95% CI [1.71,3.90]. Respondents who were never encouraged to try the GF diet were less likely to try the diet (OR 0.33, 95% CI [0.23,0.46]). CONCLUSIONS: Positive, but scientifically unsubstantiated, beliefs about the benefits of the GF diet were strongly associated with trying a GF diet, and the source of recommendation to try a GF diet was important.
32900652	Clinical characteristics and long-term health in celiac disease patients diagnosed in early childhood: Large cohort study.	BACKGROUND: Early detection of celiac disease could theoretically prevent most of the disease-associated complications, but long-term effects of this approach are unclear. AIMS: To investigate features at diagnosis and adulthood health in celiac disease patients diagnosed in early childhood in 1965-2014. METHODS: Medical data on 978 pediatric patients were collected and study questionnaires sent to 559 adult patients who were diagnosed in childhood. Results were compared between patients diagnosed in early (<=3.0 years) and later (3.1-17.9 years) childhood. RESULTS: Early diagnosed patients (n=131) had more often total villous atrophy (37% vs 25%, p=0.001), gastrointestinal presentation (61% vs 47%, p<0.001), growth disturbances (70% vs 32%, p=0.001) and severe symptoms (30% vs 9%, p<0.001) and were less often screen-detected (10% vs 27%, p<0.001) at diagnosis than those diagnosed later (n=847). Among 239 adult responders, early diagnosed patients (n=36) had fewer comorbidities (33% vs 53%, p=0.034) but considered their health less often good/excellent (69% vs 84%, p=0.029). The groups were comparable in current age, dietary adherence, symptoms and health-related quality of life. CONCLUSION: Despite more severe initial presentation, the long-term health in early diagnosed patients was mostly comparable or even better to those diagnosed later in childhood. Poorer self-perceived health suggests a need for support during the transition to adulthood care.
36028163	The Exploration of the Eating Experience in Adults with Celiac Disease: A Phenomenological Qualitative Study.	BACKGROUND: The adjustment to a strict gluten-free diet for adults diagnosed with celiac disease (CD) may lead to changes in the eating experience affecting the physical, social, and emotional states. OBJECTIVE: Through the application of the Social Cognitive Transition Model of Adjustment, the aim of the study was to explore the adjustment in the eating experience in adults recently diagnosed with CD and transitioning to a gluten-free diet. DESIGN: This was a qualitative phenomenological study conducted using semistructured interviews. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Seventeen adults from the midwestern United States who were diagnosed with CD between 6 months and 5 years before the study were recruited using social media CD sites and snowball sampling. Participants completed a semistructured interview on Zoom and the Celiac Disease Adherence Test and CeliacQ-7 questionnaires from May to November 2020. STATISTICA ANALYSES PERFORMED: Two trained qualitative researchers engaged in four steps to reduce and contextualize the data: horizontilization, reduction and elimination, clustering and thematizing, and composition of textural description. During analysis, the Social Cognitive Transition Model of Adjustment was incorporated for organization of themes and text description. RESULTS: There was moderate to high dietary adherence in 14 of 17 participants and quality of life scores ranged from 19 to 43 (median = 33). Five themes emerged aligning with Social Cognitive Transition Model of Adjustment, describing the adjustment in pre- and postdiagnosis eating experience and the coping and behaviors enacted during adjustment to a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: In individuals with CD, moving beyond problem solving and identifying psychosocial and emotional attributes in the adoption of a gluten-free diet need to be considered to promote maintenance of quality of life and dietary adherence.

35493494	Case Report: Fulminant Celiac Disease With Combination Immune Checkpoint Therapy.	Since the first approval of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in 2011, these agents have rapidly become an integral treatment option across tumor types. However, with the increased adoption of ICIs, the incidence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) continues to rise, and rare toxicity continues to be reported. Here, we present a case of a 70-year-old male patient with widespread metastatic melanoma who developed rapid onset anasarca and transaminitis after initiation of dual anti-PD-1/CTLA-4 inhibition with nivolumab and ipilimumab. An extensive workup was performed with serologies returning positive for anti-tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin (tTG-IgA) and endoscopy revealing duodenal mucosal atrophy with duodenal biopsies confirming celiac disease. All symptoms resolved after initiation of a gluten-free diet without the addition of immunosuppression. This case highlights the importance of considering celiac disease in patients with suspected protein-losing enteropathy on ICI, the fulminant nature this uncommon irAE can present with, and underscores the broad differential clinicians must maintain when managing presumed irAEs.
37985252	Sieving out non-celiac gluten sensitivity amongst patients with irritable bowel syndrome.	OBJECTIVES: It is challenging to make diagnosis of non-celiac gluten sensitivity/non-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCGS/NCWS) in clinical practice, since there is no biomarker and diagnosis is based on response to gluten-free-diet (GFD). We used anti-gliadin antibody (AGA) for screening patients with IBS for gluten-sensitivity. METHODS: 492 Adult-patients with IBS underwent screening for celiac disease and gluten-sensitivity using IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody and IgA-AGA and IgG-AGA, respectively. Patients with positive AGA (IgA and/or IgG) were invited to follow GFD, those willing were put on GFD for 6-weeks. Responsive patients were given gluten re-challenge. Diagnosis of NCGS was confirmed if they had recurrence of symptoms. RESULTS: Of 492 patients with IBS, AGA was positive in 61(12.4 %), hence suspected to have gluten-sensitivity. Of 31 who agreed to participate and followed GFD for 6-weeks, 17 (54.8 %) had complete (>30 % improvement) and 10(32.2 %) had partial (>20 % improvement) response. All 17 complete-responders were given gluten re-challenge for 6-weeks, symptoms recurred in all and hence were confirmed to have NCGS/NCWS. Significant decrease in AGA levels occurred almost in all GFD-responders. CONCLUSIONS: 12.4 % IBS patients have biological evidence of gluten/wheat-sensitivity. Almost 87 % patients with IBS having AGA responded to GFD. The value of AGA may further be explored as a biomarker for screening for the presence of NCGS, before recommending this test for the clinical practice.
37625870	Isolation and cryopreservation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells.	The study of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in immune-mediated diseases, such as celiac disease (CD), is important to uncover pathogenesis, find new biomarkers and discover and evaluate new treatments. Many studies have been published about the use and value of PBMCs in CD such as those including enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays, flow cytometry, peptide-MHC tetramers, genetic and proteomic analyses, and in vitro and proliferation assays. We present here and easy and efficient method for isolation of PBMCs using density gradient centrifugation. We also describe a simple way to freeze PBMCs in order to preserve their number and viability and a thawing procedure leading to high rates of viability of the cryopreserved cells to be used in subsequent applications.
33361748	Celiac Disease in an Adult Presenting as Behavioral Disturbances.	BACKGROUND Celiac disease is very common, with some estimates placing the prevalence at approximately 1: 300 worldwide. Typified by autoimmune degradation of the duodenal brush border due to reactivity with dietary gluten, causing malabsorption, it classically presents with both gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms. Gastrointestinal symptoms commonly include diarrhea, constipation, foul steatorrhea, flatulence, and bloating. With increased awareness and availability of testing, it is rare that a patient would present with celiac crisis, which is a syndrome of profuse diarrhea and severe metabolic/nutritional disturbances. In children, interestingly, celiac disease can present primarily as behavioral disturbance, such as increased aggression or anxiety, with milder or absent gastrointestinal symptoms. CASE REPORT A 25-year-old man with a history of schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder presented for behavioral disturbance after breaking into a neighbor's house to eat food. He also reported several months of diarrhea and fecal incontinence and was noted to have severe malnutrition on exam, despite dramatic food intake. Tissue transglutaminase IgA antibody (TTG) and gliadin IgA were highly suggestive of celiac disease, which was confirmed by biopsy. He was started on a lactose-free and gluten-free diet, and required a short course of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for nutritional resuscitation. He improved rapidly with this intervention, and returned to nutritional and behavioral baseline. CONCLUSIONS We report a unique case in which an adult with psychiatric comorbidities presented with predominantly behavioral disturbances, a more common presentation in children with the disorder. These patients may present in an atypical fashion, and the clinician should have a high index of suspicion.
28223238	Self-compassion directly and indirectly predicts dietary adherence and quality of life among adults with celiac disease.	Strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only treatment for preventing both short- and long-term consequences of celiac disease. Given that following a strict GFD can be difficult, evidence-based strategies are needed to improve the psychological experience of living with celiac disease and following the GFD. Self-compassion appears to be an important component of effectively self-regulating one's behavior to cope with a chronic disease. The main goal of this study was to examine the relationships between self-compassion and management of celiac disease as assessed by (a) adherence to a strict GFD and (b) celiac-specific quality of life (CQoL). The secondary goal of this study was to explore self-regulatory efficacy (i.e., confidence in one's ability to self-manage behavior to follow a strict GFD) and concurrent self-regulatory efficacy (i.e., one's confidence to self-manage other valued life goals while following a strict GFD) as mediators of the relationship between self-compassion and the primary outcomes (adherence and CQoL). In this prospective study, 200 North American adults diagnosed with celiac disease completed online questionnaires at two time points (baseline and 1 month later). Self-compassion at baseline directly predicted stricter adherence (at Time 2; b = -0.63, p = 0.006) and enhanced CQoL (at Time 2; b = -0.50, p = 0.001). Further, self-compassion (at Time 1) also indirectly predicted stricter Time 2 adherence through self-regulatory efficacy (at Time 1; b = -0.26, 95% CI [-0.58, -0.04], R2 = 0.29) and enhanced Time 2 CQoL through concurrent self-regulatory efficacy (at Time 1; b = -0.07, 95% CI [-0.14, -0.03], R2 = 0.33). This was the first study to assess the effects of self-compassion in relation to the psychological experience of coping with celiac disease and following a GFD. The findings indicate that self-compassion, self-regulatory efficacy and concurrent self-regulatory efficacy are important cognitions in understanding adherence to a GFD and CQoL among adults with celiac disease.
23142793	Neo-epitope tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies as a biomarker of the gluten sensitive skin disease--dermatitis herpetiformis.	BACKGROUND: The deamidated gliadin peptides (DGP) cross linked to human tissue transglutaminase (tTg) comprises a novel neo-epitope structure (Neo-tTg) for serological screening of celiac disease (CD). Our aim is to verify anti-Neo-tTg IgA and IgG in adults with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). METHODS: Multi-centric retrospective evaluation of the IgA/G autoantibodies in sera of DH patients on a regular diet (n=40) and a gluten restricted diet (GRD, n=53) and control adults with autoimmune skin diseases (n=107) by ELISA. RESULTS: The sensitivities of Celicheck Neo IgA/G (76%, 95% CI 67-84%) and the Neo tTg-A (85%, 95% CI 70-97%) ELISA were significantly greater than that of tTg-A (56%, 95% CI 46-67%), eTg-A (62%, 95% CI 52-72%), DGP-A (55%, 95% CI 55-65%), DGP-G (61%, 95% CI 51-71%), Glia-A (55%, 95% CI 45-65%) and Glia-G (56%, 95% CI 46-66%) ELISA. The specificities of all 8 ELISA were in the range of 90-100%. The area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) for the two Neo-tTg ELISA (0.863 and 0.949) were higher than the AUCs for ROCs of tTg, DGP and eTG ELISA (range between 0.657 and 0.783). The autoantibody levels of DH patients on a normal diet were significantly higher than those on GRD in the Celicheck Neo IgA/IgG, NeotTg-A; tTg-A and the eTg-A; ELISA (p<0.01) and of no significance in the DGP and Gliadin ELISA. CONCLUSION: Neo-epitope IgA autoantibodies represent a new and sensitive serological marker of DH.
30405092	Motility Disorders in Celiac Disease and Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity: The Impact of a Gluten-Free Diet.	Background: There is evidence that digestive motor disorders are frequently present in untreated celiac disease (CD) patients. Similarly, non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) can be associated with gut motor disorders. In both cases, gut dysmotility can improve or be completely reversed with a gluten-free diet (GFD). Methods: A literature search for motility disorders in CD and NCGS patients was carried out using the online databases PubMed, Medline and Cochrane. Results: Esophageal, gastric, small bowel and gallbladder motor disorders are common in both children and adults with CD. Although the clinical consequences of these disorders are not clearly defined, gastric dysfunction could affect drug absorption and metabolism in the thyroid and neurological conditions associated with CD. The impact of a GFD on motility disorders is, however, controversial. No systematic studies are available on NCGS. NCGS frequently overlaps with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and similar pathophysiological mechanisms may be hypothesized. Conclusions: Mucosal damage may affect gut motility in untreated CD through perturbation of hormonal and neuro-immunomodulatory regulation. A persistent low-grade mucosal inflammation could explain the cases of persistent motor disorders despite a GFD. Further studies are needed to definitely assess the role of gut motor disorders in NCGS.
20817171	Celiac autoimmunity in children with type 1 diabetes: a two-year follow-up.	OBJECTIVE: To determine the benefits of screening for celiac autoimmunity via immunoglobulin A transglutaminase autoantibodies (TG) in children with type 1 diabetes (T1D). STUDY DESIGN: We followed up 79 screening-identified TG+ and 56 matched TG- children with T1D for 2 years to evaluate growth, bone mineral density, nutritional status, and diabetes control. TG+ subjects self-selected to gluten-free or gluten-containing diet. RESULTS: Of the initial cohort, 80% were available for reexamination after 2 years. TG+ subjects had consistently lower weight z-scores and higher urine N-telopeptides than TG- subjects, but similar measures of bone density and diabetes outcomes. TG+ children who remained on a gluten-containing diet had lower insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 z-scores compared with TG+ subjects who reported following a gluten-free diet. Children who continued with high TG index throughout the study had lower bone mineral density z-scores, ferritin, and vitamin D 25OH levels, compared with the TG- group. CONCLUSIONS: No significant adverse outcomes were identified in children with T1D with screening-identified TG+ who delay therapy with a gluten-free diet for 2 years. Children with persistently high levels of TG may be at greater risk. The optimal timing of screening and treatment for celiac disease in children with T1D requires further investigation.
39064670	Adherence to the Gluten-Free Diet Role as a Mediating and Moderating of the Relationship between Food Insecurity and Health-Related Quality of Life in Adults with Celiac Disease: Cross-Sectional Study.	This cross-sectional study aimed to estimate the relationship between food insecurity (FI) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with celiac disease (CD) and assess whether this relationship is mediated or moderated by adherence to the gluten-free diet (GFD). The results of 1162 samples of patients diagnosed with CD showed that 8.3% of individuals who have a combined score of less than 13 exhibited excellent or very good adherence to the GFD. Furthermore, moderate and fair to poor adherence to the GFD was demonstrated, respectively and 71.9% of the patients had poor HRQoL levels. A significant and moderate positive correlation between FI and GFD adherence (r = 0.489) was found, indicating that 24% of the variance in FI is shared with GFD adherence. The patients' gender, marital status, and monthly income made statistically significant contributions to the prediction (p < 0.05). Females had significantly lower HRQoL scores than males (B = -4.619, 95% CL: -6.08, -3.16) after holding all other variables constant. In conclusion, FI is mediated by GFD adherence to HRQoL. Moreover, a significant total effect relation was found between HRQoL and both FI and GFD adherence, suggesting that lowering symptoms and complications associated with CD may reduce the impact of FI on HRQoL.
23576621	Transglutaminase 6 antibodies in the diagnosis of gluten ataxia.	OBJECTIVES: The previous finding of an immunologic response primarily directed against transglutaminase (TG)6 in patients with gluten ataxia (GA) led us to investigate the role of TG6 antibodies in diagnosing GA. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study. We recruited patients from the ataxia, gluten/neurology, celiac disease (CD), and movement disorder clinics based at Royal Hallamshire Hospital (Sheffield, UK) and the CD clinic, Tampere University Hospital (Tampere, Finland). The groups included patients with idiopathic sporadic ataxia, GA, and CD, and neurology and healthy controls. All were tested for TG6 antibodies. Duodenal biopsies were performed in patients with positive serology. In addition, biopsies from 15 consecutive patients with idiopathic sporadic ataxia and negative serology for gluten-related disorders were analyzed for immunoglobulin A deposits against TG. RESULTS: The prevalence of TG6 antibodies was 21 of 65 (32%) in idiopathic sporadic ataxia, 35 of 48 (73%) in GA, 16 of 50 (32%) in CD, 4 of 82 (5%) in neurology controls, and 2 of 57 (4%) in healthy controls. Forty-two percent of patients with GA had enteropathy as did 51% of patients with ataxia and TG6 antibodies. Five of 15 consecutive patients with idiopathic sporadic ataxia had immunoglobulin A deposits against TG2, 4 of which subsequently tested positive for TG6 antibodies. After 1 year of gluten-free diet, TG6 antibody titers were significantly reduced or undetectable. CONCLUSIONS: Antibodies against TG6 are gluten-dependent and appear to be a sensitive and specific marker of GA.
30711207	Nondietary Therapies for Celiac Disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune enteropathy triggered by gluten. Gluten-free diets can be challenging because of their restrictive nature, inadvertent cross-contaminations, and the high cost of gluten-free food. Novel nondietary therapies are at the preclinical stage, clinical trial phase, or have already been developed for other indications and are now being applied to CD. These therapies include enzymatic gluten degradation, binding and sequestration of gluten, restoration of epithelial tight junction barrier function, inhibition of tissue transglutaminase-mediated potentiation of gliadin oligopeptide immunogenicity or of human leukocyte antigen-mediated gliadin presentation, induction of tolerance to gluten, and antiinflammatory interventions.
24467498	Celiac disease and alcohol use disorders: increased length of hospital stay, overexpenditures and attributable mortality.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: alcohol use disorders are associated with a greater incidence of certain comorbidities in patients with celiac disease. Currently there is no available information about the impact that these disorders may have on length of hospital stays, overexpenditures during hospital stays, and excess mortality in these patients. METHODS: a case-control study was conducted with a selection of patients 18 years and older hospitalized during 2008-2010 in 87 hospitals in Spain. Estimations of excess length of stays, costs, and attributable mortality were calculated using a multivariate analysis of covariance, which included age, gender, hospital group, alcohol use disorders, tobacco related disease and 30 other comorbidities. RESULTS: patients who had both celiac disease and alcohol use disorders had an increased length of hospital stay, an average of 3.1 days longer in women, and 1.7 days longer in men. Excess costs per stay ranged from 838.7 euros in female patients, to 389.1 euros in male patients. Excess attributable mortality was 15.1 % in women, 12.2 % in men. CONCLUSIONS: apart from a gluten-free diet and other medical measures, the prevention of alcohol abuse is indicated in these patients. Patients hospitalized who present these disorders should receive specialized attention after leaving the hospital. Early detection and treatment should be used to prevent the appearance of organic lesions and should not be solely focused on male patients.
24417260	Nutritional consequences of celiac disease and the gluten-free diet.	Celiac disease is a chronic small intestinal immune-mediated enteropathy precipitated by exposure to dietary gluten in genetically predisposed individuals and represents a major health issue. The immune mediated response results in villous atrophy of the small intestine with subsequent malabsorption. The classic mode of presentation is that of a malabsorption syndrome resulting in deficiencies of macro and micronutrients. The gluten-free diet is the only treatment currently available for this disorder. The aim of this special report is to elucidate and explain the various nutritional deficiencies seen in newly diagnosed patients with celiac disease and while on the gluten-free diet. Though initiation of the gluten-free diet results in improvement of symptoms and most deficiencies, certain nutritional limitations are associated with the gluten-free diet. 
26345589	The relation between celiac disease, nonceliac gluten sensitivity and irritable bowel syndrome.	Wheat products make a substantial contribution to the dietary intake of many people worldwide. Despite the many beneficial aspects of consuming wheat products, it is also responsible for several diseases such as celiac disease (CD), wheat allergy, and nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). CD and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients have similar gastrointestinal symptoms, which can result in CD patients being misdiagnosed as having IBS. Therefore, CD should be excluded in IBS patients. A considerable proportion of CD patients suffer from IBS symptoms despite adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). The inflammation caused by gluten intake may not completely subside in some CD patients. It is not clear that gluten triggers the symptoms in NCGS, but there is compelling evidence that carbohydrates (fructans and galactans) in wheat does. It is likely that NCGS patients are a group of self-diagnosed IBS patients who self-treat by adhering to a GFD. 
27753627	Minimally symptomatic hypocalcaemia unmasking celiac disease.	INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease of the small intestine which occurs in genetically predisposed people of all ages. A large clinical spectrum of manifestations accompanies the onset of the disease with diarrhoea, flatulence and weight loss being the most common. However, findings like osteoporosis, iron deficiency, anaemia and hypocalcaemia could also insinuate the existence of the disease. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 55-year-old man with numbness and tingling of the upper extremities due to hypocalcaemia that proved to be an uncommon case of celiac disease. CONCLUSION: A non-negligible number of adult patients with celiac disease can present with only minor and subclinical manifestations of the disease. As such, hypocalcaemia may be the sole manifestation of celiac disease. A high index of suspicion is needed for prompt diagnosis.
27016400	Concise Review: Cellular Therapies: The Potential to Regenerate and Restore Tolerance in Immune-Mediated Intestinal Diseases.	Chronic inflammatory enteropathies, including celiac disease, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis, are lifelong disabling conditions whose cure is still an unmet need, despite the great strides made in understanding their complex pathogenesis. The advent of cellular therapies, mainly based on the use of stem cells, represents a great step forward thanks to their multitarget strategy. Both hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC) have been employed in the treatment of refractory cases with promising results. The lack of immunogenicity makes MSC more suitable for therapeutic purposes as their infusion may be performed across histocompatibility locus antigen barriers without risk of rejection. The best outcome has been obtained when treating fistulizing Crohn's disease with local injections of MSC. In addition, both HSC and MSC proved successful in promoting regeneration of intestinal mucosa, and favoring the expansion of a T-cell regulatory subset. By virtue of the ability to favor mucosal homeostasis, this last cell population has been exploited in clinical trials, with inconsistent results. Finally, the recent identification of the epithelial stem cell marker has opened up the possibility of tissue engineering, with an array of potential applications for intestinal diseases. However, the underlying mechanisms of action of these interconnected therapeutic strategies are still poorly understood. It is conceivable that over the next few years their role will become clearer as the biological interactions with injured tissues and the hierarchy by which they deliver their action are unraveled through a continuous moving from bench to bedside and vice versa.

23077880	[Variability of nutritional status and of the parameters of lipid metabolism in gluten-free diet].	UNLABELLED: Celiac disease is one of the most common forms of food intolerance in children, being an autoimmune enteropathy occurring in genetically susceptible individuals. The only treatment of celiac disease consists in a lifelong strict gluten-free diet. After gluten free diet patients with normal weight or growth failure risk become obese on the one hand because of recovery intestinal absorption and, on the other hand, nutritionally unbalanced diet, high in fat and protein. AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the nutritional status and the presence and prevalence of various changes dyslipidemia in gluten free diet. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The trial was formed by 92 patients (mean age at diagnosis 88,5 months) diagnosed with CD between January 2008 - December 2010 in 2nd and 3rd Pediatric Clinics of "Sf. Maria" Hospital Iasi. Patients were divided into two groups: group I included 36 patients younger than 2 years and group II included 52 patients aged over 2 years at time of diagnosis of celiac disease. All patients received gluten free diet. Were evaluated periodically anthropometric indices (weight, height, body mass index and Z scores in children over 2 years and weight and nutritional index in children under 2 years) and lipid profile (total lipids, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides). Assessing food intake was achieved by interviewing parents and children on dietary habits and daily food ration. RESULTS: Assessment of nutritional status: group I:--after 24 months of gluten free diet 5 cases presented overweight; group II: after 24 months of gluten free diet obesity (BMI > 30) was found in 16.07% of cases (9 patients) and overweight (BMI > 25) was found in 28.57% of cases (16 patients). Food intake: in all cases was observed increased calorie intake by an excess of lipids and carbohydrates in the diet. Investigation of lipid metabolism: in group II high values of cholesterol were found in 12 cases (21,42 of cases). In conclusions, in celiac disease gluten free diet should be balanced caloric, fat and protein to ensure an optimal nutritional status and prevent long-term complications.
29986423	Psychiatric Comorbidity in Children and Adults with Gluten-Related Disorders: A Narrative Review.	Gluten-related disorders are characterized by both intestinal and extraintestinal manifestations. Previous studies have suggested an association between gluten-related disorder and psychiatric comorbidities. The objective of our current review is to provide a comprehensive review of this association in children and adults. A systematic literature search using MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO from inception to 2018 using terms of &lsquo;celiac disease&rsquo; or &lsquo;gluten-sensitivity-related disorders&rsquo; combined with terms of &lsquo;mental disorders&rsquo; was conducted. A total of 47 articles were included in our review, of which 28 studies were conducted in adults, 11 studies in children and eight studies included both children and adults. The majority of studies were conducted in celiac disease, two studies in non-celiac gluten sensitivity and none in wheat allergy. Enough evidence is currently available supporting the association of celiac disease with depression and, to a lesser extent, with eating disorders. Further investigation is warranted to evaluate the association suggested with other psychiatric disorders. In conclusion, routine surveillance of potential psychiatric manifestations in children and adults with gluten-related disorders should be carried out by the attending physician.
23845233	Risk of colorectal neoplasia in patients with celiac disease: a multicenter study.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The association of celiac disease with colorectal neoplasia is controversial. The aim of this study was to determine the risk of colorectal neoplasia among patients with celiac disease. METHODS: We carried out a multicenter, retrospective case-control study, within four community hospitals. Celiac disease patients with a complete colonoscopy were regarded as cases and those without celiac disease as controls. For each case, two controls matched for age, sex, indication for colonoscopy and colorectal cancer family history, were randomly selected. The main outcome evaluated was risk of colorectal polyps, adenomas, advanced neoplastic lesions and cancer. RESULTS: We identified 118 patients with celiac disease and 236 controls. The risk of polyps, adenomas and advanced neoplastic lesions was similar in both groups (OR 1.25, CI 0.71-2.18, p=0.40; OR 1.39, CI 0.73-2.63, p=0.31; and OR 1.00, CI 0.26-3.72, p=1.00, respectively). On multivariate analysis, age >75 years old, and first-grade CRC family history were associated with adenomas (OR 2.68 CI 1.03-6.98, OR 6.68 CI 1.03-47.98 respectively) and advanced neoplastic lesions (OR 15.03, CI 2.88-78.3; OR 6.46 CI 1.23-33.79, respectively). With respect to celiac disease characteristic, a low adherence to a gluten free diet was independently associated with the presence of adenomas (OR 6.78 CI 1.39-33.20 p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Celiac disease was not associated with an increased risk of colorectal neoplasia. Nonadherence to a strict gluten free diet was associated with the presence of adenomas. Further studies addressing celiac disease characteristics are needed to confirm this observation.
29063352	Multivariable Analysis of Gluten-Free Pasta Elaborated with Non-Conventional Flours Based on the Phenolic Profile, Antioxidant Capacity and Color.	The phenolic compounds, color and antioxidant capacity of gluten-free pasta prepared with non-conventional flours such as chickpea (CHF), unripe plantain (UPF), white maize (WMF) and blue maize (BMF) were analyzed. Fifteen phenolic compounds (five anthocyanins, five hydroxybenzoic acids, three hydroxycinnamic acids, one hydroxyphenylacetic acid and one flavonol) were identified in pasta prepared with blue maize, and 10 compounds were identified for samples prepared with white maize. The principal component analysis (PCA) led to results describing 98% of the total variance establishing a clear separation for each pasta. Both the proportion (25, 50 and 75%) and type of maize flour (white and blue) affected the color parameters (L*, C ab *, h ab and DeltaE* ab ) and antioxidant properties (DPPH, ABTS and FRAP methods) of samples, thus producing gluten-free products with potential health benefits intended for general consumers (including the population with celiac disease).

32239752	Thiol-disulfide homeostasis in children with celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: Toxic gliadin peptide damages enterocytes in celiac disease by causing oxidative stress. Thiols are organic compounds that defend against oxidative stress. This study aimed to investigate the changes in thiol-disulfide homeostasis in children with celiac disease. METHODS: The study included patients with celiac disease, children diagnosed with functional gastrointestinal disorders, and healthy children. Patients' serum native and total thiol-disulfide amounts, disulfide/total thiol percentage ratios, disulfide / native thiol percentage ratios, and native thiol/total thiol percentage ratios were measured. RESULTS: The study involved 172 children, of whom 90 (52.3%) were girls. The mean participant age was 8.6 +- 4.2 years. A total of 59 (34.3%) children had celiac disease, 56 (32.6%) had functional gastrointestinal disorders, and 57 (33.1%) were healthy. The total thiol and disulfide levels of patients with celiac disease (305 +- 87 mumol/L and 25 +- 15 mumol/L, respectively) were significantly lower than those of healthy children (349 +- 82 mumol/L and 40 +- 15 mumol/L, respectively) (P = 0.006 and P < 0.001, respectively). Native and total thiol levels (226 +- 85 mumol/L and 279 +- 99 mumol/L, respectively) in patients with celiac disease who consumed a gluten-containing diet were significantly lower than those of patients who consumed a gluten-free diet (278 +- 64 mumol/L and 327 +- 69 mumol/L, respectively) (P = 0.017 and P = 0.041, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Thiol-disulfide homeostasis, an important antioxidant defense component of the gastrointestinal system, is disrupted in children with celiac disease. A gluten-free diet helped partially ameliorate this decline.
23632357	Human leukocyte antigen genetics and clinical features of self-treated patients on a gluten-free diet.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Increasingly, people start a gluten-free diet (GFD) without a clear celiac disease (CD) diagnosis. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotyping is useful in ruling out CD in patients with equivocal results of serologic testing or small-bowel biopsy (SBB), but its utility and the clinical features of patients on self-treated GFD (ST-GFD) are largely unknown. METHODS: Retrospective study of single tertiary care center cohort compared 137 patients on ST-GFD and 443 patients with well-defined CD. We compared HLA genotype, symptoms, serologic and SBB results, and response to GFD between the 2 groups. Analysis used univariate logistic regression modeling, adjusted for age and sex. RESULTS: Patients with ST-GFD presented more often with diarrhea (P<0.001), abdominal distention (P<0.001), flatulence (P=0.002), cramping (P=0.02), itchy skin (P=0.02), oral inflammation (P=0.04), and constipation (P=0.01) and less often with anemia (P<0.001) or malaise (P=0.02) than CD patients. In addition, 41% did not carry DQ2.5 and DQ8 versus 6% of CD patients (P<0.001). Only 2% of ST-GFD patients had SBB clearly consistent with CD. Family history of CD showed no difference between groups (P=0.77). Although CD patients had a statistically higher rate of GFD benefit, both groups had a high responsiveness rate (98% vs. 94%; P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: HLA genotyping is useful in evaluating patients on an ST-GFD. Although confirmed CD is rare in self-treated patients, most still report benefit from GFD regardless of DQ2 and DQ8 status. Nonceliac gluten sensitivity may play a role.

31254168	Celiac disease: What the Indian pediatricians know about the disease.	To ascertain the knowledge, awareness, and practices pertaining to celiac disease (CD) among the Indian pediatricians. A survey link containing a questionnaire was shared through electronic mail using a pediatric database. The survey was kept active for 6 months; all responses received at the end of the survey were analyzed. Two hundred and seventy one pediatricians out of more than 10,000 chose to respond to the survey. Most pediatricians agreed that more patients with CD are being diagnosed than earlier. The reasons for higher detection of CD were perceived to be higher index of clinical suspicion by pediatricians (86.7%) followed by increased awareness among parents (45.8%). Most pediatricians opined that clinical manifestations which prompted to a diagnosis of CD were failure to thrive (96.2%) and chronic diarrhea (81.4%). Knowledge about atypical manifestations of celiac disease was low.  Though knowledge about the common association of CD with type 1 diabetes (62.1%) and autoimmune hepatitis (55.8%) was there, awareness about its association with other uncommon conditions was lacking. Though 68% of the pediatricians were of the opinion that the confirmation of diagnosis by a mucosal biopsy is necessary, 26.5% of respondents believed that only a positive serology was sufficient for a diagnosis. A trial of gluten-free diet (GFD) was thought to be a logical step if serology was positive by 31.3% of respondents. While 87.7% of pediatricians advocated lifelong adherence to GFD, 12.3% felt that GFD could be discontinued in the future. This web-based survey revealed that though pediatricians are seeing increasing number of celiac disease patients, there is a need to increase awareness regarding the disease, its associated conditions, the need for mucosal biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and the necessity of lifelong adherence to GFD.
26486281	QUALITY OF LIFE EVALUATION IN CELIAC PATIENTS FROM SOUTHERN BRAZIL.	BACKGROUND: Restrictions imposed by the gluten-free diet generate large changes in the daily habits of the celiac patient, causing a negative impact on quality of life. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the quality of life of patients with celiac disease on a capital in Southern Brazil. METHODS: Patients older than 18 years were included, with confirmed celiac disease for at least 60 days in the period from June to October 2013. A validated questionnaire, with specific questions to assess the patient's quality of life celiac was applied. A total score ranged from 20 to 100 points; the higher the score, worse quality of life. RESULTS: A total of 103 questionnaires were evaluated, 96 (93.2%) female, with average score 56.6+-12.35 (28 to 88 points). The comparison between the questionnaire scores and family income was not significant (P=0.139). Patients diagnosed less than 1 year have poorer quality of life than those with more than 10 years (P=0.063). Patients older than 60 years had better quality of life compared with the younger ones (P=0.04). CONCLUSION: There was no association between quality of life and factors such as family income, length of diet and age at diagnosis. Chronological age greater than 60 years has positively influenced the quality of life of celiac patients.
23399324	2D ultrasonography and contrast enhanced ultrasound for the evaluation of cavitating mesenteric lymph node syndrome in a patient with refractory celiac disease and enteropathy T cell lymphoma.	BACKGROUND: The cavitating mesenteric lymph node syndrome (CMLNS) is a rare manifestation of celiac disease, with an estimated mortality rate of 50%. Specific infections and malignant lymphoma may complicate its clinical course and contribute to its poor prognosis. Diagnosing the underlying cause of CMLNS can be challenging. This is the first report on contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) findings in enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL) complicating CMLNS in a gluten-free compliant patient with persistent symptoms and poor outcome. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 51-year old Caucasian male patient, diagnosed with celiac disease and CMLNS. Despite his compliance to the gluten-free diet the symptoms persisted and we eventually considered the possible development of malignancy. No mucosal changes suggestive of lymphoma were identified with capsule endoscopy. Low attenuation mesenteric lymphadenopathy, without enlarged small bowel segments were seen on computed tomography. CEUS revealed arterial rim enhancement around the necrotic mesenteric lymph nodes, without venous wash-out. No malignant cells were identified on laparoscopic mesenteric lymph nodes biopsies. The patient died due to fulminant liver failure 14 months later; the histopathological examination revealed CD3/CD30-positive atypical T-cell lymphocytes in the liver, mesenteric tissue, spleen, gastric wall, kidney, lung and bone marrow samples; no malignant cells were present in the small bowel samples. CONCLUSIONS: CEUS findings in EATL complicating CMLNS include arterial rim enhancement of the mesenteric tissue around the cavitating lymph nodes, without venous wash-out. This vascular pattern is not suggestive for neoangiogenesis, as arteriovenous shunts from malignant tissues are responsible for rapid venous wash-out of the contrast agent. CEUS failed to provide a diagnosis in this case.
22512436	Transient elastography in patients with celiac disease: a noninvasive method to detect liver involvement associated with celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: Liver involvement in celiac disease (CD) is clinically relevant and could require specific treatment in addition to gluten-free diet (GFD). Transient elastography (TE), a noninvasive tool for assessing liver stiffness (LS), has widely been reported as an accurate surrogate marker of liver fibrosis. AIMS: To prospectively identify celiac patients with liver involvement by TE and to assess the effect of GFD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ninety-five histologically confirmed CD patients (24 newly diagnosed) were consecutively evaluated by TE and compared with 146 patients with chronic hepatitis C (HCV) and 54 healthy subjects. RESULTS: LS ranged between 2.8 and 6.7 kPa (median 4.9) in healthy subjects, defining 6.9 kPa as the upper reference limit (2 SD above the mean levels). TE was above 6.9 kPa in 10 (10.5%) CD patients. Median TE values resulted significantly higher in CD patients with hypertransaminasemia than those without [6.1 vs. 4.2 kPa (p < 0.01)]. Among the 24 newly diagnosed patients with CD, median TE values declined from 4.4 to 4 kPa, after 6 months of GFD, resulting below 6.9 kPa in 100% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: A subset of CD patients with hypertransaminasemia showed liver involvement by TE. Accordingly, based on its accuracy in predicting liver fibrosis, TE could be used to identify those CD patients suitable for liver biopsy.
32090062	Female Patients with Dermatitis Herpetiformis Show a Reduced Diagnostic Delay and Have Higher Sensitivity Rates at Autoantibody Testing for Celiac Disease.	OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to characterize the demographic information, clinical features, and laboratory data of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). METHODS: In this multicentre cross-sectional study, consecutive patients with a new diagnosis of DH that referred to nine different Italian centers between 2011 and 2016 were characterized assessing demographic, clinical and laboratory findings, and evaluating gender and age differences across selected variables. RESULTS: A total of 151 patients were included. Among them, 81 (53.6%) were males and 70 (46.4%) were females, with a male to female ratio of 1.2 : 1. The median age at the time of diagnosis was 41 years (range 0-85). Males had a significant longer diagnostic delay if compared to females (9 vs. 3 months, respectively; p = 0.01). Direct immunofluorescence was positive in 94.7% of the patients, while duodenal biopsy showed partial to total villous atrophy in 70.1% of patients. All the females resulted positive to at least one of the antibodies tested, while a total of 12 male patients (10.5%) tested negative to celiac-specific antibodies. Female patients had a high rate (14.1%) of autoimmune thyroiditis. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed some of the most relevant data regarding DH that have been previously reported in the literature. In addition, we found a reduced diagnostic delay in females with respect to males, possibly related to the higher sensitivity of serologic testing in females with DH compared to males. Finally, we demonstrated that intestinal involvement could be severe in patients with DH and that females should be tested for thyroiditis.

23184965	Structural genes of wheat and barley 5-methylcytosine DNA glycosylases and their potential applications for human health.	Wheat supplies about 20% of the total food calories consumed worldwide and is a national staple in many countries. Besides being a key source of plant proteins, it is also a major cause of many diet-induced health issues, especially celiac disease. The only effective treatment for this disease is a total gluten-free diet. The present report describes an effort to develop a natural dietary therapy for this disorder by transcriptional suppression of wheat DEMETER (DME) homeologs using RNA interference. DME encodes a 5-methylcytosine DNA glycosylase responsible for transcriptional derepression of gliadins and low-molecular-weight glutenins (LMWgs) by active demethylation of their promoters in the wheat endosperm. Previous research has demonstrated these proteins to be the major source of immunogenic epitopes. In this research, barley and wheat DME genes were cloned and localized on the syntenous chromosomes. Nucleotide diversity among DME homeologs was studied and used for their virtual transcript profiling. Functional conservation of DME enzyme was confirmed by comparing the motif and domain structure within and across the plant kingdom. Presence and absence of CpG islands in prolamin gene sequences was studied as a hallmark of hypo- and hypermethylation, respectively. Finally the epigenetic influence of DME silencing on accumulation of LMWgs and gliadins was studied using 20 transformants expressing hairpin RNA in their endosperm. These transformants showed up to 85.6% suppression in DME transcript abundance and up to 76.4% reduction in the amount of immunogenic prolamins, demonstrating the possibility of developing wheat varieties compatible for the celiac patients.
23083992	Refractory celiac disease.	A small subset of patients with celiac disease become refractory to a gluten-free diet, with persistent or recurrent symptoms of malabsorption and intestinal villous atrophy. This condition, defined as refractory celiac disease (RCD), is diagnosed after other small bowel diseases with villous atrophy are excluded. RCD is subdivided into 2 subgroups: type I RCD and type II RCD (RCDII). This latter condition is considered a low-grade intraepithelial lymphoma and has a poor prognosis. This article reviews the clinical and pathologic features of RCD and recent pathogenic findings in RCDII, offering a model to study how inflammation can drive T-cell lymphomagenesis.
36145072	Mucosal Healing in Celiac Disease: Villous Architecture and Immunohistochemical Features in Children on a Long-Term Gluten Free Diet.	Considerable heterogeneity exists across studies assessing intestinal mucosal recovery in celiac (CD) patients on a gluten-free diet (GFD). We aimed at investigating histological and immunohistochemical features in CD patients on a long-term GFD and to correlate them to the GFD duration. Morphometrical and immunohistochemical analysis were retrospectively performed on duodenal biopsies in three groups of children: 33 on a long-term (>2 years) GFD (GFD-group), four of which remained seropositive despite dietary adherence, 31 with villous atrophy (ACD-group) and 76 heathy, non-celiac (CTR-group). Moreover, in the GFD-group, we correlated immunohistochemical alterations to the GFD duration. The villous to crypt (V/C) ratio significantly improved after the GFD and completely normalized in all patients, becoming even higher than in the CTR-group (median value 3.2 vs. 3, p = 0.007). In parallel, the number of CD3+ and TCRgammadelta+ cells in the epithelium were significantly reduced in the GFD compared to ACD patients, even if they remained higher than in the CTR-group (p < 0.05). In contrast, CD25+ cells in the lamina propria significantly decreased after the GFD (p < 0.05) and become comparable to the CTR-group (p = 0.9). In the GFD-group there was no difference in the immunohistochemical parameters between seropositive and seronegative patients and alterations did not correlate to GFD length. In conclusion, a GFD is able to both restore a normal V/C ratio and reduce inflammation, but the epithelium maintains some stigmata of the disorder, such as an increased number of CD3+ and TCRgammadelta+ cells. These alterations persist regardless of the duration of the GFD.
28806297	Adherence to a Gluten-free Diet: Assessment by Dietician Interview and Serology.	We aimed to determine whether tissue transglutaminase (tTG) autoantibody positivity was associated with dietitian-assessed adherence to a gluten-free diet in pediatric patients with celiac disease and identify areas where adherence falters. We reviewed the records of children with celiac disease who had a standardized evaluation of adherence by a registered dietitian. A negative tTG value was not associated with good adherence (P = NS). Adherent and nonadherent children differed with respect to purposeful and accidental gluten exposure (P < 0.0001), knowledge (P = 0.003), cross-contact (P = 0.003), potential exposure via medications and cosmetics (P = 0.004), and potential exposure while at restaurants (P < 0.0001), but not with respect to potential exposure at school (P = NS). Based on our findings, we suggest that negative tTG levels are not necessarily indicative of good adherence to a gluten-free diet in pediatric patients with celiac disease. A separate assessment of adherence is needed focusing on knowledge, behavior while dining out, and intent to adhere.
31540157	Translation, Cultural Adaptation, and Evaluation of a Brazilian Portuguese Questionnaire to Estimate the Self-Reported Prevalence of Gluten-Related Disorders and Adherence to Gluten-Free Diet.	BACKGROUND: A Spanish version of a questionnaire intended to estimate, at the population level, the prevalence rates of self-reported gluten-related disorders and adherence to gluten-free diets has been applied in four Latin American countries. However, idiom issues have hampered the questionnaire application in the Brazilian population. Thus, the aim of the present study was to carry out a translation, cultural adaptation, and evaluation of a Brazilian Portuguese questionnaire to estimate the self-reported prevalence of gluten-related disorders and adherence to gluten-free diets in a Brazilian population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two bilingual Portuguese-Spanish health professionals carried out the translation of the original Spanish version of the questionnaire to Brazilian-Portuguese. Matching between the two translations was evaluated using the WCopyFind.4.1.5 software. Words in conflict were conciliated, and the conciliated version of the Brazilian Portuguese instrument was evaluated to determine its clarity, comprehension, and consistency. A pilot study was carried out using an online platform. RESULTS: The two questionnaires translated into Brazilian Portuguese were highly matched (81.8%-84.1%). The questions of the conciliated questionnaire were clear and comprehensible with a high agreement among the evaluators (n = 64) (average Kendall's W score was 0.875). The participants did not suggest re-wording of questions. The answers to the questions were consistent after two applications of the questionnaire (Cohen's k = 0.869). The pilot online survey yielded low response rates (9.0%) highlighting the need for face-to-face interviews. CONCLUSIONS: The translation and evaluation of a Brazilian Portuguese questionnaire to estimate the self-reported prevalence rates of gluten-related disorders and adherence to gluten-free diets was carried out. The instrument is clear, comprehensible, and generates reproducible results in the target population. Further survey studies involving face-to-face interviews are warranted.
30311150	Ultra-short Celiac Disease Is a Distinct and Milder Phenotype of the Disease in Children.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Approximately 10% of children with celiac disease (CD) have ultra-short celiac disease (USCD), where histological abnormalities are limited to the duodenal bulb. The aim of our retrospective study was to identify clinical and serological characteristics at baseline and at follow-up of children with USCD. METHODS: All children that were diagnosed with CD in our unit during 7/2010-12/2017, in whom biopsies were taken from duodenal bulb and second part, were included. We compared disease characteristics and course between children with USCD and children with involvement in the second part of the duodenum. RESULTS: Out of 3740 children who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopies, 648 were diagnosed with CD. Seventy-one (11%) of those children had limited involvement in the duodenal bulb. The USCD group included more females (P = 0.021), were older (P = 0.005), had a lower prevalence of diarrhea (P = 0.003), anemia (P = 0.007), anti-tissue transglutaminase (TTG) antibodies count (P < 0.001) at presentation, lower frequency of endoscopic abnormality, lower Marsh score, and a trend toward shorter time to the normalization of anti-TTG antibodies under a gluten-free diet compared to the extensive CD. There were no differences in body mass index or duration of symptoms before diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Children with USCD presented with a distinct phenotype of milder symptoms, lower celiac serology, and milder endoscopic and histological findings, with a trend toward faster normalization under a gluten-free diet compared to those with extensive CD. Further studies are needed to determine the long-term course and prognosis of USCD.
22649919	Detoxification of gluten by means of enzymatic treatment.	Celiac disease (CD) is an inflammatory disease of the upper small intestine in genetically predisposed individuals caused by glutamine- and proline-rich peptides from cereal storage proteins (gluten) with a minimal length of nine amino acids. Such peptides are insufficiently degraded by gastrointestinal enzymes; they permeate the lymphatic tissue, are bound to celiac-specific, antigen-presenting cells, and stimulate intestinal T-cells. The typical clinical pattern is a flat small intestinal mucosa and malabsorption. Currently, the only therapy is a strict, lifelong gluten-free diet. Recent research has shown that gluten and gluten peptides can be degraded by prolyl endopeptidases from different sources. These peptidases can either be used to produce gluten-free foods from gluten-containing raw materials, or they have been suggested as an oral therapy for CD, in which dietary gluten is hydrolyzed by coingested peptidases already in the stomach, thus preventing CD-specific immune reactions in the small intestine. This would be an alternative for CD patients to the gluten-free diet. Furthermore, microbial transglutaminase could be used to detoxify gluten either by selectively modifying glutamine residues of intact gluten by transamidation with lysine methyl ester or by crosslinking gluten peptides in beverages via isopeptide bonds so that they can be removed by filtration.
30820708	Diagnosis and Treatment Patterns in Celiac Disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated gastrointestinal (GI) disorder driven by innate and adaptive immune responses to gluten. Presentation of CD has changed over time, with non-GI symptoms, such as anemia and osteoporosis, presenting more commonly. With improved screening and diagnostic methods, the reported prevalence of CD has increased globally, and there is considerable global variation in diagnostic and treatment practices. The objective of this study was to describe the current state of CD diagnosis and treatment patterns. A targeted review of literature from MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and screening of relevant conference abstracts was performed. The generally recommended diagnostic approach is GI endoscopy with small bowel biopsy; however, in selected patients, biopsy may be avoided and diagnosis based on positive serology and clinical symptoms. Diagnosis often is delayed; the average diagnostic delay after symptom onset is highly variable and can last up to 12 years. Barriers to accurate and timely diagnosis include atypical presentation, lack of physician awareness about current diagnostic criteria, misdiagnosis, and limited access to specialists. Currently, strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only recommended treatment, which is not successful in all patients. Only one-third of patients are monitored regularly following diagnosis. Unmet needs for CD include improvements in the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis, and the development of treatments for both refractory CD and GFD nonresponsive CD. Further research should investigate the impact of education about gluten-free eating and the availability of gluten-free foods support adherence and improve outcomes in patients with CD.
28238771	Lower Prevalence of Celiac Disease and Gluten-Related Disorders in Persons Living in Southern vs Northern Latitudes of the United States.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: The association between prevalence of celiac disease and geographic region is incompletely understood, but the occurrence of several autoimmune disorders has been found to vary along a North-South gradient. We examined geographic, demographic, and clinical factors associated with prevalence of celiac disease and gluten-free diet in the United States. METHODS: In a population-based study, we analyzed data on gluten-related conditions from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, from 2009 through 2014, on 22,277 participants 6 years and older. We identified persons with celiac disease based on results of serum tests for IgA against tissue transglutaminase and endomysium or on both a health care provider diagnosis and adherence to a gluten-free diet. Gluten avoidance without celiac disease was defined as adherence to a gluten-free diet without a diagnosis of celiac disease. We compared mean serum levels of biochemical and nutritional markers based on status of gluten-related conditions. RESULTS: We found 0.7% of participants to have celiac disease and 1.1% of participants to avoid gluten without celiac disease. Celiac disease was more common among individuals who lived at latitudes of 35 -39  North (odds ratio, 3.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-7.1) or at latitudes of 40  North or more (odds ratio, 5.4; 95% CI, 2.6-11.3) than individuals who lived at latitudes below 35  North, independent of race or ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and body mass index. Gluten avoidance without celiac disease was more common among individuals who lived at latitudes of 40  North or more, independent of demographic factors and body mass index. Participants with undiagnosed celiac disease (identified by positive results from serologic tests) had lower mean levels of vitamin B-12 and folate (data collected from 2009 through 2012) than persons without celiac disease. Participants with a health care provider diagnosis of celiac disease had a lower mean level of hemoglobin than persons without celiac disease. Mean levels of albumin, calcium, iron, ferritin, cholesterol, vitamin B-6, and vitamin D (data collected from 2009 through 2010) did not differ between participants with gluten-related conditions and those without. CONCLUSIONS: In the US population, a higher proportion of persons living at latitudes of 35  North or greater have celiac disease or avoid gluten than persons living south of this latitude, independent of race or ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or body mass index. Mean levels of vitamin B-12 and folate are lower in individuals with undiagnosed celiac disease, and levels of hemoglobin are lower in participants with a diagnosis of celiac disease, compared with individuals without celiac disease.
28688105	Intussusception in celiac disease: Is it a common feature in children?	BACKGROUND AND AIM: There are sporadic reports of occurrence of intussusception in celiac disease (CD) but no systematic study yet. We prospectively studied the prevalence and natural history of intussusception in newly diagnosed CD. METHODS: From January 2010 to October 2013, 150 children, diagnosed to have CD on the basis of positive serology and duodenal biopsy, were recruited in this study. Abdominal ultrasonography was carried out before starting gluten-free diet (GFD) and repeated in those who had intussusception, on day 3 and then weekly till the resolution of intussusception. RESULTS: The median age was 72 (range, 16-204) months, and 79 (53%) were boys. Diarrhea was the presenting symptom in 119 (79%) cases. A total of 45 intussusceptions were detected in 37 (25%) children. Out of 45 intussusceptions, 95% involved small bowel. All but one had asymptomatic intussusception. On GFD, intussusception resolved spontaneously within 7 days in 65%, within 14 days in 84%, and within 28 days in 92% of cases, and none required surgical or hydrostatic reduction. On univariate analysis, younger age, low weight z score, presentation with diarrhea, abdominal distension, rickets, lower serum albumin, more severe villous atrophy, and refeeding syndrome were more common in children with intussusception. On multivariate analysis, abdominal distension and hypoalbuminemia were found to be significantly associated with intussusception. CONCLUSIONS: Intussusception is frequently (25%) seen in children with newly diagnosed CD, generally asymptomatic and resolves spontaneously on GFD. It is often associated with more severe disease. Children with CD and intussusception should not be subjected to surgical/radiological intervention.
23883196	Current trends and investigative developments in celiac disease.	Celiac disease has become extensively studied. What could be the cause? Increasing the accuracy of diagnostic tests for celiac disease has led to more discovered cases. Serological diagnosis of celiac disease has undergone important changes in recent years. Application of serological tests has reflected the diagnostic performance of tissue transglutaminase antibody and endomysial antibody as screening tests for celiac disease but also the progress of new serological tests as the antibodies against synthetic deamidated gliadin peptides. Serological tests are largely responsible for the recognition that celiac disease is not a rare disease. The Consensus in celiac disease from 2008 conducted under the aegis of the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition jointly with North American Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition which agreed that "Celiac disease is an immune-mediated enteropathy that can affect any system or organ and that can present itself with a wide range of clinical manifestations of variable severity" was confirmed. But increasing prevalence of this disease has led to the need for new methods of treatment among patients with celiac disease. Studies on quality of life of patients with celiac disease have questioned the gluten-free diet. As such new therapies, like TG2 inhibitors, the copolymer P (HEMA-co-SS) and other new experimental therapies, have emerged in celiac disease. The new therapies in celiac disease are based on new investigations in gluten toxicity screening, like K562(S)-cell agglutination, A1 and G12 monoclonal antibodies and proteomics. In this paper we want to present the investigative developments in celiac disease. We also want to find whether a new treatment in celiac disease is necessary. 
29481779	Dietary Patterns After the Weaning and Lactation Period Are Associated With Celiac Disease Autoimmunity in Children.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: There have been many studies of associations between infant feeding practices and development of celiac disease during childhood, but few studies have focused on overall diets of young children after the weaning period. We aimed to examine the association between common dietary patterns in infants and the occurrence of celiac disease autoimmunity during childhood. METHODS: We performed a prospective analysis of data from the Generation R Study that comprised 1997 children born from April 2002 through January 2006 in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Food consumption around 1 year of age was assessed with a validated food-frequency questionnaire. Dietary data were examined using a priori (based on existing guidelines) and a posteriori (principal component analysis and reduced rank regression) dietary pattern analyses. Five dietary patterns were compared. Celiac disease autoimmunity, determined on the basis of serum concentration of transglutaminase-2 autoantibody (ie, TG2A) below or above 7 U/mL, was evaluated at 6 years. Associations between dietary pattern adherence scores and celiac disease autoimmunity were examined using multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: Higher adherence to the a posteriori-derived prudent dietary pattern (high intake of vegetables, vegetable oils, pasta, and grains and low consumption of refined cereals and sweet beverages) at 1 year was significantly associated with lower odds of celiac disease autoimmunity at 6 years (odds ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.53-0.84). No significant associations were found for the 4 remaining dietary patterns. CONCLUSIONS: In a prospective study of dietary patterns of young children in the Netherlands, we associated a dietary pattern characterized by high consumption of vegetables and grains and low consumption of refined cereals and sweet beverages, with lower odds of celiac disease autoimmunity. Early-life dietary patterns might therefore be involved in the development of celiac disease during childhood.
30029707	Novel approaches for enzymatic gluten degradation to create high-quality gluten-free products.	Celiac disease (CD), a chronic enteropathy of the small intestine caused by ingestion of gluten, is one of the most prevalent food hypersensitivities worldwide. The essential treatment is a strict lifelong gluten-free diet based on the avoidance of gluten-containing products from wheat, rye, barley and, in rare cases, oats. Products made from naturally gluten-free raw materials often have inferior nutritional, textural and sensory properties compared to the corresponding gluten-containing products. Therefore, the incorporation of wheat, rye and barley flours after efficient removal of the harmful component gluten into gluten-free products would be beneficial. Gluten modification resulting in decreased CD-immunoreactivity may be achieved via the formation of crosslinks using microbial transglutaminase. To effectively eliminate CD-immunoreactivity, plant, fungal, bacterial, animal or engineered peptidases are capable of degrading gluten proteins and peptides into harmless fragments. The application of peptidases from germinated cereal grains, fungal peptidases and/or lactic acid bacteria during food processing yielded high-quality sourdough wheat breads, pasta, wheat starch and bran, rye products and beer, all with gluten contents below the Codex Alimentarius threshold of 20mg/kg for gluten-free products. As with all gluten-free products, the legislative compliance of such treated materials needs to be monitored closely. Provided that all safety requirements are met, gluten-containing raw materials treated in an adequate way to remove CD-active gluten fragments may be used together with naturally gluten-free ingredients to create an extended choice of high-quality gluten-free products.
22214930	Recognition of epidermal transglutaminase by IgA and tissue transglutaminase 2 antibodies in a rare case of Rhesus dermatitis.	Tissue transglutaminase 2 (tTG2) is an intestinal digestive enzyme which deamidates already partially digested dietary gluten e.g. gliadin peptides. In genetically predisposed individuals, tTG2 triggers autoimmune responses that are characterized by the production of tTG2 antibodies and their direct deposition into small intestinal wall. The presence of such antibodies constitutes one of the major hallmarks of the celiac disease (CD). Epidermal transglutaminase (eTG) is another member of the transglutaminase family that can also function as an autoantigen in a small minority of CD patients. In these relatively rare cases, eTG triggers an autoimmune reaction (a skin rash) clinically known as dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). Although the exact mechanism of CD and DH pathogenesis is not well understood, it is known that tTG2 and eTG share antigenic epitopes that can be recognized by serum antibodies from both CD and DH patients. In this study, the confocal microscopy examination of biopsy samples from skin lesions of two rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) with dermatitis (Table 1, Fig. 1 and 2) was used to study the affected tissues. In one animal (EM96) a spectral overlap of IgA and tTG2 antibodies (Fig. 3) was demonstrated. The presence of double-positive tTG2+IgA+ cells was focused in the deep epidermis, around the dermal papillae. This is consistent with lesions described in DH patients. When EM96 was placed on a gluten-free diet, the dermatitis, as well as tTG2+IgA+ deposits disappeared and were no longer detectable (Figs. 1-3). Dermatitis reappeared however, based on re-introduction of dietary gluten in EM96 (not shown). In other macaques including animal with unrelated dermatitis, the tTG2+IgA+ deposits were not detected. Gluten-free diet-dependent remission of dermatitis in EM96 together with presence of tTG2+IgA+ cells in its skin suggest an autoimmune, DH-like mechanism for the development of this condition. This is the first report of DH-like dermatitis in any non-human primate.
25784659	High rate of spontaneous normalization of celiac serology in a cohort of 446 children with type 1 diabetes: a prospective study.	OBJECTIVE: In children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), elevated levels of antitissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) antibody may spontaneously normalize, despite continued consumption of gluten. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of spontaneous normalization of anti-tTG levels and the existence of factors predictive for this outcome. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: All children referred from 2002 to 2012 were screened for celiac disease (CD) at diabetes onset and at specific intervals. In the presence of a high anti-tTG titer or clinical symptoms, children were offered endoscopy, and asymptomatic patients with a low anti-tTG titer were invited to a second serological test after 6 months of eating a gluten-containing diet. RESULTS: The study included 446 children. Of these, 65 (14.5%) became positive for celiac serology: 38 (58%) had a persistently elevated anti-tTG titer and 27 (41%) fluctuating anti-tTG titer; 18 (28%) became negative. The prevalence of positive CD autoimmunity and overt CD was 14.3% (95% CI 11-17) and 8.5% (95% CI 5-10), 15- and 8-times higher than the general pediatric population, respectively. Asymptomatic children older than 9.1 years at T1DM onset had the lowest risk to develop CD. CONCLUSIONS: Serum anti-tTG levels decreased spontaneously in 40% of children with T1DM and became negative in 20%, despite gluten consumption. This finding supports the hypothesis of a state of temporary positivity of celiac serology in children with diabetes. In absence of clinical symptoms or signs of CD, histological confirmation of the disease and the gluten-free diet should be postponed to avoid unnecessary procedures and reduce an additional psychological burden.
33259438	Evaluation of Daily Lives of Children and Adolescents with Celiac Disease and Nursing Approaches.	The incidence of celiac disease has been increasing in recent years. Celiac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy that emerges mostly in the childhood period. This disorder is a chronic condition of the small intestine due to gluten intake in individuals with genetic predisposition. In the treatment of celiac disease, gluten-free diet therapy is applied. However, the adaptation process to the diet may create difficulties for patients. Compliance with diet is much more difficult among patients with celiac disease in childhood and adolescence than in adult patients. Children and adolescents face distinct difficulties in their homes, at school, and in their social lives. Besides following dietary treatment, children and adolescents living with celiac disease need peer support to manage their daily routines. In this article, we aimed to discuss the problems experienced by children and adolescents living with celiac disease and nursing approaches to these problems.
27746327	Exposure assessment to fumonisins B1, B2 and B3 through consumption of gluten-free foodstuffs intended for people affected by celiac disease.	Fumonisins are mycotoxins produced by Fusarium species and affecting maize crops. Some analogues of fumonisins are known for their toxic and possible carcinogenic effects on humans and animals. Because of their occurrence in corn-based food, diet is the main source of exposure to these mycotoxins, especially among people affected by celiac disease. Hence, the purpose of this paper was to evaluate the amount of fumonisins B1, B2 and B3 in maize-based products and to assess the exposure of people affected by celiac disease to fumonisins. The sample consisted of 154 gluten-free products analyzed according to method UNI EN 14352:2005. Results showed a heterogeneous contamination by fumoninisin B1, B2 and B3, although below limits of Commission Regulation No 1126/2007 and consistent with other European literature data. Exposure to fumonisins was evaluated for different age groups. In some cases exposure to fumonisins could not be ignored since the total intake could exceed EFSA Provisional Maximum Tolerable Intake up to 150%. Therefore, in the light of an overall contamination by fumonisins the total dietary exposure could be underrated not only in people affected by celiac disease, but also in non-celiac population.
30279384	A Review on the Gluten-Free Diet: Technological and Nutritional Challenges.	Consumers, food manufacturers and health professionals are uniquely influenced by the growing popularity of the gluten-free diet. Consumer expectations have urged the food industry to continuously adjust and improve the formulations and processing techniques used in gluten-free product manufacturing. Health experts have been interested in the nutritional adequacy of the diet, as well as its effectiveness in managing gluten-related disorders and other conditions. In this review, we aim to provide a clear picture of the current motivations behind the use of gluten-free diets, as well as the technological and nutritional challenges of the diet as a whole. Alternative starches and flours, hydrocolloids, and fiber sources were found to play a complex role in mimicking the functional and sensory effects of gluten in gluten-free products. However, the quality of gluten-free alternatives is often still inferior to the gluten-containing products. Furthermore, the gluten-free diet has demonstrated benefits in managing some gluten-related disorders, though nutritional imbalances have been reported. As there is limited evidence supporting the use of the gluten-free diet beyond its role in managing gluten-related disorders, consumers are urged to be mindful of the sensorial limitations and nutritional inadequacies of the diet despite ongoing strategies to improve them.
33836647	Is mass screening for coeliac disease a wise use of resources? A health economic evaluation.	BACKGROUND: Living with undiagnosed symptomatic coeliac disease is connected with deteriorated health, and persons with coeliac disease often wait a long time for their diagnosis. A mass screening would lower the delay, but its cost-effectiveness is still unclear. Our aim was to determine the cost-effectiveness of a coeliac disease mass screening at 12 years of age, taking a life course perspective on future benefits and drawbacks. METHODS: The cost-effectiveness was derived as cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) using a Markov model. As a basis for our assumptions, we mainly used information from the Exploring the Iceberg of Celiacs in Sweden (ETICS) study, a school-based screening conducted in 2005/2006 and 2009/2010, where 13,279 12-year-old children participated and 240 were diagnosed with coeliac disease, and a study involving members of the Swedish Coeliac Association with 1031 adult participants. RESULTS: The cost for coeliac disease screening was 40,105 Euro per gained QALY. Sensitivity analyses support screening based on high compliance to a gluten-free diet, rapid progression from symptom-free coeliac disease to coeliac disease with symptoms, long delay from celiac disease with symptoms to diagnosis, and a low QALY score for undiagnosed coeliac disease cases. CONCLUSIONS: A coeliac disease mass screening is cost-effective based on the commonly used threshold of 50,000 Euro per gained QALY. However, this is based on many assumptions, especially regarding the natural history of coeliac disease and the effects on long-term health for individuals with coeliac disease still eating gluten.
26184289	Analysis of Body Composition and Food Habits of Spanish Celiac Women.	The purpose of the present work was both to analyze composition of Spanish celiac women and to study the food habits and gluten-free diet of these celiac patients, in order to determine whether they achieve a balanced and healthy diet as well as to highlight nutritional qualitative and/or quantitative differences. 54 adult celiac women (34 +- 13 years) took part in the six-month study. Height, weight and body composition were measured. An analysis of energy consumption and of the macronutrient distribution of their diet was carried out. Their fulfillment of micronutrient intake recommendations was verified. Participants showed a Body Mass Index of 21.6 +- 2.4 kg/m2. Energy Intake was slightly lower than the Dietary Reference Intakes. Excessive protein apart from over-consumption of fat was observed. More than three quarters of participants consumed meat in excess. Carbohydrate consumption along with that of fiber was below recommended levels. Vitamin D, iron, and iodine had a low percentage of recommendation compliance. In general, participants followed the recommendations of dairy products and fruit intake whereas vegetable consumption was not enough for the vast majority. We conclude that although the diet of celiac women does not differ much from the diet of general population, some considerations, such as reducing fat and protein consumption and increasing fiber intake, must be taken into account. 
23542610	Chemiluminescence and ELISA-based serum assays for diagnosing and monitoring celiac disease in children: a comparative study.	BACKGROUND: Anti-transglutaminase (tTG) or anti-deamidated gliadin peptides (DGP) serum determination is the first step in diagnosing celiac disease (CD). Our aims were to: compare the performance of novel chemiluminescent tool in the detection of tTG and DGP (Q-Flash , Inova) with that of the established ELISA (Q-Lite , Inova) methods; identify the more reliable index for making a sound diagnosis and monitoring therapy. METHODS: Using Q-Flash  and Q-Lite , IgA and IgG class tTG and DGP were measured in the sera of 155 CD pediatric patients and 166 healthy age-matched controls. Forty-two of the patients had a follow-up one year after starting gluten free diet (GFD). RESULTS: Q-Flash  IgA tTG, the more accurate (intra-assay CV for low, intermediate and high values: 2.2%, 1.6%, and 1.1%; inter-assay CV: 2.8%, 4%, and 3%), sensitive (96.1%) and specific (97%) test for diagnosing CD, was the only variable to be significantly correlated with CD at binary logistic regression analysis (r=0.263, p<0.0001, Exp(B)=1.0506, 95% CI=1.0286-1.0731). Q-Flash  IgA tTG or DGP screen were more accurate than Q-Lite  IgA tTG in monitoring CD patients on GFD (p=0.003). CONCLUSION: Q- Flash  IgA tTG measurement is an extremely precise, sensitive and specific index for not only diagnosing CD, but also monitoring therapy.
25404189	The changing clinical profile of celiac disease: a 15-year experience (1998-2012) in an Italian referral center.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is a multiform, challenging condition characterized by extremely variable features. Our goal was to define clinical, serological and histopathological findings in a large cohort of celiacs diagnosed in a single referral center. METHODS: From January 1998 to December 2012, 770 patients (599 females, median age 36 years, range 18-78 years) were diagnosed as celiacs at St. Orsola-Malpighi Hospital (Bologna, Italy). The clinical phenotypes were classified as: 1) classical (malabsorption syndrome); 2) non-classical (extraintestinal and/or gastrointestinal symptoms other than diarrhea); 3) subclinical. Serology, duodenal histology, comorbidities, response to gluten-free diet and complications were evaluated. RESULTS: Disease onset was symptomatic in 610 patients (79%), while 160 celiacs showed a subclinical phenotype. In the symptomatic group the non-classical prevailed over the classical phenotype (66% vs 34%). Diarrhea was found in 27%, while other gastrointestinal manifestations were bloating (20%), aphthous stomatitis (18%), alternating bowel habit (15%), constipation (13%) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (12%). Extraintestinal manifestations included osteopenia/osteoporosis (52%), anemia (34%), cryptogenic hypertransaminasemia (29%) and recurrent miscarriages (12%). Positivity for IgA tissue transglutaminase antibodies was detected in 97%. Villous atrophy was found in 87%, while 13% had minor lesions consistent with potential celiac disease. A large proportion of patients showed autoimmune disorders, i.e. autoimmune thyroiditis (26.3%), dermatitis herpetiformis (4%) and diabetes mellitus type 1 (3%). Complicated celiac disease was very rare. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that the clinical profile of celiac disease changed over time with an increasing rate of non-classical and subclinical phenotypes.
23878218	Dietary gluten triggers concomitant activation of CD4+ and CD8+ alphabeta T cells and gammadelta T cells in celiac disease.	Celiac disease is an intestinal autoimmune disease driven by dietary gluten and gluten-specific CD4(+) T-cell responses. In celiac patients on a gluten-free diet, exposure to gluten induces the appearance of gluten-specific CD4(+) T cells with gut-homing potential in the peripheral blood. Here we show that gluten exposure also induces the appearance of activated, gut-homing CD8(+) alphabeta and gammadelta T cells in the peripheral blood. Single-cell T-cell receptor sequence analysis indicates that both of these cell populations have highly focused T-cell receptor repertoires, indicating that their induction is antigen-driven. These results reveal a previously unappreciated role of antigen in the induction of CD8(+) alphabeta and gammadelta T cells in celiac disease and demonstrate a coordinated response by all three of the major types of T cells. More broadly, these responses may parallel adaptive immune responses to viral pathogens and other systemic autoimmune diseases. 
37836454	Gluten-Free Product Recalls and Their Impact on Consumer Trust.	The range of gluten-free food products available to consumers is steadily expanding. In recent years, recalls of food products have highlighted the importance of accurate labeling of food products for the presence of wheat, other gluten-containing cereals, or gluten itself as refined ingredient. The purpose of this study was to gain more insights into recent food recalls related to undeclared gluten/wheat contamination and consumer experiences with these recalls. Recalls of products triggered by gluten contamination are relatively scarce and are not often triggered by a consumer complaint. The impact of these recalls on consumer trust was evaluated through an online survey that was distributed among supporters of Celiac Canada (CCA) and covered (i) strategies to adhere to a gluten-free diet, (ii) experiences with gluten-free recalls and their impact on consumer trust, and (iii) demographic information. Consumer concern regarding gluten-free product recalls is significant, but the concern regarding recalls is not heightened after experiencing a recall. Companies pursuing transparency in the process, identification of the source of contamination, and mitigation strategies going forward are likely to retain consumer trust in their product and brand. Based on the survey results, further efforts focusing on consumer education regarding interpreting nutrient labels, identifying sources of information on product recalls, and understanding procedures to follow upon suspected gluten contamination of a gluten-free product are recommended.
22282398	In vitro models for gluten toxicity: relevance for celiac disease pathogenesis and development of novel treatment options.	In genetically predisposed individuals, dietary gluten in wheat, rye and barley triggers celiac disease, a systemic autoimmune disorder hallmarked by an extensive small-bowel mucosal immune response. The current conception of celiac disease pathogenesis is that it involves components of both innate and adaptive immunity whose activation typically leads to small-bowel villous atrophy with crypt hyperplasia. Currently, the only effective treatment for celiac disease is a strict lifelong gluten-free diet excluding all wheat-, rye- and barley-containing food products. During the diet, the clinical symptoms improve and the small-bowel mucosal damage recovers, while re-introduction of gluten into the diet leads to re-appearance of the symptoms and deterioration of the small-bowel mucosal architecture. In view of the restricted nature of the diet, alternative treatment is warranted. Improved understanding of the molecular basis of celiac disease has enabled researchers to suggest other therapeutic approaches. Although there is no animal model reproducing all features of celiac disease, the use of in vitro approaches including a variety of cell lines and the celiac patient small-bowel mucosal biopsy organ culture has generated knowledge about pathogenesis of celiac disease. In these culture systems, gluten induces different effects that can be quantified, thus also enabling studies concerning the efficacy of candidate therapeutic compounds for celiac disease. This review describes the intestinal epithelial cell models, celiac patient T-cell lines and clones, as well as the small-bowel mucosal organ culture methods widely used in studies of celiac disease, and summarizes the major findings obtained with these systems.
27908207	Anti-sulfatide reactivity in patients with celiac disease.	OBJECTIVE: To explore a possible significance of the presence of anti-ganglioside and anti-sulfatide antibodies in sera of adult patients with celiac disease (CD) in different clinical scenario. METHODS: We selected 22 adult patients with newly diagnosed CD and 20 age-sex matched non-CD controls. Patients' serum was tested - before and after at least 6 months on a gluten-free diet (GFD) - for anti-GM1, GM2, GM3, GD1a, GD1b, GD3, GT1a, GT1b, GQ1b and sulfatide IgM, IgG and IgA auto-antibodies, by means of a dot blot technique and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: We found the presence of auto-antibodies in untreated patients. In particular, anti-sulfatide IgG antibodies were present in 8 (36%) patients independently of the presence of neurological symptoms. Anti-sulfatide IgA antibodies were present in 3 (19%) patients. During GFD, anti-sulfatide IgG disappeared in all the patients, whereas IgA were observed in 2 patients. Anti-sulfatide, anti-GM1 and anti-GM2 IgM antibodies were also observed in 2 patients on a GFD. All the other auto-antibodies were absent and no demographic or clinical parameters were associated. Non-CD controls did not present any auto-antibody. CONCLUSIONS: We found anti-sulfatide IgG antibodies in CD patients on a gluten-containing diet. Anti-sulfatide IgA antibodies persisted during GFD together with the occurrence of other IgM auto-antibodies. These data suggest a possible link between gluten and IgG auto-antibodies.
26394501	Recurrent Eosinophilic Pneumonia in a Patient with Isolated Immunoglobulin M Deficiency and Celiac Disease.	
23403438	Celiac disease-associated autoimmune hepatitis in childhood: long-term response to treatment.	OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease (CD) is common in patients with autoimmune liver disease (AILD); however, the long-term response to treatment of patients with AILDs coexistent with CD has not been explored in detail. The aim of the present study was to analyze the features and the long-term response to immunosuppressive treatment in children with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) associated with CD. METHODS: Retrospective and prospective evaluation of patients followed at a single center. RESULTS: Among 79 patients with AIH, 15 (19%) had CD (9 type 1, 3 type 2, 3 seronegative). In the group of patients with AIH and CD, female sex was significantly more represented than in the group of patients with AIH alone; also, in the former group, diagnosis was made significantly earlier (P < 0.05). All of the 15 patients on a gluten-free diet achieved sustained remission when treated with prednisone and azathioprine or cyclosporine. The mean period of follow-up was 73 months; discontinuation of therapy was attempted in 9 patients while in remission: 4 patients relapsed, 5 (33%) could definitively stop immunosuppressive treatment with a mean period of treatment-free sustained remission of 89 months (range 26-174). In the same period, treatment discontinuation, attempted in 24 of 64 patients with AIH without CD, was successful in 5 patients (8%; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AIH coexisting with CD achieve treatment-free sustained remission in a significantly higher proportion, when compared with patients with AIH without CD, suggesting a possible long-term adjuvant effect of a gluten-free diet.
27428994	Gastrointestinal Symptoms in Celiac Disease Patients on a Long-Term Gluten-Free Diet.	Experience suggests that many celiac patients suffer from persistent symptoms despite a long-term gluten-free diet (GFD). We investigated the prevalence and severity of these symptoms in patients with variable duration of GFD. Altogether, 856 patients were classified into untreated (n = 128), short-term GFD (1-2 years, n = 93) and long-term GFD (>=3 years, n = 635) groups. Analyses were made of clinical and histological data and dietary adherence. Symptoms were evaluated by the validated GSRS questionnaire. One-hundred-sixty healthy subjects comprised the control group. Further, the severity of symptoms was compared with that in peptic ulcer, reflux disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Altogether, 93% of the short-term and 94% of the long-term treated patients had a strict GFD and recovered mucosa. Untreated patients had more diarrhea, indigestion and abdominal pain than those on GFD and controls. There were no differences in symptoms between the short- and long-term GFD groups, but both yielded poorer GSRS total score than controls (p = 0.03 and p = 0.05, respectively). Furthermore, patients treated 1-2 years had more diarrhea (p = 0.03) and those treated >10 years more reflux (p = 0.04) than controls. Long-term treated celiac patients showed relatively mild symptoms compared with other gastrointestinal diseases. Based on our results, good response to GFD sustained in long-term follow-up, but not all patients reach the level of healthy individuals. 
29459801	The effect of gluten-free diet among celiac patients aged 3-12 years old on BMI during 2006 to 2014 at Nemazee Teaching hospital.	INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease (CD) is increasingly diagnosed and weight changes are common after adoption of a glutenfree diet (GFD) and there is concern that patients might gain further weight on a GFD. OBJECTIVES: This study examined to evaluate the impact of a GFD on the body mass index (BMI), whether favorable or unfavorable. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, we reviewed electronic records of 44 patients with serologic study and intestinal biopsy confirmed CD who was visited in Nemazee hospital, Shiraz. All patients were put on GFD for 2 years and followed closely by pediatric gastroenterologist. BMIs were categories to four group underweight, normal weight, overweight and obese. Initial BMI and follow-up BMI was comparing together and also compared with general population. RESULT: At diagnosis, 27.27% of subjects were underweight, 63.64% normal and 9.09% were obese. On a GFD, 66.66% of underweight patients gained weight and became normal weight and 25% of normal weight and 75% of obese patients had increase weight; and the rest of the patients, BMI remained stable. The follow-up BMIs were statistically higher than initial BMIs (mean 17.17 vs. 15.62, p <0.0001). CONCLUSION: Individuals with celiac disease have lower BMI than the regional population at diagnosis. On the GFD, BMI is increased significantly in all categories.
27087453	A Refractory Celiac Patient Successfully Treated With Mesenchymal Stem Cell Infusions.	Type II refractory celiac disease (RCD), as defined according to the amount of aberrant intraepithelial lymphocytes, is a condition characterized by severe malabsorption syndrome and poor prognosis, with no effective treatment. Based on the regenerative and immunomodulatory properties of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), we investigated the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of serial infusions of autologous bone marrow-derived MSCs in a 51-year-old woman with type II RCD. Mesenchymal stem cells were isolated, expanded, and characterized following standard protocols. Monitoring of the patient's malabsorption indexes, mucosal architecture, and percentage of aberrant intraepithelial lymphocytes was scheduled for the time of enrollment, at each infusion, and after 6 months. Determination of mucosal expression of interleukin (IL)-15 and its receptor was also performed. Expansion of MSCs was feasible, and the patient underwent 4 systemic infusions of 2 x 10(6) MSCs/kg body weight 4 months apart, without adverse effects. During the treatment period, she experienced gradual and durable amelioration of her general condition, with normalization of stool frequency, body mass index, laboratory test results, and mucosal architecture. Remarkably, the expression of IL-15 and its receptor almost completely disappeared. Thus, treatment of RCD with serial MSC infusions seems promising, leading to recovery from the life-threatening condition while blocking the IL-15 pathogenic pathway. 
38205704	Assessing mucosal recovery in celiac disease - Time to diagnosis and histological severity as determining factors.	Study background and objectives: There is great disparity in mucosal recovery among celiac patients on a gluten-free diet. We report a study to identify associated factors. METHODS: Celiac patient cases were collected that had positive celiac serology and villous atrophy at diagnosis, and had undergone a control biopsy after at least 12 months of follow-up. RESULTS: We included 70 celiac patients. They had experienced symptoms for 9.05 +- 9.48 years before being diagnosed. After follow-up for 2.93 +- 1.94 years, 34.3 % had complete mucosal recovery and 57.1 % had partial mucosal recovery. In the comparative analysis we found no relationship between mucosal recovery and sex, age, clinical manifestations or follow-up time from diagnosis to second biopsy. Time with clinical manifestations before diagnosis was associated with a worse outcome: 2.64 years in patients with full recovery, 4.61 years in patients with partial recovery, and 14.26 years in patients with persistent villous atrophy. Higher transglutaminase antibody titers both at diagnosis and during follow-up were associated with poorer histologic outcomes. We observed higher mucosal recovey rates in patients with mild atrophy versus severe atrophy at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of gluten-free diet a significant proportion of patients have persistent histologic changes. Time with clinical manifestations before diagnosis is key for histological severity and recovery.
24837306	Benefits of a gluten-free diet for asymptomatic patients with serologic markers of celiac disease.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: We investigated whether screen-detected and apparently asymptomatic adults with endomysial antibodies (EmA) benefit from a gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: We performed a prospective trial of 3031 individuals at risk for celiac disease based on screens for EmA. Of 148 seropositive individuals, 40 fulfilled inclusion criteria and were assigned randomly to groups placed on a GFD or gluten-containing diets. We evaluated ratios of small-bowel mucosal villous height:crypt depth, serology and laboratory test results, gastrointestinal symptom scores, physiologic well-being, perception of health by a visual analog scale, bone mineral density, and body composition at baseline and after 1 year. Thereafter, the group on the gluten-containing diet started a GFD and was evaluated a third time; subjects in the GFD group remained on this diet. RESULTS: After 1 year on the GFD, the mean mucosal villous height:crypt depth values increased (P < .001), levels of celiac-associated antibodies decreased (P < .003), and gastrointestinal symptoms improved to a greater extent than in patients on gluten-containing diets (P = .003). The GFD group also had reduced indigestion (P = .006), reflux (P = .05), and anxiety (P = .025), and better health, based on the visual analog scale (P = .017), than the gluten-containing diet group. Only social function scores improved more in the gluten-containing diet group than in the GFD group (P = .031). There were no differences between groups in laboratory test results, bone mineral density, or body composition. Most measured parameters improved when patients in the gluten-containing diet group were placed on GFDs. No subjects considered their experience to be negative and most expected to remain on GFDs. CONCLUSIONS: GFDs benefit asymptomatic EmA-positive patients. The results support active screening of patients at risk for celiac disease. Clinicaltrials.gov no: NCT01116505.
31673859	Psychological Needs and Services in a Pediatric Multidisciplinary Celiac Disease Clinic.	This study aims to describe the psychological needs in children with celiac disease (CD) and to examine the feasibility of psychological consultation in a multidisciplinary clinic. Participants (N = 69) included children with CD and their parents who completed a pre-clinic mental health survey and a 30-min psychological consultation as part of a multidisciplinary clinic (including gastroenterology, nutrition, education, neurology, and neuropsychology). Quantitative and qualitative analyses examined psychological needs, experiences, and satisfaction. The psychologist identified clinically significant symptoms and provided referrals in 49% of children. There were no significant differences by time since CD diagnosis. During the psychology consultation, families discussed emotional adjustment, impact on life and physical well-being, and management of the gluten-free diet. Parents reported high levels of satisfaction from the clinic visit. We identified frequent psychological needs in pediatric CD. The multidisciplinary approach may be a feasible model for specialized, optimal treatment in this population.
27185075	Serum I-FABP Detects Gluten Responsiveness in Adult Celiac Disease Patients on a Short-Term Gluten Challenge.	OBJECTIVES: Response to gluten challenge (GC) is a key feature in diagnostic algorithms and research trials in celiac disease (CD). Currently, autoantibody titers, late responders to GC, and invasive duodenal biopsies are used to evaluate gluten responsiveness. This study investigated the accuracy of serum intestinal-fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP), a marker for intestinal epithelial damage, to predict intestinal damage during GC in patients with CD. METHODS: Twenty adult CD patients in remission underwent a two-week GC with 3 or 7.5 g of gluten daily. Study visits occurred at day -14, 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28. Serum I-FABP, antibodies to tissue transglutaminase (tTG-IgA), deamidated gliadin peptides (IgA-DGP), and anti-actin (AAA-IgA) were assessed at each visit. Villous-height to crypt-depth ratio (Vh:Cd) and intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) count were evaluated at day -14, 3, and 14. Forty-three CD-serology negative individuals were included to compare serum I-FABP levels in CD patients on a gluten-free diet (GFD) with those in healthy subjects. RESULTS: Serum I-FABP levels increased significantly during a two-week GC. In contrast, the most pronounced autoantibody increase was found at day 28, when patients had already returned to a GFD for two weeks. IgA-AAA titers were only significantly elevated at day 28. I-FABP levels and IEL count correlated at baseline (r=0.458, P=0.042) and at day 14 (r=0.654, P=0.002) of GC. Neither gluten dose nor time on a GFD influenced I-FABP change during GC. CONCLUSIONS: Serum I-FABP levels increased significantly during a two-week GC in adult CD patients and correlated with IEL count. The data suggest that serum I-FABP is an early marker of gluten-induced enteropathy in celiac patients and may be of use in both clinical and research settings.
26336025	Unusual presentation of arsenic poisoning in a case of celiac disease.	Arsenic poisoning may occur from sources other than drinking water such as rice, seafood, or insecticides. Symptoms and signs can be insidious, non-specific, atypical, and easily overlooked. We present a 39-year-old woman with celiac disease who was on gluten-free diet for 8 years and presented with diarrhea, headache, insomnia, loss of appetite, abnormal taste, and impaired short-term memory and concentration, but with no skin lesions. Arsenic concentration in her 24-hour urine was 682.77 micro g/g creatinine (normal < 15). She responded very well to chelation therapy with dimercaptosuccinic acid given orally and recovered within 2 weeks. The suspected source of arsenic poisoning was rice, as drink.ing contaminated ground water is not known in Saudi Arabia and she had not taken seafood. Therefore, arsenic poisoning should be suspected based on the meticulous medical history in cases of patients with celiac disease whose main food is rice and who present with unusual symptoms.

25803021	Tax-deductible provisions for gluten-free diet in Canada compared with systems for gluten-free diet coverage available in various countries.	Celiac disease affects 1% of the North American population, with an estimated 350,000 Canadians diagnosed with this condition. The disease is triggered by the ingestion of gluten, and a lifelong, strict gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only currently available treatment. Compliance with a strict GFD is essential not only for intestinal mucosal recovery and alleviation of symptoms, but also for the prevention of complications such as anemia, osteoporotic fractures and small bowel lymphoma. However, a GFD is difficult to follow, socially inconvenient and expensive. Different approaches, such as tax reduction, cash transfer, food provision, prescription and subsidy, have been used to reduce the additional costs of the GFD to patients with celiac disease. The current review showed that the systems in place exhibit particular advantages and disadvantages in relation to promoting uptake and compliance with GFD. The tax offset system used in Canada for GFD coverage takes the form of a reimbursement of a cost previously incurred. Hence, the program does not help celiac patients meet the incremental cost of the GFD - it simply provides some future refund of that cost. An ideal balanced approach would involve subsidizing gluten-free products through controlled vouchers or direct food provision to those who most need it, independently of 'ability or willingness to pay'. Moreover, if the cost of such a program is inhibitive, the value of the benefits could be made taxable to ensure that any patient contribution, in terms of additional taxation, is directly related to ability to pay. The limited coverage of GFD in Canada is concerning. There is an unmet need for GFD among celiac patients in Canada. More efforts are required by the Canadian medical community and the Canadian Celiac Association to act as agents in identifying ways of improving resource allocation in celiac disease. 
23697749	An excess of prior irritable bowel syndrome diagnoses or treatments in Celiac disease: evidence of diagnostic delay.	OBJECTIVE: It is recognized that celiac disease can present with symptoms characteristic of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and that a substantial proportion of patients referred to gastroenterologists with these symptoms may have celiac disease. The authors set out to discover how commonly those suffering with celiac disease are misdiagnosed as suffering from IBS and whether such misdiagnosis delays the correct diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case control study using computerized records from the General Practice Research Database was conducted. The authors compared the proportion of patients with celiac disease who had a diagnosis of or had undergone treatment for IBS over a variety of time periods before the diagnosis of celiac disease with the proportion of a matched group without celiac disease who were similarly diagnosed or treated. RESULTS: It was found that 16% of celiac patients had such a prior diagnosis compared to 4.9% of controls (a threefold increased risk of prior IBS; OR = 3.8, 95% CI: 3.6-4.2), and that if one looked at typical treatment for IBS rather than diagnostic codes, 28% of celiac patients appeared to have been treated compared to 9% of controls. Many of the diagnoses of IBS occurred within the last year before diagnosis of celiac disease, but there was a clear excess of IBS even 10 years earlier. CONCLUSIONS: In contemporary UK practice, it is likely that at least some patients with celiac disease spend many years being treated as having IBS. Following guidelines to test serologically for celiac disease will minimize this problem.
30840918	Daily oligofructose-enriched inulin intake impacts bone turnover markers but not the cytokine profile in pediatric patients with celiac disease on a gluten-free diet: Results of a randomised, placebo-controlled pilot study.	BACKGROUND: Bone metabolism disturbances are commonly observed in patients with newly diagnosed celiac disease (CD). The only available treatment for CD-the intake of a gluten-free diet (GFD)-has been found to be insufficient in effectively improving bone health in some patients. Therefore, there is an urgent need to modify the GFD so as to allow for the provision of all the necessary nutrients and improved absorption. Prebiotics intake reportedly improves the absorption of bone-related vitamin D and calcium as well as bone metabolism. The effect of prebiotic intake on bone health in CD patients has not been studied yet. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of oligofructose-enriched inulin intake on bone metabolism and immune response in children with CD on a GFD. METHODS: A total of 34 children with CD were randomised into two groups receiving 10 g of oligofructose-enriched inulin (Synergy 1) or a placebo (maltodextrin) for three months, together with a strict GFD. The children's bone metabolism marker levels and cytokine profiles were analysed before and after the intervention. RESULTS: After supplementation, the concentration of osteocalcin increased significantly in children receiving Synergy 1, while the concentration of bone alkaline phosphatase increased in both groups, independent of supplementation. After the intervention, the level of pyridinoline increased significantly in the placebo group, resulting in a concentration that was two times higher than that in the Synergy 1 group, in which it remained stable. Moreover, the plasma concentrations of N-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen decreased in both the groups, whereas the tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b level increased particularly in the Synergy 1 group. The intervention did not lead to immunological response changes. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed supplementation beneficially altered bone metabolism, through increased bone formation rates and decreased bone resorption process rates. Supplementation of GFD with prebiotic oligofructose-enriched inulin may be a promising auxiliary therapy for bone metabolism improvements in children with CD.
28051174	Characterization of globulin storage proteins of a low prolamin cereal species in relation to celiac disease.	Brachypodium distachyon, a small annual grass with seed storage globulins as primary protein reserves was used in our study to analyse the toxic nature of non-prolamin seed storage proteins related to celiac disease. The main storage proteins of B. distachyon are the 7S globulin type proteins and the 11S, 12S seed storage globulins similar to oat and rice. Immunoblot analyses using serum samples from celiac disease patients were carried out followed by the identification of immune-responsive proteins using mass spectrometry. Serum samples from celiac patients on a gluten-free diet, from patients with Crohn's disease and healthy subjects, were used as controls. The identified proteins with intense serum-IgA reactivity belong to the 7S and 11-12S seed globulin family. Structure prediction and epitope predictions analyses confirmed the presence of celiac disease-related linear B cell epitope homologs and the presence of peptide regions with strong HLA-DQ8 and DQ2 binding capabilities. These results highlight that both MHC-II presentation and B cell response may be developed not only to prolamins but also to seed storage globulins. This is the first study of the non-prolamin type seed storage proteins of Brachypodium from the aspect of the celiac disease.
34073654	Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity: An Update.	Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a clinical entity characterized by the absence of celiac disease and wheat allergy in patients that trigger reproducible symptomatic responses to gluten-containing foods consumption. Due to the lack of sensitive and reproducible biomarkers for NCGS diagnosis, placebo-controlled gluten challenges must be carried out for its diagnosis. The gluten challenges can be either double- or single-blind, for research or clinical practice purposes, respectively. For improving our understanding about the magnitude and relevance of NCGS in different populations, epidemiological studies based on self-report have been carried out. However, the gluten challenge-based prevalence of NCGS remains to be estimated. Since NCGS was recently recognized as a clinical entity, more studies are needed to delve into NCGS pathogenesis, for instance, the molecular interactions between the suspected cereal grain components that trigger NCGS, such as fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) and amylase and trypsin inhibitors, and the immune system remains to be elucidated. Although still under debate, NCGS patients can be susceptible to only one or more than one of the NCGS triggers. The treatment of NCGS involves the dietary restriction of the suspected triggers of the disease, but there is controversial data about the effectiveness of different dietary interventions such as the gluten-free diet and low-FODMAP diet. Certainly, our understanding of NCGS is improving quickly due to the constant availability of new scientific information on this topic. Thus, the aim of the present narrative review is to present an up-to-date overview on NCGS from epidemiology to current therapy.
28489931	Cortical involvement in celiac disease before and after long-term gluten-free diet: A Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation study.	OBJECTIVE: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in de novo patients with Celiac Disease previously revealed an imbalance in the excitability of cortical facilitatory and inhibitory circuits. After a median period of 16 months of gluten-free diet, a global increase of cortical excitability was reported, suggesting a glutamate-mediated compensation for disease progression. We have now evaluated cross-sectionally the changes of cortical excitability to TMS after a much longer gluten-free diet. METHODS: Twenty patients on adequate gluten-free diet for a mean period of 8.35 years were enrolled and compared with 20 de novo patients and 20 healthy controls. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation measures, recorded from the first dorsal interosseous muscle of the dominant hand, consisted of: resting motor threshold, cortical silent period, motor evoked potentials, central motor conduction time, mean short-latency intracortical inhibition and intracortical facilitation. RESULTS: The cortical silent period was shorter in de novo patients, whereas in gluten-free diet participants it was similar to controls. The amplitude of motor responses was significantly smaller in all patients than in controls, regardless of the dietary regimen. Notwithstanding the diet, all patients exhibited a statistically significant decrease of mean short-latency intracortical inhibition and enhancement of intracortical facilitation with respect to controls; more intracortical facilitation in gluten-restricted compared to non-restricted patients was also observed. Neurological examination and celiac disease-related antibodies were negative. CONCLUSIONS: In this new investigation, the length of dietary regimen was able to modulate the electrocortical changes in celiac disease. Nevertheless, an intracortical synaptic dysfunction, mostly involving excitatory and inhibitory interneurons within the motor cortex, may persist. The clinical significance of subtle neurophysiological changes in celiac disease needs to be further investigated.
28406045	A methacrylic hyaluronic acid derivative for potential application in oral treatment of celiac disease.	OBJECTIVE: Aim of this work was the synthesis of a methacrylic hyaluronic acid (HA) derivative and the production, via photocrosslinking, of related hydrogels loaded with an endopeptidase intended for a potential oral treatment of celiac disease. METHODS: The methacrylic derivative of HA was prepared through a one-pot procedure involving the reaction with ethylenediamine (EDA) and methacrylic anhydride (MA). The obtained derivative, named HA-EDA-MA, was used to prepare photocrosslinked hydrogels loaded with a prolyl endopeptidase derived from Flavobacterium meningosepticum (PEP FM) able to detoxify gliadin. Obtained hydrogels were recovered as gels or freeze-dried powders. RESULTS: Hydrogels obtained as freeze-dried powders, are able to protect loaded enzyme from degradation due to freeze-drying process and from alteration during storage, overall in the presence of a cryoprotectant. All photocrosslinked HA-EDA-MA hydrogels (gels and powders) release PEP FM in simulated intestinal fluid in sustained manner and in active form. HA-EDA-MA hydrogels are nontoxic as demonstrated through in vitro studies on BALB 3T3 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Prepared hydrogels show a potential application for oral treatment of celiac disease thanks to the possibility to release enzymes able to detoxify the gliadin peptide that induces the immunogenic response.
25254519	Depression and anxiety in child and adolescents with follow-up celiac disease and in their families.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Earlier research has indicated a positive association between Celiac disease and some mental disorders in both adults and children. The aim of this study was to explore the diet compliance and depression and anxiety levels of pediatric celiac children and their families after a gluten-free diet. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 30 celiac pediatric patients (17 children [57%] and 13 adolescents [43%]) were enrolled in the study, and 20 healthy controls (11 children [55%] and 9 adolescents [45%]) were studied as controls. Depression was assessed with the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) form, and anxiety was assessed with the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED) form. Diet compliance was measured with a diet compliance form, and the families were asked to complete the Beck Depression Measurement (BDI) form for depression and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory I-II (STAI-I and STAI-II) forms for anxiety. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in depression and anxiety between pediatric celiac patients consuming a gluten-free diet and the healthy control group. We observed no difference in depression and anxiety in the Celiac CD group patients. Diet compliance was 73.3% in the study group. CONCLUSION: The depression and anxiety levels of pediatric celiac patients and their parents did not differ from those in the healthy group.
30908383	Pediatric Nonceliac Gluten Sensitivity: A Gluten-related Disorder Treatment Center Experience.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to identify the prevalence and clinical characteristics of children with nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) presenting to a tertiary care center specialized for evaluation of gluten-related disorders. METHODS: The medical records of all patients aged 0 to 18 years who presented to our center over a 4-year period (July 2013-June 2018) and consented to participate in our research registry were reviewed. Patients meeting the clinical criteria for NCGS were reviewed in detail. RESULTS: Among 500 pediatric patients who volunteered to participate in the registry during the study period, we identified 26 (5.2%) with NCGS. Both gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms associated with gluten ingestion were common with abdominal pain (57.7%), bloating (53.9%), rash (53.9%), diarrhea/loose stool (42.3%), and emotional/behavioral issues (42.3%) emerging as the predominant complaints. In addition, children with NCGS demonstrated a high personal history (61.5%) and family history (61.5%) of concomitant allergic/atopic disease. CONCLUSIONS: Even within our highly specialized population of patients with a suspected gluten-related disorder, pediatric NCGS is relatively uncommon. The estimated prevalence and clinical features mirror those previously reported in a similarly highly selective population of adults. In the absence of celiac disease, clinical suspicion for NCGS should arise in a child with gastrointestinal and/or extraintestinal complaints alleviated with gluten removal and considered in symptomatic patients with associated allergic/atopic disease. Proper and adequate exclusion of celiac disease and other potential causes of the clinical complaints is essential to justify adoption of the gluten-free diet according to an appropriate stringency and with dietitian supervision to avoid nutritional deficiencies.
25873118	[Non-celiac gluten sensitivity].	Non-celiac gluten sensitivity has recently been recognized by the scientific community as a part of gluten-related disorders, and is defined as a condition with gastrointestinal and/or extra-intestinal symptoms triggered by gluten ingestion in the absence of celiac disease and wheat allergy. Currently, there is no specific serological marker and non-celiac gluten sensitivity remains a diagnosis of exclusion: testing for celiac disease and wheat allergy must be negative, symptoms must improve with a gluten-free diet, and diagnosis must be confirmed by the gluten challenge. In this article, we discuss current knowledge of pathophysiology, clinical and epidemilogical spectrum, diagnosis, and treatment of NCGS. 
24583754	Titers of anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody correlate well with severity of villous abnormalities in celiac disease.	GOALS: We reviewed our celiac disease (CeD) database to study if anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibody (ab) titers correlate with severity of villous abnormalities in Indian patients and to find out a cutoff value of anti-tTG ab fold-rise, which could best predict CeD. BACKGROUND: Guidelines for diagnosing CeD suggest that biopsy could be avoided in some patients with high anti-tTG ab titer. STUDY: We reviewed a cohort of 366 anti-tTG ab-positive individuals in whom duodenal biopsies were performed. Anti-tTG ab was obtained before initiation of gluten-free diet. Anti-tTG ab results were expressed in terms of fold-rise by calculating ratio of observed values with cutoff value. CeD was diagnosed if in addition to positive serology, patients had villous atrophy (>Marsh grade 2) and unequivocal response to gluten-free diet. RESULTS: The mean anti-tTG fold-rise in groups with Marsh grade <=2 was 2.6 (+-2.5), grade 3a was 4.0 (+-3.9), 3b was 5.7 (+-5.1), and 3c was 11.8 (+-8.0). The positive likelihood ratio for diagnosing CeD was 15.4 and 27.4 at 12- and 14-fold-rise of anti-tTG ab titer, respectively. The positive predictive value of diagnosis of CeD was 100% when anti-tTG ab titer was 14-fold higher over the cutoff value. Fifty-seven (43.9%) individuals with anti-tTG titer rise <2-fold high also had CeD. CONCLUSIONS: As severity of villous abnormality increases, titer of anti-tTG also rises. Presence of villous atrophy can be predicted at very high anti-tTG ab titer. In contrast to emerging belief, mucosal biopsies should be performed even if anti-tTG ab titer is <2 times, because many patients with CeD have low titers.

26931303	Celiac crisis in children in Serbia.	BACKGROUND: To assess the prevalence and risk factors of celiac crisis (CC) in children with classical celiac disease (CD). METHODS: This retrospective study comprised 367 children with classical CD diagnosed from 1994 to 2015. The diagnosis of CD was based on the revised ESPGHAN criteria and CC on acute worsening and rapid progression of chronic diarrhea and vomiting followed by severe dehydration, multiple metabolic derangements and a marked decrease of body weight. RESULTS: Celiac crisis was confirmed in six (1.63 %) children, five in the first and one in the second year of life. In three patients CC was precipitated by rotavirus and in one by Salmonella enteritidis infection, while in the remaining two, except for a too long-standing disease and severe malnutrition, no additional causes of CC were found. CONCLUSION: Celiac crisis in Serbia is still-present in children exclusively below the second year of life as a spontaneous or intestinal infection precipitated complication of previously unrecognized CD.

37062174	Targeting the gut microbiota in inflammatory bowel diseases: where are we?	The gut microbiota is now recognized to be a key driver of mucosal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Robust functional and compositional alterations of the gut microbiota have been described in IBD with a reduction in bacterial diversity, a reduction in some anti-inflammatory anaerobic bacteria, and an increase in bacteria with pro-inflammatory potential. However, despite 15 years of active research, therapeutical applications are still lacking. Recent studies have shed new light on how targeting the gut microbiota can be beneficial in IBD with fecal microbiota transplantation, next-generation probiotics, and phage therapy. Given the similarities in dysfunction and structure of the gut microbiota between IBD and other chronic conditions associated with intestinal inflammation, such as celiac disease, Familial Mediterranean Fever, or common variable immunodeficiency, common therapeutic strategies targeting the host-microbiota symbiosis may be applied in these different conditions.
33503952	Rationale for Timing of Follow-Up Visits to Assess Gluten-Free Diet in Celiac Disease Patients Based on Data Mining.	The assessment of compliance of gluten-free diet (GFD) is a keystone in the supervision of celiac disease (CD) patients. Few data are available documenting evidence-based follow-up frequency for CD patients. In this work we aim at creating a criterion for timing of clinical follow-up for CD patients using data mining. We have applied data mining to a dataset with 188 CD patients on GFD (75% of them are children below 14 years old), evaluating the presence of gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) in stools as an adherence to diet marker. The variables considered are gender, age, years following GFD and adherence to the GFD by fecal GIP. The results identify patients on GFD for more than two years (41.5% of the patients) as more prone to poor compliance and so needing more frequent follow-up than patients with less than 2 years on GFD. This is against the usual clinical practice of following less patients on long term GFD, as they are supposed to perform better. Our results support different timing follow-up frequency taking into consideration the number of years on GFD, age and gender. Patients on long term GFD should have a more frequent monitoring as they show a higher level of gluten exposure. A gender perspective should also be considered as non-compliance is partially linked to gender in our results: Males tend to get more gluten exposure, at least in the cultural context where our study was carried out.

26250345	Severe intestinal malabsorption associated with olmesartan: a French nationwide observational cohort study.	OBJECTIVES: Severe sprue-like enteropathy associated with olmesartan has been reported, but there has been no demonstration of an increased risk by epidemiological studies. AIM: To assess, in a nationwide patient cohort, the risk of hospitalisation for intestinal malabsorption associated with olmesartan compared with other angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and ACE inhibitors (ACEIs). DESIGN: From the French National Health Insurance claim database, all adult patients initiating ARB or ACEI between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2012 with no prior hospitalisation for intestinal malabsorption, no serology testing for coeliac disease and no prescription for a gluten-free diet product were included. Incidence of hospitalisation with a discharge diagnosis of intestinal malabsorption was the primary endpoint. RESULTS: 4 546 680 patients (9 010 303 person-years) were included, and 218 events observed. Compared with ACEI, the adjusted rate ratio of hospitalisation with a discharge diagnosis of intestinal malabsorption was 2.49 (95% CI 1.73 to 3.57, p<0.0001) in olmesartan users. This adjusted rate ratio was 0.76 (95% CI 0.39 to 1.49, p=0.43) for treatment duration shorter than 1 year, 3.66 (95% CI 1.84 to 7.29, p<0.001) between 1 and 2 years and 10.65 (95% CI 5.05 to 22.46, p<0.0001) beyond 2 years of exposure. Median length of hospital stay for intestinal malabsorption was longer in the olmesartan group than in the other groups (p=0.02). Compared with ACEI, the adjusted rate ratio of hospitalisation for coeliac disease was 4.39 (95% CI 2.77 to 6.96, p<0.0001) in olmesartan users and increased with treatment duration. CONCLUSIONS: Olmesartan is associated with an increased risk of hospitalisation for intestinal malabsorption and coeliac disease.
25837529	Wheat-related disorders reviewed: making a grain of sense.	Wheat-related disorders have become a growing area of clinical and scientific interest and can be categorized broadly as: autoimmune-mediated; allergic; and non-autoimmune/non-allergic conditions. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) and non-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCWS) present on this spectrum as disorders associated with adverse gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal manifestations following exposure to gluten and/or other wheat-related constituents. NCGS/NCWS is increasingly considered in patients with unexplained symptoms after the exclusions of celiac disease and wheat allergy. As objective diagnostic data and specific biomarkers are lacking, response to a gluten-free/wheat-free diet can confirm the presence of NCGS/NCWS. An association with irritable bowel syndrome has been detected, and the effects of other food components, such as fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols, may contribute. Our organization and synthesis of extant knowledge pertaining to wheat-related disorders may advance current practice and research efforts toward an improved understanding of NCGS/NCWS as an evolving clinical entity. 
26576765	Adherence to gluten-free diet and barriers to adherence in patients with celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: While adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD) is essential for effective control of celiac disease, the level of adherence to GFD may vary. We assessed the level of adherence to GFD and identified barriers to adherence in patients with celiac disease. METHODS: Both treatment-naive and follow up patients with celiac disease were recruited from a celiac disease clinic. All the patients were assessed for symptom improvement using celiac symptom index (CSI), weight, and hemoglobin; adherence to GFD using detailed dietary history and food-labeled quiz questionnaire; identification of barriers to GFD using a self-administered 36-point questionnaire; and quality of life using a standard 36-item short form (SF36) questionnaire. RESULTS: Among the patients who were already on GFD, only 53.3% maintained an excellent or good level of adherence, which increased to 92.4% at 6 months with repeated counseling. Among the treatment-naive patients, 64.8% maintained either excellent or good compliance at 1 month after first counseling, which increased to 96.3% at 6 months with repeated counseling. The most common barrier to adherence was non-availability of GFD. Certain barriers could be modified with repeated counseling and education. Response to GFD, as measured by CSI, gain in weight, and improvement in hemoglobin, was better in those having either excellent or good compliance to GFD compared to those who remained poorly adherent. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated counseling increased the level of adherence to GFD.

25944220	Pulmonary Hemosiderosis Associated With Celiac Disease: Lane Hamilton Syndrome.	
29515723	[Celiac disease in adult patients revealed by polyserositis: about a case].	Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease affecting multiple organs. It often presents as gastrointestinal manifestations associated with malabsorption. However, serosa involvement uncommonly reveals this enteropathy, making the diagnosis difficult. We here report the case of JA, aged 63 years, admitted to hospital to detect the cause of malabsorption syndrome associated with polyserositis signs including pleurisy, pericarditis, ascites and hydrocephalus. The diagnosis of CD was based on endoscopic signs without serology tests. Patient's evolution was partially favorable, due to lack of compliance with a gluten-free diet. Our study reports the first case of CD revealed by polyserositis. CD should be suspected in patients with malabsorption syndrome, in the absence of evocative signs.
21948339	Safety, tolerability, and activity of ALV003: results from two phase 1 single, escalating-dose clinical trials.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is the most common hereditary autoimmune disease in humans. The only treatment option for non-refractory celiac disease patients is adherence to a strict life-long gluten-free diet, which often fails to normalize small bowel histology. ALV003 is a mixture of two proteases that degrades gluten and is in clinical development as an oral therapy for patients with celiac disease. AIMS: The safety, tolerability, and activity of ALV003 were assessed in two phase 1 clinical trials. METHODS: In study 1 (N = 28) the study drug was administered in the fasted state; in study 2 (N = 53) the study drug was administered together with a gluten-containing meal. Both studies were single-dose, single-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trials. ALV003 was dosed at escalating dose levels by cohort (100, 300, 900, and 1,800 mg) and gastric samples were aspirated using a nasogastric tube. Adverse events, serum drug levels, and anti-drug antibody titers were measured. Gastric samples were assessed for ALV003 enzymatic activity over time (gastric pharmacokinetics) and gluten degradation (gastric pharmacodynamics). RESULTS: All doses were well tolerated, and no serious adverse events or allergic reactions were observed. Gastric aspirates collected 30 min following a meal showed that 100 and 300 mg ALV003 degraded 75 +- 10% (N = 8) and 88 +- 5% (N = 8), respectively, of one gram of wheat bread gluten. CONCLUSIONS: ALV003 is an orally active protease that appears to be stable in the fed stomach and degrades dietary gluten in this compartment. Single doses of oral ALV003 were not associated with serious adverse reactions.
34192430	A Randomized Trial of a Transglutaminase 2 Inhibitor for Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND: In celiac disease, small intestinal transglutaminase 2 causes deamidation of glutamine residues in gluten peptides, which enhances stimulation of T cells and leads to mucosal injury. Inhibition of transglutaminase 2 is a potential treatment for celiac disease. METHODS: In a proof-of-concept trial, we assessed the efficacy and safety of a 6-week treatment with ZED1227, a selective oral transglutaminase 2 inhibitor, at three dose levels as compared with placebo, in adults with well-controlled celiac disease who underwent a daily gluten challenge. The primary end point was the attenuation of gluten-induced mucosal damage, as measured by the ratio of villus height to crypt depth. Secondary end points included intraepithelial lymphocyte density, the Celiac Symptom Index score, and the Celiac Disease Questionnaire score (for assessment of health-related quality of life). RESULTS: Of the 41 patients assigned to the 10-mg ZED1227 group, the 41 assigned to the 50-mg group, the 41 assigned to the 100-mg group, and the 40 assigned to the placebo group, 35, 39, 38, and 30 patients, respectively, had adequate duodenal-biopsy samples for the assessment of the primary end point. Treatment with ZED1227 at all three dose levels attenuated gluten-induced duodenal mucosal injury. The estimated difference from placebo in the change in the mean ratio of villus height to crypt depth from baseline to week 6 was 0.44 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.15 to 0.73) in the 10-mg group (P = 0.001), 0.49 (95% CI, 0.20 to 0.77) in the 50-mg group (P<0.001), and 0.48 (95% CI, 0.20 to 0.77) in the 100-mg group (P<0.001). The estimated differences from placebo in the change in intraepithelial lymphocyte density were -2.7 cells per 100 epithelial cells (95% CI, -7.6 to 2.2) in the 10-mg group, -4.2 cells per 100 epithelial cells (95% CI, -8.9 to 0.6) in the 50-mg group, and -9.6 cells per 100 epithelial cells (95% CI, -14.4 to -4.8) in the 100-mg group. Use of the 100-mg dose may have improved symptom and quality-of-life scores. The most common adverse events, the incidences of which were similar across all groups, were headache, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Rash developed in 3 of 40 patients (8%) in the 100-mg group. CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary trial, treatment with ZED1227 attenuated gluten-induced duodenal mucosal damage in patients with celiac disease.

34569646	Bone Fractures in Children and Young Adults With Type 1 Diabetes: Age Distribution, Fracture Location, and the Role of Glycemic Control.	Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a known risk factor for fractures, but the underlying pathophysiology is still not fully understood. This study aims to define age peaks and frequent fracture sites of children and young adults with T1D. Additionally, associations of fractures with metabolic and lifestyle factors as well as with additional complications in individuals with T1D were analyzed. A total of 750 individuals with T1D aged <=25 years with fractures were matched to 3750 patients with T1D without fractures by demographics and insulin regimen. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values were compared using linear regression, and logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) for fractures in individuals with acute complications and diseases. Median (Q1-Q3) age was 12.7 (9.9 to 14.9) years in individuals with fractures and 16.3 (12.6 to 17.8) years in the entire control group with 65% versus 53% males. Peak age for fractures was 7 to <15 years in males and 9 to <11 years in females, which is earlier than reported for the general population. HbA1c (%) was significantly higher in individuals with fractures than in controls (difference of estimated means: 0.26%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.07-0.46), especially in postpubertal females (0.68; 0.10-1.26). Significantly higher odds for fractures were observed in individuals with severe hypoglycemia (OR = 1.90; 95% CI 1.47-2.47), especially in prepubertal females (OR = 2.81; 1.21-6.52]) and postpubertal males (2.44; 1.11-5.38), celiac disease (2.02; 1.67-2.45), and with a history of smoking (1.38; 1.02-1.88). The age peak of fractures seems to be earlier in T1D than in the general population. Poor glycemic control is related to fractures, even before puberty. Associations of HbA1c and severe hypoglycemia with fractures highly depend on age and sex.   2021 The Authors.

29753760	Gluten-free living in China: The characteristics, food choices and difficulties in following a gluten-free diet - An online survey.	BACKGROUND: Individuals adhering to a gluten-free diet (GFD) have been scarcely researched within a Chinese population. This present study was conducted to assess the characteristics, food choices, shopping preferences, and emotions and attitudes of individuals following a GFD. METHODS: Individuals following a GFD were invited to complete an online questionnaire about their demography and geography characteristics, gluten-free food choices, shopping preferences, GFD management and subjective difficulty towards the diet. Distribution of the characteristics was described, and univariate and multivariate logistic regressions performed to explore the relationship between the above-mentioned variables and subjective difficulty in following a GFD. RESULT: 209 individuals following a GFD completed the questionnaire, most of whom were young, single and well-educated females from developed provinces or municipalities in China. Multiple regression showed that age, education level, advice on starting a GFD, duration before discovering a gluten intolerance, food choices and ways of GFD management were significantly associated with the subjective difficulty in following a GFD. CONCLUSION: Our findings offer a basic characteristics pattern of the population on a GFD in mainland China. Nearly one-third of GFD followers found the diet challenging to be followed. We suggest that sufficient celiac disease and gluten-induced disorder education be conducted among healthcare practitioners. Early diagnosis of gluten-induced disorders and defining an Asian-adapted GFD, as well as an increase in public awareness, may help adherence to a strict GFD in China.
21787226	Unraveling the ties between celiac disease and intestinal microbiota.	Celiac disease is a multifactorial disorder that involves interactions between genetic and environmental factors. Gluten proteins are responsible for the symptoms of celiac disease, but other environmental factors that influence the intestinal ecosystem, including the milk-feeding type and gastrointestinal infections, may also play a role. Moreover, intestinal dysbiosis, characterized by increased Gram-negative bacteria and reduced bifidobacteria, has been detected in celiac disease patients. This review summarizes current knowledge of the associations between the intestinal microbiota and celiac disease and its possible modes of action in pathogenesis. Deeper understanding of these interactions can help redefine how this disorder is investigated.
25574900	Primary care management of celiac disease.	: Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder with genetic predisposition that affects as many as 1 in 100 individuals. Treatment is a lifelong, strict adherence to a gluten-free diet. Management by a primary care provider may lead to increased adherence and can minimize effects of nonadherence to the diet. 
34334763	Patient Perspectives on the Long-term Management of Celiac Disease.	GOAL: The aim of this study was to survey adults with celiac disease (CD) on the utility of specific aspects of follow-up and on information needs. BACKGROUND: Currently, the treatment for CD is strict gluten avoidance. Although this places the onus on the patient for disease management, patient perspectives on CD care have not been formally assessed. STUDY: The Manitoba Celiac Disease Cohort prospectively enrolled adults newly diagnosed with CD using serology and histology. At the 24-month study visits, participants rated the utility of aspects of CD care on a 5-point scale anchored by "not at all useful" and "very useful" and the helpfulness of information on CD-related topics on a 6-point scale anchored by "not at all helpful" and "very helpful." RESULTS: The online survey was completed by 149 of 211 cohort members [median age 40 (interquartile range 30 to 56) y; 68% female]. Adherence to a gluten-free diet was good. Most participants (87%) responded that they should be seen regularly for medical follow-up of CD, preferably every 6 (26%) or 12 months (48%). Blood tests were the most highly rated care component (rated scored >=4/5 by 78% of respondents), followed by the opportunity to ask about vitamins and supplements (50%), symptom review (47%), and information on CD research (44%). Diet review was not considered helpful. CONCLUSIONS: Two years after diagnosis, most individuals with CD find regular specialist follow-up helpful, particularly for biochemical assessment of disease activity and its complications. Furthermore, information on research and long-term complications of CD is also valued.
26676361	Gluten ataxia is better classified as non-celiac gluten sensitivity than as celiac disease: a comparative clinical study.	Gluten ataxia (GA) has customarily been considered to be the main neurological manifestation of celiac disease (CD). In recent years, the condition of non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) has been defined, which includes some patients who are not considered "true celiacs." We performed a comparative clinicopathological study of these three entities. We studied 31 GA, 48 CD and 37 NCGS patients, prospectively in the same center for a period of 7 years. The protocol study included two serological determinations for gluten sensitivity [anti-gliadin IgA and IgG (AGA) and anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA (TG) antibodies], HLA-DQ2 typing, and duodenal histological assessment. Demographics and investigative findings were compared. Females were 55 % in GA, 75 % in CD (p < 0.001), and 47 % in NCGS (N.S.). GA patients were older (59 +- 14 years) than CD (43 +- 13 years) and NCGS (41 +- 8 years) groups (p < 0.001). AGA positivity was higher in GA (100 %) than in CD (48 %) groups (p < 0.001), but similar to NCGS patients (89 %; N.S.); TG positivity was lower in GA (3.2 %) than in CD (33.3 %; p < 0.001), but similar to NCGS (2.7 %; N.S.). DQ2 (+) was lower in GA (32.2 %) than in CD (89.6 %; p < 0.001), but similar to NCGS (29.7 %; N.S.). Lymphocytic enteritis (Marsh type 1) was lower in GA (9.6 %) than in CD (66.7 %; p < 0.001), but similar to NCGS (10.8 %; N.S.). The other gluten sensitivity-related characteristics measured were different to CD patients, but very close to NCGS. We conclude that GA patients are better classified within the NCGS group, than within CD.
37962594	[What is established in the management of celiac disease?]	Nowadays, celiac disease is well-established in internal medicine as an autoimmune disease induced by gluten as a trigger. Undoubtedly similarly well-established is the gluten-free diet. It is the only recognized therapy for celiac disease to date. However, this presents some pitfalls in its implementation, which will be discussed in the following review. In addition, current developments that have the potential to significantly change both diagnosis and treatment of celiac disease are discussed. On the one hand, such an outlook was chosen since colleagues want to be "ready" when such developments are integrated into daily clinical routine. On the other hand, the realization that the field of mucosal immunology is moving forward has the potential to lift the spirits of the reader.

31138509	Device-assisted enteroscopy: An update on techniques, clinical indications and safety.	After more than 15 years since its introduction into clinical practice, indications for device-assisted enteroscopy have greatly expanded. Alongside the consolidated indications such as the diagnosis and treatment of small bowel bleeding, Crohn's disease, hereditary polyposis, small-bowel tumors and complicated celiac disease, device-assisted enteroscopy is nowadays largely used to perform endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in patients with altered anatomy, stent placement, retrieval of foreign bodies, direct insertion of jejunal feeding tubes, and in selected cases of incomplete colonoscopy. This has been made possible by the technical improvements of the enteroscopes and accessories and by the widespread use of the method. Device-assisted enteroscopy endotherapy currently offers a safe and effective alternative to major surgery and often represents the preferred option for treatment of small-bowel pathology. Its safety profile is favourable even in the elderly patient, provided that it is performed in high-volume and experienced centers. The evolution of the enteroscopy technique is a challenge for the future and could be facilitated by the new enteroscopes models. These prototypes need a thorough clinical and safety assessment especially for the complex therapeutic procedures. Large prospective, multicenter studies should be performed to assess whether the use of device-assisted enteroscopy leads to improved patients' long-term outcomes.

28204873	Dysbiosis a risk factor for celiac disease.	Celiac disease remains one of the most challenging pathologies of the small intestine. It involves multiple pathogenic pathways and there are no disease-changing pharmacological agents available against it yet. The term microbiota refers to the community of microorganisms that inhabit a particular region of the body. Normal gut microbiota has a vital role in maintaining the intestinal homeostasis and promoting health. Celiac disease is associated with microbiota alteration, especially with an increase in the number of Gram-negative bacteria and a decrease in the number of Gram-positive bacteria. There is a strong relationship between intestinal dysbiosis and celiac disease, and recent studies are aimed at determining whether the celiac disease is a risk factor for dysbiosis or dysbiosis is for celiac disease. Therefore, the aim of this review was to assess the latest findings regarding the gut microbiota and its impact on the celiac disease, including therapeutic aspects.
30341866	Prevalence of Chronic Liver Disease Among the Patients of Celiac Disease and Effect of Gluten-Free Diet on Outcome of Liver Disease: A Prospective Study.	Objectives: Descriptive reports of liver involvement in celiac disease (CD) are sparse, and the effect of a strict gluten-free diet (GFD) on the course of liver injury is also poorly understood. We conducted a study on 94 adult patients with CD and found that 39 of them were having chronic liver disease as well. We further followed patients of 'CD with CLD' with strict Gluten-free diet (GFD) for six months. Methods: We screened 94 patients of CD for CLD and found 39 patients to have CLD as well. We further followed these 39 patients of 'CD with CLD' for six month with strict gluten-free diet. Follow up was done in terms of Child Pugh score. We recorded their clinical as well as laboratory findings after 1 month, 3 months and 6 months and compared them with those at the time of recruitment. Results: The liver involvement was found in 39(41.5%) out of 94 patients celiac disease. Mean Child-Pugh score on admission was 10.22+-1.09 and on first follow-up mean Child-Pugh score was 7.38+-1.47 was found to be statistically highly significant (p <0.001) Mean Child-Pugh score on admission was 10.15+-1.09 and on second follow-up 7.33+-1.33 respectively and was statistically highly significant (p <0.001) Mean Child-Pugh score on admission was 10.12+-1.09 and on third follow-up mean Child-Pugh score was 6.31+-0.93 respectively was statistically highly significant (p <0.001).

23149808	The celiac iceberg: characterization of the disease in primary schoolchildren.	OBJECTIVE: Celiac disease (CD) has a prevalence of 0.55% to 1% in Italy. Identifying CD in schoolchildren to characterize CD iceberg and evaluate the effect of diagnosis in screening-detected children. METHODS: A total of 7377 5- to 8-year-old children were invited to participate. A total of 5733 salivary samples were collected and tested for anti-transglutaminase antibodies (tTGAb), using a fluid-phase radioimmunoassay. Salivary tTGAb-positive children were analyzed for serum antibodies (anti-endomysium antibodies, radioimmunoassay, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tTGAb). Positive children underwent endoscopy and then started gluten-free diet (GFD) and periodical follow-up. RESULTS: Forty-six subjects were found salivary tTGAb-positive and 16 border-line. Forty-five of 46 and 5 of 15 of them were also serum antibody-positive. Forty-two children showed duodenal villous atrophy and 1 had only type 1 lesions. Three children started GFD without performing endoscopy. CD prevalence (including 23 previously diagnosed children with CD) was 1.2%. Considering all 65 celiacs in our sample, a silent CD was found in 64%, typical in 28%, atypical in 7%, and potential in 1%. All patients showed strict adherence to GFD, weight and stature increase, and well-being improvement. Eighty-five percent and all but 2 screening-detected children with CD had Italian parents. CONCLUSIONS: Our sample size, representative of primary schoolchildren of our region, demonstrated that CD prevalence is growing in Italy, with a modified clinical spectrum and iceberg deepness.
30661899	Liver Transplantation for Fulminant Hepatic Failure Due to Heat Stroke: A Case Report.	Heat stroke is a condition caused by an excessive increase in body temperature in a relatively short period of time, and is clinically characterized by central nervous system dysfunction, including delirium, seizures, coma, and severe hyperthermia. In this context, the resulting fulminant hepatic failure makes liver transplant the best choice when there are no guarantees of better results with conservative treatment. We present our experience in this case, possible alternative choices, and the current role of liver transplantation in the resolution of fulminant liver failure due to heat stroke. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 32-year-old man with a history of malabsorption syndrome and unconfirmed celiac disease controlled with a gluten-free diet, who, while working on a typical summer midday in southern Spain (approximately 40 C), abruptly presented with loss of consciousness, coma, and a temperature of 42 C, as well as seizures at the initial medical assessment that subsided after the administration of diazepam. On the third day, the patient presented with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, requiring mechanical ventilation, hemodialysis, and inotropic support. He did not improve with the support of conservative treatment, therefore it was decided to perform an urgent liver transplant, after which he recovered completely. CONCLUSIONS: Liver transplantation should be a main choice of treatment for cases in which, despite intensive medical treatment, there is still clinical and analytical evidence of massive and/or irreversible hepatocellular damage.

32032584	Gliadin Nanoparticles Induce Immune Tolerance to Gliadin in Mouse Models of Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease could be treated, and potentially cured, by restoring T-cell tolerance to gliadin. We investigated the safety and efficacy of negatively charged 500-nm poly(lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles encapsulating gliadin protein (TIMP-GLIA) in 3 mouse models of celiac disease. Uptake of these nanoparticles by antigen-presenting cells was shown to induce immune tolerance in other animal models of autoimmune disease. METHODS: We performed studies with C57BL/6; RAG1-/- (C57BL/6); and HLA-DQ8, huCD4 transgenic Ab0 NOD mice. Mice were given 1 or 2 tail-vein injections of TIMP-GLIA or control nanoparticles. Some mice were given intradermal injections of gliadin in complete Freund's adjuvant (immunization) or of soluble gliadin or ovalbumin (ear challenge). RAG-/- mice were given intraperitoneal injections of CD4+CD62L-CD44hi T cells from gliadin-immunized C57BL/6 mice and were fed with an AIN-76A-based diet containing wheat gluten (oral challenge) or without gluten. Spleen or lymph node cells were analyzed in proliferation and cytokine secretion assays or by flow cytometry, RNA sequencing, or real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Serum samples were analyzed by gliadin antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and intestinal tissues were analyzed by histology. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, or immature dendritic cells derived from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, were cultured in medium containing TIMP-GLIA, anti-CD3 antibody, or lipopolysaccharide (controls) and analyzed in proliferation and cytokine secretion assays or by flow cytometry. Whole blood or plasma from healthy volunteers was incubated with TIMP-GLIA, and hemolysis, platelet activation and aggregation, and complement activation or coagulation were analyzed. RESULTS: TIMP-GLIA did not increase markers of maturation on cultured human dendritic cells or induce activation of T cells from patients with active or treated celiac disease. In the delayed-type hypersensitivity (model 1), the HLA-DQ8 transgenic (model 2), and the gliadin memory T-cell enteropathy (model 3) models of celiac disease, intravenous injections of TIMP-GLIA significantly decreased gliadin-specific T-cell proliferation (in models 1 and 2), inflammatory cytokine secretion (in models 1, 2, and 3), circulating gliadin-specific IgG/IgG2c (in models 1 and 2), ear swelling (in model 1), gluten-dependent enteropathy (in model 3), and body weight loss (in model 3). In model 1, the effects were shown to be dose dependent. Splenocytes from HLA-DQ8 transgenic mice given TIMP-GLIA nanoparticles, but not control nanoparticles, had increased levels of FOXP3 and gene expression signatures associated with tolerance induction. CONCLUSIONS: In mice with gliadin sensitivity, injection of TIMP-GLIA nanoparticles induced unresponsiveness to gliadin and reduced markers of inflammation and enteropathy. This strategy might be developed for the treatment of celiac disease.
23653940	[Gluten-sensitive celiac disease associated with recurrent aphthous stomatitis and schizophrenia].	The paper describes a clinical case of celiac disease with grade 3 malabsorption, which is associated with recurrent aphthous stomatitis and schizophrenia. On readmission after 8 months of strict adherence to his gluten-free diet, the patient was observed to be in clinical remission and to have normalized laboratory indices and immunological tests. The signs of recurrent stomatitis disappeared. However, the symptoms of the mental disease remained.
32415563	Impact of a Child's Celiac Disease Diagnosis and Management on the Family.	BACKGROUND: Little attention has been paid to family-wide repercussions of a child's celiac disease diagnosis and concomitant gluten-free diet management. AIMS: We quantitatively and qualitatively describe positive and negative family-wide effects of a child's celiac disease diagnosis and disease management. METHODS: We interviewed 16 families with at least one child currently following a gluten-free diet, with a biopsy-confirmed celiac disease diagnosis >= 1 year prior. Mothers and fathers independently rated child's dietary adherence, concern about child's health status, burden in caring for child's dietary needs, and level of change in various aspects of life post- diagnosis. Children rated their own celiac-specific quality of life through a validated scale. Seventy-one in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 children with celiac disease, 31 parents, and 24 siblings. RESULTS: Mothers and fathers rated the effects of their child's celiac disease differently, with mothers reporting more lifestyle changes and heavier burden. Negative and positive themes emerged from the interviews. Mothers felt the burden of managing a gluten-free diet. Fathers felt guilty for carrying a celiac disease-associated gene and both fathers and siblings regretted limited food choices at restaurants and home. The need to be a more creative cook was seen as a positive effect by mothers. Fathers appreciated new family traditions. Siblings felt they had developed empathy for others. A framework is proposed to illustrate these family-wide interactions. CONCLUSIONS: A child's celiac disease diagnosis and disease management affects the entire family. Our results will inform family-centered interventions that maximize quality of life for families.
23996798	Prevalence of celiac disease in nutritional anemia at a tertiary care center.	BACKGROUND: While anemia occurs in 80 % to 90 % of patients with celiac disease (CD), it may be the sole manifestation of CD. The prevalence of CD in Indian patients with nutritional anemia is not known. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adolescent and adult patients presenting with nutritional anemia were prospectively screened for CD using IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody (anti-tTG Ab) followed, if positive, by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and duodenal biopsy. RESULTS: Ninety-six patients [mean +- SD age 32.1 +- 13.1 years and median duration of anemia 11 months (range 1 to 144 months)] were screened. Of these patients, 80 had iron deficiency anemia, 11 had megaloblastic anemia, and 5 had dimorphic anemia. Seventy-three patients were on hematinics and 36.4 % had received blood transfusions. Nineteen had a history of chronic diarrhea and the mean +- SD duration of diarrhea in them was 9.7 +- 35.8 months. IgA anti-tTG Ab was positive in 13 patients, of whom 12 agreed to undergo duodenal biopsy. Ten patients had villous atrophy (Marsh grade 3a in three, 3b in one, and 3c in six) and two did not. Thus, 10 patients with nutritional anemia (iron deficiency 9, vitamin B12 deficiency 1) were diagnosed to have CD. On multivariate logistic regression, age, duration of symptoms, and presence of diarrhea were found to be the predictors of CD. All the patients with CD were put on gluten-free diet and with iron and vitamin supplementations and showed a significant improvement in hemoglobin concentration. CONCLUSIONS: CD screening should be included in the work up of otherwise unexplained nutritional anemia.
23155313	Intramuscular vs intradermal route for hepatitis B booster vaccine in celiac children.	AIM: To compare intradermal (ID) and intramuscular (IM) booster doses, which have been used in healthy and high risk subjects, such as healthcare workers, haemodialysis patients, human immunodeficiency virus patients, and renal transplant recipients unresponsive to initial hepatitis B vaccination, in celiac individuals. METHODS: We conducted our study on 58 celiac patients, vaccinated in the first year of life, whose blood analysis had showed the absence of protective hepatitis B virus (HBV) antibodies. All patients had received the last vaccine injection at least one year before study enrolment and they had been on a gluten free diet for at least 1 year. In all patients we randomly performed an HBV vaccine booster dose by ID or IM route. Thirty celiac patients were revaccinated with recombinant hepatitis B vaccine (Engerix B) 2 mug by the ID route, while 28 celiac patients were revaccinated with Engerix B 10 mug by the IM route. Four weeks after every booster dose, the anti-hepatitis B surface (HBs) antibody titer was measured by an enzyme-linked immune-adsorbent assay. We performed a maximum of three booster doses in patients with no anti-HBs antibodies after the first or the second vaccine dose. The cut off value for a negative anti-HBs antibody titer was 10 IU/L. Patients with values between 10 and 100 IU/L were considered "low responders" while patients with an antibody titer higher than 1000 IU/L were considered "high responders". RESULTS: No significant difference in age, gender, duration of illness, and years of gluten intake was found between the two groups. We found a high percentage of "responders" after the first booster dose (ID = 76.7%, IM = 78.6%) and a greater increase after the third dose (ID = 90%, IM = 96.4%) of vaccine in both groups. Moreover we found a significantly higher number of high responders (with an anti-HBs antibody titer > 1000 IU/L) in the ID (40%) than in the IM (7.1%) group, and this difference was evident after the first booster dose of vaccination (P < 0.01). No side effects were recorded in performing delivery of the vaccine by either the ID or IM route. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that both ID and IM routes are effective and safe options to administer a booster dose of HBV vaccine in celiac patients. However the ID route seems to achieve a greater number of high responders and to have a better cost/benefit ratio.
31601008	Neighborhood Deprivation and Risks of Autoimmune Disorders: A National Cohort Study in Sweden.	Background: No study to date, as far as we know, has analyzed the potential effect of neighborhood-level deprivation on autoimmune disorders (ADs), when adjusted for individual-level characteristics. Methods: A total of 5.4 million individuals from 8363 neighborhoods, comprising the whole Swedish population (ages 25-74 years), were followed for the period 1 January 2000, until admission due to diagnosis of ADs during the period of the study, or the conclusion of the study (31 December 2010). We used a neighborhood deprivation index, constructed from variables such as low education, low income, unemployment, and social welfare assistance, to assess the level of neighborhood deprivation. Multilevel logistic regression was used in the analysis with individual level characteristics at the first level and level of neighborhood deprivation at the second level. Results: A significant association between level of neighborhood deprivation and ADs was found. The crude odds were 1.32 (95% confidence interval 1.27-1.36) for those residing in the high-deprived neighborhoods compared to those living in low-deprivation neighborhoods. In the full model, where individual level characteristics were taken into account, the odds of ADs were 1.18 (1.14-1.22) in the most deprived neighborhoods. Certain Ads-angiitis hypersensitive (5.14), ankylosing spondylitis (1.66), celiac disease (1.65), Crohn's disease (1.21), diabetes mellitus type 1 (1.45), Graves's disease (1.13), Hashimoto thyroiditis (1.51), psoriasis (1.15), rheumatoid arthritis (1.15), sarcoidosis (1.20), and systemic sclerosis (1.27)-remained significantly associated with high level of neighborhood deprivation after adjustment for the individual-level variables. Conclusion: This study is the largest to date analyzing the potential influence of neighborhood deprivation on ADs. Our results indicate that neighborhood deprivation may affect risk of ADs, independent of individual level sociodemographic characteristics. For health care policies, both individual and neighborhood level approaches seem to be of importance.
29884481	Addressing Barriers for Patients with Celiac Disease When Assessing for Gluten in Medications.	
38474870	Preparation and Immunochemical Characterization of a Water-Soluble Gluten Peptide Fraction for Improving the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease.	The diagnosis of celiac disease (CD) is complex and requires a multi-step procedure (symptoms, serology, duodenal biopsy, effect of a gluten-free diet, and optional genetic). The aim of the study was to contribute to the improvement of CD diagnosis by preparing a water-soluble gluten peptide fraction (called Solgluten) and by selecting gluten-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for the detection of gluten immunogenic gluten peptides (GIPs) in urine and blood serum spiked with Solgluten. Food-grade Solgluten was prepared by the extraction of a peptic digest of vital gluten with water, centrifugation, and freeze-drying. The process was relatively easy, repeatable, and cheap. The content of gliadin-derived GIPs was 491 mg/g. Solgluten was used as antigenic material to compare two competitive ELISA kits (R7021 and K3012) and two sandwich ELISA kits (M2114 and R7041) in their quality regarding the quantitation of GIPs in urine and blood serum. The quality parameters were the reactivity, sensitivity, coefficients of variation and determination, and curve shape. The evaluation of the kits showed a number of discrepancies in individual quality parameters measured in urine and serum. Due to the lowest limit of quantitation and the highest coefficient of determination, M2114 may be the first choice, while R7021 appeared to be less suitable because of the high coefficients of variation and unfavorable curve progression. The results set the stage for improving CD diagnosis by supplementing conventional blood tests with oral provocation with Solgluten and subsequent ELISA measurement of GIPs that could support the no-biopsy approach and by better assessing the effect of a gluten-free diet by monitoring adherence to the diet by measuring GIPs in urine and blood.
21947219	Lane-Hamilton syndrome: case report and review of the literature.	We report a case of a three-and-a-half-year-old boy, who presented with poor general condition, stunted growth, had the presence of nail clubbing, persistent cough and frequent diarrhoea. Persistent iron deficiency anaemia without signs of haemolysis suggested Lane-Hamilton syndrome (LHS) which is or/is an extremely rare combination of idiopathic pulmonary haemosiderosis (IPH) and celiac disease (CD), although both diseases are immunologically mediated and the pathogenetic link between them is not clear. We have now 3 years of follow-up on gluten-free diet (GFD), resulting in a gradual recovery of the abnormal laboratory results in combination with an improving growth. Clinically, he is asymptomatic without any additional treatment. Our case illustrates that CD should be specifically looked for in patients with IPH, especially those in whom the severity of anaemia is disproportionate to the IPH symptoms. Both diseases may benefit from a GFD.
25263796	Urinary nitric oxide metabolites in children with celiac disease after long-term consumption of oats-containing gluten-free diet.	OBJECTIVE: Oats are accepted in the gluten-free diet (GFD) for children with celiac disease (CD). Some reports have indicated, however, that not all celiac patients tolerate oats. We have previously shown that some children still have high levels of urinary nitric oxide (NO) metabolites as markers of intestinal inflammation after 1 year on GFD with oats. In this study, we measured urinary NO metabolites in CD children who had been consuming oats-containing GFD for an extended, 2-6-year period, also taking into consideration ordinary consumption of nitrite/nitrate-rich foods close to the urine sampling. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Morning urinary nitrite/nitrate concentrations were measured in 188 pediatric CD patients. A questionnaire was used to elucidate factors possibly affecting the urinary levels, for example, dietary factors, asthma, or urinary tract infection. RESULTS: Oats were consumed by 89.4% of the patients for a median time of 3 years. The median nitrite/nitrate level was 980 muM. The majority (70.2%) who consumed oats had low levels of urinary nitrite/nitrate, that is, <1400 muM, while 29.8% demonstrated high levels, that is, >1400 muM. Nitrite/nitrate-rich foods did not significantly influence the urinary concentrations. CONCLUSION: The urinary levels of NO metabolites revealed two subpopulations, one with high and one with low levels. The high levels could be possibly due to poor adherence to the GFD, sensitivity to oats, or some unknown factor(s). Nitrate-rich foods, asthma, or urinary tract infection did not affect the result. The elevated levels of NO metabolites could indicate mucosal inflammation and pinpoint the need of careful follow-up of children on oats-containing GFD.
25702766	Review and practice guidelines for celiac disease in 2014.	Celiac disease, or gluten-sensitive enteropathy, is defined as a state of heightened immunologic responsiveness to ingested gluten (from wheat, barley, or rye) in genetically susceptible individuals. Ingestion of the offending proteins leads to inflammation and intestinal mucosal damage, which may result in a spectrum of gastrointestinal symptoms, nutritional abnormalities, and systemic complications ranging from anemia and osteoporosis to secondary autoimmunity and malignancy. The genetic influence in the pathogenesis of celiac disease is indicated by its familial occurrence. Celiac disease does not develop unless a person has alleles that encode for human leukocyte antigen DQ2 or DQ8 proteins. The clinical picture of celiac disease has changed considerably during the past 30 years. Diarrhea, which was the presenting symptom in > 90% of celiac disease patients before 1981, is now the chief complaint in < 40%. In contrast, the increased frequency of atypical celiac disease presentations, including anemia and bone disease, is revealed by the widespread availability of serologic testing. An association between celiac disease and autoimmune disorders, such as type 1 diabetes, autoimmune thyroid disease, and Sjogren's syndrome, has been well documented. The tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin antibody and the endomysial immunoglobulin antibody are the most sensitive and specific serologic tests, respectively, for identifying individuals who need to undergo an intestinal biopsy. If the suspicion of celiac disease is high, intestinal biopsy should be pursued even if serologic tests are negative. The gold standard for the diagnosis of celiac disease is a small bowel biopsy showing villous atrophy. The treatment for celiac disease is lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). Despite the proven benefits of the GFD, it can be exceedingly difficult to completely avoid gluten-containing foods, and adherence to a GFD is estimated to be only 45% to 80%. 
20934289	Association of Budd-Chiari syndrome and celiac disease.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: An association between Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) and celiac disease (CD) is uncommon. The aims of our study were to investigate the etiology of BCS and to search for a particular HLA Ag pattern among patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: BCS diagnosis was based on Doppler ultrasound and CD diagnosis on duodenal biopsy, transglutaminase (TGAb) and gliadin antibodies (GAb). Patients were screened for prothrombotic disorders and seven had a PCR-SSO test for HLA genotypes. Patients were treated with anticoagulants and gluten-free diet. RESULTS: Nine patients were included; mean age 27 years (20-42); sex ratio (F/M) 2; mean follow-up duration 31 months (6-54). All patients had endoscopic and histological features of CD. GAb/TGAb were found in 78 % (n=7). Ag HLA found were HLA DQbeta1(*)02 (n=6) and DQbeta1(*)03 (n=3). Prothrombotic conditions identified were latent myeloproliferative disorder (n=1), protein C deficiency (n=1), probable factor V Leiden (n=1) and oral contraceptive use (n=1). No prothrombotic state could be identified in the five other patients. CONCLUSION: The BCS-CD association is relatively frequent in our country. Underlying prothrombotic conditions were absent in more than 50 % of cases, suggesting CD plays a role in the occurrence of thrombosis. HLA alleles found are strongly associated with CD, without any particular pattern for the BCS-CD association.
31866245	Most Patients With Celiac Disease on Gluten-Free Diets Consume Measurable Amounts of Gluten.	
28738401	Serum Vitamins and Minerals at Diagnosis and Follow-up in Children With Celiac Disease.	OBJECTIVES: Children with celiac disease (CD) may experience deficiencies of several micronutrients. The objectives of the present study were to determine the prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies in children with CD at diagnosis, 6 months, and 18 months after the start of a gluten-free diet (GFD), and examine any correlation between micronutrient deficiencies, serum tissue transglutaminase (TtG) immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibody titers, and the degree of mucosal damage at diagnosis. METHODS: Children (<17 years) with CD had their serum vitamins, minerals, and anti-TtG IgA antibodies measured at diagnosis, 6 and 18 months after starting a GFD. Histopathological changes of duodenal biopsies at diagnosis were documented using modified MARSH classification. RESULTS: The medical records of 140 children (mean age at diagnosis 7.8 +- 4.01 years, 87 girls [621%]) with CD were examined. At diagnosis, serum vitamin D was the most commonly deficient vitamin in 70% of children. Serum ferritin was subnormal in 34.5% with zinc in 18.6% children but only 12 (10.9%) children had iron deficiency anemia. There was no correlation between micronutrient deficiencies at diagnosis and serum TtG IgA antibody titers or the degree of villous atrophy. The majority of serum levels of measured micronutrients had normalized after 6 months of starting GFD except for vitamin D, which improved but remained subnormal. CONCLUSIONS: At diagnosis, most children with CD have vitamin D deficiency. The degree of micronutrient deficiencies does not correlate with the degree of villous atrophy or serum titers of anti-TtG IgA antibodies.
34597288	TaggScreening-detected positive serology for celiac disease: is there always mucosal damage?	
34456226	Celiac disease: clinical update.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review highlights literature from the past year and explores the impact on current understanding of celiac disease pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management. RECENT FINDINGS: In contrast to earlier clinical trials, recent data suggests that early gluten introduction may protect against the development of celiac disease. Celiac disease is underdiagnosed, associated with high burden of disease and linked to excess mortality risk, yet, there remains considerable uncertainty regarding the utility of mass screening in asymptomatic individuals. The gut microbiome is increasingly implicated in celiac disease pathogenesis, although the exact mechanism is undefined. Probiotics have been proposed as a disease-modifying option for celiac disease but most studies assessing efficacy are of low-quality. Patients with celiac disease do not appear to be at increased risk of contracting or developing adverse outcomes from COVID-19. Little is known about the pathogenesis of nonceliac gluten sensitivity; however, recent findings suggest an autoimmune basis for the condition. SUMMARY: Current understanding of celiac disease continues to advance, though significant knowledge gaps remain. Large, rigorous, prospectively designed studies are needed to further characterize celiac disease pathogenesis, management and therapeutic options.
22617359	Celiac disease and giardiasis:  a case report.	When investigating a patient with suspected celiac disease (CD), several other conditions must be considered, including potential infection with Giardia lamblia. Although giardiasis is rare, its histopathological and serological picture may resemble that of CD. We report the case of a young man with diabetes mellitus and a family history of CD referred to our hospital because of diarrhoea and weight loss. Investigation showed, among other factors, partial villous atrophy in duodenal biopsies and elevated immunoglobulin A antitissue transglutaminase antibodies. The patient was diagnosed with CD and recommended a gluten-free diet. At the same time, faecal tests were conducted, indicating the presence of G. lamblia. The patient was treated and improved, even after discontinuing the gluten-free diet. Subsequent follow-up after 6 months showed total regression of mucosal histopathology and a normal antitissue transglutaminase antibodies level.
25516687	Reversal of IgM deficiency following a gluten-free diet in seronegative celiac disease.	Selective IgM deficiency (sIGMD) is very rare; it may be associated with celiac disease (CD). We present the case of an 18-year-old man with sIGMD masking seronegative CD. Symptoms included abdominal pain, diarrhea and weight loss. Laboratory tests showed reduced IgM, DQ2-HLA and negative anti-transglutaminase. Villous atrophy and diffuse immature lymphocytes were observed at histology. Tissue transglutaminase mRNA mucosal levels showed a 6-fold increase. The patient was treated with a gluten-free diet (GFD) and six months later the symptoms had disappeared, the villous architecture was restored and mucosal tissue transglutaminase mRNA was comparable to that of healthy subjects. After 1 year of GFD, a complete restoration of normal IgM values was observed and duodenal biopsy showed a reduction of immature lymphocytes and normal appearance of mature immune cells.
30143412	Are the dietary habits of treated individuals with celiac disease adherent to a Mediterranean diet?	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The only treatment for celiac disease (CD) is strict, lifelong adherence to a gluten-free (GF) diet. To date, there are contrasting data concerning the nutritional adequacy of GF products and diet. There have been no studies that have assessed the adherence of individuals with CD to a Mediterranean diet (MD), a protective dietary regimen against major non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Therefore, we examined the adherence to an MD of a group of Italian individuals with CD and compared it with that of a healthy control group. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a cross-sectional study, a sample of individuals with CD and a group of healthy subjects were included. The dietary habits of all participants were recorded using a validated food frequency questionnaire, and the adherence to an MD was determined using the Italian Mediterranean Index. Typical Mediterranean food consumption was not significantly different between individuals with CD and the healthy participants, except for fruits (P = 0.017). However, individuals with CD consumed significantly higher amounts of potatoes (P = 0.003) and red and processed meat (P = 0.005) than healthy participants. The resulting mean Italian Mediterranean Index was significantly higher in healthy participants than in individuals with CD (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The results raise questions concerning the food choices of individuals with CD, suggesting the need of encouraging them to make better food choices more in line with an MD, which would improve their nutritional status and better protect them from NCDs at long term. PROTOCOL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov (ID NCT01975155) on November 4 2013.
38216646	Barriers at various levels of human ecosystem for maintaining adherence to gluten free diet in adult patients with celiac disease.	INTRODUCTION: While lifelong and strict adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD) is essential for the successful treatment of celiac disease (CeD), only 30-50% of patients are able to maintain a good adherence to GFD. We determined factors influencing the adherence to GFD at various ecological levels including intra-personal, inter-personal, organizational, community and system-based levels in adult patients with CeD. METHODS: A questionnaire to assess the adherence was developed and it was administered in the CeD clinic to patients with CeD on GFD for >1 year. Adherence to GFD was assessed in a subset of patients (n = 320) using Celiac Disease Adherence Test (CDAT). RESULTS: Overall, 978 patients [median age: 29 years; females: 592] with CeD on GFD were recruited. They reported many barriers to adherence to GFD including intra-personal barriers such as lack of knowledge about GFD (19%), inadequate financial resources (27.2%) and lack of self-motivation/confidence (55.3%); inter-personal barriers such as intake of gluten-containing food upon forceful insistence of friends/family (23.4%); organizational barriers such as high cost (70.8%) and non-availability of GF-food products (48.6%); community-based barriers like consumption of gluten-containing food at religious occasions/festivals (11.1%) and social occasions (27.2%); and system-based barriers such as non-referral to dietitian for counseling (21.9%). As per CDAT, 204 (63.7%), 73(22.8%) and 43(13.4%) patients had good, average, and poor adherence to GFD, respectively. On multivariable analysis, occasional consumption of gluten, non-availability of GF-food while dining out and coercing by family and friends for consumption of GC-food were found to have highest odds for poor adherence to GFD. CONCLUSIONS: Non-referral to a dietitian for counseling, irregular follow-up visits, unavailability of flour mill, non-supportive family/friends, high cost and limited availability of GF-food are the most common barriers to adherence to GFD. There is a need to create infrastructure and develop strategies to overcome these diverse barriers at various levels of ecosystem and thereby facilitate better adherence to GFD.
24296842	Drug absorption in celiac disease.	PURPOSE: Published evidence on established and theorized effects of celiac disease on drug absorption and pharmacokinetics is reviewed. SUMMARY: Patients with celiac disease develop a variety of gastric disorders requiring oral medications, but the impact of damage to intestinal villi and other celiac disease sequelae on drug absorption remains poorly understood. A review of the pertinent literature (English-language articles on research in adults published during the period 1970-August 2012) identified several reports of altered drug absorption mechanisms in patients with celiac disease, including accelerated or delayed gastric emptying, increased permeability of jejunal mucosa, changes in intraluminal pH, decreased intestinal surface area, and reduced intestinal cytochrome P-450 enzymes. A small number of published studies suggest that celiac disease may be associated with altered drug absorption, resulting in higher serum concentrations of propranolol, lower peak concentrations of acetaminophen and practolol, higher dosing requirements with levothyroxine, impaired or delayed absorption of certain antibiotics, and other pharmacokinetic effects with a potential impact on medication efficacy and toxicity. However, these studies involved very small patient samples and were poorly controlled, with some yielding contradictory results. More and larger pharmacokinetic studies in patients with celiac disease-especially studies of drugs that are dosed empirically or are not amenable to dosage adjustment according to vital signs or laboratory values-are needed. CONCLUSION: Given the sometimes conflicting data on drug absorption in the context of celiac disease, cautious medication selection, dosage adjustment, and monitoring for efficacy and potential adverse effects are advised.
28948465	Going Gluten Free: the History and Nutritional Implications of Today's Most Popular Diet.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The gluten-free diet (GFD) has become one of the most popular diets in modern history. Claims of improved health and increased energy fuel this popularity, though there is little evidence to substantiate these claims. The present review focuses on outlining known gluten-related disorders (GRD), discussing the GFD in the general population, exploring nutritional considerations, and providing advice for physicians in managing these patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Currently, about a quarter of the population reports keeping a GFD despite GRDs affecting less than half of these individuals. Reduced intake of calcium, B vitamins, and fiber as well as enhanced consumption of fat and simple carbohydrates has consistently been reported and needs to be continually addressed. Although a necessity in proper management of GRDs, unforeseen nutritional complications may develop in patients who are gluten free for which enhanced physician awareness is vital to achieving optimal patient care.
26887696	Transcultural adaptation and validation of the Celiac Dietary Adherence Test. A simple questionnaire to measure adherence to a gluten-free diet.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A gluten-free diet is to date the only treatment available to celiac disease sufferers. However, systematic reviews indicate that, depending on the method of evaluation used, only 42% to 91% of patients adhere to the diet strictly. Transculturally adapted tools that evaluate adherence beyond simple self-informed questions or invasive analyses are, therefore, of importance. The aim is to obtain a Spanish transcultural adaption and validation of Leffler's Celiac Dietary Adherence Test. METHODS: A two-stage observational transversal study: translation and back translation by four qualified translators followed by a validation stage in which the questionnaire was administered to 306 celiac disease patients aged between 12 and 72 years and resident in Aragon. Factorial structure, criteria validity and internal consistency were evaluated. RESULTS: The Spanish version maintained the 7 items in a 3-factor structure. Reliability was very high in all the questions answered and the floor and ceiling effects were very low (4.3% and 1%, respectively). The Spearman correlation with the self-efficacy and life quality scales and the self-informed question were statistically significant (p < 0.01). According to the questionnaire criteria, adherence was 72.3%. CONCLUSION: The Spanish version of the Celiac Dietary Adherence Test shows appropriate psychometric properties and is, therefore, suitable for studying adherence to a gluten-free diet in clinical and research environments.
32971511	Clinical characteristics of hospitalized and home isolated COVID-19 patients with type 1 diabetes.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To elucidate the clinical features of COVID-19 patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) under hospitalization and home isolation conditions. METHOD: This retrospective study was conducted among 32 patients with COVID-19 and T1D, who sought treatment at the Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia between May 01, 2020 and July 30, 2020. Patients data were extracted from electronic medical records. RESULTS: Of the total of 32 COVID-19 patients with T1D, 21.9% required hospitalization, while 78.1% underwent home isolation. Among the study population, 9.4% (3/32) were reported to have hypertension, 21.9% (7/32) had chronic pulmonary disease (CPD), 18.8% (6/32) had thyroid disorders, and 18.8% (6/32) had the celiac disease. Of the 32 studied patients, 68.8% (22/32) of them were reported as normal, while 28.1% (9/32) had chronic kidney disease (CKD) II and 3.1% (1/32) had end-stage renal failure. The most common symptoms observed among the hospitalized patients were nausea and vomiting (71.4%; 5/7), followed by fever (57.1%; 4/7), cough (42.8%; 3/7), sore throat (42.8%; 3/7), abdominal pain (42.8%; 3/7) and dyspnea (42.%; 3/7). The most common reasons for hospitalization were diabetic ketoacidosis (71.4%; 5/7) followed by bacterial pneumonia (14.3%; 1/7), fever (14.3%; 1/7), sore throat (14.3%; 1/7), severe hyperglycemia (14.3%; 1/7) and COVID-19 pneumonia (14.3%; 1/7). Except the severity of COVID-19 (p = 0.0001), none of the demographic and clinical parameters indicated statistically significant differences between patients requiring hospitalization and home isolation. CONCLUSION: Majority of the COVID-19 patients with T1D recovered with conservative treatment at home. Diabetic ketoacidosis was the most common reason for hospitalization.
33155859	ENT Manifestations of Celiac Disease: A Scholarly Review.	OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease is a common multisystemic autoimmune disorder. It is now increasingly recognized that it may present with extraintestinal manifestations which contribute to the difficulty in its diagnosis. The objective of this scholarly review was to examine the extraintestinal ENT manifestations of celiac disease and its pathophysiology and management, in order to highlight that some patients with celiac disease may present initially to the otolaryngologist. Improving awareness of celiac disease among otolaryngologists may aid in the correct diagnosis and correct management plan. METHODS: A literature review was conducted using the PubMed database to identify original articles related to celiac disease and ENT manifestations between the years 2000 and 2020. The search was performed using the search string: ("coeliac disease" OR "celiac disease") AND ("ENT manifestations" OR "hearing loss" OR "epistaxis" OR "nasal septal perforation" OR "obstructive sleep apnoea" OR "vertigo" OR "tonsillitis" OR "sinusitis"). Only articles written in English were reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 17 papers met the inclusion criteria. Extraintestinal ENT manifestations of celiac disease include sensorineural hearing loss, obstructive sleep apnea, nasal septal perforation, epistaxis, and vertigo with nystagmus. Sensorineural hearing loss, obstructive sleep apnea, nasal septal perforation, vertigo, and nystagmus are thought to result from immunologically mediated mechanisms, with intestinal malabsorption resulting in epistaxis. CONCLUSIONS: Celiac disease can cause extraintestinal ENT manifestations and requires a high index of suspicion from the otolaryngologist to diagnose and suitably manage. A gluten-free diet may result in sufficient symptom resolution for most manifestations. Sensorineural hearing loss due to celiac disease appears to be progressive and permanent and may require frequent audiological monitoring.
30149623	Quality of Life of Celiac Patients in Brazil: Questionnaire Translation, Cultural Adaptation and Validation.	(1) Background: Celiac disease (CD) is a common autoimmune disorder. The manifestations of the disease and the obligatory life-long gluten-free diet (GFD) are associated with the impairment of patients' quality of life. Therefore, the present study aimed to translate, culturally adapt and validate a celiac disease quality of life (CD-QoL) questionnaire and apply it to a representative number of Brazilian CD patients. (2) Methods: A cross-cultural Brazilian-Portuguese version of the CD-QoL was developed according to revised international guidelines. The questionnaire was administered to 450 celiac patients. The reliability, reproducibility and validity were studied. (3) Results: The Brazilian CD-QoL questionnaire presents valid measures of reproducibility and internal consistency. Early diagnosis is related to higher scores of Brazilian CD-QoL social, sub- and total scale. There was a positive correlation between higher education level and higher QoL. Individuals with partners tend to have a better emotional subscale of QoL. CD-patients who follow a strict GFD have highest QoL scale values. Men scored higher than women on the CD-QoL. All results were statistically significant except for the gastrointestinal subscale. (4) Conclusions: Brazilian CD-QoL allows comparative research between different celiac populations in the world. QoL research will help in the development of effective strategies to improve Brazilian celiac patients' quality of life.
23434875	Pediatric celiac disease, cryptogenic hypertransaminasemia, and autoimmune hepatitis.	OBJECTIVE: The association between celiac disease (CD) and liver disease in pediatrics is widely recognized, but its prevalence is unknown. This study aims to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the prevalence of CD in children with cryptogenic persistent hypertransaminasemia (HTS) or autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), and vice versa. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE/PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and MD Consult from 1977 to May 2012 for studies reporting either CD and HTS or AIH. Pooled prevalences with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and relative risk (RR) were calculated. RESULTS: Nine studies (2046 patients) were identified. Pooled prevalences of CD in children with mild, nonspecific cryptogenic persistent HTS and vice versa were 12.0% (95% CI 4.17-29.96) and 36.0% (95% CI 32.15-40.11), respectively. A gluten-free diet normalized transaminase levels in 77% to 100% of patients with CD within 4 to 8 months. Pooled prevalences of CD in children with AIH and vice versa were 6.3% (95% CI 3.87-11.73) and 1.4% (95% CI 0.84-2.15), respectively. The RR of HTS in children with CD versus the general population, and of CD in children with HTS was 6.55 (95% CI 5.65-7.60) and 11.59 (95% CI 3.80-35.33), respectively. The corresponding RR of AIH in children with CD was 188.54 (95% CI 92.23-385.43). The RR of CD in children with AIH was 6.63 (95% CI 3.86-11.40). CONCLUSIONS: CD is associated with elevated transaminase levels in about one-third of newly diagnosed children. Cryptogenic persistent HTS may signal gluten-dependent nonspecific mild hepatitis (12.0% of cases) or more rarely (6.3%) severe CD-related autoimmune hepatopathy. RRs confirm these trends in the considered associations.
35705069	Referral for Dietary Intervention in Celiac Disease Is Low among Gastroenterologists and Primary Care Providers.	BACKGROUND: Strict adherence to a gluten-free diet is the only known effective treatment for celiac disease currently. Multiple organizations recommend follow-up with a dietitian and guideline-directed management after diagnosis. Few studies have evaluated follow-up post diagnosis. However, these do not include a systematic process for monitoring dietary referral among celiac disease patients. We sought to evaluate and compare the frequency of early dietary referral and guideline-directed preventive care and management for celiac disease patients managed by gastroenterologists and primary care providers. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of celiac disease patients receiving care at a single tertiary care facility. Our primary outcome was to compare the frequency of dietary intervention between gastroenterologists and primary care providers in an outpatient setting after initial diagnosis. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine associated factors for referral for dietary intervention and recommended follow-up lab work. RESULTS: 261 patients were included in the study, 81.6% were followed by gastroenterologist and only 51% were seen by a dietitian. Patients following up with gastroenterologists had higher odds of referral for dietary intervention on multivariate analysis (OR 3.29, p value <0.003). Only 16% of all patients completed appropriate guideline-directed follow-up care. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary intervention and follow-up of preventive care lab work were low in celiac disease patients. There is an opportunity for further education of both primary care providers and gastroenterologists on the importance of early dietary referral and appropriate medical management at follow-up.
26979028	[CELIAC DISEASE].	Celiac disease is an inflammatory enteropathy, autoimmune-like, due to gluten intake in genetically predisposed persons with HLA-DQ2/DQ8 genotyping. Prevalence rates are approaching 1% of population in Europe and USA. Clinical expression of celiac disease is extremely various. Screening is based on detection of serum celiac antibodies and diagnosis is confirmed with duodenal biopsy. Treatment relies on gluten free diet (GFD) with eviction of wheat, barley and rye. GFD allows prevention of osteopenia, autoimmune diseases and malignant complications. The main cause of resistance to GFD because is its bad observance.
29243104	Skepticism Regarding Vaccine and Gluten-Free Food Safety Among Patients with Celiac Disease and Non-celiac Gluten Sensitivity.	BACKGROUND: There has been a marked increase in the adoption of the gluten-free (GF) diet. AIMS: To query individuals with celiac disease (CD) and non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) on their beliefs toward the health effects of gluten, and safety of vaccines and GF food products. METHODS: We distributed a Web-based survey to individuals with CD and NCGS on a CD center e-mail list. We used univariate and multivariate analysis to compare responses of respondents with CD and NCGS. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 27% (NCGS n = 217, CD n = 1291). Subjects with NCGS were more likely than those with CD to disagree with the statement that "vaccines are safe for people with celiac disease" (NCGS 41.3% vs. CD 26.4% (p < 0.0001), and were more likely to decline vaccination when offered (30.9 vs. 24.2%, p = 0.007). After adjusting for age and gender, NCGS subjects were more likely than CD subjects to avoid genetically modified (GMO) foods (aOR 2.30; 95% CI 1.71-3.10), eat only organic products (aOR 2.87; 95% CI 2.04-4.03), believe that the FDA is an unreliable source of information (aOR 1.82, 95% CI 1.26-2.64), and believe a GF diet improves energy and concentration (aOR 2.52; 95% CI 1.86-3.43). CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with NCGS were more likely than those with CD to have doubts about vaccine safety and believe in the value of non-GMO and organic foods. Our findings suggest that the lack of reliable information on gluten and its content in food and medications may reinforce beliefs that result in a detriment to public health.
22185370	Thrombopoietin-receptor agonists in haematological disorders: the Danish experience.	The objective of this study was to investigate the use of thrombopoietin-receptor agonists (TPO-ra) in patients with refractory primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) as well as off-label use of TPO-ra in Danish haematology departments. Hospital medical records from 32 of the 39 patients having received TPO-ra from 2009 to 1 May 2011 were available for data collection and included in the study. Of these patients, 15 received TPO-ra for refractory primary ITP, 7 for secondary ITP (chronic lymphatic leukaemia, systemic lupus erythematosus, Evans syndrome, human immunodeficiency virus and celiac disease) and 10 were treated for non-ITP (chemotherapy-induced, acute myeloid leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, hereditary spherocytosis and suspected chemically induced thrombocytopenia). Initial response to TPO-ra defined as platelet counts >30 x 10(9)/l after 4 weeks of treatment was found in 59% of primary ITP patients, 57% of patients with secondary ITP and 40% of patients with non-ITP. There were four deaths in the cohort, three of which were related to pre-existing medical conditions. Otherwise adverse effects were in general mild. This Danish retrospective registration study has demonstrated that in the off-protocol setting, the use of TPO-ra is associated with response rates largely similar to those seen in previous protocol-monitored studies and no new adverse events were reported.
23229860	Celiac disease: a challenging disease for pharmaceutical scientists.	Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by the ingestion of gluten-containing grains that affects ~1% of the white ethnic population. In the last decades, a rise in prevalence of CD has been observed that cannot be fully explained by improved diagnostics. Genetic predisposition greatly influences the susceptibility of individuals towards CD, though environmental factors also play a role. With no pharmacological treatments available, the only option to keep CD in remission is a strict and permanent exclusion of dietary gluten. Such a gluten-free diet is difficult to maintain because of gluten's omnipresence in food (e.g., additive in processed food). The development of adjuvant therapies which would permit the intake of small amounts of gluten would be desirable to improve the quality of life of patients on a gluten-free diet. Such therapies include gluten-degrading enzymes, polymeric binders, desensitizing vaccines, anti-inflammatory drugs, transglutaminase 2 inhibitors, and HLA-DQ2 blockers. However, many of these approaches pose pharmaceutical challenges with respect to drug formulation and stability, or application route and dosing interval. This perspective article discusses how pharmaceutical scientists may deal with these challenges and contribute to the implementation of novel therapeutic options for patients with CD.
34062843	Intracortical and Intercortical Motor Disinhibition to Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Newly Diagnosed Celiac Disease Patients.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) may present or be complicated by neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) probes brain excitability non-invasively, also preclinically. We previously demonstrated an intracortical motor disinhibition and hyperfacilitation in de novo CD patients, which revert back after a long-term gluten-free diet (GFD). In this cross-sectional study, we explored the interhemispheric excitability by transcallosal inhibition, which has never been investigated in CD. METHODS: A total of 15 right-handed de novo, neurologically asymptomatic, CD patients and 15 age-matched healthy controls were screened for cognitive and depressive symptoms to the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), respectively. TMS consisted of resting motor threshold, amplitude, latency, and duration of the motor evoked potentials, duration and latency of the contralateral silent period (cSP). Transcallosal inhibition was evaluated as duration and latency of the ipsilateral silent period (iSP). RESULTS: MoCA and HDRS scored significantly worse in patients. The iSP and cSP were significantly shorter in duration in patients, with a positive correlation between the MoCA and iSP. CONCLUSIONS: An intracortical and interhemispheric motor disinhibition was observed in CD, suggesting the involvement of GABA-mediated cortical and callosal circuitries. Further studies correlating clinical, TMS, and neuroimaging data are needed.
23161318	Clinical remission after strict gluten-free diet in a patient with celiac disease, advanced cryptogenic cirrhosis and splenic atrophy.	
23962034	An autoimmune disease refractory to immunosuppressive regimens: celiac disease diagnosed long after liver transplantation.	CD is defined as T-lymphocyte-mediated gluten sensitivity. Although CD is known to affect the small intestine, it is nonetheless a multisystem disorder. Liver involvement in CD may vary from isolated hypertransaminasemia to cirrhosis. Because CD is an inappropriate immune response to gluten proteins, strict gluten-free diet is the principal therapy, along with management of liver dysfunction. In patients who fail to respond to a gluten-free diet, immunosuppressive drugs may improve intestinal inflammatory activity in untreated CD. The present case report is of a 25-yr-old woman with diarrhea lasting several weeks. The patient had received a liver transplant 13 yr earlier, and presented with cryptogenic cirrhosis diagnosed as CD. This appears to be the first case of its kind in which a pediatric long-term liver transplant patient presents with diarrhea eventually diagnosed as CD whose diet included gluten, and who was treated by an immunosuppressive drug regimen. Because of the normalization of CD-related antibodies in the post-transplantation period without gluten restriction, CD should be part of a list of diagnostic possibilities in liver transplant patients presenting with diarrhea of unknown etiology. 
30375355	Rheumatologic manifestations in celiac disease: what should we remember?	
24691402	Mucosal healing in children with treated celiac disease.	OBJECTIVES: Limited data suggest complete mucosal healing in treated children with celiac disease (CD), but recent data from adult endoscopic biopsies have shown substantial numbers with persistent mucosal injury. We aimed to assess the rate of mucosal healing and indications for repeat small bowel (SB) biopsy in children with CD. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed records of children (ages 1-18 years) with CD who underwent a second SB biopsy. All of the children were seen at Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN) from January 1997 through June 2013. RESULTS: Forty children were identified (14 boys); average age at diagnosis was 8.5 years. Indications for second SB biopsy were abdominal pain (n = 20), diarrhea (n = 7), constipation (n = 5), non-celiac-related concern (n = 2), follow-up (n = 5), and persistent serology (n = 1). Average time between biopsies was 24 months (range 4-120 months). Histology on the second biopsy showed complete healing (n = 25), intraepithelial lymphocytes (n = 9), and persistent villous atrophy (n = 6). Of these, 3 patients had partial villous atrophy and 3 had with complete villous atrophy. Persistent villous atrophy was observed in 2 of 20 patients with abdominal pain and 1 of 7 with diarrhea. All of the patients with persistent constipation (n = 5) had complete resolution. CONCLUSIONS: Mucosal healing in children with CD may not be complete as previously assumed. Abdominal pain was the most common indication for repeating the SB biopsy. Persistence of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and constipation was poorly associated with persistence of mucosal injury.
22649918	Gluten and celiac disease--an immunological perspective.	Gluten, a complex protein group in wheat, rye, and barley, causes celiac disease (CD), an autoimmune enteropathy of the small intestine, in genetically susceptible individuals. CD affects about 1% of the general population and causes significant health problems. Adverse inflammatory reactions to gluten are mediated by inappropriate T-cell activation leading to severe damage of the gastrointestinal mucosa, causing atrophy of absorptive surface villi. Gluten peptides bind to the chemokine receptor, CXCR3, and induce release of zonulin, which mediates tight-junction disassembly and subsequent increase in intestinal permeability. Proinflammatory cytokine IL-15 also contributes to the pathology of CD, by driving the expansion of intra-epithelial lymphocytes that damage the epithelium and promote the onset of T-cell lymphomas. There is no cure or treatment for CD, except for avoiding dietary gluten. Current gluten thresholds for food labeling have been established based on the available analytical methods, which show variation in gluten detection and quantification. Also, the clinical heterogeneity of celiac patients poses difficulty in defining clinically acceptable gluten thresholds in gluten-free foods. Presently, there is no bioassay available to measure gluten-induced immunobiological responses. This review focuses on various aspects of CD, and the importance of gluten thresholds and reference material from an immunological perspective.
35016615	The effect of group-based education on gastrointestinal symptoms and quality of life in patients with celiac disease: randomized controlled clinical trial.	BACKGROUND: In this trial, we investigated the effect of a group-based education program on gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and quality of life (QOL) in patients with celiac disease (CD). METHOD: In the present study, 130 patients with CD who were on a GFD for at least 3 months, randomly assigned to receive group-based education (n = 66) or routine education in the celiac clinic (n = 64) for 3 months. We assessed gastrointestinal symptoms and quality of life using the gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (GSRS) questionnaire and SF-36 questionnaire at baseline and 3 months after interventions. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 37.57 +- 9.59 years. There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding the baseline values. Results showed that the mean score of total GSRS score in the intervention group was significantly lower compared with the control group 3 months post-intervention (p = 0.04). Also, there was a significant difference in the mean score of SF-36 between the two groups 3 months post-intervention (p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Results showed that group-based education was an effective intervention in patients with celiac disease to improve gastrointestinal symptoms and quality of life. Trial registration IRCT code: IRCT20080904001197N21; registration date: 5/23/2019.
37004970	Effectiveness of Hepatitis B Vaccination for Patients With Inflammatory Bowel and Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Guidelines recommend measuring antibody (Ab) titers to hepatitis B virus (HBV) after vaccination for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or celiac disease (CD) ("IBD/CD patients") and revaccinating when titers are low. Few data, however, support this recommendation. We aimed to compare effectiveness of HBV vaccination (immunity and infection rates) for IBD/CD patients vs matched referents. METHODS: Using the Rochester Epidemiology Project, we performed a retrospective cohort study of patients first diagnosed with IBD/CD (index date) while residing in Olmsted County, Minnesota, from January 1, 2000, through December 31, 2019. HBV screening results were obtained from health records. RESULTS: In 1,264 incident cases of IBD/CD, only 6 HBV infections were diagnosed before the index date. A total of 351 IBD/CD cases had documented receipt of 2 or more HBV vaccines before their index date and had hepatitis B surface antigen Ab (anti-HBs) titers measured after their index date. The proportion of patients with HBV-protective titers (>=10 mIU/mL) decreased with time before plateauing, with protective-titer rates of 45% at 5 up to 10 years and 41% at 15 up to 20 years after the last HBV vaccination. The proportion of referents with protective titers also decreased with time and was consistently higher than IBD/CD patients' levels within 15 years after the last HBV vaccination. However, no new HBV infection developed in any of 1,258 IBD/CD patients during a median follow-up of 9.4 (IQR, 5.0-14.1) years. CONCLUSIONS: Routine testing of anti-HBs titers may not be indicated for fully vaccinated IBD/CD patients. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings in other settings and populations.
25581556	Celiac is a social disease: family challenges and strategies.	Celiac disease is the most common autoimmune inherited disorder in the United States, affecting approximately 1% of the population. Little research exists on the impact of family processes on adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD), the only treatment for celiac disease. The objective of this qualitative study was to examine the barriers that families with a celiac child face and the strategies they use to adhere to the recommended diet. In-depth interviews were conducted with 10 families with a child between the ages of 6 and 12 diagnosed with celiac disease. Grounded theory and narrative analysis were used to analyze interview transcripts. Social isolation and misunderstandings about celiac disease and the GFD emerged as the most significant barriers to diet adherence including the reproduction of traditional gender relations among parents. Diet adherence facilitators included various types of institutional and societal support and idiosyncratic family arrangements. Successful diet adherence strategies used by families included planning ahead and taking their own food to social functions. Family processes play a critical role in GFD adherence. Implications for health care clinicians working with families with a child with celiac disease are discussed.
31082840	Promotion of Testing for Celiac Disease and the Gluten-Free Diet Among Complementary and Alternative Medicine Practitioners.	INTRODUCTION: We identified the frequency and assessed the validity of marketing claims made by American chiropractors, naturopaths, homeopaths, acupuncturists, and integrative medicine practitioners relating to the diagnosis and treatment of celiac disease and nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), both of which have increased in prevalence in recent years. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study analyzing websites of practitioners from 10 cities in the United States and analyzed the websites for any mention of celiac or NCGS as well as specific claims of ability to diagnose, ability to treat, and treatment efficacy. We classified treatments promoted as true, false, or unproven, as assessed independently by 2 authors. RESULTS: Of 500 clinics identified, 178 (35.6%) made a claim regarding celiac disease, NCGS, or a gluten-free diet. Naturopath clinic websites have the highest rates of advertising at least one of diagnosis, treatment, or efficacy for celiac disease (40%), followed by integrative medicine clinics (36%), homeopaths (20%), acupuncturists (14%), and chiropractors (12%). Integrative medicine clinics have the highest rates of advertising at least one of diagnosis, treatment, or efficacy for NCGS (45%), followed by naturopaths (37%), homeopaths (14%), chiropractors (14%), and acupuncturists (10%). A geographic analysis yielded no significant variation in marketing rates among clinics from different cities. Of 232 marketing claims made by these complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) clinic websites, 138 (59.5%) were either false or unproven. DISCUSSION: A significant number of CAM clinics advertise diagnostic techniques or treatments for celiac disease or NCGS. Many claims are either false or unproven, thus warranting a need for increased regulation of CAM advertising to protect the public.
24842303	Prevalence of celiac disease in cirrhosis and outcome of cirrhosis on a gluten free diet: a prospective study.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Current consensus suggests CD to be a multi-systemic disease that could affect any organ system including the liver. It remains under-diagnosed in the US and its prevalence and management in cirrhotic patients has not been studied. Our aim was (1) to estimate the prevalence of CD in cirrhosis, (2) to characterize cirrhotic patients with abnormal celiac serology and normal small bowel biopsy and (3) to evaluate the effect of a GFD on the liver. METHODS: A total of 204 consecutive patients with biopsy proven cirrhosis scheduled for an upper endoscopy (EGD) to assess and treat gastro-esophageal varices (GEV) at the Cleveland Clinic between 5/1/2008 and 5/30/2010 were enrolled in the study and followed for 2 years. RESULTS: CD affects 2.5% of cirrhotic patients and more than twice the prevalence in the general population. Abnormal EMA >1/10 and high hTTG levels >20 IU can be used to diagnose CD in cirrhosis. Sensitivities and specificities are 100% for EMA and 80% and 94% for hTTG, respectively. After a GFD, patients with CD showed a return to normal levels of their celiac serology, small bowel biopsy and liver enzyme abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: CD is at least twice more common in cirrhotic patients than in the general population and GFD improves liver tests. CD can occur coincidentally with other liver disorders and screening may be warranted during the evaluation of patients with cirrhosis. Abnormal EMA and high hTTG levels can be used to diagnose CD in cirrhosis.
24555425	Italian family paediatricians' approach and management of celiac disease: a cross-sectional study in Puglia Region, 2012.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic autoimmune illness of the small intestine triggered by gluten consumption in genetically predisposed individuals. CD presentation is not limited to the gastrointestinal tract and it is still under-diagnosed. Complete resolution of clinical manifestations follows if a gluten-free diet is adopted. In western countries, CD prevalence is approximately 1%. Age of onset is often between 6 months and 7 years.We assessed the approach to diagnosis and management of celiac patients by the paediatricians in Puglia Region, Italy. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey among the 589 Apulian Family Paediatricians (FPs) during January 2011-January 2012 using a self-administered web-based standardized questionnaire including self-assessment of their knowledge, diagnostic path and type of management they would follow for CD, clinical information on their celiac patients. We assessed associations among the explored variables by defining double-entry contingency tables and calculating Odds Ratio (OR) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs). RESULTS: The 218 (37%) FPs participating in the study reported 1,020 CD patients (representing approximately 1% of the child population covered by the enrolled FPs). Of them, 55% were female; 45% were aged 5-10 years. Weight loss and stunting were the main reported symptoms at diagnosis (41%). The majority (98%) of FPs requested anti-transglutaminase antibody (tTG-Ab) titres for CD diagnosis. Approximately 78% of FPs recommended gluten introduction in the diet of infants at the age of 6 months; 12% and 8% recommended introduction of gluten before and after 6 months of age respectively.The degree of knowledge for either CD diagnosis making process or CD related diseases was medium/high in 97% and 82% of the participating FPs respectively. FPs (83%) who had a medium or high degree of knowledge of CD patients' diet were more likely to experience low or no difficulty in providing their patients with dietary advices (OR:5.5; 95%CI:1.7-17.5). CONCLUSIONS: Apulian FPs report a good degree of knowledge of CD, its diagnosis and its management. We will diffuse results and recommendations to all paediatricians in the Region. Actions aiming to continued education on CD in medical under and postgraduate trainings are crucial to prevent under-diagnosis.
24053854	Influence of Psyllium, sugar beet fibre and water on gluten-free dough properties and bread quality.	Celiac patients generally have a low intake of protein and fibre attributed to their gluten-free (GF) diet. To satisfy the increasing demand for healthier products, this research focused on the effects of the supplementation of Psyllium (P) and sugar beet fibre (SB) on the mixing and leavening behaviour of gluten-free doughs. Four doughs, having different consistencies that made them suitable to be poured into moulds or to be shaped, and their corresponding breads were evaluated. The results obtained suggested that a lower consistency is preferred to assure good dough performances during leavening, in particular when ingredients having a high water affinity are included into the recipe. Both P and SB improved the workability of the doughs, but P played a central role on GF bread development, thanks to its film forming ability, and evidenced a more effective antistaling effect, thanks to its high water binding capacity. 
36503568	Malignant complications of celiac disease: a case series and review of the literature.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. Diagnosis is based on evaluating specific autoantibodies and histopathologic findings of duodenal biopsy specimens. The only therapy for celiac disease is a gluten-free diet. Celiac disease can be complicated by malnutrition, other autoimmune diseases, refractoriness to treatment, and gastrointestinal tumors. This article presents seven cases of malignancies in patients with celiac disease. Its objective is to raise awareness of the malignant complications of celiac disease, leading to earlier diagnosis and improved outcomes. CASE PRESENTATION: Seven cases of malignant complications of celiac disease occurred among 190 patients followed at the Department of Internal Medicine and Gastroenterology, University Hospital Brno from 2014 to 2021. We describe these cases and the presentation, diagnostic process, course, management, and outcomes for each, along with proposed potential risk factors of malignant complications. There was one Caucasian man who was 70 years old and six Caucasian women who were 36, 46, 48, 55, 73, and 82 years old in our cohort. Of the seven cases of malignancies in our cohort, four patients were diagnosed with small bowel adenocarcinoma, one with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, one with carcinoma of the tongue, and one with colorectal carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: Malignancies occurred in 3.7% of patients followed up for celiac disease. Awareness of the malignant complications of celiac disease, risk factors, presentation, and disease course could lead to earlier diagnosis and improved outcomes.
32239378	Characteristics and Maternal-Fetal Outcomes of Pregnant Women Without Celiac Disease Who Avoid Gluten.	BACKGROUND: Gluten avoidance among patients without celiac disease has become increasingly popular, especially among young and female demographics; however, no research has explored gluten avoidance during pregnancy, when nutrition is particularly important. AIMS: To determine whether avoiding gluten in pregnancy is associated with any medical, obstetric, or neonatal characteristics. METHODS: In this single-center retrospective cohort study, we identified women with singleton pregnancies who avoid gluten based on antenatal intake questionnaire responses and inpatient dietary orders, excluding those with celiac disease. Certain demographic, medical, obstetric, and neonatal characteristics were compared to matched controls who do not avoid gluten. RESULTS: From July 1, 2011 to July 1, 2019, 138 pregnant women who avoid gluten were admitted for delivery of singleton gestations. Compared to controls, gluten-avoidant women had fewer prior pregnancies (p = 0.005), deliveries (p < 0.0005), and living children (p < 0.0005), higher rates of hypothyroidism (OR = 3.22; p = 0.001) and irritable bowel syndrome (OR = 6.00; p = 0.019), higher second trimester hemoglobin (p = 0.018), and lower body mass index at delivery (p = 0.045). Groups did not differ in any obstetric or fetal characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Gluten avoidance in pregnancy is common and, in women without celiac disease, is associated with higher rates of hypothyroidism and irritable bowel syndrome, fewer pregnancies, term births, and living children, and lower peripartum BMI, but is not associated with any obstetric or neonatal comorbidities. Avoiding gluten does not appear to adversely affect maternal or fetal health, but reasons for gluten avoidance, as well as long-term maternal and pediatric outcomes after gluten avoidance in pregnancy, warrant further study.
27087556	Novel Monoclonal Antibody-Based Immunodiagnostic Assay for Rapid Detection of Deamidated Gluten Residues.	Gluten derived from wheat and related Triticeae can induce gluten sensitivity as well as celiac disease. Consequently, gluten content in foods labeled "gluten-free" is regulated. Determination of potential contamination in such foods is achieved using immunoassays based on monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that recognize specific epitopes present in gluten. However, food-processing measures can affect epitope recognition. In particular, preparation of wheat protein isolate through deamidation of glutamine residues significantly limits the ability of commercial gluten testing kits in their ability to recognize gluten. Adding to this concern, evidence suggests that deamidated gluten imparts more pathogenic potential in celiac disease than native gluten. To address the heightened need for antibody-based tools that can recognize deamidated gluten, we have generated a novel mAb, 2B9, and subsequently developed it as a rapid lateral flow immunoassay. Herein, we report the ability of the 2B9-based lateral flow device (LFD) to detect gluten from wheat, barley, and rye and deamidated gluten down to 2 ppm in food as well as its performance in food testing. 
28573725	Effects of cellulose derivative hydrocolloids on pasting, viscoelastic, and morphological characteristics of rice starch gel.	Effects of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) on the pasting, viscoelastic, and morphological properties of rice starch gel were studied. The addition of CMC increased the peak and trough viscosities, while decreased the final and setback viscosities of rice starch. The peak and trough viscosities of rice starch gel were only little affected by the addition of HPMC. The dynamic viscoelastic result showed that the addition of CMC significantly increased the values of storage modulus (G') and loss modulus (G''), while reduced the value of tandelta as compared to the control sample. Only a small increase in values of G' and G'' was observed in the case of HPMC. The rice starch gel with CMC addition exhibited higher resistances to the stress and produced a stronger gel network. The creep recovery data were well fitted by a four-element Burger's model. Furthermore, the morphological characteristics were in agreement with the finding of rheological results. It was concluded that the addition of CMC and HPMC modified the rheology of rice starch gel in different ways and interacted under different models based on their molecular structures. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Gluten-free foods such as rice cake are essential for people who suffer from celiac disease which is a digestive disorder caused by the consumption of grains containing gluten. The use of CMC and HPMC represents the most widespread approach used to mimic gluten in the manufacture of gluten-free breads based on rice starch, due to their structure-building and water-binding properties. Therefore, it is necessary and crucial to investigate the physical-chemical properties such as pasting and rheological properties of the rice starch with these hydrocolloids. In addition, a better understanding of the interactions of CMC and HPMC on the rice starch could provide additional tools for selection of gluten free recipes with improved rheological and textural properties.
23083993	Celiac disease in the developing world.	The prevalence of celiac disease (CD) in many developing countries is similar to that of developed areas, in both low- and high-risk groups. The disorder is underestimated because of lack of disease awareness. CD is strongly associated with HLA-DQ2 in developing countries. Clinical presentation may be characterized by chronic diarrhea, anemia, stunting and increased mortality. Few studies have addressed atypical or silent CD. Diagnosis is initially made by serologic tests and is confirmed by small intestinal biopsies. In developing countries the adherence to the treatment is still difficult because of poor availability of dedicated gluten-free food.
38716937	Did diet compliance and remission reduce oxidative stress in celiac patients?	OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the effect of remission status on thiol-disulfide homeostasis in celiac patients and thus to indirectly determine the effect of oxidative stress and inflammation caused by non-compliance with the diet. METHODS: Between February 2019 and December 2021, 117 patients diagnosed with celiac disease were included in this prospective randomized and controlled study. In addition to routine tests of celiac patients, thiol and disulfide measurements were made from the blood both at the beginning of the study and at the end of the first year. RESULTS: While 52 of the patients (44.4%) were in remission, 65 patients (55.6%) were not. There was an evident increase in native thiol levels of the patients who were initially not in remission but went into at the end of the first year (347.4+-46.7 mumol/L vs. 365.3+-44.0 mumol/L; p=0.001). Mean plasma disulfide levels of patients with celiac going into remission became reduced in the first year from the level of 14.5+-5.1 mumol/L down to 8.9+-4.2 mumol/L (p<0.001). In celiac patients who entered remission, disulfide and anti-tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin A levels decreased in a correlation (r=0.526; p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Not being in remission in celiac disease leads to increased oxidative stress, and thiol-disulfide homeostasis is an indirect indicator of this. Additionally, providing remission in celiac patients reduces oxidative stress.
30835989	Pediatric Celiac Disease - A Review.	Our understanding of celiac disease is rapidly expanding. Previously thought to be a rare food intolerance, celiac disease is now recognized as a multifactorial autoimmune disorder with a vast array of presentations. Symptoms range from classic diarrhea, weight loss, and abdominal pain to constipation and extra-intestinal manifestations including anemia, elevated transaminase levels, osteoporosis, or aphthous stomatitis. Some cases are "silent" with no apparent symptoms at all. Although endoscopic biopsy and histology findings remain the gold standard for confirmatory diagnosis, serologic testing options continue to advance. Tissue-transglutaminase (tTG) IgA antibody levels alone have shown high sensitivity and specificity in patients over 2 years of age. The mainstay of treatment remains strict lifetime adherence to a gluten-free diet. Further discussion on the prevalence, pathogenesis, presentation, testing, and management of celiac disease will follow.
21282953	Follow-up of children with celiac disease - lost in translation?	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a prevalent condition with a broad spectrum of presentations requiring a lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD). Our aims were to examine the presentation and adherence to a GFD as well as the adequacy of follow-up of children diagnosed with CD at a tertiary referral center. METHODS: A retrospective electronic chart review of pediatric patients suspected of CD (n = 581) who were seen at our institute between January 1999 and December 2008 was performed. RESULTS: 387 children were diagnosed with CD (F/M ratio of 1.54, median age: 6.25 years). Presenting symptoms were iron deficiency anemia (n = 82, 34%), short stature (n = 59, 24.5%) and abdominal pain (n = 59, 24.5%). In 63 patients (16.3%) an associated autoimmune disease was recorded. Only 42.7% of the patients (165/387) had regular out-patient gastroenterologist visits; 22% (86/387) were followed by their primary care physician. Over 35% (136/387) were completely lost to follow-up. Negative serology on follow-up was present in 91% of the CD patients(150/165) followed at our center in comparison to 70% (60/86) in those followed up by their primary physician (p = 0.0002). CONCLUSIONS: At least in our referral center, follow-up of children diagnosed with CD is far from satisfactory. Initiatives aimed at improving adherence to regular follow-up are needed as this intervention is associated with a significant increase in patient compliance with a long-term GFD.

21695401	Prodromal irritable bowel syndrome may be responsible for delays in diagnosis in patients presenting with unrecognized Crohn's disease and celiac disease, but not ulcerative colitis.	INTRODUCTION: We aimed to determine the prevalence and duration of prodromal periods in patients with celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis). Furthermore, we explored to what extent vague abdominal symptoms consistent with both disorders were attributed to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and if the presence of prodromal IBS (P-IBS) had an impact on prodrome duration. METHODS: In the study, 683 biopsy-proven patients (celiac n = 225, ulcerative colitis n = 228, Crohn's disease n = 230) completed a postal survey including an assessment of prodromal periods and IBS symptoms during both the prodrome and at present (achieved by completion of the ROME II criteria). Results were compared to age/sex-matched controls (n = 348). RESULTS: Crohn's disease patients had the highest prevalence of prodromes (94%) in comparison to ulcerative colitis (48%) and celiac disease (44%). However, Crohn's disease patients have the lowest prevalence of P-IBS (29%) in comparison to ulcerative colitis (38%) and celiac disease (67%). Prodrome duration in patients with P-IBS Crohn's disease was 4 years in comparison to 2 years without (p = 0.018). Prodrome duration in P-IBS celiac disease was 10 years in comparison to 7 years without (p = 0.046). Prodrome duration in patients with ulcerative colitis was not affected by P-IBS (p >= 0.05). Age and sex were not confounding factors. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to make direct comparisons of prodrome periods between celiac disease and IBD. Prodrome duration in celiac disease is significantly longer and more often characterized by P-IBS than IBD. In celiac disease and CD, P-IBS increases prodrome duration. This may represent a failure to understand the overlap between IBS and celiac disease/IBD.
33053456	Symptoms of gluten ingestion in patients with non-celiac gluten sensitivity: A randomized clinical trial.	OBJECTIVES: Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is the presence of symptoms induced by gluten and relieved by a gluten-free diet (GFD) in patients without celiac disease or wheat allergy. Studies are mixed as to whether gluten is the main symptom trigger in patients with NCGS. Gluten immunogenic peptides (GIPs) in stool and urine are novel methods to monitor GFD compliance. Few studies have investigated their use in patients with NCGS. The aim of this study was to assess whether patients with NCGS have increased symptoms with gluten ingestion and to assess compliance with the GFD using stool and urine GIPs. METHOD: This was a prospective, randomized, double-blinded crossover trial evaluating symptoms in patients with NCGS. Thirty patients with NCGS and 43 healthy controls were placed on a GFD. Patients received 0.5 or 2 g/d of gluten for 7 d each. The remaining weeks, they received placebo for a total of 4 wk. Symptoms were evaluated weekly using the Celiac Symptom Index (CSI). Urine and stool samples were collected weekly and measured for the detection of GIPs to detect exposure to gluten. RESULTS: There was no difference in symptom severity within the NCGS group whether receiving placebo or gluten (32.69 versus 31.54, P = 0.64). Patients with NCGS had significantly higher CSI scores at baseline than healthy controls. Patients with NCGS were less likely to have stool and urine GIPs than healthy patients. CONCLUSION: Patients with NCGS were more adherent to the GFD based on stool and urine GIP results. Patients with NCGS had increased symptom severity at baseline compared with healthy controls. Neither group had significantly increased symptoms after ingestion of gluten.
31569610	Measuring Quality of Life in Parents or Caregivers of Children and Adolescents with Celiac Disease: Development and Content Validation of the Questionnaire.	Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder triggered by the ingestion of gluten and affects approximately 1% of the global population. Currently, the only treatment available is lifelong strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). Chronic diseases such as CD affect patients and their family members' quality of life (QoL); particularly parents and caregivers who play an essential role in the child's care and treatment. A higher level of psychological distress has been found in the parents of children with chronic ailments due to limited control over the child's daily activities and the child's illness. In this context, the validation of a specific questionnaire of QoL is a valuable tool to evaluate the difficulties faced by parents or caregivers of children with this chronic illness. A specific questionnaire for this population can elucidate the reasons for stress in their daily lives as well as the physical, mental, emotional, and social impact caused by CD. Therefore, this study aimed to develop and validate a specific questionnaire to evaluate the QoL of parents and caregivers of children and adolescents with CD. Overall results showed that a higher family income resulted in a higher score of the worries domain. In addition, having another illness besides CD decreased the QoL (except in the worries domain). The other variables studied did not present a statistically significant impact on the QoL, which was shown to be low in all aspects. Knowledge of the QoL is important to help implement effective strategies to improve celiac patients' quality of life and reduce their physical, emotional, and social burden.
31789773	The Impact of Celiac Disease on Caregivers' Well-being: An Integrative Review.	OBJECTIVES: A diagnosis of celiac disease (CD) requires individuals to adopt a strict gluten-free diet. As children with CD must rely on their caregivers for guidance and support with managing the gluten-free diet, CD may challenge the caregiver's emotional and social well-being. The primary objective of this mixed-methods systematic review was to synthesize research investigating the impact of CD on caregiver's well-being. METHODS: Five databases were systematically searched from 1990 to 2018 to identify all empirical studies that assessed well-being in caregivers of children (0-18 years) with CD. Qualitative and quantitative data were extracted separately before being integrated to explore key themes across the studies. RESULTS: Twelve studies were identified that explored the well-being of caregivers of children with CD (3 qualitative, 9 quantitative), reporting on 665 caregivers. The quality of evidence was limited across studies. Synthesis of results revealed 3 themes (Caregiver Responsibility, Caregiver Well-Being and Concern for Child's Health, Implications for the Family) describing the impact of a child with CD on caregiver well-being. CONCLUSIONS: Caregivers of children with CD may experience difficulties that impact their well-being; specific difficulties identified included the impact of caregivers' social activities, finances, and anxiety. The findings detailed in this review point toward factors that may guide health care personnel to provide support for the caregivers of children with CD.

29699403	Ten years of follow-up of the Spanish cohort of the European PreventCD study: the lessons learned.	AIM: to evaluate the influence of gluten consumption on celiac disease development and to describe its natural history in the Spanish cohort of the European PreventCD study. METHODS: prospective multi-center double blind study of 225 children that were followed up from birth. All cases were HLA-DQ2/HLA-DQ8 positive with a 1st degree relative with celiac disease and were followed up in three centers from Madrid, Reus and Valencia. Gluten intake was determined between four and ten months according to the protocol. Gluten intake was ad libitum between eleven and 36 months and was prospectively quantified by means of dietary records. Clinical visits and specific antibody analysis for celiac disease were performed periodically. RESULTS: twenty-six cases were diagnosed, all had a positive biopsy and serology; 21 had gastrointestinal symptoms and five were asymptomatic. In addition, 2,565 food records were analyzed and statistically significant differences (p < 0.001) were found with regard to gluten consumption among the three centers, although not between celiac and non-celiac children (p = 0.025). The HLA-DQ2.5/DQ2.5 and DQ2.5/DQ2.2 genotypes had a relative risk of 4.7 (95% CI: 0.80-27.55; p = 0.08), which was higher than for the rest of genotypes. Female gender also had a relative risk that was five times higher than that for males. CONCLUSIONS: the amount of gluten intake between 11 and 36 months or the duration of breast feeding were not risk factors for the development of CD in the Spanish population. The HLA genotype and gender were the most relevant associated factors. In this at-risk group, the disease presented before two years of age in the majority of the cases with a weak clinical expression.

30714395	Optimization of hot-air drying conditions for cassava flour for its application in gluten-free pasta formulation.	The design and development of gluten-free foods requires a comprehensive understanding of the behavior of the raw materials to attain the same cooking and nutritional quality as gluten-based food. The objective of this study was to determine the optimal hot-air drying conditions for elaboration of cassava flour to be used in a gluten-free pasta formulation. The results showed that the operational conditions to minimize the hot-air drying time (57 min) to produce cassava flour with higher water holding capacity was 57 C at 3 m/s. Then, the optimal formulation for the pasta was found to be cassava (26 g/100 g), amaranth flour (12 g/100 g), and carboxymethyl cellulose (0.23 g/100 g), which maximized the Aw (0.160), moisture content (3.10 g/100 g), hardness (5.02 N), and protein content (9.30 g/100 g), and it is used for the sensorial analysis, which showed that an earthy taste was the main problem with consumer satisfaction.
29529159	Determination of gluten consumption in celiac disease patients on a gluten-free diet.	Background: Celiac disease (CD) patients adhering to a gluten-free diet (GFD) are exposed frequently to low levels of gluten that contribute to symptoms and persistent intestinal histologic damage. Objective: We analyzed prior clinical data to determine how much gluten is accidentally consumed while on a GFD. The aim was to understand the range of gluten consumption for a wide distribution of CD patients. Design: A meta-analysis was conducted on data from 2 different clinical programs: 1) measurements of gluten in stool and urine in CD and non-CD populations; and 2) analysis of data from trials for the investigational therapeutic latiglutenase. The stool and urine studies included controlled gluten challenges. A calibration factor was applied that allowed normal ingestion of gluten to be computed from the urine and stool measurements. From the latiglutenase trial data, a determination of gluten consumption was made by estimating how much gluten was eliminated from patients' diets due to a trial effect that led to improved histology even in the placebo group. Results: The average inadvertent exposure to gluten by CD individuals on a GFD was estimated to be ~150-400 (mean) and ~100-150 (median) mg/d using the stool test and ~300-400 (mean) and ~150 (median) mg/d using the urine test. The analyses of the latiglutenase data for CD individuals with moderate to severe symptoms indicate that patients ingested significantly >200 mg/d of gluten. Conclusions: These surrogate biomarkers of gluten ingestion indicate that many individuals following a GFD regularly consume sufficient gluten to trigger symptoms and perpetuate intestinal histologic damage.
23054089	Meta-analysis of oro-cecal transit time in fasting subjects.	PURPOSE: Computer simulations are utilized during pharmaceutical development in order to design appropriate formulation based on the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) and physicochemical properties of target compounds, so that adequate prescriptions are offered to patients. Oro-cecal transit time (OCTT) is an important factor affecting these simulations because the absorption of drug that administered orally and the resultant pharmacokinetic profile are expressed as a function of time. Given the large intra- and inter-individual variance in OCTT, it is unsurprising that an accurate model has not yet been proposed. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis using subject-level data to construct a statistical model that predicted OCTT. Literature that utilized lactulose to measure OCTT was identified and analyzed using a mixed-effects model. RESULTS: The OCTTs of fasting healthy subjects were expressed using a linear model, with the amount of lactulose as the single significant explanatory factor. We found that this model could statistically distinguish the OCTTs of subjects with altered physical status from those of healthy people. Specifically, cystic fibrosis and celiac disease most significantly affected OCTT. CONCLUSION: The OCTT models developed herein incorporate inter-subject variations and can contribute to providing more accurate predictions of drug pharmacokinetic profiles.
25411060	Lipoatrophy in children with type 1 diabetes: an increasing incidence?	The objectives were to evaluate the current prevalence of lipoatrophy at insulin injection sites in young patients with type 1 diabetes. Standardized examination of insulin injection sites in all 678 patients with type 1 diabetes treated in 2013 in our outpatient clinic were conducted. In case of lipoatrophy photo documentation and standardized interview with parents and patients were performed. We identified a total of 16 patients (43.8% male) with lipoatrophy (overall prevalence 2.4%). The current mean age (+-SD) of the affected patients was 14.4 +- 3.9 years, age and diabetes duration at onset of lipoatrophy were 11.5 +- 3.8 years and 5.4 +- 3.6 years, respectively. All patients were using analogs at the onset of lipoatrophy. In all, 14 of 16 patients (87.5%) were on insulin pump compared with 52% without lipoatrophy (P = .0018). The use of steel needle and Teflon catheter was equal between the pump patients. Concomitant autoimmune diseases were present in 37.5% of the patients (thyroiditis: n = 3, thyroiditis and celiac disease: n = 2, celiac disease: n = 1) compared with 15.0% in those without lipoatrophy (P = .0128). Lipoatrophy was present in young patients treated with modern insulins and pumps; however, the prevalence was relatively low as expected with the use of modern insulins. Our data may support the hypothesis that a constant mechanical element such as a subcutaneous catheter may trigger the development of lipoatrophy, particularly in those patients with more than 1 autoimmune disease. 
24700375	Human milk composition differs in healthy mothers and mothers with celiac disease.	PURPOSE: To investigate whether breast-milk composition and microbiota differ in healthy mothers and mothers with celiac disease (CD) to ultimately contribute to identify additional factors determining CD risk. METHODS: Breast-milk samples from healthy mothers (n = 12) and mothers with CD (n = 12) were collected. Cytokines and secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) were analyzed by bead-arrays and flow cytometry and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) were assessed by capillary electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence (CE-LIF) detection. Breast-milk microbiota composition was analyzed by conventional and quantitative real-time PCR. RESULT: Breast milk from CD mothers showed significantly lower levels of interleukin (IL) 12p70 (P < 0.042), transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 (P < 0.018) and sIgA (P < 0.003) and almost significantly lower levels of interferon (IFN)-gamma (P < 0.058). Six mothers in each group belonged to the secretor Le(a-b+) type, one to the secretor Le(a-b-) type and five to the non-secretor Le(a+b-) type. CD mothers of non-secretor Le(a+b-) type showed increased Lacto-N-tetraose content (P < 0.042) compared with healthy mothers. CD mothers' milk showed reduced gene copy numbers of Bifidobacterium spp. (P < 0.026) and B. fragilis group (P < 0.044). CONCLUSION: CD mothers' breast milk is characterized by a reduced abundance of immunoprotective compounds (TGF-beta1 and sIgA) and bifidobacteria. The reduction in these components could theoretically diminish the protective effects of breast-feeding on the child's future risk of developing CD.
37686713	Uncovering the Concerns and Needs of Individuals with Celiac Disease: A Cross-Sectional Study.	The treatment for celiac disease (CD) involves a strict gluten-free diet, which can be challenging and lead to questions for patients. Pinpointing these uncertainties can enable the creation of efficient educational resources. In this study, a questionnaire was specifically designed to gain insights into the knowledge, concerns, and needs of individuals with CD and their supporters. The questionnaire was distributed through the Instagram social network and received adequate responses from 300 participants, 258 (86%) being female and 152 (50.7%) falling in the age range of 25-44 years. The concerns of individuals with celiac disease and celiac supporters were rated on a 1-4 scale, with a mean score of 3.5 indicating significant concern. A total of 255 (85%) of all participants expressed that their principal concern was the social limitations they faced, such as difficulties in eating out and sharing food with others. Every participant evaluated their overall disease knowledge, averaging at 2.92 out of 4, indicating a reasonable level of awareness. When asked if they believed that improving general knowledge about CD in the general population would enhance their quality of life, the vast majority responded affirmatively. This finding underscores the importance of not only educating individuals with CD but also reaching out to the wider population, especially those who have a direct impact on the daily lives of individuals with CD, such as family members, friends, and food service providers.

23403442	Oral health status and salivary properties in relation to gluten-free diet in children with celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: Patients with celiac disease (CD) have a wide variety of symptoms, from being asymptomatic to having chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, and extraintestinal symptoms. In the oral cavity, enamel defects and recurrent aphthous stomatitis are the most common symptoms. The aim of the study was to assess oral health, bacterial colonization and salivary buffering capacity of patients with CD at diagnosis were compared with patients with CD receiving a gluten-free diet (GFD) and healthy children. METHODS: Three groups were prospectively investigated: newly diagnosed CD, CD treated with GFD, and a control group. All of the children were examined by pediatric dentists, and saliva samples were collected for bacterial and pH analysis. RESULTS: Ninety children were enrolled in the study, 30 in each group. A higher prevalence of enamel hypoplasia (66%) was found in children with CD. Plaque index was significantly lower in the celiac-treated group, which correlated with oral health behavior: teeth brushing and frequency of eating between meals. Children receiving GFD brushed their teeth and used fluoride significantly more often than other children in the study. No difference between groups was found in snack consumption, mutans streptococci and lactobacilli counts in saliva, as well as pH and buffer capacity. CONCLUSIONS: A lower degree of plaque was found in children with CD receiving GFD. This finding could not be explained by salivary properties or bacteria, but rather by better oral hygiene. The results should raise the awareness of pediatric gastroenterologists toward oral health-related issues in children with CD.
25667705	Celiac disease causing severe osteomalacia: an association still present in Morocco!	Celiac disease (CD), a malabsorption syndrome caused by hypersensitivity to gliadin fraction of gluten. CD can manifest with classic symptoms; however, significant myopathy and multiple fractures are rarely the predominant presentation of untreated celiac disease. Osteomalacia complicating celiac disease had become more and more rare. We describe here a case of osteomalacia secondary to a longstanding untreated celiac disease. This patient complained about progressive bone and muscular pain, weakness, fractures and skeletal deformities. Radiological and laboratory findings were all in favor of severe osteomalacia. Improvement of patient's weakness and laboratory abnormalities was obvious after treatment with gluten free diet, vitamin D, calcium and iron. This case affirms that chronic untreated celiac disease, can lead to an important bone loss and irreversible complications like skeletal deformities. 
35051648	A Low FODMAP Diet Reduces Symptoms in Treated Celiac Patients With Ongoing Symptoms-A Randomized Controlled Trial.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: A gluten-free diet usually leads to mucosal remission in celiac disease, but persistent symptoms are common. A low fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) diet is an established treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We have assessed the efficacy of a moderately low FODMAP diet on persistent symptoms in treated celiac patients. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was performed from 2018 to 2019 in 70 adults with biopsy-proven celiac disease. Inclusion criteria were as follows: persistent gastrointestinal symptoms defined by a Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS)-IBS version score of 30 or higher, gluten-free diet adherence for 12 months or longer, and serologic and mucosal remission. Participants were randomized to a low FODMAP-gluten-free diet (intervention) or usual gluten-free diet (control). The GSRS-IBS score was recorded at baseline and at weeks 1 to 4, and the Celiac Symptom Index at baseline and at week 4. Statistics included marginal models for repeated data and analyses of covariance. RESULTS: We included 34 participants in the intervention group and 36 in the control group. Time development of GSRS-IBS total scores differed significantly between the groups (Pinteraction < .001), evident after 1 week (mean difference in intervention vs control, -8.2; 95% CI, -11.5 to -5.0) and persisting through week 4 (mean difference in intervention vs control, -10.8; 95% CI, -14.8 to -6.8). Moreover, significantly lower scores were found for the dimensions of pain, bloating, diarrhea, and satiety (Pinteraction <= .04), but not constipation (Pinteraction = .43). FODMAP intake during the intervention was moderately low (mean, 8.1 g/d; 95% CI, 6.7-9.3 g/d). The Celiac Symptom Index was significantly lower in the intervention group at week 4 (mean difference, -5.8; 95% CI, -9.6 to -2.0). CONCLUSIONS: A short-term moderately low FODMAP diet significantly reduced gastrointestinal symptoms and increased celiac disease-specific health, and should be considered for the management of persistent symptoms in celiac disease. CLINICALTRIALS: gov: NCT03678935.
38749320	Pilot study indicates that a gluten-free diet lowers oxidative stress for gluten-sensitive persons with schizophrenia.	One-third of people with schizophrenia have elevated levels of anti-gliadin antibodies (AGA IgG). A 5-week randomized double-blind pilot study was performed in 2014-2017 in an inpatient setting to test the effect of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on participants with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who also had elevated AGA IgG (>= 20 U) but were negative for celiac disease. This earlier pilot study reported that the GFD-group showed improved gastrointestinal and psychiatric symptoms, and also improvements in TNF-alpha and the inflammatory cytokine IL-23. Here, we performed measurements of these banked plasma samples to detect levels of oxidative stress (OxSt) using a recently developed iridium (Ir)-reducing capacity assay. Triplicate measurements of these samples showed an Intraclass Correlation Coefficient of 0.84 which indicates good reproducibility. Further, a comparison of the OxSt measurements at the baseline and 5-week end-point for this small sample size shows that the GFD-group (N = 7) had lowered OxSt levels compared to the gluten-containing diet group (GCD; N = 9; p = 0.05). Finally, we showed that improvements in OxSt over these 5 weeks were correlated to improvements in gastrointestinal (r = +0.64, p = 0.0073) and psychiatric (r = +0.52, p = 0.039) symptoms. Also, we showed a possible association between the decrease in OxSt and the lowered levels of IL-23 (r = +0.44, p = 0.087), although without statistical significance. Thus, the Ir-reducing capacity assay provides a simple, objective measure of OxSt with the results providing further evidence that inflammation, redox dysregulation and OxSt may mediate interactions between the gut and brain.
22564209	Growth and metabolic control in patients with type 1 diabetes and celiac disease: a longitudinal observational case-control study.	BACKGROUND: The occurrence of celiac disease (CD) in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) is increasing. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of CD on growth and glycemic control in patients with T1D, and the effects of adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD) on these parameters. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A longitudinal retrospective case-control design was used. The medical files of 68 patients with T1D and duodenal-biopsy-confirmed CD were reviewed for data on weight, height, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), frequency of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and severe hypoglycemic events before and after diagnosis and treatment of CD. Findings were compared with 131 patients with T1D only matched for age, gender, and duration of diabetes. RESULTS: CD was diagnosed in 5.5% of all patients with T1D attending our center during the study period; 26% of the patients with CD were symptomatic. There were no significant differences in glycemic control or frequency of severe hypoglycemia or DKA events between the study and control groups. Body mass index-standard deviation score (SDS), height-SDS, and HbA1c values were marginally but not significantly higher in the control than the study group and similar in subjects with CD with good or fair/poor adherence to a GFD throughout follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with T1D and CD treated with GFD have growth and measures of metabolic control similar to those with T1D without CD. The decision whether asymptomatic celiac patients should be put on a GFD or only symptomatic patients has to be weighed against possible short- and long-term consequences of no intervention, and should be based on more evidence from larger randomized studies.
35889899	Hepatic Steatosis in Patients with Celiac Disease: The Role of Packaged Gluten-Free Foods.	Background: An increased risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in patients with celiac disease (CD) adhering to a gluten-free diet (GFD) was recently reported. The nutritional composition of packaged gluten-free foods (PGFF) has been proposed as a possible cause. This hypothesis has not been investigated further, since a systematic structural nutritional interview for all patients would be problematic in clinical practice. Methods: We administered a simple questionnaire based on a Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value (RFM) analysis (a cornerstone of direct marketing segmentation) to consecutive CD patients on a GFD for >6 months and verified its association with NAFLD. Subgroup analyses were performed to understand whether specific patterns of PGFF consumption were significantly associated with NAFLD. Results: Amongst 147 patients (female 82%, median age 42 years), 45 (30.6%) had NAFLD. Total RFM score (adjusted odds ratio = 1.223, 95% CI: 1.059-1.413, p = 0.006), body mass index, and total cholesterol and triglycerides were independently related to NAFLD, and "Bread and bakery" (p = 0.002), "salty convenience" (p = 0.005), and "sweet convenience" (p = 0.049) products were significantly related with NAFLD. Also, questions about the number of purchased PGFF in the last month (monetary value) and different categories of PGFF consumed in the last week (recency) were particularly able to identify NAFLD patients. Conclusions: The specific GFD dietary habits of CD patients were correlated with the degree of risk of NAFLD. Information was obtained through a questionnaire which could be used in clinical practice to favor a patient-tailored approach and in future studies to verify the reproducibility of our results in different geographical areas.
20823839	Increased risk of hospital admission for influenza in patients with celiac disease: a nationwide cohort study in Sweden.	OBJECTIVES: Although earlier studies suggest an increased risk of infectious disease in celiac disease (CD), data on the risk of influenza in patients with CD are limited. We examined the risk of hospital admission for influenza in CD patients, but for comparative reasons also in individuals with small-intestinal inflammation or normal mucosa but positive CD serology. METHODS: In 2006-2008, we collected duodenal/jejunal biopsy data on CD (Marsh 3: villous atrophy, VA; n=29,008 unique individuals) and inflammation (Marsh 1-2; n=13,200) from all 28 pathology departments in Sweden. A third regional cohort consisted of 3,709 individuals with positive CD serology but normal mucosa (Marsh 0). The biopsies were performed between 1969 and 2008. Through linkage with the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register, we estimated the risk of hospital admission for influenza compared with that of 224,114 age- and sex-matched controls from the general population. RESULTS: Individuals with CD were at increased risk of hospital admission for influenza (hazard ratio (HR)=2.1; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.6-2.7; n=81). The absolute risk of influenza was 30/100,000 person-years (excess risk: 16/100,000 person-years). Furthermore, children with CD were at increased risk of influenza (HR=2.5; 95% CI=1.3-4.8). Whereas individuals with inflammation without VA were also at increased risk of influenza (HR=1.9; 95% CI=1.4-2.5), individuals with normal mucosa but positive CD serology were not (HR=1.2; 95% CI=0.5-3.0). CONCLUSIONS: This study found an increased risk of hospital admission for influenza in patients with CD.
35164408	Extrusion Cooking Effect on Carbohydrate Fraction in Novel Gluten-Free Flours Based on Chickpea and Rice.	Extrusion cooking allows the development of value-added products from pulses, such as gluten-free snacks with added functional properties. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the changes induced by the extrusion process on the carbohydrate fraction (total carbohydrates, soluble sugars and oligosaccharides, dietary fiber, and arabinoxylans) of novel flour formulations based on chickpeas and rice enriched with different dietary fiber sources. Moreover, the influence of the addition of fiber-rich ingredients, such as Fibersol  and passion fruit, on the analyzed compounds was also evaluated. Sucrose was the main soluble sugar found in analyzed formulations, and raffinose was the prevalent oligosaccharide, followed by stachyose. The content of total alpha-galactosides tended to be higher after extrusion cooking. As a consequence of the extrusion treatment, the content of total and soluble dietary fiber was statistically increased in most of the analyzed samples. In general, no significant changes were observed in total arabinoxylan content as a consequence of the extrusion process, while the content of water-soluble arabinoxylans was significantly increased in extruded formulations. It was observed that the content of total available carbohydrates, stachyose, and water-soluble arabinoxylans were significantly influenced by the addition of passion fruit, Fibersol , and both. The incorporation of these ingredients in gluten-free formulations based on chickpeas and rice allows one to obtain suitable functional formulations for the development of innovative, gluten-free, extruded snack-type products, which could be an interesting alternative for people with celiac disease.
35889749	Nutritional Status of Saudi Children with Celiac Disease Following the Ministry of Health's Gluten-Free Diet Program.	This study aimed to evaluate the nutritional status of Saudi children with celiac disease (CD) who followed the Ministry of Health's gluten-free diet (GFD) program. This study involved 66 children with CD (29 boys and 37 girls) from 5 hospitals belonging to the Ministry of Health. Socioeconomic characteristics were obtained using a structured questionnaire. Anthropometric indices were measured using a body composition analyzer. Dietary intake was assessed using three 24 h dietary records. The biochemical parameters were determined in the hospitals' laboratories. According to the findings, the majority of respondents had ages ranging from 10 to 13 years, a father and mother with a university education, a high family income, and 5 to 7 family members. Carbohydrates and protein intake for both genders were significantly higher than the DRI's recommended dietary intake. However, the majority of nutrients consumed were at levels significantly lower than the DRI. Both genders had normal anthropometric indices, with girls having at significantly higher indices than boys. The biochemical parameters of both genders were comparable and within the normal range, except for vitamin D, which was below the normal range. The most important factors influencing nutritional status were age for both genders, and family income and number of family members for boys. In conclusion, data obtained for nutrient intake, anthropometric indicators, body composition, and biochemical analysis indicated that CD children following the Ministry of Health GFD program have a generally good nutritional status.
28399059	Rotavirus Vaccination and the Risk of Celiac Disease or Type 1 Diabetes in Finnish Children at Early Life.	BACKGROUND: Rotavirus infection has been suggested as a trigger of type 1 diabetes (T1D)-related autoimmunity and celiac disease (CD)-related autoimmunity. METHODS: We carried out a nationwide, population-based cohort study evaluating whether prevention of rotavirus infection with vaccination affects the risk of CD and T1D diagnosed during 2009-2014 in Finnish children by comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated children in a cohort born in 2009-2010. Nationwide rotavirus vaccination records were collected from healthcare databases during 2009-2011 and validated for a sample of 495 children born from July 2009 to December 2009. Incident diagnoses of CD and T1D during 2009-2014 in the cohort were identified in the National Care Register. RESULTS: The adjusted relative risks (with 95% confidence intervals) were 0.91 (0.69-1.20) for T1D and 0.87 (0.65-1.17) for CD in vaccinated children compared with unvaccinated, suggesting that oral rotavirus vaccination does not alter the risk of CD or T1D during 4-6 years follow-up after vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that oral rotavirus vaccination is considered safe in the individuals at risk of CD and T1D.
32111387	Two decades of pediatric celiac disease in a tertiary referral center: What has changed?	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is common worldwide with increasing prevalence and changing presentation. AIMS: To evaluate changes in the presentation and management of CD over the last two decades. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of pediatric patients with CD between 01.1999 to 12.2018 was performed. Comparisons were made between an early (1999 to 2008) and late (2009 to 2018) decade, regarding clinical and laboratory parameters at presentation and follow-up. RESULTS: In a cohort of 932 patients (early decade n = 316, late decade n = 616), patients from the late decade presented with lower rates of weight loss and abdominal distention (24.2% vs 34.7% and 6% vs 11%, respectively p < 0.01), and with higher rates of abdominal pain or asymptomatic presentation (41.4% vs 27.4%, p < 0.01, and 18% vs 13%, p < 0.05, respectively). Good adherence to gluten-free diet was reported more often in the late decade (64% vs 50.6%, p < 0.001), and fewer patients were lost to follow-up. During the late decade, significantly higher rates of celiac serology normalization were achieved during the first two years of follow-up. CONCLUSION: In recent years, children with CD were diagnosed with milder symptoms, showed better adherence and demonstrated earlier normalization of celiac serology.
25130636	[Osteoporosis and bone alterations in celiac disease in adults].	Both celiac disease and osteoporosis are common diseases which are considered an emerging problem in medicine. Celiac disease is a condition at high risk for secondary osteoporosis. Osteoporosis or osteopenia are typically present in untreated adult symptomatic celiac disease with an overt malabsorption syndrome, but is found in about 50 % in suboptimally treated celiac patients, subclinical patients and asymptomatic adult celiac patients, too. Etiology of pathologic bone alteration in celiac disease is multifactorial; however, two main mechanisms are involved: intestinal malabsorption and chronic inflammation. The evaluation of bone mineral metabolism (total calcium/albumin, 25-OH vitamin D3 and parathormone levels in serum) and bone mineral density (densitometry) is recommended in the clinical management of celiac patients. Many studies have demonstrated that bone mineral density values in adults show a good improvement in the first period after the institution of gluten-free diet, the improvement is then unsatisfactory and treatment with a mineral-active drug should probably be considered.
33729309	[Weaknesses in healthcare for persons with gluten-related disorders].	Gluten-related disorders affect 1% to 6% of the population, with complications and high risk of short and long-term morbidity and mortality. Since 2009, Brazil has a Clinical Protocol of Therapeutic Guidelines for Celiac Disease, but there are frequent complaints by persons with gluten-related disorders concerning the lack of healthcare professionals' knowledge of this topic and the difficulties related to healthcare, for both diagnosis and treatment. This study aimed to understand the weaknesses in healthcare perceived by persons with gluten-related disorders. An online qualitative survey was conducted in the Living Without Gluten group on Facebook, consulting the records saved by the group for 65 months, which totaled 510 posts and the respective comments. The data were grouped in categories, and thematic content analysis was performed, adopting the theoretical references on healthcare. The analysis revealed that the searches for diagnosis and adequate treatment were often described as a forced pilgrimage, resulting from shortcomings in healthcare, including lack of up-to-date knowledge on gluten-related disorders among the healthcare professionals and problems in the physician-patient relationship. Weaknesses in patient care and late diagnoses contribute to increasing the risk of complications and deaths. In this context, the Living Without Gluten group plays a leading role as a support group and network of solidarity, favoring increased awareness and empowerment of numerous Brazilians with gluten-related disorders.
33462461	Gluten content in labeled and unlabeled gluten-free food products used by patients with celiac disease.	OBJECTIVE: Gluten-free (GF) diet is the only reliable treatment for patients with celiac disease (CeD), but data on the extent of gluten contamination in GF food available in India is scanty. We evaluated gluten content in labeled, imported, and non-labeled GF food products currently available in the Indian market. METHODS: Overall, 794 processed and commercially available packaged GF products (labeled GF (n = 360), imported GF (n = 80), and non-labeled/naturally GF (n = 354)) were collected from supermarkets of National Capital Region of India. Those unavailable in stores were purchased from e-commerce sites or directly from the manufacturers. Gluten level in them was determined by Ridascreen Gliadin sandwich R5 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R-Biopharm AG, Germany). As per Codex Alimentarius and Food Safety and Standard Authority of India, "gluten free" labeled products must not contain > 20 mg/kg of gluten. RESULTS: Overall, 10.1% of 794 GF products including 38 (10.8%) of 360 labeled and 42 (11.8%) of 354 non-labeled/naturally GF food products had gluten content > 20 mg/kg (range: 24.43-355 and 23.2-463.8 mg/kg, respectively). None of the imported GF products had gluten more than the recommended limits. Contaminated products most commonly belonged to cereal and their products (flours, coarse grains, pasta/macaroni, snack foods) pulse flours, spices, and bakery items. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion (10.1%) of GF food products (both labeled and non-labeled) available in India have gluten content greater than the prescribed limits of <20 mg/kg. Physicians, dietitians, support group, and patients with CeD should be made aware of this fact and regulatory bodies should ensure quality assurance.
31546057	A Cooking-Based Intervention Promotes Gluten-Free Diet Adherence and Quality of Life for Adults with Celiac Disease.	Current treatment for celiac disease (CD) requires a life-long gluten-free diet (GFD).1 Among the top challenges are eating outside the home2 and over-reliance on processed foods, which are often high-fat, low-fiber, and high-sugar.3 Home cooking is a GFD management strategy that addresses both. Research not specific to CD suggests a variety of positive outcomes related to home cooking: healthier dietary pattern, positive self-management behaviors (eg, improved glycosylated hemoglobin and cholesterol levels), increased willingness to integrate complex dietary changes, and improved quality of life (QOL).4-6 In this study we assessed the feasibility and acceptability of a cooking-based nutrition education intervention to promote GFD adherence and QOL among adults with CD.
34210037	Food Safety and Cross-Contamination of Gluten-Free Products: A Narrative Review.	A gluten-free diet (GFD) is currently the only effective treatment for celiac disease (CD); an individual's daily intake of gluten should not exceed 10 mg. However, it is difficult to maintain a strict oral diet for life and at least one-third of patients with CD are exposed to gluten, despite their best efforts at dietary modifications. It has been demonstrated that both natural and certified gluten-free foods can be heavily contaminated with gluten well above the commonly accepted threshold of 20 mg/kg. Moreover, meals from food services such as restaurants, workplaces, and schools remain a significant risk for inadvertent gluten exposure. Other possible sources of gluten are non-certified oat products, numerous composite foods, medications, and cosmetics that unexpectedly contain "hidden" vital gluten, a proteinaceous by-product of wheat starch production. A number of immunochemical assays are commercially available worldwide to detect gluten. Each method has specific features, such as format, sample extraction buffers, extraction time and temperature, characteristics of the antibodies, recognition epitope, and the reference material used for calibration. Due to these differences and a lack of official reference material, the results of gluten quantitation may deviate systematically. In conclusion, incorrect gluten quantitation, improper product labeling, and poor consumer awareness, which results in the inadvertent intake of relatively high amounts of gluten, can be factors that compromise the health of patients with CD.
28071042	Oat raw materials and bakery products - amino acid composition and celiac immunoreactivity.	BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to compare the biochemical and immunochemical properties of avenins in some special oat raw materials and additionally the possibility of using them as a raw material for the gluten-free bakery products. METHODS: The compared oat raw materials were - oat flakes, commercial oat flours (including gluten-free oat flour) and residual oat flour, which is by-product of beta-glucan preparation. Biochemical characteristic included amino acid compositions and SDS-PAGE profiles of extracted avenins. The immunochemical reactivity with polyclonal anti-gluten and monoclonal anti-gliadin antibodies was evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively by immunoblotting and ELISA methods. Additionally, experimental bakery products made of examined raw materials were assessed according to their suitability for the celiac patients' diet. RESULTS: The highest protein content was measured in the beta-glucan preparation "Betaven" and gluten-free oat flour. Proteins of all materials are rich in glutamic and aspartic acid, leucine and arginine. Proportions of amino acids in avenins extracted from most of oat raw materials are similar, excluding gluten-free oat flour, which has a very low avenin content and proportions of individual amino acids are different. The SDS-PAGE protein pattern consisted of proteins with molecular weight of about 25-35 kDa. Polyclonal anti-gluten anti-body recognized all protein fractions of molecular weight higher than 20 kDa. Quantitative ELISA analysis shows that the majority of samples has a gliadin-like protein content within the range of 80-260 mg/kg, excluding gluten-free flours and corresponding bakery products. Altogether, beta-glucan preparation has extremely high level of gliadin-like proteins. CONCLUSIONS: In the examined oat raw materials and foods the contents of immunoreactive amino acid sequences exceeded the limit of 20 mg/kg (considered as gluten-free) except for gluten-free flours (oat and  the prepared mixture) and the bakery products based on gluten-free flours. Unfortunately, the rest of oat raw materials and products cannot be considered gluten-free.
37855116	The use of urine peptidomics to define dietary gluten peptides from patients with celiac disease and the clinical relevance.	INTRODUCTION: Determination of urinary gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) has emerged as one of the most attractive test to monitor the adherence to the gluten-free diet (GFD) of patients with celiac disease (CD), being a simple, noninvasive and direct method to detect gluten contamination of the GFD. AREAS COVERED: We conducted a scoping review in Medline (PubMed) of articles published up to April 2023 that analyzed any aspect of the clinical relevance of the use of urinary GIP measurement in patients with CD. A total of 17 articles reporting the clinical use of urinary peptidomics for the follow-up of CD patients were finally included. EXPERT OPINION: Available data suggest that a negative urinary GIP result is a reliable noninvasive predictor of intestinal mucosa healing in CD patients treated with the GFD, especially if testing three urine samples on different days including the weekend. Due to conflicting results about the sensitivity and the specificity of the urinary GIP determination, additional in-depth information is needed, particularly related to (1) the relationship between the amount of ingested gluten and the quantity of urinary GIP excreted in treated CD patients, (2) the GIP kinetics and best timing for sample collection.
27035377	Anemia in Pediatric Celiac Disease: Association With Clinical and Histological Features and Response to Gluten-free Diet.	GOALS: The aim of the present study was to compare clinical, serological, and histological manifestations between children with anemia and without anemia at celiac disease (CD) diagnosis. BACKGROUND: Despite being a common finding, the association between the presence of anemia and clinicohistopathological presentation of CD in children remains obscure. STUDY: A total of 455 patients with CD <18 years of age were divided into those with anemia and those without anemia at diagnosis. The groups underwent comparisons of a variety of clinical, serological, and laboratory parameters and severity of small-bowel mucosal damage. Furthermore, adherence and clinical and serological response to the gluten-free diet (GFD) were compared. RESULTS: Anemia was detected in 18.0% of the patients. Children with anemia had higher values for transglutaminase 2 antibodies (120.0 U/L vs 88.0 U/L, P < 0.001) and, by definition, lower values for hemoglobin (10.5 g/dL vs 12.8 g/dL, P < 0.001) and other iron parameters. They were also less often screen-detected (13.4% vs 34.6%), had more severe histological damage (P = 0.048), and poorer dietary adherence (78.3% vs 87.5%, P = 0.035) than the patients without anemia. A total of 92% of the patients recovered from anemia after a median of 1 year on a GFD, but hemoglobin values remained significantly lower compared with the nonanemic group (12.5 g/dL vs 13.2 g/dL, P = 0.045). There was no difference between the groups in the clinical and serological response to the GFD (P = 0.318). CONCLUSIONS: Anemia at CD diagnosis is associated with more severe histological and serological presentation in children. Furthermore, low hemoglobin may not fully recover even after a median of 1 year on a strict GFD.
37049570	Evaluation of the Usefulness of an Automatable Immunoassay for Monitoring Celiac Disease by Quantification of Immunogenic Gluten Peptides in Urine.	A gluten-free diet (GFD) is currently the only treatment available for patients with celiac disease (CD). However, adherence to a GFD can be challenging because gluten is present in many foods. A lifelong follow-up of patients with CD must be performed to promote adherence to a GFD and to identify the appearance of symptoms and the associated diseases. Therefore, the development of tools to analyze gluten exposure in these patients is important. This study proposes the development of the first automatable ELISA to monitor adherence to a GFD through the quantification of urine gluten immunogenic peptides (u-GIP). Seven healthy volunteers without suspicion of CD and 23 patients with CD were monitored as part of this study to optimize, validate, and apply this assay. Non-interference was found in the urine matrix, and the recovery percentage for spiked samples was 81-101%. The u-GIP was stable for up to 16 days when the samples were stored at different temperatures. Overall, 100% of the patients had detectable u-GIP at diagnosis (range of 0.39-2.14 ng GIP/mL), which reduced to 27% after 12 months on a GFD. Therefore, this highly sensitive immunoassay would allow the analysis of u-GIP from a large battery of samples in clinical laboratories of specialized healthcare centers.
30002342	Celiac Disease and Liver Disorders: From Putative Pathogenesis to Clinical Implications.	Immunologically mediated liver diseases belong to the common extraintestinal manifestations of celiac disease. We have reviewed the current literature that addresses the association between celiac disease and liver disorders. We searched relevant articles on MEDLINE/PubMed up to 15 June 2018. The objective of the article is to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date review on the latest hypotheses explaining the pathogenetic relationship between celiac disease and liver injury. Besides the involvement of gut-liver axis, tissue transglutaminase antibodies, and impairment of intestinal barrier, we integrate the latest achievements made in elucidation of the role of gut microbiota in celiac disease and liver disorders, that has not yet been sufficiently discussed in the literature in this context. The further objective is to provide a complete clinical overview on the types of liver diseases frequently found in celiac disease. In conclusion, the review highlights the clinical implication, recommend a rational approach for managing elevated transaminases in celiac patients, and underscore the importance of screening for celiac disease in patients with associated liver disease.
31476445	Antigen-specific tolerance to self-antigens in protein replacement therapy, gene therapy and autoimmunity.	Trials of antigen-specific tolerance have been undertaken in the clinic for over fifty years and the results of these antigen-specific clinical trials are described in this review. Antigen-specific tolerization of the immune system in protein replacement therapy for hemophilia A is an accepted treatment. Clinical trials are ongoing for autoimmune conditions such as type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, and rheumatoid arthritis with various antigen-specific strategies. Trials for tolerization in celiac disease aim for antigen specific tolerance to gluten, an environmental trigger, which may then halt the progression to autoimmunity targeting a self-antigen, tissue transglutaminase. Although many promising approaches have been demonstrated in pre-clinical models, this review will focus primarily on clinical trials of antigen-specific tolerance that have been taken to the clinic and with initial results reported in the peer reviewed literature. A separate article on approaches with CAR-T cells appears in this volume.
24694905	Exposure assessment to mycotoxins in gluten-free diet for celiac patients.	Mycotoxins are low molecular weight secondary metabolites produced by certain strains of filamentous fungi such as Aspergillus, Penicillium and Fusarium, which attack crops in the field, and grow on foods also during storage under favorable conditions of temperature and humidity. Foods mainly contributing to the intake of mycotoxins with diet are cereals, maize being the most risky commodity due to the potential co-occurrence of more than one mycotoxin, this can be of particular concern especially for vulnerable group of population such as celiac patients that show increased maize-based products consumption. In this study the exposure of celiac patients to fumonisins (FBs) and zearalenone (ZON) has been assessed. The higher exposures, for all the matrices and for both the selected mycotoxins, were for children age group. The lower and upper bound exposure ranged between 348-582 ng/kg bw/day for FBs and 22-83 ng/kg bw/day for ZON; these values result well below the TDI for the selected mycotoxins, representing the 17-29% and 9-33% of the TDI set for FBs and ZON, respectively. Even considering the worst scenario the exposure values reported for children were lower, namely 1385 ng/kg bw/day for FBs and 237 ng/kg bw/day for ZON, than the corresponding toxicological thresholds.
39313830	Celiac disease: Guideline update overview.	ABSTRACT: The American College of Gastroenterology revised its recommendations for diagnosing and managing celiac disease in its updated 2023 clinical guideline. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder causing malabsorption following exposure to gluten. A wide range of both gastrointestinal and nongastrointestinal signs and symptoms can occur. This article provides an overview of the diagnosis and management of celiac disease, aiding the NP in developing a greater awareness of the condition both to diagnose it and to refer patients as needed to gastroenterology for evaluation.
22732174	Early vaccinations are not risk factors for celiac disease.	OBJECTIVES: To investigate if changes in the national Swedish vaccination program coincided with changes in the celiac disease (CD) incidence rate in infants (ie, the Swedish CD Epidemic), and to assess the potential association between these vaccinations and CD risk. METHODS: All studies were based on the National Swedish Childhood Celiac Disease Register. Using an ecological approach, we plotted changes over time in the national vaccination program in the graph displaying CD incidence rate. A population-based incident case-referent study of invited infants was performed. Exposure information was received through a questionnaire and child health clinic records. Vaccines explored were diphtheria/tetanus, pertussis (acellular), polio (inactivated), Haemophilus influenzae type b (conjugated), measles/mumps/rubella, and live attenuated bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) in children with increased tuberculosis risk. Findings were subjected to a birth cohort analysis. RESULTS: Introduction of pertussis vaccine coincided in time with decreasing CD incidence rates. In the infant case-referent study, however, neither vaccination against pertussis (odds ratio 0.91; 95% confidence interval 0.60-1.4), nor against Haemophilus influenzae type b or measles/mumps/rubella was associated with CD. Coverage for the diphtheria/tetanus and polio vaccines was 99%. BCG was associated with reduced risk for CD (adjusted odds ratio 0.54; 95% confidence interval 0.31-0.94). Discontinuation of general BCG vaccination did not affect the cumulative incidence of CD at age 15 years. CONCLUSIONS: Early vaccinations within the national Swedish program were not associated with CD risk, nor could changes in the program explain the Swedish epidemic. A protective effect by BCG was suggested, which could be subject to further studies.
27074817	Serum Concentrations of Insulin, Ghrelin, Adiponectin, Leptin, Leptin Receptor and Lipocalin-2 in Children with Celiac Disease Who Do and Do Not Adhere to a Gluten-Free Diet.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: The roles of the many bioactive peptides in the pathogenesis of celiac disease remain unclear. To evaluate the serum concentrations of insulin, ghrelin, adiponectin, leptin, leptin receptor, and lipocalin-2 in children with celiac disease who do and do not adhere to a gluten-free diet (GFD, intermittent adherence). METHODS: Prepubertal, pubertal, and adolescent celiac children were included in this study (74 girls and 53 boys on a GFD and 80 girls and 40 boys off of a GFD). RESULTS: Insulin levels in prepubertal (9.01+-4.43 muIU/mL), pubertal (10.3+-3.62 muIU/mL), and adolescent (10.8+-4.73 muIU/mL) girls were higher than those in boys (5.88+-2.02, 8.81+-2.88, and 8.81+-2.26 muIU/mL, respectively) and were neither age-dependent nor influenced by a GFD. Prepubertal children off of a GFD exhibited higher ghrelin levels than prepubertal children on a GFD. Adiponectin levels were not age-, sex- nor GFD-dependent. Adherence to a GFD had no effect on the expression of leptin, leptin receptor, and lipocalin-2. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to a GFD had no influence on the adiponectin, leptin, leptin receptor, and lipocalin-2 concentrations in celiac children, but a GFD decreased highly elevated ghrelin levels in prepubertal children. Further studies are required to determine whether increased insulin concentrations in girls with celiac disease is suggestive of an increased risk for hyperinsulinemia.
28350930	Screening for Celiac Disease.	
30012987	Effects of a Gluten-Containing Meal on Gastric Emptying and Gallbladder Contraction.	The ingestion of gluten has been associated with gastrointestinal symptoms even in the absence of detectable immune responses. Little is known about the pathophysiological effects of gluten on the upper gastrointestinal tract. We aimed to assess whether the ingestion of gluten leads to an impairment of the physiological mechanisms of gastric emptying, gallbladder contraction and relaxation. A total of 17 healthy subjects underwent ultrasound evaluation of gastric emptying dynamics and gallbladder contractions at baseline and every 30 min after a standard gluten-containing and gluten-free meal (250 kcal, 70% carbohydrates). The pattern of gastric emptying was similar after a standard meal with or without gluten, but differed in terms of the peak of the antral filling curve, which was wider (mean area 5.69, median 4.70, range 3.71-9.27 cm2 vs. mean 4.89, median 4.57, 2.27-10.22 cm2, p = 0.023) after the gluten-containing meal. The pattern of gallbladder contractions was different after the gluten-free meal (p < 0.05), with higher gallbladder volumes in the late refilling phases. The results of this study show that gluten ingestion exerts objective effects on gastric and gallbladder motility. Although the underlying pathophysiological mechanism remains unknown, these results could account for some of the gluten-related symptoms reported by patients with celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity.
23885887	Hospital admissions for vitamin D related conditions and subsequent immune-mediated disease: record-linkage studies.	BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested that there may be an association between vitamin D deficiency and the risk of developing immune-mediated diseases. METHODS: We analyzed a database of linked statistical records of hospital admissions and death registrations for the whole of England (from 1999 to 2011). Rate ratios for immune-mediated disease were determined, comparing vitamin D deficient cohorts (individuals admitted for vitamin D deficiency or markers of vitamin D deficiency) with comparison cohorts. RESULTS: After hospital admission for either vitamin D deficiency, osteomalacia or rickets, there were significantly elevated rates of Addison's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, chronic active hepatitis, celiac disease, Crohn's disease, diabetes mellitus, pemphigoid, pernicious anemia, primary biliary cirrhosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, thyrotoxicosis, and significantly reduced risks for asthma and myxoedema. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that patients with vitamin D deficiency may have an increased risk of developing some immune-mediated diseases, although we cannot rule out reverse causality or confounding. Further study of these associations is warranted and these data may aid further public health studies.
25494908	Emerging drugs for celiac disease.	INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease is an immune-mediated gluten-dependent disorder, primarily affecting the small intestine in genetically predisposed individuals. The disorder has a very heterogeneous clinical and histopathological spectrum. Current treatment with a gluten-free diet is very effective, but the diet is difficult to maintain and remains costly. AREAS COVERED: Alternatives to the gluten-free diet have been proposed to either replace this current treatment, or at least, to supplement use of the gluten-free diet. Studies in the published English language literature relevant to this review were examined for this report. EXPERT OPINION: Most recent published double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials have focused on an orally administered recombinant glutenase (ALV003) showing significant but limited benefit to celiac disease patients already compliant with a gluten-free diet. Other studies have addressed other immune mechanisms that may play a role in its pathogenesis and have not been so positive. Added investigations, particularly over the long-term, in other larger and more heterogeneous populations are needed.
25248239	[Antibodies against alfa-enolase as an indication of inflammatory process in patients with celiac disease--preliminary results].	INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmunological gluten sensitive enteropathy occuring to genetically predisposed individuals. Active CD is accompanied by presence of multiple antibodies. Anti alpha enolase antibodies were reported in several autoimmunological disorders like rheumatoid arthritis, primary sclerosing cholangitis. Data about its presence and role in CD is avaricious. AIM: The aim of this study was to determine presence of anti alpha enolase antibodies in CD, correlation with gluten exposure, presence of anti tranglutaminase antibodies and Marsh scale. METHODS: Sera from 31 patients with CD (21 females, 10 males) and 6 healthy subjects were collected. Evaluation of CD activity and adherence to gluten free diet were obtained by serology tests (presence of endomyslum antibodies and/or anti transglutamineses in IgA or IgG classes) and histological hallmarks. Anti alpha enolase antibodies were identified in sera using ELISA kit. Titres of anti alpha enolase antibodies were identified among patients with newly diagnosed CD, CD patients non adhering to gluten free diet (GFD), adhering to GFD and among healthy subjects. RESULTS: Mean titre of anti alpha enolase antibodies was higher in CD patients (both treated and non treated) in comparison to control group, respectively 1.1 ng/mL, and 0.795 ngl mL. Among CD patients non adhering to gluten free diet mean titre was 1.4 ng/mL. CONCLUSIONS: Higher anti alpha enolase antibodies titres in non treated CD suggest usefulness of its measurement. These antibodies might be a novel marker of chronic inflammation among CD patients non adhering to GFD.
26487487	B vitamins related to homocysteine metabolism in adults celiac disease patients: a cross-sectional study.	BACKGROUND: The only treatment for celiac disease is the gluten-free diet. Few studies have assessed the nutritional adequacy of this diet, especially of B vitamins related to homocysteine metabolism. The aim of this study was to assess the nutritional status and serum concentrations of B vitamins involved in homocysteine metabolism, and to determine whether the dietary intake of these vitamins are meeting Dietary Reference Intakes in celiac patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional study enrolled a total of 20 celiac patients (36.3 +- 13.7 years old; 65% women), following strict gluten-free diet (GFD) and 39 healthy controls matched by sex and age. The dietary intake was assessed by 3-day food records, and serum concentrations of homocysteine and vitamins B6, B12, and folate were determined after overnight fasting. Comparisons between the two groups were performed by Student's t test or Mann-Whitney U-test, for continuous variables. Pearson's chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables. An alpha level of 5% were considered significant. RESULTS: Celiac patients had lower serum folate concentrations (7.7 +- 3.5 ng/mL, P < 0.05) than controls. All celiac patients had folate intake below the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) (130.8 +- 53.6 mug/d). However, only a small proportion of celiac patients had hyperhomocysteinemia. CONCLUSIONS: Celiac patients treated with GFD presented inadequacy of dietary folate intake and low-serum concentrations of folate, suggesting that more attention should be given to the quality of the nutrients offered by the GFD, as it constitutes a lifelong treatment.
29287009	Adherence to the Gluten-free Diet and Health-related Quality of Life in an Ethnically Diverse Pediatric Population With Celiac Disease.	OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease that requires lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). Adherence to the GFD in childhood may be poor and adversely influence health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The study purpose was to determine sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors influencing adherence to the GFD and HRQOL in a multiethnic cohort of youth with CD. METHODS: A multisite (Edmonton, Hamilton, Toronto) study examining child-parent HRQOL in youth with CD (n = 243) and/or mild gastrointestinal complaints (GI-CON; n = 148) was conducted. Sociodemographic (age, child-parental age/education/ethnicity/place of birth), anthropometric (weight, height, body mass index), disease (diagnosis, age at diagnosis, duration, Marsh score, serology), household characteristics (income, family size, region, number of children/total household size), HRQOL (Peds TM/KINDL and Celiac Disease DUX), GI Complaints (PedsQL: Gastrointestinal Symptom Scale) and gluten intake were measured. RESULTS: Younger age (<10 years), non-Caucasian ethnicity (parent/child), and presence of GI symptoms were associated with the highest rates of adherence to the GFD in CD children (P < 0.05). CD children (parent/child) had higher HRQOL (average, composite domains) than GI-CON (P < 0.05), but CD children were comparable to healthy children. Lack of GI symptoms, non-Caucasian ethnicity and age (<10 years) were associated with increased HRQOL in composite/average domains for CD (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Child-parent perceptions of HRQOL in a multiethnic population with CD are comparable to healthy reference populations, but significantly higher than in parent/child GI-CON. Adherence to the GFD in ethnically diverse youth with CD was related to GI symptoms, age of the child, and ethnicity of the parent-child.

It presents the pathogenetic components of pathology development, associations with the specific features of the microflora in different parts of the gastrointestinal tract, as well as groups at risk for this pathology. The idea on other types of gluten intolerance is briefly given. Current elaborated approaches to gluten enteropathy therapy are provided.
26486279	CELIAC DISEASE OR GLUTEN RELATED DISORDERS? WHO WOULD BE THE DISEASE OF THE TIME?	
30287726	The Effect of Gluten-Free Diet on Health and the Gut Microbiota Cannot Be Extrapolated from One Population to Others.	Gluten-related disorders (GRD) affect millions of people worldwide and have been related to the composition and metabolism of the gut microbiota. These disorders present differently in each patient and the only treatment available is a strict life-long gluten-free diet (GFD). Several studies have investigated the effect of a GFD on the gut microbiota of patients afflicted with GRD as well as healthy people. The purpose of this review is to persuade the biomedical community to think that, while useful, the results from the effect of GFD on health and the gut microbiota cannot be extrapolated from one population to others. This argument is primarily based on the highly individualized pattern of gut microbial composition and metabolic activity in each person, the variability of the gut microbiota over time and the plethora of factors associated with this variation. In addition, there is wide variation in the composition, economic viability, and possible deleterious effects to health among different GFD, both within and among countries. Overall, this paper encourages the conception of more collaborative efforts to study local populations in an effort to reach biologically and medically useful conclusions that truly contribute to improve health in patients afflicted with GRD.
32604710	Living with Gluten and Other Food Intolerances: Self-Reported Diagnoses and Management.	People suffering from a food intolerance (FI) tend to initiate restrictive diets such as a gluten-free diet (GFD), to alleviate their symptoms. To learn about how people live with these problems in daily life (independent of their medical diagnoses), 1203 participants answered a previously validated questionnaire and were divided into: G1 (those self-reporting symptoms after gluten consumption) and G2 (those informing no discomfort after gluten consumption). Self-reported clinical characteristics, diagnoses and diets followed were registered. Twenty nine percent referred some FI (8.5% in G1). In G1, self-reported diagnoses were more frequent (p < 0.0001), including a high proportion of eating and mood disorders. Diagnoses were reported to be given by a physician, but GFD was indicated by professional and nonprofessional persons. In G2, despite declaring no symptoms after gluten consumption, 11.1% followed a GFD. The most frequent answer in both groups was that GFD was followed "to care for my health", suggesting that some celiac patients do not acknowledge it as treatment. Conclusion: close to one third of the population report suffering from some FI. Those perceiving themselves as gluten intolerant report more diseases (p < 0.0001). A GFD is followed by ~11% of those declaring no symptoms after gluten ingestion. This diet is perceived as a healthy eating option.
28030626	Increased Incidence of Thyroid Disease in Patients with Celiac Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	The prevalence of thyroid disease is likely increased among individuals with celiac disease (CD). In addition, exposure to gluten-free treatment may be associated with a risk of thyroid disease, but this association remains controversial. A systematic review was performed to evaluate the association between thyroid disease and CD. The articles were obtained from the PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Chinese WanFang bibliographical databases for the period up to May 2016. The results were analysed in a meta-analysis with odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). There were 13 articles in this meta-analysis, including 15629 CD cases and 79342 controls. Overall, the prevalence of thyroid disease in patients with CD was significantly increased compared with that in the control groups (OR 3.08, 95% CI 2.67-3.56, P<0.001). Moreover, there was no significant difference in the OR between the gluten-treated and untreated groups (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.61-1.92, P = 0.786). The results of our meta-analysis support the hypothesis that the prevalence of thyroid disease in patients with CD is increased compared with that in controls, which suggests that CD patients should be screened for thyroid disease. The effect of gluten-free treatment on thyroid disease needs further investigation.
28555380	Anti-gliadin antibodies in breast milk from celiac mothers on a gluten-free diet.	PURPOSE: To analyze the presence of total IgA and anti-gliadin antibodies (AGA) in BM from CD mothers who follow a gluten-free diet (GFD) and from mothers on a normal gluten-containing diet (ND). METHODS: 218 samples of mature milk were obtained at different months of lactation (1-6) from 83 mothers (2 or more samples per mother) from Italy (Naples), The Netherlands (Leiden) and Spain (Madrid, Valencia and Reus): 42 CD mothers on GFD for more than 2 years and 41 non-CD mothers on a ND. Whey samples were analyzed for AGA-IgA by an indirect homemade ELISA and for total IgA (g/L) by a commercial ELISA kit. RESULTS: AGA-IgA was detected in BM, both in mothers on a GFD and mothers on a ND. AGA-IgA levels in both groups of mothers, CD and non-CD, show the same trend towards decreasing slightly along the months of lactation (p = 0.91). A different trend is observed for total IgA levels, decreasing markedly in CD mothers from the first month of lactation onwards but remaining stable in non-CD mothers (p = 0.048). A statistically significant association was found between the means of total IgA and AGA-IgA (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: AGA-IgA is present in BM from mothers on a ND as well as in BM from mothers who had been on a GFD for years. This reflects the existence of a long-lasting immunological memory independent of the mother's diet. If the presence of these antibodies has any role in promoting the acquisition of gluten tolerance in the infant, our study shows that children of CD mothers would be on equal conditions as children of non-CD mothers.
30368766	Disordered eating behaviors in adolescents with celiac disease.	PURPOSE: Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic immune-mediated systemic disease characterized by inflammation and villous atrophy of the small intestine. A strict, lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only treatment for CD. Disordered eating behaviors (DEBs) prevail in adolescence and young adulthood, and confer a risk of developing into full-blown eating disorders. The aims of the current study were to assess the incidence and risk factors for DEBs among individuals with CD, and to examine an association between adherence to GFD and DEBs. METHODS: A cohort of 136 individuals with CD responded to a web-mediated survey that assessed DEBs and adherence to a GFD. The survey included demographic data (gender, age, weight, disease duration) and two self-rating questionnaires: the Eating Attitudes Test-26 and the gluten-free diet questionnaire. RESULTS: DEBs were found in 19% of female and 7% of male responders. These individuals were characterized by being overweight (p = 0.02), of an older age (p = 0.04) and female sex (p = 0.06). Strict adherence to a GFD was reported by 32% of the responders and was not correlated with age, disease duration, age at diagnosis of CD and with being overweight. CONCLUSIONS: Caregivers should be aware of the increased occurrence of DEBs in adolescents with CD, especially those who are overweight, older and of a female gender. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level V, cross-sectional descriptive study.
26434032	The Gluten-Free Frenzy: Fad or Fitting?	Although the gluten-free diet has been recognized as therapeutic for individuals suffering from celiac disease, it has been promoted recently for other indications, such as autism, chronic fatigue syn- drome, and irritable bowel syndrome, or simply as a healthy dietary choice for anyone. The basics of the gluten-free diet are explored, with evidence-based indications and nursing implications when patients choose gluten-free.
21050687	Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma: a review on clinical presentation, diagnosis, therapeutic strategies and perspectives.	INTRODUCTION: Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL) is a rare complication of celiac disease (<1% of lymphomas) and has a poor prognosis. METHODS: International literature review with PubMed search (up to January 2009) of pathophysiological, clinical and therapeutic data. RESULTS: EATL is found in patients with a mean age of 59 years, often with a complication that signals its diagnosis. Refractory celiac disease (RCD), equivalent to low-grade intraepithelial T-cell lymphoma, could be an intermediary between celiac disease and high-grade invasive T-cell lymphoma. The median survival is 7 months, with no significant difference between stages; the cumulative 5-year survival is less than 20%. The poor prognosis is determined by disease that has often spread before it is diagnosed (50%), multifocal involvement of the small bowel (50%), poor general health status and undernutrition, and recurrence of complications (infections, perforations, gastrointestinal haemorrhages, occlusions), thus delaying the chemotherapy and contributing to frequent chemotherapy resistance. There is currently no effective and consensual treatment: preventive surgery for complications is controversial, and the results of chemotherapy are disappointing. The classic CHOP protocol (combination of doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide-vincristine-prednisone) does not have satisfactory results and survival remains poor, especially in patients with underlying RCD. High-dose chemotherapy with autotransplantion seems to only improve the prognosis in localised forms. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation was not evaluated. In all, 1/3 of patients, being unfit for treatment, die before 3 months and half of treated patients stop chemotherapy prematurely due to inefficacy, intolerance and/or complications. CONCLUSION: Improvement of the prognosis requires collaboration in order to compose a national cohort, to evaluate new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies and to define prognostic factors.
36583900	Celiac crisis with thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy in a child.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease rarely presents with edema, hypoalbuminemia, acute metabolic deterioration, and electrolyte imbalances. This life-threatening condition is defined as a celiac crisis and may mimic disorders with metabolic derangement and sepsis. The crisis may present at onset or develop in celiac disease patients with poor compliance to a gluten-free diet. The fluid resuscitation and replacement of electrolyte deficits are life-saving modalities. CASE: A 14-month-old girl was admitted with fever, lethargy, severe dehydration, edema, hypotension, and commenced sepsis therapy. However, the patient had a growth delay and loss of weight with diarrhea and delayed motor skills. On admission, laboratory evaluation showed anemia, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminemia, electrolyte disturbances, and metabolic acidosis and developed thrombocytopenia during follow-up. The celiac serological tests and upper gastrointestinal endoscopic duodenal mucosa appearance, and duodenum histopathology findings suggested celiac disease. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights that a celiac patient may present with a severe illness like sepsis and may be associated with cytopenia and coagulopathy in the celiac crisis.
29684362	Characterization of the Small Intestinal Lesion in Celiac Disease by Label-Free Quantitative Mass Spectrometry.	Global characterization of tissue proteomes from small amounts of biopsy material has become feasible because of advances in mass spectrometry and bioinformatics tools. In celiac disease (CD), dietary gluten induces an immune response that is accompanied by pronounced remodeling of the small intestine. Removal of gluten from the diet abrogates the immune response, and the tissue architecture normalizes. In this study, differences in global protein expression of small intestinal biopsy specimens from CD patients were quantified by analyzing formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded material using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and label-free protein quantitation. Protein expression was compared in biopsy specimens collected from the same patients before and after 1-year treatment with gluten-free diet (n = 10) or before and after 3-day gluten provocation (n = 4). Differential expression of proteins in particular from mature enterocytes, neutrophils, and plasma cells could distinguish untreated from treated CD mucosa, and Ig variable region IGHV5-51 expression was found to serve as a CD-specific marker of ongoing immune activation. In patients who had undergone gluten challenge, coordinated up-regulation of wound response proteins, including the CD autoantigen transglutaminase 2, was observed. Our study provides a global and unbiased assessment of antigen-driven changes in protein expression in the celiac intestinal mucosa.
38592719	Diagnostic Delay of Celiac Disease in Childhood.	Importance: The extent and factors associated with risk of diagnostic delay in pediatric celiac disease (CD) are poorly understood. Objectives: To investigate the diagnostic delay of CD in childhood, and to assess factors associated with this delay. Design, Setting, and Participants: Multicenter, retrospective, cross-sectional study (2010-2019) of pediatric (aged 0-18 years) patients with CD from 13 pediatric tertiary referral centers in Italy. Data were analyzed from January to June 2023. Main Outcomes and Measures: The overall diagnostic delay (ie, the time lapse occurring from the first symptoms or clinical data indicative of CD and the definitive diagnosis), further split into preconsultation and postconsultation diagnostic delay, were described. Univariable and multivariable linear regression models for factors associated with diagnostic delay were fitted. Factors associated with extreme diagnostic delay (ie, 1.5 x 75th percentile) and misdiagnosis were assessed. Results: A total of 3171 patients with CD were included. The mean (SD) age was 6.2 (3.9) years; 2010 patients (63.4%) were female; and 10 patients (0.3%) were Asian, 41 (1.3%) were Northern African, and 3115 (98.3%) were White. The median (IQR) overall diagnostic delay was 5 (2-11) months, and preconsultation and postconsultation diagnostic delay were 2 (0-6) months and 1 (0-3) month, respectively. The median (IQR) extreme overall diagnostic delay (586 cases [18.5%]) was 11 (5-131) months, and the preconsultation and postconsultation delays were 6 (2-120) and 3 (1-131) months, respectively. Patients who had a first diagnosis when aged less than 3 years (650 patients [20.5%]) showed a shorter diagnostic delay, both overall (median [IQR], 4 [1-7] months for patients aged less than 3 years vs 5 [2-12] months for others) and postconsultation (median [IQR], 1 [0-2] month for patients aged less than 3 years vs 2 [0-4] months for others). A shorter delay was registered in male patients, both overall (median [IQR], 4 [1-10] months for male patients vs 5 [2-12] months for female patients) and preconsultation (median [IQR], 1 [0-6] month for male patients vs 2 [0-6] months for female patients). Family history of CD was associated with lower preconsultation delay (odds ratio [OR], 0.59; 95% CI, 0.47-0.74) and lower overall extreme diagnostic delay (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.56-0.99). Neurological symptoms (78 patients [21.5%]; OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.03-1.78), gastroesophageal reflux (9 patients [28.1%]; OR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.02-3.42), and failure to thrive (215 patients [22.6%]; OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.31-2.00) showed a more frequent extreme diagnostic delay. A previous misdiagnosis (124 patients [4.0%]) was more frequently associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease, diarrhea, bloating, abdominal pain, constipation, fatigue, osteopenia, and villous atrophy (Marsh 3 classification). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study of pediatric CD, the diagnostic delay was rather short. Some factors associated with risk for longer diagnostic delay and misdiagnosis emerged, and these should be addressed in future studies.
25738293	T cell-activated signaling pathways and locally produced cytokines as potential targets in celiac disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease induced by an autoimmune reaction to indigested gluten, which occurs in genetically predisposed population. The etiology of CD is linked to innate and adaptive immunity, mostly mediated by lymphocytes, especially T cells, infiltrating into the small intestinal wall. The subpopulations of T cells that infiltrate inflamed intestinal tissues comprise various CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells. The plethora of T cell subtypes activated in CD leads to simultaneous activation of different signaling cascades including GATA1, NF-kB, JAK or STAT5 the activity of which may be modified by diet or drugs. It was recently showed that food allergens may accelerate CD by altering the interaction between IL-15 and CD4+ T cells in the activation of CD8+ T cells. Increased levels of cytokines like IL-15 are considered to play a role in CD development. Furthermore it was showed that some drugs like tofacitinib or ruxolitinib may influence CD by blocking IL-15 signaling and CD8+ T cell activity. This mini-review will summarize the current knowledge on the role of CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell in clinical and experimental CD and will describe how T cell-activated signaling pathways and locally released proteins may be influenced by dietary factors and drugs used in CD treatment. 
38660933	Gluten-free pasta as an alternative in the diet of patients with celiac disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder that produces inflammation in the gut mucosa, affecting nutrient digestion and absorption. CD affects 0.3% to 1.0% of the world's population and only 15% have a clinical diagnosis. The only effective treatment is a gluten-free diet. The objective of this study was to develop a dough for gluten-free pasta prepared with mixtures of flours from corn, amaranth, soy, and rice. According to the FAO standard of 1975, the resultant mixtures should have a protein content greater than 11.0% and a chemical rating of not less than 70. Three mixtures were obtained: corn-soy (81-19), corn-rice-soy (48-37-15), and corn-rice-amaranth (49-32-14). To improve the handling of the pasta and its physical characteristics (sedimentation, degree of absorption, and cracked shaped pasta) compared to a control (commercial) gluten-free pasta, carboxymethylcellulose, an emulsifier (distilled monoglycerides), and egg albumin were added at concentrations of 0.3, 0.5, and 5.0%, respectively. The corn flour was pregelatinized, and the extrusion was repeated twice. The experimental pasta had a protein content of 14.0%, which was higher than the commercial pasta (4.5%), and a gluten content of less than 20 mg/kg which, according to the Codex Alimentarius International Food Standard (2015), it is considered gluten-free. The corn-rice-soy pasta obtained had an acceptance and liking similar to a commercial brand. This pasta may widen the gluten-free products commercially available to CD patients in Mexico, which nowadays is limited and expensive. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Raw materials available in our country were selected to promote their consumption and diversify the ingredients used in the production of gluten-free products. The pasta obtained presented a higher nutritional content than a commercial gluten-free pasta and was comparable to that of a pasta made with wheat.
23083989	Non-celiac gluten sensitivity.	Gluten sensitivity has been best recognized and understood in the context of two conditions, celiac disease and wheat allergy. However, some individuals complain of symptoms in response to ingestion of "gluten," without histologic or serologic evidence of celiac disease or wheat allergy. The term non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) has been suggested for this condition, although a role for gluten proteins as the sole trigger of the associated symptoms remains to be established. This article reviews the available information regarding symptomatology, epidemiology and genetics, serology and histology, and in vitro and in vivo experimental data on the pathophysiology of NCGS.
28849767	Joint Involvement in Children with Celiac Disease.	OBJECTIVE: To determine early joint involvement as detected by ultrasonography in children with newly diagnosed celiac disease, and in children with celiac disease on gluten-free diet for more than 6 months. METHODS: Cross-sectional comparative study evaluating joint abnormalities by ultrasonography. RESULTS: Ultrasonography showed abnormalities in 19 out of 60 (31.7%) children with newly diagnosed celiac disease as compared to 2 (3.3%) out of 60 in those on a gluten-free diet for more than 6 months. CONCLUSION: Subclinical synovitis as detected by ultrasound is a frequent finding in newly diagnosed children with celiac disease.
22779690	Elution of antitransglutaminase antibodies from duodenal biopsies: a novel approach in the diagnosis of celiac disease.	Celiac disease (CeD) is a disease more prevalent and multisymptomatic than was earlier recognized. Whereas prompt initiation of gluten-free diet (GFD) is beneficial in relieving the symptoms, an accurate CeD diagnosis is necessary also to avoid years of restricted diet on uncertain grounds. We propose a new diagnostic method, based on elution of deposited antibodies against transglutaminase (anti-tTG) from duodenal biopsies in patients with symptoms and screening serology analyses suggestive of CeD. The eluates were analyzed in a Phadia 250 fluoroimmunoassay, demonstrating elevated concentrations of anti-tTG in CeD patients, corresponding to serology and histopathology findings. In one case histology was inconclusive, displaying only unspecific inflammation, but eluted anti-tTG was positive. This patient has clinically improved following GFD. We conclude that our novel method represents a new tool in the diagnostic work up in CeD. The detection of deposited anti-tTG at the site of inflammation appears to provide a high sensitivity and specificity using a technique that is quick, simple and reliable. Further studies are needed for optimization and elucidation of suitable applications for this elution method.
27026081	Serum transglutaminase 3 antibodies correlate with age at celiac disease diagnosis.	BACKGROUND: Transglutaminase (TG)2 is the autoantigen in celiac disease, but also TG3 antibodies have been detected in the serum of celiac disease patients. AIMS: To investigate the correlations between serum TG3 antibodies and clinical and histological manifestations of celiac disease and to assess gluten-dependency of TG3 antibodies. METHODS: Correlations between serum TG3 antibody levels measured from 119 adults and children with untreated coeliac disease and the demographic data, clinical symptoms, celiac antibodies, histological data and results of laboratory tests and bone mineral densities were tested. TG3 antibodies were reinvestigated in 97 celiac disease patients after 12 months on a gluten-free diet (GFD). RESULTS: TG3 antibody titers were shown to correlate with the age at celiac disease diagnosis. Further, negative correlation with TG3 antibodies and intestinal gammadelta+ cells at diagnosis and on GFD was detected. Correlations were not detected with the clinical manifestation of celiac disease, TG2 or endomysial autoantibodies, laboratory values, severity of mucosal villous atrophy, associated diseases or complications. TG3 antibody titers decreased on GFD in 56% of the TG3 antibody positive patients. CONCLUSION: Serum TG3 antibody positivity in celiac disease increases as the diagnostic age rises. TG3 antibodies did not show similar gluten-dependency as TG2 antibodies.
30469412	A Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Pilot Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Effect of Supplementation with Prebiotic Synergy 1 on Iron Homeostasis in Children and Adolescents with Celiac Disease Treated with a Gluten-Free Diet.	Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) occurs in 15-46% of patients with celiac disease (CD), and in some cases, it may be its only manifestation. Studies in animal models have shown that prebiotics, including inulin, may help to increase intestinal absorption of iron. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a prebiotic, oligofructose-enriched inulin (Synergy 1), on iron homeostasis in non-anemic children and adolescents with celiac disease (CD) in association with a gluten-free diet (GFD). Thirty-four CD patients (4-18 years old) were randomized into two groups receiving Synergy 1 (10 g/day) or a placebo (maltodextrin) for three months. Before and after intervention, blood samples were collected from all patients for assessment of blood morphology, biochemical parameters and serum hepcidin concentration. We found that serum hepcidin concentration after the intervention was significantly decreased by 60.9% (p = 0.046) in the Synergy 1 group, whereas no significant difference was observed in the placebo group. No differences in morphological and biochemical blood parameters (including ferritin, hemoglobin and C-reactive protein (CRP)) were observed after intervention in either group. Given that hepcidin decrease may improve intestinal iron absorption, these results warrant further investigation in a larger cohort and especially in patients with IDA.
34753529	Gluten contamination in labelled gluten-free, naturally gluten-free and meals in food services in low-, middle- and high-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	The gluten-free diet is based on the consumption of foods without gluten, which aims to manage celiac disease. The concern of celiac patients is that these foods should be safe. However, gluten contamination can affect these foods. The objectives of this review and meta-analysis were first, to identify articles that detected gluten contamination in gluten-free foods using validated methods. Second, to quantify the overall prevalence of gluten contamination of naturally gluten-free foods, labelled gluten-free products, and meals prepared in food services. Third, to highlight the influence of the country's income and the period of study on this prevalence. The studies were identified in Scopus, Science Direct, Web of Science, PubMed, and Google Scholar. Forty articles were included according to PRISMA guidelines. The statistical meta-analysis was performed using MedCalc 19 software. The results show that in the gluten-free foods analysed, the overall prevalence of gluten contamination was estimated at 15.12% (95% CI: 9.56%-21.70%), with more than 20 mg/kg of gluten. Naturally gluten-free foods were significantly more contaminated than labelled gluten-free products and than meals in food services (28.32%; 9.52%; 4.66% respectively; p < 0.001). Moreover, it was noticed that oats were the most contaminated food. In addition, the prevalence of gluten contamination has significantly decreased over time. The majority of the studies were carried out in upper-middle-income and high-income countries, while only one study was conducted in lower-middle income countries. Therefore, it is necessary to implement preventive actions to reduce gluten contamination, ensuring safe gluten-free foods for celiac patients, including low-income countries.
25227743	Familial multiple lipomas coexisting with celiac disease: a case report.	INTRODUCTION: Gluten enteropathy (celiac disease) is a chronic disease and presents as diarrhea, weight loss and anemia. CASE PRESENTATION: A 35-year-old Caucasian man with gluten enteropathy, familial multiple lipomas and seborrheic keratosis was seen in our clinic. After confirmation of the diagnosis, he was advised to follow a gluten-free diet. His clinical improvement was evaluated and confirmed with biopsy. CONCLUSION: Celiac disease is known to be associated with many systemic diseases and skin lesions but its association with familial multiple lipomas has not yet been reported.
29895731	Extra-Intestinal Manifestation of Celiac Disease in Children.	The aim of this literature review is to discuss the extra-intestinal manifestations of celiac disease within the pediatric celiac population.
31680344	Small-bowel capsule endoscopy in patients with celiac disease, axial versus lateral/panoramic view: Results from a prospective randomized trial.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: Capsule enteroscopy (CE) is recommended in the management of complicated celiac disease (CD). However, published data are derived from axial-view capsule systems. No data are available on the use of lateral/panoramic view capsules. This study aimed at evaluating the diagnostic yield and efficacy of the lateral/panoramic versus the axial view capsule system in CD. METHODS: Consecutive CD patients were enrolled in a prospective monocentric study. Each patient ingested an axial (PillCam SB3) and a lateral/panoramic (CapsoCam Plus) view capsule with a 3-h interval in a randomized order. Two experts blindly evaluated the CE carried out. A third expert reviewed the videos in cases of discordance. RESULTS: Twenty-five CD patients were enrolled (four males, age at CE 51.2 +- 16.6 years, age at CD diagnosis 41.7 +- 20.6, years on a gluten-free diet [GFD] 9.6 +- 9.4). Indications at CE were refractory CD in nine cases, non-responsiveness to GFD in 10 and GFD non-compliance in six. A positive finding was evidenced in 15 (60%) and 13 (52%) cases by CapsoCam and PillCam respectively (not significant). Atrophy was detected by both capsules. Considering the percentage of the small-bowel mucosa presenting atrophy signs, mean values were 22% +- 35 and 20% +- 29 for lateral/panoramic and axial systems, respectively (not significant). Compared to duodenal histology, PillCam correctly identified 80% of patients with SB atrophy, whereas CapsoCam identified 73% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Lateral/panoramic view CE is effective in the detection of small-bowel atrophy in CD and presents good sensitivity and specificity when compared to histology.
30921260	Pediatric Celiac Disease and Eosinophilic Esophagitis: Outcome of Dietary Therapy.	OBJECTIVE: The coexistence of celiac disease (CeD) and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) in pediatric patients has been increasingly recognized. In the current study, we have aimed to assess the outcomes of therapeutic dietary interventions in a cohort of pediatric patients with CeD and EoE. METHODS: Pediatric patient records obtained from the University of Chicago Celiac Center Database from August 2008 to July 2013 were reviewed. Information was collected on patients with concomitant CeD and EoE regarding age, sex, dates of diagnoses, presenting symptoms, length of symptoms before diagnosis, familial and personal atopic history, dietary therapy, and esophageal histologic response to dietary therapy. RESULTS: A total of 350 records of patients with CeD were reviewed. Twenty-two (6.3%) had a confirmed diagnosis of CeD and EoE, 17 had repeat biopsies. Four of 17 (23.5%) had resolution of esophageal eosinophilia on an exclusive gluten-free diet, 10 of 17 (59%) required additional eliminations to show histologic resolution, 1 of 17 (6%) had not reached histological remission, and 2 of 17 (12%) were lost to follow-up. Success rates of single food reintroductions were: soy 5 of 5 (100%), eggs 3 of 5 (60%), dairy 3 of 7 (43%), nuts 2 of 4 (50%), and fish 2 of 4 (50%). CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the largest pediatric study to assess the histologic outcome of EoE-associated esophageal eosinophilia in response to dietary management of pediatric patients with concomitant CeD and EoE. We demonstrate that soy is well tolerated in this cohort, and suggest that reintroducing this food first, or trialing a soy-inclusive elimination diet is a viable strategy.
30060266	The Effect of Gluten-Free Diet on Thyroid Autoimmunity in Drug-Naive Women with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis: A Pilot Study.	BACKGROUND: Autoimmune thyroid disease is often accompanied by celiac disease. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a gluten-free diet affects thyroid autoimmunity, hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis activity and thyroid function tests in women with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and incidentally found positive anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies. METHODS: The study included 34 women with autoimmune thyroiditis divided into two group. The patients belonging to the first one (group A, n=16) complied with the gluten-free diet for 6 months, while the remaining patients (group B, n=18) remained without any dietary treatment. Serum titers of thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies, as well as serum levels of thyrotropin, free thyroid hormones and 25-hydroxyvitamin D were measured at the beginning of the study and 6 months later. Based on thyrotropin and free thyroid hormone levels, Jostel's thyrotropin index, the SPINA-GT index and the SPINA-GD index were calculated. RESULTS: All patients completed the study protocol. In group B, serum thyrotropin and free thyroid hormones levels, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels as well as the calculated indices remained at the similar levels. The gluten-free diet reduced thyroid antibody titers, as well as slightly increased 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and the SPINA-GT index. In group A, the impact on TPOAb and TgAb titers correlated with the changes in the SPINA-GT index, whereas the impact on TPOAb with the changes in 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results suggest that the gluten-free diet may bring clinical benefits to women with autoimmune thyroid disease.
32216476	Advances in understanding the potential therapeutic applications of gut microbiota and probiotic mediated therapies in celiac disease.	INTRODUCTION: Celiac Disease (CD) is an autoimmune enteropathy caused by exposure to gluten in genetically predisposed people. While gluten is the main driving force in CD, evidence has shown that microbiota might be involved in the pathogenesis, development, and clinical presentation of CD. Microbiota manipulation may modify its functional capacity and may be crucial for setting-up potential preventive or therapeutic application. Moreover, probiotics are an excellent source of endopeptidases for digesting gluten. AREAS COVERED: In this narrative review we illustrate all the recent scientific discoveries in this field including CD pathogenetic mechanism where gut microbiota might be involved and possible use of probiotics in CD prevention and treatment. EXPERT OPINION: In the future, probiotics could be used as an add-on medication for strengthening/facilitating the gluten-free diet (GFD) and improving symptoms; the prospect of using it for therapeutic purposes is to be sought in a more distant future.
25451648	Apparently asymptomatic patients with serologic markers of celiac disease and gluten-free diet.	
21284331	Effect of gluten-free diet on growth and glycemic control in children with type 1 diabetes and asymptomatic celiac disease.	We aimed to evaluate the effects of a gluten-free diet on growth and glycemic control in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) and asymptomatic, biopsy-proven celiac disease (CD). Each case of CD was compared to two children with DM and no CD. We studied weight, height, and hemoglobin A1c (HgbAlc) up to 12 months pre- and post- CD diagnosis in 29 cases and 58 controls. The change in body mass index (deltaBMI Z-score) over 2 years was significantly higher in CD cases vs. controls (mean +/- SD 0.33 +/- 0.74 vs. +/- 0.08 +/- 0.46; p = 0.023). However, BMI Z-score did not change in CD patients diagnosed with DM for > 1 year. Mean HgbA1c was similar between groups throughout the study. In conclusion, children with asymptomatic CD and DM do not have significant changes in BMI, height Z-score or metabolic control 1 year post-diagnosis.
22326684	The function of tissue transglutaminase in celiac disease.	Celiac disease is a chronic small bowel disorder caused by an abnormal immune response to an array of epitopes of wheat gluten and related proteins of rye and barley in genetically susceptible individuals who express the HLA-DQ2/-DQ8 haplotype. Gluten peptides are efficiently presented by celiac disease-specific HLA-DQ2- and HLA-DQ8-positive antigen presenting cells to CD4(+) T-cells that, once activated, drive a T helper cell type 1 response leading to the development of the typical celiac lesion-villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia and intraepithelial and lamina propria infiltration of inflammatory cells. Tissue transglutaminase (tTG) is a calcium dependent ubiquitous enzyme which catalyses posttranslational modification of proteins and is released from cells during inflammation. tTG is suggested to exert at least two crucial roles in celiac disease: as a deamidating enzyme, that can enhance the immunostimulatory effect of gluten, and as a target autoantigen in the immune response. Since glutamine-rich gliadin peptides are excellent substrates for tTG, and the resulting deamidated and thus negatively charged peptides have much higher affinity for the HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 molecules, the action of tTG is believed to be a key step in the pathogenesis of celiac disease. This review is focused on the function of tTG in celiac disease, although it also deals with novel advances in tTG-based therapies.
25255352	Plummer-Vinson syndrome following gastric bypass surgery.	Plummer-Vinson syndrome (PVS) is the combination of dysphagia, angular cheilitis, atrophic glossitis, and esophageal webbing in the setting of iron deficiency anemia. Although it is relatively uncommon, this condition is important to recognize because it is a source of dysphagia and it confers an increased risk for hypopharyngeal cancer. Cases of PVS associated with gastrointestinal conditions such as celiac disease and gastric cancer have been previously reported in the literature, but as far as we know, no case of PVS associated with bariatric surgery has been previously reported. We describe the case of a 39-year-old woman who developed PVS following gastric bypass surgery, and we briefly discuss the current knowledge of this syndrome. 
26078104	Usefulness of recombinant gamma-gliadin 1 for identifying patients with celiac disease and monitoring adherence to a gluten-free diet.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an inflammatory disease of the small intestine caused by an immunologic hypersensitivity reaction to dietary wheat gluten. OBJECTIVES: We sought to clone, express, and perform IgA epitope mapping of a CD-specific wheat antigen and to study its usefulness for identifying patients with CD and monitoring adherence to a gluten-free diet. METHODS: A synthetic gene coding for gamma-gliadin 1 (GG1) was expressed in Escherichia coli. Recombinant gamma-gliadin 1 (rGG1) was purified and characterized biochemically, structurally, and immunologically by using sera from patients with CD and control subjects. Overlapping GG1 peptides were synthesized for IgA and IgG epitope mapping. GG1 and peptide-specific antibodies were raised for tracing GG1 in cereals and dietary wheat products and to study its resistance to digestion. RESULTS: rGG1 was expressed and purified. rGG1-based IgA ELISAs performed in populations of patients with CD and control subjects showed a specificity of 92.9%, which was higher than that of gliadin extract (e). Furthermore, it allowed monitoring of adherence to a gluten-free diet in patients. A 26-amino-acid peptide from the proline-glutamine-rich repetitive N-terminal region was identified as the immunodominant IgA epitope. GG1-related antigens were found in rye, barley, and spelt but not in oat, rice, or maize. GG1 was detected in dietary wheat products after baking, and in particular, the major IgA epitope-containing region was resistant against digestion. CONCLUSIONS: rGG1 and its epitope might be useful for identifying patients with CD, monitoring treatment, and studying the pathomechanisms of CD and development of preventive and therapeutic strategies.
36907258	Impact of adherence to gluten-free diet in paediatric celiac patients on optical coherence tomography findings: Ocular imaging based study.	OBJECTIVE: This study aims to measure choroidal thickness, retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, GCC thickness, and foveal thickness by optical coherence tomography and to investigate whether there is a difference between celiac patients who adhere to the gluten-free diet and who do not. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 68 eyes of 34 pediatric patients diagnosed with celiac disease were included in the study. Celiac patients were divided into two groups those who adhere to the gluten-free diet and those who do not. Fourteen patients who adhere to the gluten-free diet and 20 patients who do not adhere to the gluten-free diet were included in the study. Choroidal thickness, GCC, RNFL, and foveal thickness of all subjects were measured and recorded using an optical coherence tomography device. RESULTS: The mean choroidal thickness of the dieting and non-diet groups was 249.05 +- 25.60 and 244.18 +- 33.50 microm, respectively. The mean GCC thickness of the dieting and non-diet groups was 96.56 +- 6.26 and 93.83 +- 5.62 microm, respectively. The mean RNFL thickness of the dieting and non-diet groups was 108.83 +- 9.97 and 103.20 +- 9.74 microm, respectively. The mean foveal thickness of the dieting and non-diet groups was 259.25 +- 33.60 and 261.92 +- 32.94 microm, respectively. There was not a statistically significant difference between the dieting group and the non-diet group in terms of choroidal, GCC, RNFL and foveal thicknesses (p = 0.635, p = 0.207, p = 0.117, p = 0.820, respectively). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the present study states that adhering to a gluten-free diet does not make any difference in choroidal, GCC, RNFL, and foveal thicknesses in pediatric celiac patients.
22504243	Nonresponsive celiac disease due to Strongyloides stercoralis infestation.	Celiac disease (CD) is treated by eliminating all gluten from the diet. A 49-year-old man with CD was admitted to our clinic with complaints of recurrent diarrhea and abdominal pain despite strict adherence to a gluten-free diet. The duodenum was seen to be edematous on gastroduodenoscopic examination. Histological examination of the biopsy specimen taken from the duodenum showed multiple round shaped Strongyloides stercoralis (S. stercoralis) larvae within the crypts. He was successfully treated with albendazole. This case emphasizes the importance of duodenal biopsy in CD. To our knowledge, this is the first case in the literature showing CD and S. stercoralis together.
23588237	Mucosal cytokine response after short-term gluten challenge in celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity.	OBJECTIVES: In celiac disease (CD), gluten induces both adaptive and innate immune responses. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is another form of gluten intolerance where the immune response is less characterized. The aim of our study was to explore and compare the early mucosal immunological events in CD and NCGS. METHODS: We challenged 30 HLA-DQ2(+) NCGS and 15 CD patients, all on a gluten-free diet, with four slices of gluten-containing bread daily for 3 days. Duodenal biopsy specimens were collected before and after challenge. The specimens were examined for cytokine mRNA by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR and for MxA-expression and CD3(+) intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) by immunohistochemistry and compared with specimens from untreated CD patients and disease controls. RESULTS: In CD patients, tumor necrosis factor alpha (P=0.02) and interleukin 8 (P=0.002) mRNA increased after in vivo gluten challenge. The interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) level of treated CD patients was high both before and after challenge and did not increase significantly (P=0.06). Four IFN-gamma-related genes increased significantly. Treated and untreated CD patients had comparable levels of IFN-gamma. Increased expression of MxA in treated CD patients after challenge suggested that IFN-alpha was activated on gluten challenge. In NCGS patients only IFN-gamma increased significantly (P=0.03). mRNA for heat shock protein (Hsp) 27 or Hsp70 did not change in any of the groups. Importantly, we found that the density of IELs was higher in NCGS patients compared with disease controls, independent of challenge, although lower than the level for treated CD patients. CONCLUSIONS: CD patients mounted a concomitant innate and adaptive immune response to gluten challenge. NCGS patients had increased density of intraepithelial CD3(+) T cells before challenge compared with disease controls and increased IFN-gamma mRNA after challenge. Our results warrant further search for the pathogenic mechanisms for NCGS.
33184625	Genetic, lifestyle, and health-related characteristics of adults without celiac disease who follow a gluten-free diet: a population-based study of 124,447 participants.	BACKGROUND: The number of gluten-free diet followers without celiac disease (CD) is increasing. However, little is known about the characteristics of these individuals. OBJECTIVES: We address this issue by investigating a wide range of genetic and phenotypic characteristics in association with following a gluten-free diet. METHODS: The cross-sectional association between lifestyle and health-related characteristics and following a gluten-free diet was investigated in 124,447 women and men aged 40-69 y from the population-based UK Biobank study. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of following a gluten-free diet was performed. RESULTS: A total of 1776 (1.4%) participants reported following a gluten-free diet. Gluten-free diet followers were more likely to be women, nonwhite, highly educated, living in more socioeconomically deprived areas, former smokers, have lost weight in the past year, have poorer self-reported health, and have made dietary changes as a result of illness. Conversely, these individuals were less likely to consume alcohol daily, be overweight or obese, have hypertension, or use cholesterol-lowering medication. Participants with hospital inpatient diagnosed blood and immune mechanism disorders (OR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.18, 2.21) and non-CD digestive system diseases (OR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.42, 1.77) were more likely to follow a gluten-free diet. The GWAS demonstrated that no genetic variants were associated with being a gluten-free diet follower. CONCLUSIONS: Gluten-free diet followers have a better cardiovascular risk profile than non-gluten-free diet followers but poorer self-reported health and a higher prevalence of blood and immune disorders and digestive conditions. Reasons for following a gluten-free diet warrant further investigation.
26088079	Validation of the Turkish version of the Celiac Disease Questionnaire (CDQ).	INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to translate, adapt and validate the Celiac Disease Questionnaire (CDQ), which was developed in Germany, for use in Turkey. METHODS: The questionnaire was translated by a forward-backward translation method. Total CDQ score and four subscores (emotional state, gastrointestinal symptoms, worries, social problems) were calculated and their reliability assessed by internal consistency. Reliability of scales was evaluated by internal consistency. Test-retest reliability was assessed by means of a retest after 15 days. Face validity was assessed by patient volunteers and physicians and construct validity was assessed by means of confirmatory factor analysis. Convergent validity was determined by comparing responses to the CDQ with similar subscale scores of the Short Form-36 (SF-36) health survey. Discriminative concurrent criterion validity was determined by comparing the CDQ scores of patients with celiac disease (CD) on a gluten-free diet (GFD) with CD patients not on a GFD. RESULTS: The Turkish version of the CDQ was completed by 205 patients with celiac disease (Female 146, mean age 31.1 year, +- 10.61). The Cronbach-alpha coefficent of the subscores ranged between 0.73 and 0.93. Test-retest reliability was 0.99 for all subscores. 42 patients with CD and five gastroenterologists assessed the items of the CDQ to be comprehensible and relevant to the health related quality of life (HRQOL) of CD patients. The confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated acceptable fit indices for the original four subscales of the CDQ. The correlations between the scales of the CDQ and the instrument for validation covering similar dimensions of the HRQOL ranged between 0.61 and 0.93. In all subscores and in the total score, patients not on a GFD showed a significantly reduced HRQOL (all p < 0.05) compared to patients on a GFD. CONCLUSION: The Turkish version of the CDQ proved to be a reliable and valid instrument for measuring HRQOL in Turkish patients with celiac disease.
33707543	Precision medicine and machine learning towards the prediction of the outcome of potential celiac disease.	Potential Celiac Patients (PCD) bear the Celiac Disease (CD) genetic predisposition, a significant production of antihuman transglutaminase antibodies, but no morphological changes in the small bowel mucosa. A minority of patients (17%) showed clinical symptoms and need a gluten free diet at time of diagnosis, while the majority progress over several years (up to a decade) without any clinical problem neither a progression of the small intestine mucosal damage even when they continued to assume gluten in their diet. Recently we developed a traditional multivariate approach to predict the natural history, on the base of the information at enrolment (time 0) by a discriminant analysis model. Still, the traditional multivariate model requires stringent assumptions that may not be answered in the clinical setting. Starting from a follow-up dataset available for PCD, we propose the application of Machine Learning (ML) methodologies to extend the analysis on available clinical data and to detect most influent features predicting the outcome. These features, collected at time of diagnosis, should be capable to classify patients who will develop duodenal atrophy from those who will remain potential. Four ML methods were adopted to select features predictive of the outcome; the feature selection procedure was indeed capable to reduce the number of overall features from 85 to 19. ML methodologies (Random Forests, Extremely Randomized Trees, and Boosted Trees, Logistic Regression) were adopted, obtaining high values of accuracy: all report an accuracy above 75%. The specificity score was always more than 75% also, with two of the considered methods over 98%, while the best performance of sensitivity was 60%. The best model, optimized Boosted Trees, was able to classify PCD starting from the selected 19 features with an accuracy of 0.80, sensitivity of 0.58 and specificity of 0.84. Finally, with this work, we are able to categorize PCD patients that can more likely develop overt CD using ML. ML techniques appear to be an innovative approach to predict the outcome of PCD, since they provide a step forward in the direction of precision medicine aimed to customize healthcare, medical therapies, decisions, and practices tailoring the clinical management of PCD children.
31947949	Nutritional Status, Dietary Intake, and Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet of Children with Celiac Disease on a Gluten-Free Diet: A Case-Control Prospective Study.	The only effective treatment for celiac disease (CD) is a life-long strict gluten-free diet (GFD). Nutritional adequacy of the GFD has remained controversial and a matter of debate for a long time. No large case-control studies on children regarding the nutritional adequacy of the GFD has been performed. In this study, children diagnosed with CD on a GFD for >= 2 years were recruited. Controls were age and gender-matched healthy children not affected with CD. In both groups, anthropometric measurements and energy expenditure information were collected. Dietary assessment was performed by a 3-day food diary. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was estimated by the KIDMED index. Overall, 120 children with CD and 100 healthy children were enrolled. No differences were found between CD children and controls in anthropometric measurements and energy expenditure. In the CD group, the daily intake of fats was significantly higher while the consumption of fiber was lower in comparison with the control group. The median KIDMED index was 6.5 in CD children and 6.8 in healthy controls. The diet of children with CD in this study was nutritionally less balanced than controls, with a higher intake of fat and a lower intake of fiber, highlighting the need for dietary counseling.
23177794	Usefulness of the organ culture system when villous height/crypt depth ratio, intraepithelial lymphocyte count, or serum antibody tests are not diagnostic for celiac disease.	The existence of mild forms of celiac disease (CD) can make the histology-based diagnosis difficult to reach. Since anti-endomysium (EMA) and anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) are detectable in culture supernatants of duodenal biopsies from CD patients, our aim was to assess if this system can support the histology in the diagnostic work-up. A total of 559 suspected CD patients underwent serum EMA/anti-tTG detection, upper endoscopy with duodenal biopsy sampling, histologic analysis, and organ culture to detect EMA/anti-tTG in supernatants. A subgroup of 30 patients with organ culture positive results were put on a gluten-free diet (GFD). Their gluten-dependency was evaluated by the psychological general well-being and beck depression inventory indexes. Statistical analysis was performed by Cohen k inter-test, Friedman test, and Dunn multiple comparison. Two hundred forty-one out of 559 (43.1%) patients showed intestinal villous atrophy, whereas serum and organ culture EMA/anti-tTG were positive in 293/559 (52.4%) and 334/559 (59.7%) patients, respectively. The strength of agreement resulted good for serology vs histology (k = 0.730), good for organ culture vs histology (k = 0.662), and very good for serology vs organ culture (k = 0.852). After 12 months of GFD, psychological general well-being index significantly increased, and beck depression inventory index significantly decreased (P < 0.001 for each one). Data highlight the organ culture system as a useful tool to assist the histology in diagnosing CD, mainly in cases without villous atrophy or in seronegative patients. The marked improvement in quality of life after a GFD further supports the reliability of this system in diagnosing CD.
25379519	Bone mineral density at diagnosis of celiac disease and after 1 year of gluten-free diet.	Atypical or silent celiac disease may go undiagnosed for many years and can frequently lead to loss of bone mineral density, with evolution to osteopenia or osteoporosis. The prevalence of the latter conditions, in case of new diagnosis of celiac disease, has been evaluated in many studies but, due to the variability of epidemiologic data and patient features, the results are contradictory. The aim of this study was to evaluate bone mineral density by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in 175 consecutive celiac patients at time of diagnosis (169 per-protocol, 23 males, 146 females; average age 38.9 years). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was repeated after 1 year of gluten-free diet in those with T-score value <-1 at diagnosis. Stratification of patients according to sex and age showed a higher prevalence of low bone mineral density in men older than 30 years and in women of all ages. A 1-year gluten-free diet led to a significant improvement in lumbar spine and femoral neck mean T-score value. We propose that dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry should be performed at diagnosis of celiac disease in all women and in male aged >30 years, taking into account each risk factor in single patients. 
31297187	Recent advances in celiac disease and refractory celiac disease.	Celiac disease (CeD), defined as gluten-induced enteropathy, is a frequent and largely underdiagnosed disease. Diagnosis relies on the detection of highly specific serum IgA anti-transglutaminase auto-antibodies and on the demonstration of duodenal villous atrophy. Treatment necessitates a strict gluten-free diet, which resolves symptoms and enables histological recovery. However, regular follow-up is necessary to assess mucosal healing, which emerges as an important prognostic factor. Recent work on CeD pathogenesis has highlighted how the cross-talk between gluten-specific CD4 + T cells and interleukin-15 can activate cytotoxic intraepithelial lymphocytes and trigger epithelial lesions. Moreover, acquisition by a subset of intraepithelial lymphocytes of somatic gain-of-function mutations in the JAK-STAT pathway was shown to be a decisive step in the progression toward lymphomas complicating CeD, thus opening new therapeutic perspectives for these rare but life-threatening complications.
33022759	Gluten-Free Diet and Migraine.	Migraine is common in celiac disease (CD) and usually improves on a gluten-free diet (GFD). The benefit for people impacted by migraine without CD is poorly evidenced. A GFD may have adverse health consequences and is expensive.
22044901	Early feeding practices and their impact on development of celiac disease.	Celiac disease is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by the ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. Gluten is a protein component in wheat and other cereals, including rye and barley that are generally introduced in the infant's diet at weaning. At present, two schools of thought claim that changing early feeding regimens in at-risk infants can either prevent the onset of the disease or merely delay it. Recent advances have increased our understanding of the molecular basis of this disorder and provide the rationale to perform prospective dietary interventional studies to establish the proper timing of gluten exposure to minimize the risk of developing celiac disease.
32921753	Celiac disease and headache in children: a narrative state of the art.	Celiac disease (CD) is one of the most important entity of the wide spectrum of gluten-related disorders (GRDs). It is well known that neurological manifestation can be present either at the onset of CD, or appear during the development of the pathology, and different can be the neurologic findings. Clinical features are very variable, ranging from typical manifestations of gastrointestinal involvement to neurologic symptom. The most frequent neurologic signs reported were headache, epileptic seizure, migraine, mental retardation, ataxia and attention deficit and hyperactive disorder. Headache either in form of migraine, or in non-specific form represents one of the main clinical presentation in CD. The aim of this work is to provide a narrative review of the pediatric literature focused on the cephalalgic features of children with CD evaluating the potential benefits of a gluten free diet (GFD).  Papers were identified by searching for related literature in Medline (PubMed) and Embase using the words "Celiac Disease" and "Headache" or "Migraine" by specifying "children"/"paediatric age" for reports published since 1972 till 31th October 2018. According to our inclusion criteria, a total of 25 papers has been evaluated. Although it is still controversial if headache is prevalent in CD children a correct compliance to a GFD seems to improve the neurological symptoms even if the underlying pathogenic relationship between CD and neurologic system involvement is still not fully understood.
27648810	Interleukin-15 promotes intestinal dysbiosis with butyrate deficiency associated with increased susceptibility to colitis.	Dysbiosis resulting in gut-microbiome alterations with reduced butyrate production are thought to disrupt intestinal immune homeostasis and promote complex immune disorders. However, whether and how dysbiosis develops before the onset of overt pathology remains poorly defined. Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is upregulated in distressed tissue and its overexpression is thought to predispose susceptible individuals to and have a role in the pathogenesis of celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although the immunological roles of IL-15 have been largely studied, its potential impact on the microbiota remains unexplored. Analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA-based inventories of bacterial communities in mice overexpressing IL-15 in the intestinal epithelium (villin-IL-15 transgenic (v-IL-15tg) mice) shows distinct changes in the composition of the intestinal bacteria. Although some alterations are specific to individual intestinal compartments, others are found across the ileum, cecum and feces. In particular, IL-15 overexpression restructures the composition of the microbiota with a decrease in butyrate-producing bacteria that is associated with a reduction in luminal butyrate levels across all intestinal compartments. Fecal microbiota transplant experiments of wild-type and v-IL-15tg microbiota into germ-free mice further indicate that diminishing butyrate concentration observed in the intestinal lumen of v-IL-15tg mice is the result of intrinsic alterations in the microbiota induced by IL-15. This reconfiguration of the microbiota is associated with increased susceptibility to dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis. Altogether, this study reveals that IL-15 impacts butyrate-producing bacteria and lowers butyrate levels in the absence of overt pathology, which represent events that precede and promote intestinal inflammatory diseases.
25665935	Trends and racial/ethnic disparities in gluten-sensitive problems in the United States: findings from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys from 1988 to 2012.	OBJECTIVES: Racial disparities in the prevalence of celiac disease (CD) and the number of people without CD avoiding gluten (PWAG) in the United States are unknown. We aimed to describe racial differences in the prevalence of CD and PWAG, and evaluate the trends of CD in the noninstitutionalized civilian adult population of the US between 1988 and 2012. METHODS: A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) from 1988 to 1994, 1999 to 2004, and 2009 to 2012. Serum samples from the NHANES participants were tested for CD serology, which included IgA tissue transglutaminase (tTG IgA) and, if findings were abnormal, for IgA endomysial antibodies. Information about adherence to a gluten-free diet was obtained by means of an interviewer-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: In NHANES 2009-2012, the adjusted prevalence of CD was significantly higher (P<0.0001) among non-Hispanic whites (1.0%) than among non-Hispanic blacks (0.2%) and Hispanics (0.3%), whereas the adjusted prevalence of PWAG was significantly higher (P=0.01) in blacks (1.2%) as compared with Hispanics (0.5%) and whites (0.7%). The seroprevalence of CD in adults aged 50 years and older increased from 0.17% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03-0.33) in 1988-1994 to 0.44% (95% CI 0.24-0.81) in 2009-2012 (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The overall prevalence of CD increased between 1988 and 2012 and is significantly more common in whites. In addition, a higher proportion of individuals maintaining a gluten-free diet in the absence of a diagnosis of CD are blacks.
22097920	Slow gallbladder emptying reverts to normal but small intestinal transit of a physiological meal remains slow in celiac patients during gluten-free diet.	BACKGROUND: Alterations of small intestinal transit and gallbladder (GB) motility have been reported in celiac disease (CD) in studies involving, in most cases, non-physiological experimental conditions and artificial stimuli to motility. Our aims were to quantitate non-invasively small intestinal transit time and GB emptying during administration of a physiological and palatable solid meal, and to assess the effect of gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: We simultaneously measured mouth-to-cecum transit time (MCTT) using a validated H(2) breath test, and GB motility using ultrasonography. We studied CD patients before (n = 19) and during (n = 14) GFD, and healthy volunteers (n = 24) following administration of a physiological solid meal (Kcal 539). KEY RESULTS: Mouth-to-cecum transit time was more prolonged in CD (mean +- SEM: 235 +- 96 min) than in controls (169 +- 65 min, P = 0.0039). The GB fasting volume and postprandial residual volume were significantly higher in CD than in controls, and GB emptying constant was slower in CD than in controls. During GFD, GB emptying reverted to normal, but MCTT remained unchanged (229 +- 69 min) and more prolonged in CD than in controls (P = 0.0139). During GFD, duodenal infiltration with lymphocytes and mast cells persisted higher than that in controls, and the number of mast cells lying in proximity of nervous endings did not change. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Slow postprandial MCTT in response to a physiological meal does not revert to normal during GFD, an effect mirroring incomplete histopathologic recovery.
31349675	Daily Life Restrictions are Common and Associated with Health Concerns and Dietary Challenges in Adult Celiac Disease Patients Diagnosed in Childhood.	The prevalence and associated factors of daily life restrictions due to a gluten-free diet in adult celiac disease patients diagnosed in childhood are poorly known. We investigated these issues by collecting the medical data of 955 pediatric patients and sending questionnaires evaluating various health outcomes to the 559 patients who had reached adulthood. Of the 231 respondents, 46% reported everyday life restrictions caused by dietary treatment. Compared with those without restrictions, they more often had anemia at diagnosis (37% vs. 22%, p = 0.014), but the groups were comparable in other diagnostic features. In adulthood, patients with restrictions reported more overall symptoms (32% vs. 17%, p = 0.006), although the symptoms measured with the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale questionnaire were comparable. Despite strict dietary adherence in both groups, the experience of restrictions was associated with dietary challenges (34% vs. 9%, p < 0.001), health concerns (22% vs. 13%, p = 0.050), and lower vitality scores in the Psychological General Well-Being questionnaire. The groups did not differ in their current age, socioeconomic status, family history of celiac disease, general health or health-related lifestyle, the presence of co-morbidities, or regular follow up. Our results encourage healthcare professionals to discuss the possible health concerns and dietary challenges with patients to avoid unnecessary daily life restrictions, especially when young patients start to take responsibility for their treatment.
26608460	Detection of gluten immunogenic peptides in the urine of patients with coeliac disease reveals transgressions in the gluten-free diet and incomplete mucosal healing.	OBJECTIVE: Gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only management for coeliac disease (CD). Available methods to assess GFD compliance are insufficiently sensitive to detect occasional dietary transgressions that may cause gut mucosal damage. We aimed to develop a method to determine gluten intake and monitor GFD compliance in patients with CD and to evaluate its correlation with mucosal damage. DESIGN: Urine samples of 76 healthy subjects and 58 patients with CD subjected to different gluten dietary conditions were collected. A lateral flow test (LFT) with the highly sensitive and specific G12 monoclonal antibody for the most dominant gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) and a LFT reader were used to quantify GIP in solid-phase extracted urines. RESULTS: GIP were detectable in concentrated urines from healthy individuals previously subjected to GFD as early as 4-6 h after single gluten intake, and remained detectable for 1-2 days. The urine assay revealed infringement of the GFD in about 50% of the patients. Analysis of duodenal biopsies revealed that most of patients with CD (89%) with no villous atrophy had no detectable GIP in urine, while all patients with quantifiable GIP in urine showed incomplete intestinal mucosa recovery. CONCLUSION: GIP are detected in urine after gluten consumption, enabling a new and non-invasive method to monitor GFD compliance and transgressions. The method was sensitive, specific and simple enough to be convenient for clinical monitoring of patients with CD as well as for basic and clinical research applications including drug development. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT02344758.
36649519	The Relationship between Zonulin and Metabolic Syndrome in Renal Transplant Patients.	BACKGROUND: Levels of zonulin, a surrogate marker of intestinal permeability, are elevated in various disorders including insulin resistance, obesity, celiac disease, and inflammatory bowel disease. We aimed to elucidate the association of zonulin levels and metabolic syndrome (MS) in renal transplant recipients. METHODS: Seventy-nine renal transplant recipients were enrolled. Diagnosis of MS was established employing the Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) criteria. Serum zonulin level was determined using the double antibody sandwich ELISA method. RESULTS: MS was encountered in 37 (41.6%) of the 79 patients. Serum zonulin level was significantly higher in patients with MS compared to those without MS (p < 0.001). Serum zonulin level correlated with presence of MS (r: 739, p < 0.001), abdominal obesity (r: 514, p < 0.001), fasting glucose level (r: 361, p: 0.001), presence of fasting glucose/diabetes criterion of MS (r: 316, p: 0.005), presence of low HDL criterion of MS (r: 266, p: 0.018), and BMI (r: 527, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A Zonulin-mediated increase in intestinal permeability may play a role in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome. We propose that zonulin may be a suitable surrogate marker of MS in renal transplant recipients.
22261352	Open conformation tissue transglutaminase testing for celiac dietary assessment.	OBJECTIVES: Anti tissue-transglutaminase antibody is the mainstay of celiac disease serologic testing. Whilst it has high sensitivity in patients on an unrestricted diet, sensitivity is poor for evaluation of gluten free diet adherence. AIM: To assess the utility of a novel assay measuring Immunoglobulin-A antibodies to catalytically active open conformation tissue-transglutaminase in assessment of ongoing gluten exposure in celiac disease patients on an alleged gluten free diet. METHODS: Through prospective assessment, 147 patients with celiac disease were divided into good and poor adherence. Open and closed (conventional) tissue-transglutaminase titres were measured using standard enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. 50 patients with inflammatory bowel disease served as disease controls. RESULTS: Overall 128 patients had been on gluten free diet for more than six months and 19 were found to be poorly adherent on dietary review. Within this group 13 (68.4%) and 10 (52.6%) patients respectively were positive for the open conformation and conventional assay (p=0.51). Two and one control patients tested positive for closed and open assays respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to native assays open conformation tissue-transglutaminase may have higher sensitivity in the poor gluten free diet adherence group and higher specificity in the control population. Larger population studies are warranted to assess whether the open conformation tissue-transglutaminase assay may be superior to the conventional assay.
30272603	Use of an Educational Module to Improve Confidence and Knowledge of Celiac Disease Among Nurse Practitioners in Pennsylvania: A Quasi-Experimental Mixed-Methods Design.	Accurate and prompt diagnosis of celiac disease has proven difficult due to the myriad of presenting symptoms and a lack of a clear diagnostic protocol. This pilot study investigated the use of an evidence-based multimedia educational module on nurse practitioner confidence and knowledge of celiac disease. Thirteen nurse practitioners in Pennsylvania completed all study activities, which involved the use of an online pretest, learning component, an immediate post-test, along with 2 follow-up surveys. Results revealed that nurse practitioner confidence (p <= .05) and knowledge (p <= .05) levels significantly improved after participation in the educational intervention. Qualitative data also revealed that nurse practitioners are more aware of the various presentations and symptoms of celiac disease and stated that with this knowledge, their clinical practice has changed to include recognition of the various celiac disease presentations. Findings suggest that nurse practitioners are now more knowledgeable of the various presentations of celiac disease and may be more likely to consider celiac disease as a diagnosis if patients present with typical or atypical symptoms.
38951440	Clinical presentation of celiac disease in adult patients: current real-life experience.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The clinical presentation of celiac disease (CD) has changed over time with more patients presenting with non-classical symptoms, extra-intestinal manifestations (EIM) or no symptoms. We aimed to investigate the main symptoms/signs leading to the diagnosis of CD in adult patients. As secondary end-point, we evaluated the outcome of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms following gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: All consecutive CD adult patients referring to our University Hospital from September 2022 to February 2024 were included. Clinical data were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: 134 patients, 104 females/30 males, median age at diagnosis 35 years, were included. 79 patients reported GI symptoms (i.e., diarrhea, abdominal bloating, dyspepsia) as the main symptom leading to CD diagnosis. In 40 patients, the leading symptom/sign was an EIM (i.e., iron deficiency anemia, infertility/miscarriages, dermatitis, osteoporosis, elevated transaminase levels). Fifteen patients were asymptomatic, being diagnosed because of a positive family history or concomitant autoimmune hypothyroidism. Of the 79 patients reporting GI symptoms, 20 did not experience complete resolution with the GFD. Among the 17 patients who reported a strict adherence to GFD (vs 1 patient with low-adherence, 2 non-compliant), lactose intolerance and irritable bowel syndrome overlap were diagnosed in 2 and 15 patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: GI manifestations remain the main symptoms at presentation of CD, however clinicians should be aware of the EIM of CD and the association with other autoimmune disorders. In non-responsive CD patients, an overlap with functional disorders might be considered.
21867979	Regenerating gene Ialpha is a biomarker for diagnosis and monitoring of celiac disease: a preliminary study.	The regenerating gene (REG) is a multigene family in humans that plays a role in tissue regeneration. The REG Ialpha protein is expressed in the pancreas and the gastrointestinal tract and is involved in the pathophysiology of gastritis, pancreatitis, cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and type 1 diabetes (T1D). Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease caused by the ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. Our aim was to determine whether the serum REG Ialpha concentration reflects the destructive/regenerative process in the small bowel in CD. REG Ialpha was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 40 patients with active CD, and in 19 of them, REG Ialpha was assessed after following a gluten free diet. As controls, 35 healthy subjects were included in the study. Autoantibodies to transglutaminase, gliadin, and endomisium were measured also. We found a significant increase in REG Ialpha in the sera of CD patients when compared with controls. REG Ialpha levels decreased after a gluten-free diet together with a significant reduction in antitransglutaminase antibodies. T1D and pernicious anemia patients displayed normal serum REG Ialpha concentrations. This preliminary study suggests that REG Ialpha protein levels can be used as a biomarker for the diagnosis and monitoring of CD.
22984893	A gluten-free diet effectively reduces symptoms and health care consumption in a Swedish celiac disease population.	BACKGROUND: A gluten-free diet is the only available treatment for celiac disease. Our aim was to investigate the effect of a gluten-free diet on celiac disease related symptoms, health care consumption, and the risk of developing associated immune-mediated diseases. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to 1,560 randomly selected members of the Swedish Society for Coeliacs, divided into equal-sized age- and sex strata; 1,031 (66%) responded. Self-reported symptoms, health care consumption (measured by health care visits and hospitalization days), and missed working days were reported both for the year prior to diagnosis (normal diet) and the year prior to receiving the questionnaire while undergoing treatment with a gluten-free diet. Associated immune-mediated diseases (diabetes mellitus type 1, rheumatic disease, thyroid disease, vitiligo, alopecia areata and inflammatory bowel disease) were self-reported including the year of diagnosis. RESULTS: All investigated symptoms except joint pain improved after diagnosis and initiated gluten-free diet. Both health care consumption and missed working days decreased. Associated immune-mediated diseases were diagnosed equally often before and after celiac disease diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Initiated treatment with a gluten-free diet improves the situation for celiac disease patients in terms of reduced symptoms and health care consumption. An earlier celiac disease diagnosis is therefore of great importance.
27605538	The clinical and phenotypical assessment of seronegative villous atrophy; a prospective UK centre experience evaluating 200 adult cases over a 15-year period (2000-2015).	BACKGROUND: Seronegative villous atrophy (SNVA) is commonly attributed to coeliac disease (CD). However, there are other causes of SNVA. More recently angiotensin-2-receptor-blockers (A2RBs) have been reported as an association but data on SNVA have been limited to centres evaluating complex case referrals and not SNVA in general. OBJECTIVES: To provide clinical outcomes and associations in a large prospective study overseeing all newcomers with SNVA. DESIGN: Over a 15-year period (2000-2015) we evaluated 200 adult patients with SNVA at a UK centre. A diagnosis of either seronegative CD (SNCD) or seronegative non-CD (SN-non-CD) was reached. Baseline comparisons were made between the groups, with 343 seropositive CD subjects serving as controls. RESULTS: Of the 200 SNVA cases, SNCD represented 31% (n=62) and SN-non-CD 69% (n=138). The human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 and/or DQ8 genotype was present in 61%, with a 51% positive predictive value for SNCD. The breakdown of identifiable causes in the SN-non-CD group comprised infections (27%, n=54), inflammatory/immune-mediated disorders (17.5%, n=35) and drugs (6.5%, n=13; two cases related to A2RBs). However, no cause was found in 18% (n=36) and of these 72% (n=26/36) spontaneously normalised duodenal histology while consuming a gluten-enriched diet. Following multivariable logistic regression analysis an independent factor associated with SN-non-CD was non-white ethnicity (OR 10.8, 95% CI 2.2 to 52.8); in fact, 66% of non-whites had GI infections. On immunohistochemistry all groups stained positive for CD8-T-cytotoxic intraepithelial lymphocytes. However, additional CD4-T helper intraepithelial lymphocytes were occasionally seen in SN-non-CD mimicking the changes associated with refractory CD. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with SNVA do not have CD, in particular those who are not white. Furthermore, a subgroup with no obvious aetiology will show spontaneous histological resolution while consuming gluten. These findings suggest caution in empirically prescribing a gluten-free diet without investigation.
32679754	Gluten Degrading Enzymes for Treatment of Celiac Disease.	Celiac disease (CeD) affects about 1% of most world populations. It presents a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from minor symptoms to mild or severe malabsorption, and it may be associated with a wide variety of autoimmune diseases. CeD is triggered and maintained by the ingestion of gluten proteins from wheat and related grains. Gluten peptides that resist gastrointestinal digestion are antigenically presented to gluten specific T cells in the intestinal mucosa via HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8, the necessary genetic predisposition for CeD. To date, there is no effective or approved treatment for CeD other than a strict adherence to a gluten-free diet, which is difficult to maintain in professional or social environments. Moreover, many patients with CeD have active disease despite diet adherence due to a high sensitivity to traces of gluten. Therefore, safe pharmacological treatments that complement the gluten-free diet are urgently needed. Oral enzyme therapy, employing gluten-degrading enzymes, is a promising therapeutic approach. A prerequisite is that such enzymes are active under gastro-duodenal conditions, quickly neutralize the T cell activating gluten peptides and are safe for human consumption. Several enzymes including prolyl endopeptidases, cysteine proteases and subtilisins can cleave the human digestion-resistant gluten peptides in vitro and in vivo. Examples are several prolyl endopeptidases from bacterial sources, subtilisins from Rothia bacteria that are natural oral colonizers and synthetic enzymes with optimized gluten-degrading activities. Without exception, these enzymes must cleave the otherwise unusual glutamine and proline-rich domains characteristic of antigenic gluten peptides. Moreover, they should be stable and active in both the acidic environment of the stomach and under near neutral pH in the duodenum. This review focuses on those enzymes that have been characterized and evaluated for the treatment of CeD, discussing their origin and activities, their clinical evaluation and challenges for therapeutic application. Novel developments include strategies like enteric coating and genetic modification to increase enzyme stability in the digestive tract.
32932082	Sprouted oat as a potential gluten-free ingredient with enhanced nutritional and bioactive properties.	This study is aimed to produce and characterize a novel gluten-free ingredient from oat through sprouting at 18  C for 96 h. The nutritional and bioactive properties as well as key enzymatic activities were studied in sprouted oat powder and compared with those of oat grain powder (control). Sprouted oat powder was an excellent source of protein (10.7%), beta-glucan (2.1%), thiamine (687.1 mug/100 g), riboflavin (218.4 mug/100 g), and minerals (P, K, Mg and Ca), and presented better amino acid and fatty acid compositions and levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (54.9 mg/100 g), free phenolics (507.4 mg GA/100 g) and antioxidant capacity (1744.3 mg TE/100 g) than control. Enhanced protease and alpha-amylase and reduced lipase activities were observed in sprouted oat powder, which are promising features to improve its nutritional, sensorial and health-promoting properties. These results support the use of sprouted oat powder as a promising gluten-free functional ingredient.
31530521	Does celiac disease cause autoimmune sensorineural hearing loss?	BACKGROUND/AIMS: The primary aim of this study is to identify whether an autoimmune sensorineural hearing loss is an extraintestinal neurological manifestation in adult CD patients. The secondary aim is to identify whether the duration of a gluten-free diet has an effect on the hearing levels of CD patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study consisting of 103 adult CD patients and 79 healthy controls between May 2012 and August 2018 at the University of Gaziantep Gastroenterology and Otorhinolaryngology Departments. CD patients were divided into two groups as remission or active, according to their gluten-free diet duration and serum levels of anti-t-TG. The control group was checked both for CD symptoms and anti-t-TG serum levels. Both participants performed a pure tone audiometry after detailed ear nose and throat examination. RESULTS: Only 4 of 103 CD patients showed sensorineural hearing loss. There was no statistically significant difference between hearing levels of the CD patients and the control group in both measurements of air and bone conductions. The hearing levels comparing the remission and active CD patients did not show any difference in air and bone conduction frequencies. CONCLUSION: In this study with a higher number of CD patients when compared with the previous studies, it has been shown that CD does not appear to cause autoimmune sensorineural hearing loss. In addition, the status of the patients regarding the activeness or the remission of CD did not display a differ between the CD patients in terms of hearing levels.
34244963	Dental enamel defects and oral cavity manifestations in Asian patients with celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: While the small intestine is the main site of disease, many other organs are affected by celiac disease (CeD). Dental enamel defects (DED) are common in patients with CeD, and these are one of the indicators of CeD, even when no other symptom of CeD is present. Data on dental and oral cavity manifestations in Asian patients with CeD are scanty. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate dental and oral manifestations in Asian patients with CeD. METHODS: We recruited 118 patients with biopsy-confirmed CeD (36 treatment naive and 82 on follow-up for at least 1 year on gluten-free diet [GFD]) and 40 controls. Diagnosis was made as per the standard criteria. Oral and dental manifestations were evaluated by a dental surgeon. The DED were evaluated according to Aine's criteria. RESULTS: Overall higher number of patients with CeD (66.9%), both treatment naive (69.4%) and those on GFD (65.8%) had DED in comparison to controls (20%) (odds ratio, 8.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.4-19.2; p<0.001). Specific/bilaterally symmetrical DED were significantly higher in patients with CeD than controls. Recurrent aphthous ulcers were also significantly higher in patients with CeD. Approximately 80.6% and 63.4% treatment-naive patients and those on GFD, respectively reported dry mouth sensation, which was significantly higher than the controls. CONCLUSION: Almost two-third of patients with CeD had DED. Physicians and dietitians caring for patients with CeD should be trained in identification of DED and other oral manifestations of CeD.
24355936	The diagnosis and treatment of celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is an inflammatory disease of, the small intestine with a prevalence of roughly 0.5%-1%. Its symptoms arise in response to gluten consumption by genetically predisposed persons (HLA-DQ2/8). The autoantigen tissue transglutaminase (TG2) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of celiac disease. METHOD: Selective review of pertinent literature, including guidelines from Germany and abroad. RESULTS: Celiac disease can present at any age with gastrointestinal or extraintestinal manifestations (e.g., malabsorption or Duhring's dermatitis herpetiformis); it can also be found in association with other (auto-)immune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes. Most cases are oligosymptomatic. The wide differential diagnosis includes food intolerances, intestinal infections, and irritable bowel syndrome, among other conditions. The definitive diagnosis requires the demonstration of celiac disease-specific autoantibody to TG2 (endomysium), which is over 90% sensitive and far over 90% specific, and the characteristic histologic lesions of the small-bowel mucosa and remission on a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSION: An understanding of celiac disease ought to inform everyday clinical practice in all medical disciplines, because this is a common condition with diverse manifestations that can be effectively diagnosed and easily treated for the prevention of both acute and long-term complications. Patients should follow a strictly gluten-free diet for life.
26040340	[A review of diseases related to the intake of gluten].	Cereals are considered a basic food. Through the development of cooking, the human being has produced high- gluten-content food, so that it could make the most of its nutritional properties. Wheat is becoming one of the key elements of the Mediterranean diet. Amongst gluten- intake-related pathologies- gluten is present mainly in wheat, barley and rye- celiac disease (CD) is the most well-known. CD is a chronic inflammatory condition which affects gastrointestinal tract which develops in genetically predisposed individuals. The most common manifestation of CD is nutrients malabsorption. This protein trigger other pathology, wheat allergy (WA), which is an adverse immunological effect to gluten due to E immunoglobulin. A recent increased in non celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) has also been noticed, defined as the emergence of a range of gluten-intake related symptoms in patients for which celiac disease and wheat allergy have been ruled out. This article discusses these three conditions with their phatogenic mecanisms and the different clinic manifestations. 
21672108	Quality of life in children with diabetes and celiac disease: minimal impact of the 'double diagnosis'.	BACKGROUND: Despite the advent of sensitive testing to detect celiac disease (CD), screening in type 1 diabetes (T1D) remains controversial. Many diabetes clinics are apprehensive about the prospect of introducing a second illness requiring intensive lifestyle changes in patients and families already managing a chronic condition, especially in asymptomatic patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of managing CD + T1D on quality of life in families, with attention to the effect of adherence with a gluten-free diet (GFD) and metabolic control. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional assessment using a validated self-reported quality of life measure: 28 children with biopsy-proven CD + T1D were compared with 40 subjects with T1D aged 8-18 yr. Parental and child reports were assessed as well as symptoms at the time of CD diagnosis and adherence with a GFD at the quality of life assessment. RESULTS: No significant differences in quality of life were observed between subjects with established CD + T1D and subjects with T1D alone. Parents of children with CD + T1D reported lower social functioning scores than parents of children with T1D (p = 0.03). In the CD + T1D group no differences in quality of life were observed with regard to age at CD diagnosis, CD duration, or on the basis of adherence with a GFD. CONCLUSIONS: The additional diagnosis of CD has minimal impact on quality of life in children with T1D; however, parents of CD + T1D children did express greater concern about their child's social functioning.
27273303	[Celiac disease : Pathogenesis, clinics, epidemiology, diagnostics, therapy].	Celiac disease is induced by the consumption of gluten containing cereals (wheat, spelt, barley, rye). With a prevalence of ~ 1 %, it is the most common non-infectious chronic inflammatory intestinal disease worldwide. It manifests in all age groups, either classically with abdominal pain, diarrhoea and growth failure or weight loss, more commonly with indirect consequences of malabsorption, such as anaemia and osteoporosis, or with associated autoimmune diseases like type 1 diabetes, autoimmune thyroiditis or dermatitis herpetiformis. The pathogenesis of celiac disease is well explored. Gluten, the cereal storage protein, is not completely digested and reaches the intestinal mucosa where it activates inflammatory T cells, which cause atrophy of the resorptive villi. This T-cell activation requires a genetic predisposition (the molecules HLA-DQ2 or -DQ8 on antigen-presenting immune cells). Moreover, the enzyme tissue transglutaminase (TG2) which is released in the mucosa increases the immunogenicity of the gluten peptides by a deamidation reaction. The test for serum antibodies to the autoantigen TG2 is one of the best diagnostic markers in medicine, which in combination with endoscopically obtained biopsies, secures the diagnosis of celiac disease. Despite these tools celiac disease is severely underdiagnosed, with 80-90 % of those affected being undetected. The untreated condition can lead to grave complications. These include the consequences of malabsorption, cancers (especially intestinal T-cell lymphoma), and likely also the promotion of autoimmune diseases. The therapy of celiac disease, a strict gluten-free diet, is difficult to maintain and not always effective. Alternative, supporting pharmacological therapies are urgently needed and are currently in development. 
36913036	Study of the immune response in celiac patients with selective IgA deficiency who start a gluten-free diet.	Studies are scarce regarding IgG anti-tissue transglutaminase 2 (tTG) normalization in selective IgA deficient (SIgAD) celiac disease (CD) patients after beginning a gluten free diet (GFD). The aim of this study is to analyse the decreasing dynamics of IgG anti-tTG in patients diagnosed with CD who start a GFD. To achieve this objective, IgG and IgA anti-tTG levels at diagnosis and during follow-up in 11 SIgAD CD patients and in 20 IgA competent CD patients were retrospectively evaluated. At diagnosis, statistical differences were not found when comparing IgA anti-tTG levels of IgA competent subjects with IgG anti-tTG levels of SIgAD subjects. Regarding the decreasing dynamics, even though no statistical differences were found (p = 0.06), normalization rates were slower for SIgAD CD patients. After 1 and 2 years on GFD, respectively, only 18.2% and 36.3% of the SIgAD CD patients normalized IgG anti-tTG levels; otherwise, IgA anti-tTG reached values under the reference values in 30% and 80% of the IgA competent patients in the same time-points. Although IgG anti-tTG has demonstrated a high diagnostic efficiency in SIgAD CD pediatric patients, this test does not appear to be as precise for long-term GFD response monitoring as IgA anti-tTG levels in IgA sufficient patients.
23432128	Sorghum, a healthy and gluten-free food for celiac patients as demonstrated by genome, biochemical, and immunochemical analyses.	Wheat (Triticum spp. L.), rye (Secale cereal L.), and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) seeds contain peptides toxic to celiac patients. Maize (Zea mays L.) and rice (Oryza sativa L.) are distant relatives of wheat as well as sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) and are known to be safe for celiacs. Both immunochemical studies and in vitro and in vivo challenge of wheat-free sorghum food products support this conclusion, although molecular evidence is missing. The goal of the present study was to provide biochemical and genetic evidence that sorghum is safe for celiac patients. In silico analysis of the recently published sorghum genome predicts that sorghum does not contain peptides that are toxic for celiac patients. Aqueous/alcohol-soluble prolamins (kafirins) from different sorghum varieties, including pure lines and hybrids, were evaluated by SDS-PAGE and HPLC analyses as well as an established enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the R5 antibody. These analyses provide molecular evidence for the absence of toxic gliadin-like peptides in sorghum, confirming that sorghum can be definitively considered safe for consumption by people with celiac disease.
37294459	Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency Is Common in Celiac Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	The prevalence of celiac disease (CD) is approximately 1% in the US. Studies have shown possible association between exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) and CD, with numerous hypothesized biological mechanisms including small bowel mucosal damage causing disruption of enteric-mediated hormonal secretion such as cholecystokinin and loss of enterokinase. The overall prevalence of EPI in CD remains unknown. We performed systematic review and metanalysis and examined the prevalence of EPI in patients who were first diagnosed with CD versus those who had been on treatment with gluten-free diet (GFD). Results  Six studies were included in the analysis totaling 446 CD patients (Avg age 44.1 years; 34% Males). One hundred and forty-four patients had newly diagnosed CD, and 302 patients had known CD with at least 9 months treatment with GFD. Four studies examined newly diagnosed CD patients. The individual rates of EPI in new CD patients ranged from 10.5 to 46.5%. The pooled prevalence of EPI in newly diagnosed CD patients was 26.2% (95% CI 8.43-43.92%, Q = 2.24, I2 = 0%). Five studies examined CD patients on GFD. The rate of EPI ranged from 1.9% to 18.2%. The prevalence of EPI in patients treated with GFD is 8% (95% CI 1.52-14.8%, Q = 4.42, I2 = 9.59%). Patients with newly diagnosed CD are significantly more likely to have EPI compared to those patients treated with GFD (p = 0.031). CD patients on GFD with persistent symptoms have a significantly higher rate of EPI (28.4%) compared to CD patients on GFD who are asymptomatic (3%) (p < 0.001).
32425730	A negative fallout of COVID-19 lockdown in Italy: Life-threatening delay in the diagnosis of celiac disease.	
37646811	Cross-sectional imaging: current status and future potential in adult celiac disease.	Celiac disease (CD), triggered by exposure to gluten in genetically susceptible individuals, is an immune-mediated small bowel disease affecting about 1% of the population worldwide. But the prevalence of CD varies with age, sex, and location. A strict gluten-free diet remains the primary treatment for CD, currently. Most of patients with CD respond well to gluten-free diet with good prognosis, while some patients fail to get symptomatic relief or histological remission (e.g., nonresponsive or refractory CD). Because of heterogeneous clinical appearance, the diagnosis of CD is difficult. Moreover, malignant complications and poor outcomes accompanied with refractory CD present great challenges in disease management. Over the past three decades, cross-sectional imaging techniques (computed tomography [CT] and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) play an important role in small bowel inflammatory and neoplastic diseases. Compared with endoscopic techniques, cross-sectional imaging permits clearly presentation of both intraluminal and extraluminal abnormalities. It provides vascular and functional information, thus improving the possibility as diagnostic and follow-up tool. The value of cross-sectional imaging for patients with suspected or confirmed CD has been gradually demonstrated. Studies revealed that certain features suggested by cross-sectional imaging could help to establish the early diagnosis of CD. Besides, the potential contributions of cross-sectional imaging may lie in the evaluation of disease activity and severity, which helps guiding management strategies. The purpose of this review is to provide current overviews and future directions of cross-sectional imaging in adult CD, thus facilitating the understanding and application in clinical practice. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: In this review, we systematically summarized the existing knowledge of cross-sectional imaging in adult CD and analyzed their possible roles in clinical practice, including disease diagnosis, complication identification, treatment evaluation, and prognostic prediction. KEY POINTS:   Regarding a condition described as "celiac iceberg", celiac disease remains underdiagnosed and undertreated.   Cross-sectional imaging is helpful in clinical management of celiac disease, including disease diagnosis, complication identification, treatment evaluation, and prognostic prediction.   Cross-sectional imaging should be considered as the valuable examination in patients suspected from celiac disease.
31262542	Metabolism of wheat proteins by intestinal microbes: Implications for wheat related disorders.	Wheat is a common cereal in the Western diet and an important source of protein as well as fiber. However, some individuals develop adverse reactions to a wheat-containing diet. The best characterized is celiac disease which develops after intake of gluten in individuals with genetic predisposition. Other wheat-related conditions are less well defined in terms of diagnosis, specific trigger and underlying pathways. Despite this, the overall prevalence of wheat-related disorders has increased in the last decades and the role of microbial factors has been suggested. Several studies have described an altered intestinal microbiota in celiac patients compared to healthy subjects, but less information is available regarding other wheat-related disorders. Here, we discuss the importance of the intestinal microbiota in the metabolism of wheat proteins and the development of inflammatory or functional conditions. Understanding these interactions will open new directions for therapeutic development using bacteria with optimal wheat protein degrading capacity.
30025705	New Onset Villous Atrophy in a Patient With Celiac Disease.	
29325090	The 5 Ws of a gluten challenge for gluten-related disorders.	Gluten-related disorders (GRDs) are gradually emerging as epidemiologically relevant diseases, with a global prevalence estimated to be approximately 5% in the population. Conditions related to gluten ingestion include celiac disease (CD), wheat allergy (WA), and nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). Although mediated by different pathogenic pathways, these 3 conditions share similar clinical manifestations and can present a difficult differential diagnosis. The gluten challenge (GC) is an important diagnostic tool for GRDs, but there is great variability in regards to deciding which patients should be challenged, what amount of gluten should be used, what the GC duration should be, when and where the GC should occur, and, sometimes, why to conduct a GC. This review summarizes the current knowledge about the desirable characteristics of GCs in the 3 main GRDs following a 5 Ws approach-that is, the 5 main journalistic questions: who, what, when, where, why. The answers will help to determine the correct use of the GC in diagnosing GRDs.
23961546	Burden of illness and use of health care services before and after celiac disease diagnosis in children.	OBJECTIVES: Prevalence of celiac disease in children is approximately 1%, but most patients remain unrecognized by reason of variable clinical presentation. Undetected patients may have an increased burden of illness and use of health care services because of nonspecific complaints. We investigated these issues prospectively in newly detected patients with celiac disease before and after diagnosis in a large nationwide cohort of children. METHODS: A validated questionnaire was sent to consecutive families whose children had been diagnosed as having celiac disease within 1 year. The survey contained questions about the use of medical consultations, on-demand drugs, vitamins and herbal products, children's absenteeism from day care or school and, parents' work absenteeism. A follow-up questionnaire was sent after 1 year of receiving a gluten-free diet. RESULTS: A total of 132 families responded. A total of 44 children were diagnosed because of gastrointestinal and 88 because of extraintestinal symptoms or by risk-group screening. On treatment, outpatient visits to primary health care decreased from a mean of 3.0 to 1.3 visits per year (P < 0.001), the number of hospitalizations from 0.2 to 0.1 (P = 0.008), and antibiotic prescriptions from 1.0 to 0.5/year (P < 0.001). Visits to secondary and tertiary health care increased from 0.6 to 1.4 (P < 0.001), mostly for celiac surveillance. Use of vitamins, micronutrients, and herbal products increased from 7.3 to 10.2 pills per month (P = 0.028). CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a gluten-free diet resulted in reduced use of health care services and antibiotic prescriptions in children. Our findings support active case-finding and risk-group screening for celiac disease.
34864760	Growth and development in type 1 diabetes.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to summarize the current literature on the subject of linear growth in children and adolescents with or at risk for type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). RECENT FINDINGS: Poor glycemic control in T1DM is associated with growth hormone resistance, and improving glycemic control can improve linear growth. Newer reports suggest that the increasingly popular very low carbohydrate diets, may reduce linear growth velocity. SUMMARY: Linear growth during childhood is a complex process regulated influenced by genetic, hormonal, nutritional and environmental factors. Linear growth may be impaired in children with T1DM, correlating with poor metabolic control; an extreme example is Mauriac syndrome. This decrement in linear growth appears to be driven in part by a reduction in growth hormone responsiveness, leading to low insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels. Improving glycemic control can lead to improved IGF-1 levels and linear growth. Other factors associated with poor linear growth in T1DM include celiac disease and dietary alterations, with early reports suggesting that very low carbohydrate diets, if not carefully managed, may increase risk of attenuated linear growth. This review examines the latest data regarding the associations between T1DM and linear growth in children.
25466501	The impact of immune dysregulation on the development of autoimmune gastrointestinal and liver disease.	The intestinal epithelium plays an active immunologic role in preventing the uptake of foreign antigens. Additionally, the intestinal mucosa is an active site for immune suppression through the development of oral tolerance. Dysfunction of any aspect of the intestinal barrier, such as impairment of intestinal tight junctions, immunologic dysregulation or decreased oral tolerance will lead to overstimulation of the immune system upon exposure to foreign antigens and subsequent unregulated chronic intestinal inflammation. This persistent inflammatory activity may potentially predispose the patient to the development of intestinal autoimmune disease. An active immune response possibly directed against intestinal flora has been postulated to be the underlying etiology for inflammatory bowel disease. Failure of oral tolerance is thought predispose a patient to celiac disease and possibly eosinophilic esophagitis. Additionally, an active immunologic response to absorbed antigen may be the underlying etiology for the development of autoimmune liver disease. 
34041591	Cesarean delivery and risk of hospitalization for autoimmune disorders before 14 years of age.	It is supposed that cesarean birth is implicated in the development of autoimmunity. We evaluated the association between cesarean delivery and the risk of hospitalization for autoimmune disease in children up to 14 years of age. We performed a longitudinal cohort study of 934,873 children born between 2006 and 2019 in Quebec, Canada. The main exposure measure was cesarean delivery versus vaginal delivery (spontaneous or induced). Outcomes included hospitalization for type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, or other autoimmune disorders before 14 years of age. We used Cox regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between cesarean delivery and hospitalization for autoimmune disorders, adjusted for patient characteristics. A total of 248,963 children (27%) were delivered by cesarean. Median length of follow-up was 7.4 years. The hospitalization rate for autoimmune disorders was 69.1 per 100,000 person-years for cesarean and 65.9 per 100,000 person-years for vaginal delivery. Cesarean delivery was not associated with autoimmune disorders overall (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.96-1.10). There was no association with type 1 diabetes (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.85-1.17), celiac disease (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.71-1.04), inflammatory bowel disease (HR 1.15, 95% CI 0.88-1.49), or idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.82-1.25). Cesarean delivery was not associated with autoimmune disorders at different ages.Conclusion: This study suggests that cesarean delivery is not associated with the risk of hospitalization for autoimmune disorders before 14 years of age. Delivery mode does not seem to mediate the risk of autoimmunity in childhood. What is Known:   Children born by cesarean may be at risk of abnormal immune development.   The association between cesarean delivery and risk of pediatric autoimmune disorders is unclear. What is New:   In this cohort study of over 900,000 children, cesarean delivery was not associated with the risk of hospitalization for a range of autoimmune disorders before 14 years of age.   Cesarean delivery may not be related to the development of autoimmunity.
28837103	Activities, Participation and Quality of Life Concepts in Children and Adolescents with Celiac Disease: A Scoping Review.	Celiac disease (CD) is a food-related chronic condition and adherence to a strict gluten-free diet is the only available treatment. Adherence to the restrictive diet is challenging among children, especially adolescents. The aim was to describe existing knowledge about food-related activities, participation, and quality of life in daily life among children and adolescents with CD and to illuminate gaps in knowledge. The scoping review methodology was applied and literature searches were conducted in electronic databases. Twenty-three articles met the inclusion criteria. Food-related activities were identified, classified, and coded under the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health adapted for children and youth (ICF-CY) concepts of activities and participation. A wide variety of study populations, objectives, methods, and tools involving 55 different food-related activities were found. Incorporation of the ICF-CY concepts and quality of life captures new insights into everyday challenges. Reviewing the CD literature using this different lens reveals areas yet to receive sufficient attention. Further research can deepen the understanding of daily functioning of children with CD and the underlying skills required to participate in daily food-related activities while adhering to the diet. This can lead to the development of standardized disease-specific assessment tools and suitable intervention programs.
38777415	Vitamin D and celiac disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated condition affecting the small intestine. Its reported global prevalence falls within the range of 0.7% to 1.4%. Notably, historically, higher rates, reaching 1% in Western Ireland, have been documented. Recent research has even revealed prevalence rates as elevated as 2% in northern Europe. These findings underscore the urgency for swift and cost-effective diagnosis, especially in individuals identified through screening efforts. At present, the diagnosis of CD relies on a multifaceted approach involving positive serological markers such as IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-TTG) and anti-endomysial antibodies (anti-EMA). These serological findings are assessed in conjunction with classical histological alterations, as outlined in the Marsh classification. CD is an inflammatory condition triggered by the consumption of gluten, resulting from intricate interactions between genetic, immunological, and environmental factors. CD is linked to malabsorption, leading to nutritional deficiencies. Individuals with CD are required to adhere to a gluten-free diet, which itself can lead to nutrient deficiencies. One such deficiency includes vitamin D, and there is substantial experimental evidence supporting the notion of a bidirectional relationship between CD and vitamin D status. A low level of vitamin D has a detrimental impact on the clinical course of the disease. Here we summarize the key characteristics of CD and explore the prominent roles of vitamin D in individuals with CD.
21619651	Compliant gluten-free children with celiac disease: an evaluation of psychological distress.	BACKGROUND: Children with chronic illnesses are known to have increased risks for emotional and behavioral problems. In the present study, children and adolescent suffering from celiac disease (CD) were compared with healthy controls to assess differences in the psychological profile. METHODS: A total of 100 well-treated and compliant CD patients (65 females/35 males; age mean +- SD: 10.38 +- 2.71) were compared to 100 normal controls (58 females/42 males; age mean +- SD: 11.47 +- 2.61). Emotional and behavioral problems were assessed by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) and the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC). RESULTS: Subjects with CD self-reported an increased rate of anxiety and depression symptoms and showed higher scores in "harm avoidance" and "somatic complaints", in the CBCL parent-report questionnaire, as compared to healthy control subjects. Furthermore, gender differences could be observed in the group of CD patients, with males displaying significantly higher CBCL externalizing scores, in social, thought and attention problems, as compared to female, who in turns showed more prominent internalizing symptoms such as depression. CONCLUSIONS: The increased rate of emotional and behavioral problems in children and adolescent with CD emphasizes the importance of an early detection of mental health problems in these children.
27976643	Gluten-Free hepatomiracle in "celiac hepatitis": A case highlighting the rare occurrence of nutrition-induced near total reversal of advanced steatohepatitis and cirrhosis.	Regression of hepatic fibrosis is increasingly becoming a reality, both in clinical as well as experimental models. Reversal or near-total regression of marked liver steatohepatitis and fibrosis, however, remains a rare event. We report the case of a 20-year-old female presenting with diarrhea due to celiac disease and biopsy proven cirrhosis with portal hypertension who had a remarkable clinical improvement in response to a gluten free diet (GFD). A follow-up liver biopsy 9 months after the initiation of GFD revealed a remarkable regression of both fibrosis as well as steatosis. Villous atrophy, as seen in patients with celiac disease, could lead to a deprivation of trophic factors leading to liver injury and subsequent cirrhosis. A gluten-free dietary regimen can produce a reversal of fibrosis leading to the amelioration of symptoms associated even with advanced liver disease.
35645020	Biomarkers for the diagnosis and monitoring of celiac disease: can you count on me?	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Different markers are available to diagnose and monitor celiac disease (CeD); however, the concordance among them and their efficacy are still controversial. We aim at defining the efficacy of CeD biomarkers, their advantages and limits. RECENT FINDINGS: CeD diagnostic criteria are widely accepted, being a positive serology and duodenal atrophy (according to the Marsh-Oberhuber score) the main hallmarks. Flow cytometry and other molecular biomarkers support the diagnosis of refractory CeD. On the other side, CeD monitoring is less defined, as the biomarkers are not always reliable. To date, the reference standard to detect mucosal healing is represented by duodenal histology, but its timing and significance are debated. Novel scores may better define the trend of mucosal damage and MicroRNAs are among the innovative noninvasive biomarkers. The assessment of a correct gluten-free diet (GFD) is another aspect of CeD monitoring, based upon questionnaires and recently developed tools such as dosage of urinary or faecal gluten immunogenic peptides. SUMMARY: Clinicians lack of a widely acknowledged tools to monitor CeD and GFD. Here, we present the efficacy of the most used markers.
37983763	Efficacy of Antiobesity Medications in Patients With Celiac Disease on a Gluten-free Diet: A Retrospective Matched Cohort Study.	GOALS: We aim to describe the weight loss outcomes of patients with celiac disease (CeD) taking antiobesity medications (AOMs) and compare it with the weight loss outcomes of patients without CeD taking AOMs. BACKGROUND: Increasing rates of obesity and obesity-associated comorbidities have been previously reported in patients with CeD on a gluten-free diet. The effectiveness of AOMs in this population has not been previously described. METHODS: In our retrospective cohort study, we matched 39 patients with treated CeD to 78 patients without CeD based on sex and AOM. We assessed the weight loss outcomes at 3, 6, and 12 months after starting the AOM in both cohorts and analyzed if there was a differential response when comparing by type of AOM [injectable glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists vs. oral non-GLP-1 AOMs]. RESULTS: Both cohorts had similar baseline demographic and anthropometric characteristics. At 12 months, the CeD cohort had a nonsignificantly inferior total body weight loss percentage compared with the cohort without CeD (6.5% vs. 9.5%, P=0.13). The CeD cohort had a similar proportion of patients achieving a total body weight loss percentage of >=5% than the cohort without CeD (72.7% vs. 72.1%, P=1.00). No significant difference was observed when comparing the weight loss outcomes of injectables (GLP-1 receptor agonists) to oral AOMs. The proportion of patients reporting side effects was similar for both groups, regardless of the type of AOM. CONCLUSION: Patients with CeD taking AOMs had similar weight loss outcomes to patients without CeD. Hence, AOMs can be a safe and effective therapy for weight management in patients with CeD.
30240477	Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy imitating Crohn's disease: a rare cause of malnutrition.	Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE) is a rare autosomal recessive disease caused by a mutation in the TYMP gene encoding thymidine phosphorylase. MNGIE causes gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms in homozygous individuals and is often misdiagnosed as anorexia nervosa, inflammatory bowel disease, or celiac disease. We present the case of a 26-year-old female with MNGIE, who was initially diagnosed with anorexia nervosa and Crohn's disease. The diagnosis of MNGIE was established by biochemical confirmation of elevated serum and urine thymidine and deoxyuridine levels after multiple examinations and several years of disease progression and ineffective treatment. Subsequent molecular genetic testing demonstrated a homozygous TYMP gene mutation. MNGIE should be considered in patients with unexplained malnutrition, intestinal dysmotility, and atypical neurological symptoms.
25238121	High adherence to a gluten-free diet in adolescents with screening-detected celiac disease.	OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate the gluten-free diet (GFD) adherence after 1 year of follow-up in children with screening-detected celiac disease (CD) in a general population. METHODS: A total of 18,325 twelve-year-olds were invited to participate in a population-based CD screening (Exploring the Iceberg of Celiacs in Sweden), of whom 13,279 participated. In 240 children, CD was detected through elevated anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies 2 (TG2-IgA) and verified by a small-intestinal biopsy. This substudy included 210 children with TG2-IgA, evaluated both at the initial biopsy occasion and at 1-year follow-up. GFD adherence was evaluated by a combination of TG2-IgA measurements and self-reported adherence (n = 193). RESULTS: After 1 year, 85% (179/210) had normalized TG2-IgA levels (<5 U/mL). Among those who had >50 U/mL at diagnosis, 25% (16/63) still had elevated TG2-IgA, but for the majority their initial values were more than halved. Most reported a high level of GFD adherence ("always" 82% [158/193] and "often" 16% [30/193]), and 75% [145/193] reported always adhering combined with normalized TG2-IgA. Although reporting that they were always adherent, 13 (6.7%) had not yet normalized their TG2-IgA levels completely; however, a majority of these initially had the highest TG2-IgA levels. CONCLUSIONS: GFD adherence is high in adolescents with CD detected by screening of the general population of Swedish 12-year-olds. Almost all of them had normalized serology and reported GFD adherence at the 1-year follow-up. A few adolescents who reported GFD adherence, however, had elevated TG2-IgA levels, suggesting more severe disease and/or nonadherence.
38983964	Aspergillus niger prolyl endopeptidase in celiac disease.	We comment here on the article by Stefanolo et al entitled "Effect of Aspergillus niger prolyl endopeptidase in patients with celiac disease on a long-term gluten-free diet", published in the World Journal of Gastroenterology. Celiac disease is a well-recognized systemic autoimmune disorder. In genetically susceptible people, the most evident damage is located in the small intestine, and is caused and worsened by the ingestion of gluten. For that reason, celiac patients adopt a gluten-free diet (GFD), but it has some limitations, and it does not prevent re-exposure to gluten. Research aims to develop adjuvant therapies, and one of the most studied alternatives is supplementation with Aspergillus niger prolyl endopeptidase protease (AN-PEP), which is able to degrade gluten in the stomach, reducing its concentration in the small intestine. The study found a high adherence to the GFD, but did not address AN-PEP as a gluten immunogenic peptide reducer, as it was only tested in patients following a GFD and not in gluten-exposing conditions. This study opens up new research perspectives in this area and shows that further study is needed to clarify the points that are still in doubt.
29206754	Abdominal Ultrasound Does Not Reveal Significant Alterations in Patients With Nonceliac Wheat Sensitivity.	GOALS: The goal of this study was (A) to evaluate abdominal ultrasound signs in nonceliac wheat sensitivity (NCWS) patients for features useful in diagnosis and (B) to compare these aspects with those of celiac patients to assess whether ultrasound can be useful in the differential diagnosis between NCWS and celiac disease (CD). BACKGROUND: NCWS diagnosis is difficult as no biomarkers of this condition have as yet been identified. In CD ultrasound aspects have been identified that have a good diagnostic accuracy. STUDY: We prospectively recruited 45 NCWS patients (11 males, 34 females; mean age 35.7 y). Three control groups were included: (A) 99 age-matched CD patients; (B) 18 patients with seronegative CD; (C) 50 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) who did not improve on a wheat-free diet. NCWS diagnosis was confirmed on the basis of an elimination diet and double-blind placebo-controlled (DBPC) challenge. Ultrasound sign investigation included: dilatation of the small bowel loops, thickening of the small bowel wall, hyperperistalsis, enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes, ascites, hyposplenism, altered diameter of the portal vein. RESULTS: NCWS patients showed a low frequency of pathologic ultrasound findings. Dilated or thickened loops appeared more often in CD patients than in NCWS patients (88.8% vs. 20%; P<0.0001). These US signs were significantly more frequent in seronegative CD than in NCWS patients (both P<0.0001), whereas no difference was found between NCWS patients and IBS controls. CONCLUSIONS: In NCWS patients' ultrasound does not show a characteristic pattern which could be helpful for diagnosis. However, US can be useful to differentiate between NCWS and CD patients and especially those with seronegative CD. (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03017274).
37879521	Gluten-Related Disorders from Bench to Bedside.	Celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, and wheat allergy comprise three of the main conditions with wheat and gluten-containing foods as the symptom trigger. Distinguishing between these entities can be daunting. In this review we compare and contrast celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, and wheat allergy to allow clinicians to determine which diagnosis fits their patient to facilitate high-quality management and longitudinal care.
25516648	Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for non-malignant gastrointestinal diseases.	Both, autologous and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can be used to cure or ameliorate a variety of malignant and non-malignant diseases. The rationale behind this strategy is based on the concept of immunoablation using high-dose chemotherapy, with subsequent regeneration of naive T-lymphocytes derived from reinfused hematopoietic progenitor cells. In addition, the use of HSCT allows for the administration of high-dose chemotherapy (whether or not combined with immunomodulating agents such as antithymocyte globulin) resulting in a prompt remission in therapy-refractory patients. This review gives an update of the major areas of successful uses of HSCT in non-malignant gastrointestinal disorders. A Medline search has been conducted and all relevant published data were analyzed. HSCT has been proved successful in treating refractory Crohn's disease (CD). Patients with refractory celiac disease type II and a high risk of developing enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma have shown promising improvement. Data concerning HSCT and mesenchymal SCT in end-stage chronic liver diseases are encouraging. In refractory autoimmune gastrointestinal diseases high-dose chemotherapy followed by HSCT seems feasible and safe and might result in long-term improvement of disease activity. Mesenchymal SCT for a selected group of CD is promising and may represent a significant therapeutic alternative in treating fistulas in CD. 
33717129	Celiac Disease Causes Epithelial Disruption and Regulatory T Cell Recruitment in the Oral Mucosa.	Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by an immune-triggered enteropathy upon gluten intake. The only current treatment available is lifelong Gluten Free Diet (GFD). Several extraintestinal manifestations have been described in CD, some affecting the oral mucosa. Thus, we hypothesized that oral mucosa could potentially be a target for novel biomarkers and an administration route for CD treatment. Six de novo diagnosed and seven CD patients under GFD for at least 1 year were recruited. Non-celiac subjects (n = 8) were recruited as control group. Two biopsies of the cheek lining were taken from each subject for mRNA analysis and immunohistochemical characterization. We observed a significant decrease in the expression of epithelial junction proteins in all CD patients, indicating that oral mucosa barrier integrity is compromised. FoxP3+ population was greatly increased in CD patients, suggesting that Tregs are recruited to the damaged mucosa, even after avoidance of gluten. Amphiregulin mRNA levels from Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) and epithelial damage in the oral mucosa correlated with Treg infiltration in all the experimental groups, suggesting that recruited Tregs might display a "repair" phenotype. Based on these results, we propose that oral mucosa is altered in CD and, as such, might have diagnostic potential. Furthermore, due to its tolerogenic nature, it could be an important target for oral immunotherapy.

24313911	Inorganic and total arsenic contents in rice-based foods for children with celiac disease.	Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease that affects the villi of the small intestine causing abdominal pain, gas, diarrhea, or bad absorption due to gluten intolerance. The only treatment for this disease consists of a lifelong gluten free diet; this is, celiac people cannot consume products containing gluten, such as wheat, barley, and rye, but they can use rice and corn. Thus, rice flour is mainly used for the manufacturing of the basic products of this population. Unfortunately, rice can contain high contents of total (t-As) and inorganic (i-As) arsenic. The current study demonstrated that products for celiac children with a high percentage of rice contained high concentrations of arsenic (256 and 128 mug kg-1). The daily intake of i-As ranged from 0.61 to 0.78 mug kg-1 body weight (bw) in children up to 5 y of age; these values were below the maximum value established by the EFSA Panel (8.0 mug kg-1 bw per day), but it should be considered typical of populations with a high exposure to this pollutant. Finally, legislation is needed to improve the labeling of these special rice-based foods for celiac children; label should include information about percentage, geographical origin, and cultivar of the used rice.
31035487	Gluten Vehicle and Placebo for Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity Assessment.	Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a syndrome characterized by gastrointestinal and extraintestinal manifestations triggered after gluten ingestion in the absence of celiac disease and wheat allergy. Because of the lack of biomarkers for NCGS diagnosis, the cornerstone for its assessment is a single- or double-blind placebo-controlled (DBPC) gluten challenge. However, there are some non-standardized points in the diagnostic approach proposed by the experts. This complicate comparisons among the results published by different research groups. The gluten vehicle and placebo must be indistinguishable from each other, which entails sensory and technological evaluations of the designed gluten vehicle and placebo products. At the moment, there is no standardized method for the preparation of the gluten vehicle and placebo for carrying out DBPC gluten challenges for NCGS assessment. This review focuses on the challenges that researchers have to face, either for the development of an accepted gluten vehicle and placebo or for identifying NCGS cases on the basis of DBPC gluten challenges.
24619056	Celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity? An approach to clinical differential diagnosis.	OBJECTIVES: Differentiating between celiac disease (CD) and non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is important for appropriate management but is often challenging. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed records from 238 patients who presented for the evaluation of symptoms responsive to gluten restriction without prior diagnosis or exclusion of CD. Demographics, presenting symptoms, serologic, genetic, and histologic data, nutrient deficiencies, personal history of autoimmune diseases, and family history of CD were recorded. NCGS was defined as symptoms responsive to a gluten-free diet (GFD) in the setting of negative celiac serology and duodenal biopsies while on a gluten-containing diet or negative human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQ2/DQ8 testing. RESULTS: Of the 238 study subjects, 101 had CD, 125 had NCGS, 9 had non-celiac enteropathy, and 3 had indeterminate diagnosis. CD subjects presented with symptoms of malabsorption 67.3% of the time compared with 24.8% of the NCGS subjects (P<0.0001). In addition, CD subjects were significantly more likely to have a family history of CD (P=0.004), personal history of autoimmune diseases (P=0.002), or nutrient deficiencies (P<0.0001). The positive likelihood ratio for diagnosis of CD of a >2x upper limit of normal IgA trans-glutaminase antibody (tTG) or IgA/IgG deaminated gliadan peptide antibody (DGP) with clinical response to GFD was 130 (confidence interval (CI): 18.5-918.3). The positive likelihood ratio of the combination of gluten-responsive symptoms and negative IgA tTG or IgA/IgG DGP on a regular diet for NCGS was 9.6 (CI: 5.5-16.9). When individuals with negative IgA tTG or IgA/IgG DGP also lacked symptoms of malabsorption (weight loss, diarrhea, and nutrient deficiencies) and CD risk factors (personal history of autoimmune diseases and family history of CD), the positive likelihood ratio for NCGS increased to 80.9. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of our findings, we have developed a diagnostic algorithm to differentiate CD from NCGS. Subjects with negative celiac serologies (IgA tTG or IgA/IgG DGP) on a regular diet are unlikely to have CD. Those with negative serology who also lack clinical evidence of malabsorption and CD risk factors are highly likely to have NCGS and may not require further testing. Those with equivocal serology should undergo HLA typing to determine the need for biopsy.
33669442	Multidimensional Disadvantages of a Gluten-Free Diet in Celiac Disease: A Narrative Review.	A gluten-free diet is the mainstay method of treatment and the prevention of celiac disease complications. However, an inadequately balanced gluten-free diet can increase the risk of obesity, negatively affect glucose and lipid metabolism, and increase the risk of the metabolic syndrome. Therefore, an adequate nutritional counselling is necessary for patients diagnosed with celiac disease in order to prevent and treat the components of the metabolic syndrome.

27647622	Prevalence of Celiac Disease Is Not Increased in ADHD Sample.	Objective: The purpose of the present study was to examine the prevalence of celiac disease (CD) in children and adolescents with ADHD. Method: In all, 102 participants between 4 and 18 years of age diagnosed with ADHD participated in the study (M = 12.8 years; 84 boys and 18 girls). CD was diagnosed according to the adapted guidelines of the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPHGAN). Results: Among 102 tested children and teenagers with ADHD, we did not find anyone with suspected CD, so further diagnostic procedures for CD were not indicated. Conclusion: In our sample of children and teenagers with ADHD, the prevalence of CD was not higher than in the general population. On the basis of the obtained results and the results of similar studies, we conclude that there are not enough data to support screening for CD and the introduction of a gluten-free diet in children with ADHD unless there are additional indications.
32890754	Functional Abdominal Pain Disorders and Constipation in Children on Gluten-Free Diet.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: We studied the prevalence of functional abdominal pain disorders (FAPDs) and functional constipation (FC) in a large prospective cohort of children with celiac disease on a strict gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study, from 2016 through 2018, in a tertiary care center in Italy, of 417 patients (37% male; mean age, 13.7 y) with a diagnosis of celiac disease (European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology, and Nutrition criteria) who had been on a strict GFD for more than 1 year and had negative results from serologic tests after being on the GFD. Parents and children (>10 y) were asked to fill in a questionnaire on pediatric gastrointestinal symptoms, according to Rome IV criteria. Patients' closest siblings (or cousins) who had negative results from serologic test for celiac disease were used as controls (n = 373; 39% male; mean age, 13.5 y). RESULTS: We found a higher prevalence of FAPDs among patients with celiac disease (11.5%) than controls (6.7%) (P < .05); the relative risk (RR) was 1.8 (95% CI, 1.1-3.0). Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and FC defined by the Rome IV criteria were more prevalent in patients with celiac disease (7.2% for IBS and 19.9% for FC) than controls (3.2% for IBS and 10.5% for FC) (P < .05 and P < .001, respectively); the RR for IBS was 2.3 (95% CI, 1.1-4.6) and the RR for functional constipation was 2.1 (95% CI, 1.4-3.2). We found no differences in the prevalence of other subtypes of FAPDs. A logistic regression showed that younger age (P < .05) and a higher level of anti-transglutaminase IgA at diagnosis (P < .04) were associated with FAPDs (in particular for IBS) irrespective of GFD duration. CONCLUSIONS: Celiac disease is associated with an increased risk of IBS and FC. Strategies are needed to manage IBS and FC in patients with celiac disease.
28153477	At-Risk Screened Children with Celiac Disease are Comparable in Disease Severity and Dietary Adherence to Those Found because of Clinical Suspicion: A Large Cohort Study.	OBJECTIVE: To assess whether children at risk for celiac disease should be screened systematically by comparing their baseline and follow-up characteristics to patients detected because of clinical suspicion. STUDY DESIGN: Five hundred four children with celiac disease were divided into screen-detected (n = 145) and clinically detected cohorts (n = 359). The groups were compared for clinical, serologic, and histologic characteristics and laboratory values. Follow-up data regarding adherence and response to gluten-free diet were compared. Subgroup analyses were made between asymptomatic and symptomatic screen-detected patients. RESULTS: Of screen-detected patients, 51.8% had symptoms at diagnosis, although these were milder than in clinically detected children (P < .001). Anemia (7.1% vs 22.9%, P < .001) and poor growth (15.7% vs 36.9%, P < .001) were more common, and hemoglobin (126 g/l vs 124 g/l, P = .008) and albumin (41.0 g/l vs 38.0 g/l, P = .016) were lower in clinically detected patients. There were no differences in serology or histology between the groups. Screen-detected children had better dietary adherence (91.2% vs 83.2%, P = .047). The groups showed equal clinical response (97.5% vs 96.2%, P = .766) to the gluten-free diet. In subgroup analysis among screen-detected children, asymptomatic patients were older than symptomatic (9.0  vs 5.8 years of age, P = .007), but the groups were comparable in other variables. CONCLUSIONS: More than one-half of the screen-detected patients with celiac disease had symptoms unrecognized at diagnosis. The severity of histologic damage, antibody levels, dietary adherence, and response to treatment in screen-detected cases is comparable with those detected on a clinical basis. The results support active screening for celiac disease among at-risk children.
22157921	Refeeding syndrome in children in developing countries who have celiac disease.	OBJECTIVES: The clinical presentations of celiac crisis and refeeding syndrome in celiac disease are almost similar, but information about refeeding syndrome is scarce. We are reporting for the first time 5 cases of refeeding syndrome in children with celiac disease that could have otherwise been labeled as celiac crisis. METHODS: From January to December 2010, a chart review of hospital records of all celiac disease cases was performed, and refeeding syndrome was ascribed in those celiac patients who deteriorated clinically after initiation of a gluten-free diet and had biochemical parameters suggestive of refeeding syndrome such as hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypoalbuminemia. RESULTS: Of the total 35 celiac disease patients, 5 (median age 6.5 [range 2.2-10] years, 3 boys) were identified as having refeeding syndrome. All 5 children were severely malnourished (body mass index <14 kg/m) and all of them had anemia, hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hypoalbuminemia, and hypocalcemia, meaning that they had the perfect setting for developing refeeding syndrome. At the same time, their clinical features fulfilled the criteria for celiac crisis except that their symptoms have worsened after the introduction of a gluten-free diet. Nevertheless, instead of using steroids, they were managed as refeeding syndrome in terms of correction of electrolytes and gradual feeding, and that led to a successful outcome in all of them. CONCLUSIONS: Severely malnourished patients with celiac disease are at risk of developing potentially life-threatening refeeding syndrome, which may mimic celiac crisis, especially in developing countries. Early recognition and appropriate treatment are the keys to a successful outcome.
33847288	Association Between Celiac Disease and Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Systematic Review.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to perform a systematic review assessing the research investigating the association between celiac disease (CD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). METHODS: A literature search of MEDLINE and EMBASE was performed without limits placed on year or language. Observational studies reporting on the occurrence of CD among patients with ASD and/or the occurrence of ASD among patients with CD were included. Study design, characteristics, diagnostic criteria for ASD and CD, and the frequency of positive cases in the studied sample were recorded. Study quality was assessed using an adapted Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Due to substantial heterogeneity between studies, a meta-analysis was not performed. RESULTS: Of the 298 unique citations identified within our search strategy, 17 articles evaluating the association between CD and ASD were included. Of those articles, 13 observed samples of patients with ASD, and 6 observed samples of patients with CD. Overall, most studies had small sample sizes and reported no evidence for an association between the 2 conditions. However, a limited number of population-based studies of higher quality suggested a potential association between CD and ASD. CONCLUSIONS: Most studies assessing an association between CD and ASD are at risk for systematic and/or random error. A potential link has, however, been shown in a handful of high-quality studies, and, therefore, this comorbidity cannot be ruled out. Future studies should recruit larger sample sizes, include precise definitions of CD and ASD, and exclude patients with ASD on a gluten-free diet.
34960046	Factors Associated with Maladaptive Eating Behaviors, Social Anxiety, and Quality of Life in Adults with Celiac Disease.	A gluten-free diet (GFD), which is the only treatment for celiac disease (CeD), is challenging and associated with higher levels of anxiety, disordered eating, and lower quality of life (QOL). We examined various demographic and health factors associated with social anxiety, eating attitudes and behaviors, and QOL. Demographics and health characteristics, QOL, eating attitudes and behaviors, and social anxiety of adults with CeD were acquired using validated measures. The mean scores for QOL, SAQ, and CDFAB were compared across various demographic groups using the Z statistical test. The mean QOL score was 57.8, which is in the moderate range. The social anxiety mean scores were high: 78.82, with 9% meeting the clinical cutoff for social anxiety disorder. Those on a GFD for a short duration had significantly higher SAQ scores (worse anxiety), higher CDFAB scores (worse eating attitudes and behavior), and lower QOL scores. Those aged 23-35 years had lower QOL scores (p < 0.003) and higher SAQ scores (p < 0.003). Being single (p < 0.001) and female (p = 0.026) were associated with higher SAQ scores. These findings suggest that the development of targeted interventions to maximize QOL and healthy eating behaviors as well as to minimize anxiety is imperative for some adults with CeD.
22891176	Gluten-free diet does not appear to induce endoscopic remission of eosinophilic esophagitis in children with coexistent celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease and eosinophilic esophagitis are usually considered to be separate gastrointestinal diseases; however, it appears that they may coexist more often than would be expected. It is unknown whether eosinophilic esophagitis in patients with celiac disease responds to a gluten-free diet. OBJECTIVES: To examine the clinical, endoscopic and histological features of children with both conditions to evaluate whether eosinophilic esophagitis responds to a gluten-free diet. METHODS: From January 1, 2009, to June 30, 2011, the medical records of children <18 years of age diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis and/or celiac disease were reviewed. Patients with clinical, endoscopic and histological diagnoses of both diseases were identified and included. These findings were analyzed, as were laboratory results, treatment and follow-up. RESULTS: During the study period, there were 206 celiac disease patients, 86 eosinophilic esophagitis patients and nine (4.4% of total celiac) patients with both diagnoses. Gluten-free diet was the primary treatment for both conditions in seven of nine (78%) cases. In six of these seven (86%) patients, no endoscopic or histological improvement of eosinophilic esophagitis was observed, while in one patient, histological remission of esophageal eosinophilia occurred while on a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of eosinophilic esophagitis in patients with celiac disease was 4.4%, confirming a higher than expected prevalence of eosinophilic esophagitis compared with the general population. In patients with celiac disease, a gluten-free diet did not appear to induce remission of coexistent endoscopic and histological features of eosinophilic esophagitis.
30230372	Cross-Contamination with Gluten by Using Kitchen Utensils: Fact or Fiction?	A risk of cross-contamination exists when preparing a gluten-free (GF) meal in kitchen facilities that usually handle gluten-containing (GC) foods. Cross-contamination with gluten may occur during the preparation or cooking process; however, published data are lacking on gluten cross-contamination from kitchenware. This study was conducted to determine whether cross-contamination occurs through shared domestic kitchenware and, if so, which cleaning method is most reliable for avoiding this cross-contamination. Kitchenware (wooden spoon, colander, ladle, and knife) previously used to cook and/or prepare GC foods was used for the preparation of GF foods (bread and pasta). The gluten concentration of the GF foods was then determined using an established enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A PCR assay was also used to detect the presence of wheat omega-gliadin DNA in the food samples. Three cleaning methods were assessed to determine the concentrations of gluten and wheat DNA in GF foods cooked with utensils cleaned directly after the preparation of GC foods. Contrary to our expectations, gluten was not detected in relevant and quantifiable amounts in our samples (<20 mg/kg). The cleaning method used did not influence gluten concentrations: all samples contained <10 mg/kg. Based on PCR analyses, the only sample with lower cycle threshold ( CT) values (i.e., higher concentration of wheat DNA) was from the contaminated ladle used to serve GF pasta. This outcome led to the hypothesis that shared ladles pose a higher risk for contamination of GF foods than do shared wooden spoons, colanders, or knives. Cross-contamination with gluten in a kitchen environment may occur, but kitchen utensils used for preparing GC pasta and for cutting GC bread should not pose a relevant problem to patients with celiac disease, at least in a domestic environment.
25523228	Association of lymphocytic colitis and lactase deficiency in pediatric population.	Characterized by colonic mucosa intraepithelial lymphocytosis, lymphocytic colitis is primarily an entity presented in the middle-aged to elderly patient population. Very few large series of lymphocytic colitis of childhood occurrence are available in the medical literature. Ten cases each of lymphocytic colitis and of colonic lymphocytosis of other diagnosis, all with duodenal disaccharidases analysis data, were collected from the files of our institution. The electronic medical records were reviewed and multiple variables were analyzed. The ten patients with lymphocytic colitis presented with diarrhea. Of these, three had abdominal pain. The age range was 2-18 years. Nearly all patients were Caucasian (90%) and 70% were female. Endoscopically, most had normal appearing colonic mucosa. Significant past medical history, family medical history and associated comorbidities included celiac disease, Down syndrome, juvenile arthritis and other autoimmune diseases. Interestingly, the most revealing observation was that the majority of cases (80%) were associated with lactase deficiency and, for the most part, gastrointestinal symptoms improved simply by treatment with Lactaid or avoidance of dairy products. This association is statistically significant. Our clinicopathological study indicates that the typical pediatric patient is a female Caucasian. A large of portion of the patients had associated lactase deficiency and improved on Lactaid supplement alone. 
31970587	The Impact of a Gluten-Free Diet on Celiac Disease: A Comprehensive Evaluation of Two Cases Using NIH Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMIS, NTCB, and Neuro-QoL).	The aim of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the gluten-free diet (GFD) for celiac disease (CD) in a multidisciplinary outpatient Gastroenterology clinic with two adult cases using the innovative, paradigm-shifting measurement systems: The NIH Patient reported outcome measures (PROs). CD results in gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction, but is also associated with other inflammatory responses, psychosocial impairment, and cognitive deficits such as "brain fog." Adherence to the GFD for 6 months was associated with improvement in specific GI symptoms in one case (PROMIS-GI; Case 2) and improvement in cognitive functioning (NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery) and psychosocial functioning (Neuro-QOL) in both cases. Notably, improvement in cognitive flexibility occurred in both younger and an older adult patient. This suggests that cognitive decline and the psychosocial deficits associated with CD are reversible with GFD. The NIH PROs were found to be effective, sensitive to change, and minimally disruptive to clinic operations.
24124328	Consumption of gluten with gluten-degrading enzyme by celiac patients: a pilot-study.	AIM: To assesses the safety and efficacy of Aspergillus niger prolyl endoprotease (AN-PEP) to mitigate the immunogenic effects of gluten in celiac patients. METHODS: Patients with initial diagnosis of celiac disease as confirmed by positive serology with subtotal or total villous atrophy on duodenal biopsies who adhere to a strict gluten-free diet (GFD) resulting in normalised antibodies and mucosal healing classified as Marsh 0 or I were included. In a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled pilot study, patients consumed toast (approximately 7 g/d gluten) with AN-PEP for 2 wk (safety phase). After a 2-wk washout period with adherence of the usual GFD, 14 patients were randomised to gluten intake with either AN-PEP or placebo for 2 wk (efficacy phase). Measurements at baseline included complaints, quality-of-life, serum antibodies, immunophenotyping of T-cells and duodenal mucosa immunohistology. Furthermore, serum and quality of life questionnaires were collected during and after the safety, washout and efficacy phase. Duodenal biopsies were collected after the safety phase and after the efficacy phase. A change in histological evaluation according to the modified Marsh classification was the primary endpoint. RESULTS: In total, 16 adults were enrolled in the study. No serious adverse events occurred during the trial and no patients withdrew during the trial. The mean score for the gastrointestinal subcategory of the celiac disease quality (CDQ) was relatively high throughout the study, indicating that AN-PEP was well tolerated. In the efficacy phase, the CDQ scores of patients consuming gluten with placebo or gluten with AN-PEP did not significantly deteriorate and moreover no differences between the groups were observed. During the efficacy phase, neither the placebo nor the AN-PEP group developed significant antibody titers. The IgA-EM concentrations remained negative in both groups. Two patients were excluded from entering the efficacy phase as their mucosa showed an increase of two Marsh steps after the safety phase, yet with undetectable serum antibodies, while 14 patients were considered histologically stable on gluten with AN-PEP. Also after the efficacy phase, no significant deterioration was observed regarding immunohistological and flow cytometric evaluation in the group consuming placebo compared to the group receiving AN-PEP. Furthermore, IgA-tTG deposit staining increased after 2 wk of gluten compared to baseline in four out of seven patients on placebo. In the seven patients receiving AN-PEP, one patient showed increased and one showed decreased IgA-tTG deposits. CONCLUSION: AN-PEP appears to be well tolerated. However, the primary endpoint was not met due to lack of clinical deterioration upon placebo, impeding an effect of AN-PEP.
27387923	High levels of immunoglobulin A anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies at diagnosis are a predictive factor for celiac hepatitis.	INTRODUCTION: Celiac hepatitis is characterized by the presence of liver injury in patients with celiac disease that resolves after gluten-free diet. AIM: To evaluate predictive factors of celiac hepatitis at celiac disease diagnosis. METHODS: Retrospective study including 46 adult patients with the diagnosis of celiac disease. RESULTS: Eighty-seven percent were women, with a mean age of 33 +- 11 years, 87% had a Marsh 3 and 46% (n = 21) had celiac hepatitis. These patients had a median Immunoglobulin A anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody (TTG-IgA) level of 208.0 U/ml (p25-p75: 89-1316 U/ml), a mean aspartate aminotransferase of 42 +- 24 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 50 +- 28 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 111 +- 64 U/L, at the time of diagnosis. Median TTG-IgA one year after diagnosis was 9U/ml (p25-p75: 4.5-30.5 U/ml) and 33% of the patients had normal values. At diagnosis, patients without celiac hepatitis had a median TTG-IgA of 77U/ml (p25-p75: 24-288 U/ml), mean aspartate aminotransferase of 23 +- 4 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 20 +- 6 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 69 +- 17 U/L. Median of TTG-IgA one year after diagnosis was 6 U/ml (p25-p75: 3-19 U/ml) and 48% had normal values. The celiac hepatitis group patients had higher values of TTG-IgA (p = 0.007) at diagnosis. There was a statistically significant positive correlation between TTG-IgA and alanine aminotransferase (r = 0.324, p = 0.028) at diagnosis. The odds of having celiac hepatitis was almost 5-fold higher in patients with a TTG-IgA level higher than 310 U/ml (OR = 4.8, 95%CI = 1.213-18.781, p = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: Higher TTG-IgA levels are a predictive factor for celiac hepatitis in adult patients with celiac disease at diagnosis.

25410283	Transglutaminase as a therapeutic target for celiac disease.	INTRODUCTION: The only current treatment for celiac disease is a strict gluten-free diet. The ubiquitous presence of gluten in groceries, however, makes the diet burdensome and difficult to maintain, and alternative treatment options are thus needed. Here, the important role of transglutaminase 2 (TG2) in the pathogenesis of celiac disease makes it an attractive target for drug development. AREAS COVERED: The present paper gives an overview of TG2 and addresses its significance in the pathogenesis of celiac disease. Moreover, the article summarizes preclinical studies performed with TG2 inhibitors and scrutinizes issues related to this therapeutic approach. EXPERT OPINION: Activation of TG2 in the intestinal mucosa is central in celiac disease pathogenesis and researchers have therefore suggested TG2 inhibitors as a potential therapeutic approach. However, a prerequisite for such a drug is that it should be specific for TG2 and not affect the activity of other members of the transglutaminase family. Such compounds have already been introduced and tested in vitro, but a major obstacle to further development is the lack of a well-defined animal model for celiac disease. Nonetheless, with encouraging results in preclinical studies clinical trials with TG2 inhibitors are eagerly awaited.
35466089	Seronegative Celiac Disease in Patients with Isolated Refractory Dyspepsia and Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease.	Background/Aims: To investigate the presence of seronegative celiac disease in patients with isolated refractory dyspepsia and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)-related complaints. Methods: This was a single-center, prospective study performed at a tertiary care referral hospital. Among 968 consecutive patients, 129 seronegative patients with tissue damage consistent with Marsh IIIa classification or above were included. The patients were divided into two groups: dyspepsia (n=78) and GERD (n=51). Biopsies were taken from the duodenum regardless of endoscopic appearance, and patients with Marsh IIIa or above damage were advised to consume a gluten-free diet. The Glasgow Dyspepsia Severity (GDS) score, Reflux Symptom Index (RSI), and Biagi score were calculated at baseline and every 3 months. Control endoscopy was performed every 6 months during follow-up. Results: The median follow-up time was 19.9 months (range, 6 to 24 months) in the dyspepsia group and 19.2 months (range, 6 to 24 months) in the GERD group. All the patients were positive for the HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 haplotypes. The differences between the mean GDS scores (14.3+-2.1 vs 1.1+-0.2, respectively, p<0.05), RSI scores (6.3+-0.8 vs 0.7+-0.1, respectively, p<0.05), and Biagi scores (3.1+-0.4 vs 0.7+-0.3 in the dyspepsia group and 2.5+-0.4 vs 0.5+-0.2 in GERD group) before and after implementation of the gluten-free diet were statistically significant. The decreases in the scores were consistent with improvements in the histological findings. There was no significant correlation between endoscopic appearance and histological examination results (p=0.487). Conclusions: Seronegative celiac disease may be considered in this group of patients. Even if a patient is seronegative and has normal endoscopic findings, duodenal biopsy should be considered.
34248079	[Celiac disease:a case report detailing clinical and pathological improvement with a gluten-free diet].	Celiac disease has a morbidity of 0.2 to 1% in Europe and the United States (US), but appears to be extremely rare in Japan with only a few case reports. This report details a Japanese woman with celiac disease diagnosed by histopathological findings and the improvement of her clinical symptoms on a gluten-free diet. The woman was in her 60s and presented with diarrhea, abdominal pain, and vomiting which were repeatedly exacerbated over several weeks. Therefore, she was referred to our hospital for a detailed examination and treatment. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a crude granular mucosa with an erythematous color in the duodenum. No special findings were noted on colonoscopy or capsular endoscopy. Histopathological findings of the duodenum noted villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and lymphocytic infiltration within the surface epithelium, which were suspicious for celiac disease. A gluten-free diet was started which resulted in improved clinical symptoms. Repeat endoscopic imaging and histopathological findings after initiation of the gluten-free diet demonstrated improved small bowel villous atrophy. In this case, appropriate testing had ruled out inflammatory bowel disease, amyloidosis, infectious enteritis, parasitic disease, and allergies. Although anti-gliadin antibody (AGA) and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody (ATTGA) were serologically negative, and HLA typing was HLA-DQ6, the patient was ultimately diagnosed as having celiac disease based on the characteristic pathological findings and clinical course. In many cases of celiac disease reported in Japan, serum antibodies such as AGA and ATTGA have not been detected, and HLA testing has been negative for DQ2 or DQ8. Therefore, it is possible that celiac disease in Japan might have different genetic and immunological characteristics than the disease in the US and Europe. In the future, additional cases with histology and molecular biological analysis are necessary to test this hypothesis.
24026574	Is gluten a cause of gastrointestinal symptoms in people without celiac disease?	The avoidance of wheat- and gluten-containing products is a worldwide phenomenon. While celiac disease is a well-established entity, the evidence base for gluten as a trigger of symptoms in patients without celiac disease (so-called 'non-celiac gluten sensitivity' or NCGS) is limited. The problems lie in the complexity of wheat and the ability of its carbohydrate as well as protein components to trigger gastrointestinal symptoms, the potentially false assumption that response to a gluten-free diet equates to an effect of gluten withdrawal, and diagnostic criteria for coeliac disease. Recent randomized controlled re-challenge trials have suggested that gluten may worsen gastrointestinal symptoms, but failed to confirm patients with self-perceived NCGS have specific gluten sensitivity. Furthermore, mechanisms by which gluten triggers symptoms have yet to be identified. This review discusses the most recent scientific evidence and our current understanding of NCGS. 
25132754	Hepatitis B vaccine by intradermal route in non responder patients: an update.	Vaccination is the main prophylactic measure to reduce the mortality caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in healthy subjects since the immune response to hepatitis B recombinant vaccination occurs in over 90% of general population. Individuals who develop an anti-HBs titer less than 10 mIU/mL after primary vaccination cycle are defined "no responders". Many factors could cause a non response to the HBV vaccination, such as administration of the vaccine in buttocks, impaired vaccine storage conditions, drug abuse, smoking, infections and obesity. Moreover there are some diseases, like chronic kidney disease, human immunodeficiency virus infection, chronic liver disease, celiac disease, thalassaemia, type I diabetes mellitus, down's syndrome and other forms of mental retardation that are characterized by a poorer response to HBV vaccination than healthy subjects. To date it is still unclear how to treat this group of patients at high risk of hepatitis B infection. Recent studies seem to indicate that the administration of HBV recombinant vaccine by the intradermal route is very effective and could represent a more useful strategy than intramuscular route. This review focuses on the use of anti hepatitis B vaccine by intradermal route as alternative to conventional intramuscular vaccine in all non responder patients. A comprehensive review of the literature using PubMed database, with appropriate terms, was undertaken for articles in English published since 1983. The literature search was undertaken in September 2013. 
33607573	Immune-mediated enteropathies: From bench to bedside.	Immune-mediated enteropathies are caused by excessive reactions of the intestinal immune system towards non-pathogenic molecules. Enteropathy leads to malabsorption-related symptoms and include (severe) chronic diarrhea, weight loss and vitamin deficiencies. Parenteral feeding and immunosuppressive therapy are needed in severe cases. Celiac disease has long been recognized as the most common immune-mediated enteropathy in adults, but the spectrum of immune-mediated enteropathies has been expanding. Histological and clinical features are sometimes shared among these enteropathies, and therefore it may be challenging to differentiate between them. Here, we provide an overview of immune-mediated enteropathies focused on clinical presentation, establishing diagnosis, immunopathogenesis, and treatment options.
28499697	Assessment of dietary compliance in celiac children using a standardized dietary interview.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Compliance to a gluten free diet (GFD) in celiac disease (CD) is ideally assessed by dietary interviews, albeit time-consuming. Short dietary questionnaires have been developed for adults but not for children. Primary aim was to compare GFD compliance in celiac children, measured by a short dietary questionnaire against a dietary interview. Secondary aims were correlation between both questionnaires and celiac antibodies and identifying variables predicting noncompliance. METHODS: Between 2012 and 2014, participants in the E-health CoelKids study, completed a short dietary questionnaire and standardized dietary interview together with measurement of anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (TG2A). Results of the questionnaires were assigned under similar categories. Factors possibly influencing dietary compliance were recorded. Where appropriate, Pearson's Chi-square test for trend, unpaired t-test, Cohen's kappa and one-way ANOVA were used. RESULTS: 151 of 165 participating patients were studied, 66% were female. Mean age was 11.3 years (2-26, SD 5.4), mean age at CD diagnosis was 4.9 years (1-23, SD 4.0). The short questionnaire and dietary interview correlated poorly, detecting problems in dietary adherence in 14% and 52% of the patients, respectively (Cohen's kappa 0.034). Only the short questionnaire correlated with TG2A (p = 0.003). Only older age was associated with noncompliance, the mean age of completely nonadherent, adherent but committing errors, and strictly adherent patients were 15.5, 11.5 and 10.1 years, respectively (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the dietary interview, short dietary questionnaires and TG2A serology failed to detect dietary transgressions in CD children, wherein adolescents were shown to be at highest risk.
21139537	Capsule endoscopy of the small bowel in the clinical practice: outpatient management is feasible and cheaper.	AIM: Four Italian regions have cost coding for outpatient capsule-endoscopy. Elsewhere it is performed in ordinary hospital admission. To identify, in a cohort of patients of a Gastroenterology Unit, those feasible for outpatient versus inpatient treatment; to analyze costs distribution in both management areas. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed 100 clinical records of admissions to A.O. San-Carlo-Borromeo, Milan between 2005-2008. Hospitalization criteria (at least 3): 1) occult/obscure gastrointestinal bleeding; 2) hemoglobin <= 8 gr/dL; 3) indication for blood transfusions; 4) urgent hospital admission. RESULTS: A total of 62 patients had urgent admission, 60 blood transfusions, 81 underwent EGD and colonoscopy, 8 enteroscopy and 5 surgery. Mean haemoglobin value was 8.67 g/dL. Capsule-endoscopy was positive in 70, uncertain in 8, negative in 22. Positive cases: 33 angiodyplasia, 18 ulcers/erosions, 13 polyps/masses, 5 overt bleeding, 1 celiac disease. 47/100 were appropriate as outpatient, saving 432 days of hospital stays. Admission coding was grouped into 7 DRGs (overall expense: 98,366 Euros). Considering EGD/colonoscopy outpatient costs and 1.100 euros as estimated value for capsule-endoscopy, the total expense could be 53.919. CONCLUSION: Outpatient capsule-endoscopy small bowel examination is feasible in half of the cases. It is cost saving, (about 45.000 Euros/100 patients), reducing inappropriate hospital stays.

23648697	No effects of gluten in patients with self-reported non-celiac gluten sensitivity after dietary reduction of fermentable, poorly absorbed, short-chain carbohydrates.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) do not have celiac disease but their symptoms improve when they are placed on gluten-free diets. We investigated the specific effects of gluten after dietary reduction of fermentable, poorly absorbed, short-chain carbohydrates (fermentable, oligo-, di-, monosaccharides, and polyols [FODMAPs]) in subjects believed to have NCGS. METHODS: We performed a double-blind cross-over trial of 37 subjects (aged 24-61 y, 6 men) with NCGS and irritable bowel syndrome (based on Rome III criteria), but not celiac disease. Participants were randomly assigned to groups given a 2-week diet of reduced FODMAPs, and were then placed on high-gluten (16 g gluten/d), low-gluten (2 g gluten/d and 14 g whey protein/d), or control (16 g whey protein/d) diets for 1 week, followed by a washout period of at least 2 weeks. We assessed serum and fecal markers of intestinal inflammation/injury and immune activation, and indices of fatigue. Twenty-two participants then crossed over to groups given gluten (16 g/d), whey (16 g/d), or control (no additional protein) diets for 3 days. Symptoms were evaluated by visual analogue scales. RESULTS: In all participants, gastrointestinal symptoms consistently and significantly improved during reduced FODMAP intake, but significantly worsened to a similar degree when their diets included gluten or whey protein. Gluten-specific effects were observed in only 8% of participants. There were no diet-specific changes in any biomarker. During the 3-day rechallenge, participants' symptoms increased by similar levels among groups. Gluten-specific gastrointestinal effects were not reproduced. An order effect was observed. CONCLUSIONS: In a placebo-controlled, cross-over rechallenge study, we found no evidence of specific or dose-dependent effects of gluten in patients with NCGS placed diets low in FODMAPs.

School nurses play a major role in the care of students with food-related diversities balancing responsibilities such as providing a safe environment, encouraging leadership and community outreach, giving guidance to family and peers with care coordination, and providing needed accommodations so that all students may thrive in the school setting. It is essential that school nurses share their understanding of what it is like to live with the serious genetic autoimmune disorder known as celiac disease. With improved knowledge, the school education team, nutritional staff, and guidance counselors will have a better understanding of what the student is facing and the unique challenges it presents, because celiac disease is not a food allergy, but much more.
34339872	Larazotide acetate for treatment of celiac disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.	PURPOSE: The standard of care for treatment of celiac disease (CD) is a stringent lifetime gluten-free diet (GFD). Larazotide acetate (AT-1001) is an anti-zonulin which functions as a gut permeability regulator for treatment of CD. We endeavored to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which studied the efficacy and safety of AT-1001 in patients with CD. METHODS: We examined four databases from inception to 20-August-2020. We pooled continuous outcomes as mean difference and dichotomous outcomes as risk ratio with 95% confidence interval under the fixed-effects meta-analysis model. RESULTS: Four RCTs met our eligibility criteria, comprising 626 patients (AT-1001, n=465, placebo, n=161). Three and two RCTs reported outcomes of patients undergoing gluten challenge (intake of 2.4-2.7 grams of gluten/day) and GFD, respectively. For change in lactulose-to-mannitol ratio, the endpoint did not significantly differ between AT-1001 and placebo groups, irrespective of the gluten status. Subgroup analysis of patients undergoing gluten challenge showed AT-1001 treatment (compared with placebo) significantly correlated with better symptomatic improvement in the two endpoints of change in total gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (total GSRS) and CD-specific GSRS (CD-GSRS). However, no significant difference was noted among patients undergoing GFD for the abovementioned two efficacy endpoints. Compared with placebo, AT-1001 favorably reduced the adverse event (AE) of gluten-related diarrhea in patients who underwent gluten challenge. Other AEs were comparable between both AT-1001 and placebo groups. CONCLUSIONS: AT-1001 is largely well-endured and seems somehow superior to placebo in alleviating gastrointestinal symptoms among CD patients undergoing gluten challenge. Nevertheless, additional RCTs are warranted to validate these findings.
33928388	The Underlying Effects of Celiac Disease and Subsequent Implications on Deployment in the United States Army.	INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the etiology, pathology, and treatments for celiac disease (CD), as well as to provide context as to how CD impacts the U.S. military. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To conduct this review, the authors surveyed recent epidemiology and immunology literature in order to provide a detailed summary of the current understanding of CD, its diagnosis, and the real-world impacts within the Department of Defense (DoD). RESULTS: We described the gluten proteins and both the immune response in CD. We further describe the underlying genetic risk factors and diagnosis and pathogenesis of the disease and conclude the review with a discussion of how current DoD regulations impact U.S. military readiness. CONCLUSION: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder that results in damage to the small intestine. Ingestion of gluten in a CD patient is usually followed by villous atrophy in the small intestine, often along with other gastrointestinal symptoms. Around 1% of patients diagnosed with CD can experience complications if gluten-free diet is not followed, including intestinal lymphoma and hyposplenism. Therefore, a patient showing possible symptoms should discuss the diagnostic process with their healthcare providers to ensure adequate understanding of serological and genetic tests along with the histological examination of intestinal biopsy. Patients should seek consults with registered dietitians to structure their diets appropriately. Considering the prevalence and incidence of CD and gluten intolerances are increasing, the military should consider providing gluten-free Meals Ready-to-Eat as an option for all service members. Given the retention of service members with CD, subsequent admission of personnel with mild CD that does not affect the duties will allow the DoD access to a growing population of fully capable service members with critical technical skills who are eager to serve the USA.
26280705	Frequency and Cause of Persistent Symptoms in Celiac Disease Patients on a Long-term Gluten-free Diet.	GOALS: To estimate the frequency and cause of nonresponsive celiac disease (CD). BACKGROUND: Treatment of CD is based on life-long adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). Some celiac patients experience persistence of symptoms despite a GFD. This condition is defined as nonresponsive CD. STUDY: Celiac patients on a GFD for at least 12 months underwent diet compliance assessment, laboratory tests, breath tests, endoscopic, and histologic evaluations according to the symptoms/signs reported. RESULTS: Seventy of 321 (21.8%) patients had persistent or recurrent symptoms/signs. The cause of symptom persistence was evaluated in 56 of 70 patients. Thirteen of 56 (23%) patients were antiendomysial antibody positive. Among the patients with negative serology, 1 had fibromyalgia, and 3 had evidence that disproved the diagnosis of CD. The remaining 39 patients with negative serology underwent duodenal biopsy sampling, which evidenced histologic alterations in 24 patients. Among the 15 patients with normal histology 3 were lactose intolerant, 9 had irritable bowel syndrome, 2 had gastroesophageal reflux disease, and in 1 patient a cause for the persistent symptom was not identified. In patients with confirmed diagnosis of CD, exposure to dietary gluten was the main cause of persistence of symptoms/signs, and consistently after dietary modification, symptoms resolved in 63% of the patients at later time points during follow-up. CONCLUSION: Nonresponsive CD occurs in nearly one fifth of celiac patients on GFD and its occurrence suggests further investigations to optimize the management of celiac patients.
30392830	Murine Norovirus Infection Induces TH1 Inflammatory Responses to Dietary Antigens.	Intestinal reovirus infection can trigger T helper 1 (TH1) immunity to dietary antigen, raising the question of whether other viruses can have a similar impact. Here we show that the acute CW3 strain of murine norovirus, but not the persistent CR6 strain, induces TH1 immunity to dietary antigen. This property of CW3 is dependent on its major capsid protein, a virulence determinant. Transcriptional profiling of mesenteric lymph nodes following infection reveals an immunopathological signature that does not segregate with protective immunity but with loss of oral tolerance, in which interferon regulatory factor 1 is critical. These data show that viral capacity to trigger specific inflammatory pathways at sites where T cell responses to dietary antigens take place interferes with the development of tolerance to an oral antigen. Collectively, these data provide a foundation for the development of therapeutic strategies to prevent TH1-mediated complex immune disorders triggered by viral infections.

23180946	Celiac disease markers in patients with liver diseases: a single center large scale screening study.	AIM: To study the coincidence of celiac disease, we tested its serological markers in patients with various liver diseases. METHODS: Large-scale screening of serum antibodies against tissue transglutaminase (tTG), and deamidated gliadin using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and serum antibodies against endomysium using immunohistochemistry, in patients with various liver diseases (n = 962) and patients who underwent liver transplantation (OLTx, n = 523) was performed. The expression of tTG in liver tissue samples of patients simultaneously suffering from celiac disease and from various liver diseases using immunohistochemistry was carried out. The final diagnosis of celiac disease was confirmed by histological analysis of small-intestinal biopsy. RESULTS: We found that 29 of 962 patients (3%) with liver diseases and 5 of 523 patients (0.8%) who underwent OLTx were seropositive for IgA and IgG anti-tTG antibodies. However, celiac disease was biopsy-diagnosed in 16 patients: 4 with autoimmune hepatitis type I, 3 with Wilson's disease, 3 with celiac hepatitis, 2 with primary sclerosing cholangitis, 1 with primary biliary cirrhosis, 1 with Budd-Chiari syndrome, 1 with toxic hepatitis, and 1 with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Unexpectedly, the highest prevalence of celiac disease was found in patients with Wilson's disease (9.7%), with which it is only rarely associated. On the other hand, no OLTx patients were diagnosed with celiac disease in our study. A pilot study of the expression of tTG in liver tissue using immunohistochemistry documented the overexpression of this molecule in endothelial cells and periportal hepatocytes of patients simultaneously suffering from celiac disease and toxic hepatitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis or autoimmune hepatitis type I. CONCLUSION: We suggest that screening for celiac disease may be beneficial not only in patients with associated liver diseases, but also in patients with Wilson's disease.

34444942	TMPRSS6 rs855791 Polymorphism Status in Children with Celiac Disease and Anemia.	Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune chronic inflammatory disease occurring in genetically predisposed individuals in response to the intake of gluten. Clinical presentation can be heterogeneous. Iron-deficient anemia (IDA) is one of the most common extra-intestinal manifestations of CD. Although IDA usually reverts with a gluten-free diet (GFD), some patients show persistent IDA, the mechanisms of which are poorly understood. Recent studies suggest an association between the rs855791 polymorphism in the TMPRSS6 gene and persistent IDA in adults with CD. The current study aimed to assess the potential link between rs855791 and persistent IDA in pediatric patients with CD. The study included 106 children diagnosed with CD between 2015 and 2019. Clinical and blood parameters (including blood count, serum iron) were collected at diagnosis and after >=12 months of GFD, and the rs855791 genotype was assessed for each patient. IDA was present at diagnosis in 25 patients (23.6%); only three (3%) had persistent IDA after GFD. The prevalence of rs855791 genotypes was 9% (n = 10) for TT, 53% (n = 56) for CT, and 38% (n = 40) for CC. There was a tendency toward a higher proportion of the T allele in patients with IDA and lower hemoglobin in the TT genotype but without statistical significance. An association between rs855791 and persistent IDA was not observed. These findings suggest that persistent IDA is uncommon in pediatric patients with CD. The prevalence of rs855791 in children with CD is reported for the first time.

34391330	Significant improvement of dermatitis herpetiformis with tofacitinib.	Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a rare autoimmune blistering disorder in which patients with celiac disease, a gluten-sensitive enteropathy, present with a severely pruritic papulovesicular eruption over extensor surfaces such as the knees, elbows, lower back, buttocks, and neck. Patients are instructed to adhere to a gluten-free diet for purposes of improving their skin disease and gluten-sensitive enteropathy; this is the only treatment that lowers risk of enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma. Patients who adhere to a strict gluten-free diet often have remission of their skin disease over months to years. Dapsone is a rapid and extremely effective first-line treatment option and often used while transitioning to a gluten-free diet. Aside from gluten-free diet and dapsone, second-line treatment options include sulfapyridine, sulfasalazine, and colchicine. Some patients have difficulty adhering to a gluten-free diet or develop intolerable side effects to systemic therapies. Furthermore, there is limited data on the use of the second-line treatments. Recent studies have shed light on the role of JAK-STAT-dependent pathways in the pathogenesis of dermatitis herpetiformis. We present a patient treated with tofacitinib, 5mg twice daily, an oral JAK1/3 inhibitor, who demonstrated clinical improvement of DH and control of new lesion development.
22029621	Additional value of serum I-FABP levels for evaluating celiac disease activity in children.	OBJECTIVES: Addition of a non-invasive marker for intestinal damage to the currently used parameters for celiac disease activity (symptoms, serologic tests and biopsy) might further improve clinical management of celiac disease (CD). Intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) is a cytosolic enterocyte protein and sensitive marker for enterocyte damage in the small intestine. We investigated whether serum I-FABP levels can reliably identify villous atrophy in children with a positive CD antibody screening. Moreover, the recovery of I-FABP levels after gluten free diet (GFD) was studied. METHODS: I-FABP levels were analyzed retrospectively in 49 children with biopsy proven CD and in 19 patients with a positive screening but without histological confirmation of CD. Blood was collected before biopsy and repeatedly after the onset of GFD. RESULTS: Initial I-FABP concentrations in CD (median 458 pg/ml) were significantly (p < 0.001) elevated compared to controls (median 20 pg/ml). In the control group, only two of 19 children were found to have elevated I-FABP levels, of which one was subsequently diagnosed with CD after gluten challenge. I-FABP concentrations correlated with severity of villous atrophy. In all CD patients, I-FABP levels decreased quickly after GFD and normalized in 80% of patients within 12 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated I-FABP levels accurately predict villous atrophy in children with a positive serologic test for CD (positive predictive value 98%). In addition, measurement of I-FABP enables monitoring the response to GFD.
23029720	Advances in small bowel imaging--capsule endoscopy.	The small bowel has been a difficult area to examine due to its anatomy, location and relative tortuosity. Capsule technology has revolutionized the imaging of small bowel. Capsule endoscopy has been recommended as the 3rd diagnostic test for patients with obscure bleeding after a normal endoscopic evaluation of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract. Many studies have established its role in other clinical situations, such as detection of small bowel lesions in Crohn's disease, non steroidal anti-inflammatory drug enteropathies, celiac disease, small bowel polyposis syndromes and small bowel tumors. Capsule endoscopy of the oesophagus is recommended as an alternative to oesophagogastroduodenoscopy for screening Barrett's oesophagus, esophageal varices and of the colon for colorectal cancer.
30153131	The Nutritional and Social Contexts of Celiac Disease in Women: A Qualitative Study.	BACKGROUND: Previous studies have confirmed that women who are diagnosed with celiac disease report a lower quality of life than men who are diagnosed with the same illness. PURPOSE: This article describes the life experiences of women with celiac disease, especially those who adhere to a lifelong gluten-free diet. METHODS: A phenomenological design based on the Giorgi method was used. Twenty-two women who were diagnosed with celiac disease and were between 16 and 75 years old completed the semistructured interviews. RESULTS: The results showed that celiac disease has differing effects on the lives of women sufferers. The general feeling of being a woman with celiac disease was described as an effort toward achieving a normalized life. Four categories emerged from the results: feelings at diagnosis, limitations in daily life, social perceptions of the illness, and personal meanings of celiac disease. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This study shows that celiac disease and its treatment reduce mental and social quality of life in women. Organizations and public institutions should carry out public awareness campaigns targeting celiac disease and promote quality of life in sufferers of celiac disease in general.
32231050	Celiac Disease, Gluten-Free Diet, and Metabolic and Liver Disorders.	Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic autoimmune enteropathy triggered by the ingestion of gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. At the time of diagnosis, the frequency of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in individuals with CD appears to be similar to that of the general population, although a lower body mass index and a lower rate of hypercholesterolemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus are observed at diagnosis in CD patients. The effect of a gluten-free diet (GFD) in individuals with these liver and metabolic disorders is still a matter of debate. The aim of this study was to investigate the links between a GFD and metabolic/liver disorders in CD patients. A systematic electronic search of the literature from January 2009 to December 2019 was performed using Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library. Only papers written in English concerning metabolic and liver disorders in adult patients with CD were included. Out of 1195 citations, 14 eligible studies were identified. Increases in the frequency of NAFLD, weight gain, and alterations of the lipid profile suggest that important changes happen in celiac patients on a GFD, though the physiopathology of these conditions is unclear. Although a GFD is the only effective treatment available for CD, liver function, body weight, and metabolic and nutritional profiles should be monitored in patients on a GFD.
23155333	Celiac disease: prevalence, diagnosis, pathogenesis and treatment.	Celiac disease (CD) is one of the most common diseases, resulting from both environmental (gluten) and genetic factors [human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and non-HLA genes]. The prevalence of CD has been estimated to approximate 0.5%-1% in different parts of the world. However, the population with diabetes, autoimmune disorder or relatives of CD individuals have even higher risk for the development of CD, at least in part, because of shared HLA typing. Gliadin gains access to the basal surface of the epithelium, and interact directly with the immune system, via both trans- and para-cellular routes. From a diagnostic perspective, symptoms may be viewed as either "typical" or "atypical". In both positive serological screening results suggestive of CD, should lead to small bowel biopsy followed by a favourable clinical and serological response to the gluten-free diet (GFD) to confirm the diagnosis. Positive anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody or anti-endomysial antibody during the clinical course helps to confirm the diagnosis of CD because of their over 99% specificities when small bowel villous atrophy is present on biopsy. Currently, the only treatment available for CD individuals is a strict life-long GFD. A greater understanding of the pathogenesis of CD allows alternative future CD treatments to hydrolyse toxic gliadin peptide, prevent toxic gliadin peptide absorption, blockage of selective deamidation of specific glutamine residues by tissue, restore immune tolerance towards gluten, modulation of immune response to dietary gliadin, and restoration of intestinal architecture.
27636409	Bifidobacterium infantis NLS Super Strain Reduces the Expression of alpha-Defensin-5, a Marker of Innate Immunity, in the Mucosa of Active Celiac Disease Patients.	BACKGROUND: We have previously shown a reduction of gastrointestinal symptoms after the oral administration of Bifidobacterium infantis Natren Life Start super strain (NLS-SS) in untreated celiac disease (CD) patients. The symptomatic improvement was not associated with changes in intestinal permeability or serum levels of cytokines, chemokines, or growth factors. Therefore, we hypothesized that the beneficial symptomatic effect observed previously in patients with CD treated with B. infantis may be related to the modulation of innate immunity. GOALS: To investigate the potential mechanisms of a probiotic B. infantis Natren Life Start super strain on the mucosal expression of innate immune markers in adult patients with active untreated CD compared with those treated with B. infantisx6 weeks and after 1 year of gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: Numbers of macrophages and Paneth cells and alpha-defensin-5 expression were assessed by immunohistochemistry in duodenal biopsies. RESULTS: We showed that GFD decreases duodenal macrophage counts in CD patients more effectively than B. infantis. In contrast, B. infantis decreases Paneth cell counts and expression of alpha-defensin-5 in CD (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results identify differential innate immune effects of treatment with B. infantis compared with 1 year of GFD. Further studies are needed to investigate synergistic effects of GFD and B. infantis supplementation in CD.
33059041	The Risk of Contracting COVID-19 Is Not Increased in Patients With Celiac Disease.	The World Health Organization declared coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) a global pandemic in March 2020. Since then, there are more than 34 million cases of COVID-19 leading to more than 1 million deaths worldwide. Numerous studies suggest that celiac disease (CeD), a chronic immune-mediated gastrointestinal condition triggered by gluten, is associated with an increased risk of respiratory infections.1-3 However, how it relates to the risk of COVID-19 is unknown. To address this gap, we conducted a cross-sectional study to evaluate whether patients with self-reported CeD are at an increased risk of contracting COVID-19.
23619270	Liver failure unmasks celiac disease in a child.	BACKGROUND: Liver involvement in celiac disease (CD) varies from asymptomatic mild non-specific hepatitis to liver failure. Here we report the first child with liver failure due to a sclerosing cholangitis associated with CD. CASE REPORT: An 11 year old girl presented with fatigability for 1 year and jaundice and abdominal distension for 3 weeks. On examination, the growth parameters were below 3rd percentile; she had splenomegaly and severe ascites. Liver function tests revealed elevated liver enzymes (ALT 84 U/L, total bilirubin 98.7 mumol/L, and direct 58.3 mumol/L, gamma-glutamyltransferase 111 U/L, INR 2.7, and albumin 16 g/L). Extensive investigations excluded infectious, metabolic, structural, and endocrine causes of chronic liver disease. Because of the short stature and anemia, CD was suspected, and serological evaluation revealed increased IgA antibodies to tissue transglutaminase (385 units; normal, 0-20 units). Histopathological examination of small intestinal biopsies showed total villous atrophy consistent with celiac disease. Liver biopsy showed bridging fibrosis, portal tract expansion by lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils, bile ductular proliferation, and periductular fibrosis. Magnetic resonance cholangiography revealed beading and narrowing appearance of intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts. The histopathological and imaging findings are diagnostic of sclerosing cholangitis. The child was initiated on ursodeoxycholic acid, gluten free diet for life, and steroid that was tapered over 3 months. At 3 month follow up, liver function tests completely normalized. CONCLUSION: CD is a potentially treatable cause of liver failure. All patients with severe unexplained liver disease should undergo serological screening for CD.
35503896	Food Environment and Youth Intake May Influence Uptake of Gluten-Free Food Guide Recommendations in Celiac Disease.	A gluten-free (GF) food guide for children and youth (4-18 years) living with celiac disease (CD) has been developed and extensively evaluated by stakeholders, including registered dietitians. A case study analysis was conducted on data from 16 households of youth with CD to examine how factors related to parental food literacy, the home food environment, and food purchasing patterns may influence food guide uptake by Canadian youth with CD and their families. Households were of higher socioeconomic status, parents had good food literacy, and the home food availability of fruits, vegetables and GF grains was diverse. However, households also had a diverse supply of convenience foods and snack options. Youth reported consuming a larger proportion of these foods (>35% dietary intake) and had suboptimal diet quality. Dietary intake of fruits and vegetables were below GF plate model recommendations by over 30%. Despite limited economical barriers, good parental food literacy, and diverse food availability, meeting fruit and vegetable recommendations based on the pediatric GF food guide remains a major challenge. Findings inform that effective strategies and healthy public policies to support the uptake of GF food guide recommendations are needed to improve the health outcomes of youth with CD.
34633755	Insights from tissue "omics" analysis on intestinal remodeling in celiac disease.	Celiac disease (CeD) is a prevalent intestinal disorder that only develops in genetically susceptible individuals when they mount a harmful CD4+ T-cell response towards gluten peptides. Intake of gluten leads to inflammation and remodeling of the small intestine with symptoms such as nausea and diarrhea. The only current treatment is a lifelong gluten free diet. The immunological basis for CeD is well characterized but the mechanisms that drive intestinal remodeling are still poorly understood. Transcriptome or proteome analysis of intestinal biopsies gives a global snapshot of all processes that occur in the tissue, including alterations in the epithelial cell layer. This paper will introduce concepts of intestinal remodeling, recapitulate the current understanding of CeD pathogenesis and discuss findings from relevant tissue "omics" studies. On the basis of this review, I give perspectives on what tissue "omics" studies can tell us about disease pathogenesis with a particular focus on the gluten induced intestinal remodeling.
31220686	Dietary management of celiac disease: Revisiting the guidelines.	OBJECTIVE: Medical nutrition therapy (MNT), by lifelong compliance with a gluten-free diet, is likely the only treatment for celiac disease (CD). Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) regarding the management of CD emphasize the role of MNT over other treatment options. The aim of the present study was to review and critically appraise CD-specific MNT CPGs and identify areas in need of improvement for better adherence and outcomes. METHODS: A comprehensive search was performed using PubMed, Guidelines International Network (GIN), Google Scholar, gray literature, and websites of CD scientific organizations for CPGs, consensus and practice papers on the dietary management of CD, published in the English language. RESULTS: A total of 12 CPGs were retrieved and critically appraised by three independent reviewers using the Appraisal of Guidelines Research & Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument. All CPGs were of low quality based on AGREE II. Among the 12 CPGs, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines achieved the highest score and were unanimously recommended without modifications by the three reviewers, whereas the American Gastroenterology Association, Alberta Health Services, British Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Clinical Resource Efficiency Support Team, and Federation of International Societies of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition guidelines received the lowest scores. CONCLUSIONS: The present study reveals the low quality of guidelines regarding the MNT of CD patients, indicating the need for updated and improved guidelines taking into consideration the proposed items of AGREE II.
28034662	The perspective of celiac disease patients on emerging treatment options and non-celiac gluten sensitivity.	BACKGROUND: Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) and emerging treatment options are hot topics in the celiac disease (CeD) scientific literature. However, very little is known about the perspective on these issues of CeD patients. METHODS: We performed a large patient survey among unselected CeD patients in Switzerland. RESULTS: A total of 1689 patients were analyzed. 57.5% have previously heard of NCGS. 64.5% believe in the existence of this entity. Regarding a potential influence of NCGS on CeD awareness, 31.7% show a positive and 27.5% a negative perception. Patients with prior use of alternative medicine and women more often have heard of and believe in the existence of NCGS vs. those never having used alternative methods and men, respectively (66.9 vs. 56.9%, p=0.001 and 78.5 vs. 69.0%, p=0.001; 60.7 vs. 44.2%, p<0.001 and 71.0 vs. 60.8%, p=0.002). Women and patients >=30 years more often show a negative attitude towards NCGS (32.2% vs. 24.8%, p=0.024 and 32.2% vs. 24.2%, p=0.018). With regard to emerging treatment options for CeD, 43.3% have previously heard of novel agents, more women than men (46.0 vs. 38.0%, p=0.019). CONCLUSIONS: Perception of and attitude towards NCGS differ depending on sex, age and prior use of alternative medicine. Knowledge of the progress towards emerging treatment options is currently limited.
33962344	Celiac Disease in Children: An Association With Drug-Resistant Epilepsy.	BACKGROUND: Neurological manifestations are commonly reported in patients with celiac disease (CD). We aimed to characterize epilepsy features in a pediatric population with CD and the effect of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on seizure burden. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on pediatric patients treated at the University of Utah and Primary Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City, Utah, with both epilepsy and CD and compared with a control group with epilepsy only. RESULTS: We identified 56 patients with epilepsy and biopsy-confirmed CD (n = 36, 64%) or elevated tissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTG-Ab) without biopsy-confirmed CD (n = 20, 36%). Age- and gender-matched controls were selected from patients with epilepsy only (n = 168). Patients with biopsy-proven CD or positive tTG-Ab had high percentage of drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) compared with the control group (P < 0.05). Age at seizure onset preceded the diagnosis of CD on average by 5.9 years for patients with DRE (P < 0.01) compared with 2.2 years for those with drug-responsive epilepsy. Adhering to a GFD reduced seizure frequency or resulted in weaning dosage or weaning off of one or more antiseizure medications in a majority of patients with DRE. CONCLUSIONS: DRE was more prevalent in pediatric patients with biopsy-confirmed CD and positive tTG-Ab compared with the control group (which included childhood epilepsy syndromes), but comparable with the prevalence of DRE in the general population. Adherence to a GFD in combination with antiseizure medications appears to reduce seizure burden for those with CD and DRE.
29909690	Children with untreated coeliac disease have sub-clinical cardiac dysfunction: a longitudinal observational analysis.	INTRODUCTION: We assessed cardiac function (CF) in celiac disease (CD) patients and the effect of gluten-free diet (GFD) on CF. METHODS: Prospective evaluation of CF using conventional and tissue doppler echocardiography in 50 CD patients (age 4.2 +- 1.1 years) at diagnosis and after a year of GFD (group 1), 100 CD children (group 2; 47 compliant and 53 non-compliant) in follow-up and 25 healthy controls. RESULTS: Untreated CD (n = 50) children had larger left ventricle end diastolic dimension (35.33 +- 0.87 vs. 32.90 +- 0.91 mm; p = .04), reduced (<55%) left ventricular ejection fraction (20% vs. 0%; p = .01) and a higher (>0.6) myocardial performance index (MPI, 66% vs. 0%; p <= .01) as compared to controls. Re-evaluation after one year with good dietary compliance showed changes in isovolumic relaxation time (72.5 +- 4.2 vs. 50.62 +- 2.69; p = .0001) and deceleration time (121.05 +- 10.1 vs. 99.87 +- 8.5; p = .02), reflecting improved cardiac diastolic function. GFD compliant patients had lower MPI than non-compliant (0.60 +- .03 vs. 0.66 +- .08; p = .04), reflecting improvement in load-independent echocardiographic parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Subclinical cardiac dysfunction is common in CD children at diagnosis. Improvement in echocardiographic parameters occurs with GFD and non-compliant children continue to have persistent cardiac dysfunction.
22652902	Topical and systemic therapies for nickel allergy.	Nickel allergy can result in both cutaneous and systemic manifestations, and can range from mild to severe symptoms. A severe form of this allergy is the Systemic nickel allergy syndrome, clinically characterized by cutaneous manifestions (contact dermatitis, pompholyx, hand dermatitis dyshydrosis, urticaria) with chronic course and systemic symptoms (headache, asthenia, itching, and gastrointestinal disorders related to histopathological alterations of gastrointestinal mucosa, borderline with celiac disease). This review aims to briefly update the reader on past and current therapies for nickel contact allergy.
36859658	Nutrient intakes in adult and pediatric coeliac disease patients on gluten-free diet: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	Celiac Disease (CD) continues to require a strict lifetime gluten-free diet (GFD) to maintain healthy status. Many studies have assessed the GFD nutritional adequacy in their cohorts, but an overall picture in adults and children would offer a lifetime vision to identify actionable areas of change. We aimed at assessing the nutrient intakes of adult and pediatric CD patients following a GFD diet and identifying potential areas of improvement. Systematic review was carried out across PubMed, Scopus and Scholar up to October 2022, including full-text studies that assessed the nutrient intakes of CD patients on GFD, in terms of macro- and/or micronutrients (absolute or percentage daily average). Random-effect meta-analysis and univariable meta-regression were applied to obtain pooled estimates for proportions and influencing variables on the outcome, respectively. Thirty-eight studies with a total of 2114 patients were included. Overall, the daily energy intake was 1995 (CI 1884-2106) Kcal with 47.8% (CI 45.7-49.8%) from carbohydrates, 15.5% (CI 14.8-16.2%) from proteins, and 35.8% (CI 34.5-37.0%) from fats. Of total fats, 13.2% (CI 12.4-14.0%) were saturated fats. Teenagers had the highest consumption of fats (94.9, CI 54.8-134.9 g/day), and adults presented insufficient dietary fiber intake (18.9 g, CI 16.5-21.4 g). Calcium, magnesium, and iron intakes were particularly insufficient in adolescence, whereas vitamin D was insufficient in all age groups. In conclusion, GFD may expose CD patients to high fat and low essential micronutrient intakes. Given GFD is a lifelong therapy, to prevent the occurrence of diseases (e.g. cardiovascular or bone disorders) dietary intakes need to be assessed on long-term follow-ups.
25884227	Essential amino acids in the gluten-free diet and serum in relation to depression in patients with celiac disease.	INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease (CD) is associated with an increased risk of major depressive disorder, possibly due to deficiencies in micronutrients in the gluten-free diet. We aimed to investigate whether essential amino acids (i.e., the precursors of serotonin, dopamine and other neurotransmitters) are depleted in the diet and serum of CD patients with major depressive disorder. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study we assessed dietary intake of amino acids and serum levels of amino acids, in 77 CD patients on a gluten-free diet and in 33 healthy controls. Major depressive disorder was assessed with structured interviews (using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview Plus). Dietary intake was assessed using a 203-item food frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 55 years and 74% were women. The intake of vegetable protein was significantly lower in CD patients than in healthy controls (mean difference of 7.8 g/d; 95% CI: 4.7-10.8), as were serum concentrations of tyrosine, phenylalanine and tryptophan (all p < 0.005). However, within the CD patient group, the presence of major depressive disorder (n = 42) was not associated with intake or serum levels of essential amino acids. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CD on a long-term gluten-free diet, with good adherence, consume significantly less vegetable protein than controls, and their serum levels of several essential amino acids were also lower. Despite its potential adverse effect, intake and serum levels of essential amino acids were not related to major depression.
38199032	Eating competence in caregivers of celiac children: A cross-sectional study performed in Brazil.	OBJECTIVES: Eating competence is an intraindividual approach to eating, behaviors, and attitudes related to eating, with repercussions on the individual and family. In pediatric celiac disease, the family is involved in the gluten-free diet management, the only treatment available. A gluten-free diet might affect eating competence because gluten-free diet compliance requires knowledge about food, meal planning, and attention to food choices. The objective is to access eating competence in caregivers of children with celiac disease and the association between caregivers' eating competence, children's adherence to a gluten-free diet, and sociodemographic data of participants. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used a snowball spread method by applying a questionnaire, including sociodemographic data, data related to health, eating habits, and the Satter Eating Competence Inventory version validated for the Brazilian population. The sample consisted of 220 Brazilian parents or caregivers of celiac disease children. The scores of the Satter Eating Competence Inventory version validated for the Brazilian population were described in terms of means, SDs, medians, and interquartile range. Student's t test and analysis of variance followed by Tukey's post hoc tests were applied, and the association with the variables of interest was analyzed using Pearson chi2 tests. The tests were conducted considering bilateral hypotheses and a 5% significance level. RESULTS: Participants' sex, schooling level, and income did not affect their eating competence. Competent eaters were mostly those with normal weight, following a gluten-free diet, with children complying with a gluten-free diet, and who have meals with family and prepare them at home. Different from vegetable consumption, participants' eating competence did not differ considering the frequency of children's fruit consumption. CONCLUSIONS: The caregivers of children with celiac disease have greater eating competence scores than general Brazilian adults, and caregivers of children with celiac disease who comply with the gluten-free diet have higher eating competence scores.
35603827	Assessment of the social quality of life and the physical activity of adult celiac disease patients following a gluten-free diet in Lebanon.	To date, the primary and only treatment recommended for effective management of celiac disease (CD) is adherence to a strict gluten-free diet (GFD) which entails a new approach to eating that affects the social quality of life (QoL) and physical activity (PA) of patients. This cross-sectional study aimed at assessing the social QoL and PA of adult Lebanese CD patients aged between 18 and 59 years old who are following a GFD. An online CD questionnaire was administered to 136 Lebanese celiac participants on a GFD. The findings of this study show a significant association between celiac patients following a GFD and their social QoL (P-value = 0.0001). The results also showed a significant association between the same population and their PA (p-value = 0.0001). Further awareness-raising and learning activities about gluten-free products are needed to improve the adherence to a strict GFD to facilitate its availability to the Lebanese population.
21685040	The liver in celiac disease: clinical manifestations, histologic features, and response to gluten-free diet in 30 patients.	Descriptive reports of liver histologic features in celiac disease (CD) are sparse, and the effect of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on the course of liver injury is poorly understood. We reviewed liver biopsy specimens in 30 patients with CD and performed immunostains for IgG, IgG4, IgM, and IgA. Subsequent liver biochemical tests and compliance with the GFD were recorded. Of the patients, 19 had autoimmune-mediated liver disease (AILD; autoimmune hepatitis, 9; primary sclerosing cholangitis, 7; and primary biliary cirrhosis, 3). The remaining 11 patients had cryptogenic hepatitis (5), hepatitis C (2), steatohepatitis (2), sarcoidosis (1), and T-cell lymphoma (1). The liver disease diagnosis preceded the CD diagnosis in all groups except steatohepatitis. Although 82% of patients without AILD had symptomatic CD, only 26% of patients with AILD had such symptoms. The pathology of the specific liver disease was not atypical in histologic features or IgG/IgM ratios. While GFD improved cryptogenic hepatitis, it did not seem to affect AILD. We propose that AILD and cryptogenic hepatitis in patients with CD represent distinct clinical, histologic, and immunohistochemical entities rather than 2 ends of a spectrum of liver injury.
29941778	Celiac Disease and Glandular Autoimmunity.	Celiac disease is a small intestinal inflammatory disease with autoimmune features that is triggered and maintained by the ingestion of the storage proteins (gluten) of wheat, barley, and rye. Prevalence of celiac disease is increased in patients with mono- and/or polyglandular autoimmunity and their relatives. We have reviewed the current and pertinent literature that addresses the close association between celiac disease and endocrine autoimmunity. The close relationship between celiac disease and glandular autoimmunity can be largely explained by sharing of a common genetic background. Further, between 10 and 30% of patients with celiac disease are thyroid and/or type 1 diabetes antibody positive, while around 5-7% of patients with autoimmune thyroid disease, type 1 diabetes, and/or polyglandular autoimmunity are IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody positive. While a gluten free diet does not reverse glandular autoimmunity, its early institution may delay or even prevent its first manifestation. In conclusion, this brief review highlighting the close association between celiac disease and both monoglandular and polyglandular autoimmunity, aims to underline the need for prospective studies to establish whether an early diagnosis of celiac disease and a prompt gluten-free diet may positively impact the evolution and manifestation of glandular autoimmunity.
26269669	Microscopic colitis: A review of etiology, treatment and refractory disease.	Microscopic colitis is a common cause of chronic, nonbloody diarrhea. Microscopic colitis is more common in women than men and usually affects patients in their sixth and seventh decade. This article reviews the etiology and medical management of microscopic colitis. The etiology of microscopic colitis is unknown, but it is associated with autoimmune disorders, such as celiac disease, polyarthritis, and thyroid disorders. Smoking has been identified as a risk factor of microscopic colitis. Exposure to medications, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton pump inhibitors, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, is suspected to play a role in microscopic colitis, although their direct causal relationship has not been proven. Multiple medications, including corticosteroids, anti-diarrheals, cholestyramine, bismuth, 5-aminosalicylates, and immunomodulators, have been used to treat microscopic colitis with variable response rates. Budesonide is effective in inducing and maintaining clinical remission but relapse rate is as high as 82% when budesonide is discontinued. There is limited data on management of steroid-dependent microscopic colitis or refractory microscopic colitis. Immunomodulators seem to have low response rate 0%-56% for patients with refractory microscopic colitis. Response rate 66%-100% was observed for use of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy for refractory microscopic colitis. Anti-TNF and diverting ileostomy may be an option in severe or refractory microscopic colitis. 
35435771	How does a celiac iceberg really float? The relationship between celiac disease and gluten.	Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune intestinal disease caused by intolerance of genetically susceptible individuals after intake of gluten-containing grains (including wheat, barley, etc.) and their products. Currently, CD, with "iceberg" characteristics, affects a large population and is distributed over a wide range of individuals. This present review summarizes the latest research progress on the relationship between CD and gluten. Furthermore, the structure and function of gluten peptides related to CD, gluten detection methods, the effects of processing on gluten and gluten-free diets are emphatically reviewed. In addition, the current limitations in CD research are also discussed. The present work facilitates a comprehensive understanding of CD as well as gluten, which can provide a theoretical reference for future research.
33529351	The effect of gluten-free diet on body mass index in paediatric celiac disease.	AIM: More normal weight and overweight children are currently diagnosed with celiac disease (CD). We aimed to describe the relation between body mass index (BMI) and the clinical characteristics of paediatric CD and to determine the effect of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on BMI. METHODS: Data on all children diagnosed with CD during 7/2010-7/2019 with documented anthropometric data at diagnosis were retrospectively analysed. The children were divided into three groups according to BMI status at diagnosis: underweight, normal weight and overweight (BMIs <5%, 5%-85% and >85%, respectively). RESULTS: Of the 236 children [median age 7.87 (4.91-11) years] included in the study, 24 (10.1%) were underweight at diagnosis and 32 (13.6%) were overweight. Diarrhoea as the presenting symptom was significantly more common in the overweight group (p = 0.012), while short stature was more common in the underweight group (p = 0.002). Following a GFD had no significant effect on the children's BMI during a median follow-up of 15.7 (0-85) months, but there was a significant shift of patients between the BMI categories (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Although a shift of patients between the BMI categories was observed, following a GFD did not significantly affect the overall BMI in children with CD.
26322559	Effects of Gluten-Free Diet on Quality of Life and Depression in Children With Celiac Disease.	OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the level of depression and quality of life in children with celiac disease (CD). In addition, it aimed to examine the relations of depression level and life quality with adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: Twenty-five children with CD and 25 healthy controls were included. The Depression Scale for Children and the General Purpose Health-Related Quality of Life Scale for Children were performed on patients before and after receiving recommendations to follow a GFD. RESULTS: No significant differences were found in the depression scores between the patients and the control subjects (P > 0.05). In contrast, total scores and scores of the emotional well-being subscale of the measure of Quality of Life Scale for Children were significantly lower in patients with CD compared with the control group (P < 0.05). No significant improvements were observed in depression or life quality scores of the total subsample of celiac patients, all of whom received a recommendation to follow a GFD (P > 0.05). Significant decrease was observed in the depression scores, however, of celiac patients who were able to actually adhere to the GFD compared with nonadherent patients. CONCLUSIONS: CD negatively affected quality of life in children. Adherence to GFD was associated with reduction in depression symptoms. Improving the adherence of celiac patients to a GFD may have a favorable effect on their depression symptoms.
29969711	All disease begins in the gut: Influence of gastrointestinal disorders and surgery on oral drug performance.	The term "disease" conjures a plethora of graphic imagery for many, and the use of drugs to combat symptoms and treat underlying pathology is at the core of modern medicine. However, the effects of the various gastrointestinal diseases, infections, co-morbidities and the impact of gastrointestinal surgery on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic behaviour of drugs have been largely overlooked. The better elucidation of disease pathology and the role of underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms have increased our knowledge as far as diagnoses and prognoses are concerned. In addition, the recent advances in our understanding of the intestinal microbiome have linked the composition and function of gut microbiota to disease predisposition and development. This knowledge, however, applies less so in the context of drug absorption and distribution for orally administered dosage forms. Here, we revisit and re-evaluate the influence of a portfolio of gastrointestinal diseases and surgical effects on the functionality of the gastrointestinal tract, their implications for drug delivery and attempt to uncover significant links for clinical practice.
21637088	Celiac disease: implications for patient management.	Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder that is known specifically for causing inflammation of the mucosa in the small intestine. Through multiple diagnostic and screening tools such as small intestinal biopsy sample, serological testing, and human leukocyte antigen testing, healthcare providers can diagnose this disease that contains components related to genetic predisposition and intake of gluten proteins found in wheat, barley, and rye. There are some who believe that having an autoimmune disease may predispose one to acquiring another disease. With patients experiencing mostly diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss, the implementation of a gluten-free diet is the treatment that healthcare providers recommend. Through monitoring gluten intake and providing nutritional supplementation, those diagnosed with celiac disease can lead a relatively normal life without complications. With celiac disease affecting all age ranges in the population, and with a documented higher frequency, there is a growing awareness in society that can be easily seen in grocery stores, restaurants, and food manufacturers.

27045926	Metagenomics Reveals Dysbiosis and a Potentially Pathogenic N. flavescens Strain in Duodenum of Adult Celiac Patients.	OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease (CD)-associated duodenal dysbiosis has not yet been clearly defined, and the mechanisms by which CD-associated dysbiosis could concur to CD development or exacerbation are unknown. In this study, we analyzed the duodenal microbiome of CD patients. METHODS: The microbiome was evaluated in duodenal biopsy samples of 20 adult patients with active CD, 6 CD patients on a gluten-free diet, and 15 controls by DNA sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA libraries. Bacterial species were cultured, isolated and identified by mass spectrometry. Isolated bacterial species were used to infect CaCo-2 cells, and to stimulate normal duodenal explants and cultured human and murine dendritic cells (DCs). Inflammatory markers and cytokines were evaluated by immunofluorescence and ELISA, respectively. RESULTS: Proteobacteria was the most abundant and Firmicutes and Actinobacteria the least abundant phyla in the microbiome profiles of active CD patients. Members of the Neisseria genus (Betaproteobacteria class) were significantly more abundant in active CD patients than in the other two groups (P=0.03). Neisseria flavescens (CD-Nf) was the most abundant Neisseria species in active CD duodenum. Whole-genome sequencing of CD-Nf and control-Nf showed genetic diversity of the iron acquisition systems and of some hemoglobin-related genes. CD-Nf was able to escape the lysosomal compartment in CaCo-2 cells and to induce an inflammatory response in DCs and in ex-vivo mucosal explants. CONCLUSIONS: Marked dysbiosis and an abundance of a peculiar CD-Nf strain characterize the duodenal microbiome in active CD patients thus suggesting that the CD-associated microbiota could contribute to the many inflammatory signals in this disorder.
26060114	Therapeutic approaches for celiac disease.	Celiac disease is a common, lifelong autoimmune disorder for which dietary control is the only accepted form of therapy. A strict gluten-free diet is burdensome to patients and can be limited in efficacy, indicating there is an unmet need for novel therapeutic approaches to supplement or supplant dietary therapy. Many molecular events required for disease pathogenesis have been recently characterized and inspire most current and emerging drug-discovery efforts. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) confirm the importance of human leukocyte antigen genes in our pathogenic model and identify a number of new risk loci in this complex disease. Here, we review the status of both emerging and potential therapeutic strategies in the context of disease pathophysiology. We conclude with a discussion of how genes identified during GWAS and follow-up studies that enhance susceptibility may offer insight into developing novel therapies. 
23938076	[Immunological screening and follow-up of celiac disease: experience of the University Hospital of Marseille].	PURPOSE: Anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (ATTG) have helped to distinguish atypical and silent clinical forms of celiac disease (CD). Immunological diagnosis or follow-up of the disease is now based in France in first line upon IgA ATTG serum evaluation. In the University Hospital of Marseille, the serological diagnosis of CD had consisted during several years in simultaneous determination of both IgA anti-endomysial antibodies (AEA) and IgA ATTG. In literature, few studies focused on the concordance between the two tests and a very few epidemiological data about CD in France are available. METHODS: Five thousand nine hundred and eighty-one patients for whom both AEA and ATTG testing were available were retrospectively included. Characteristics of this cohort were detailed. We numbered and analyzed especially bioclinical charts from patients with AAE/AATG discordance. RESULTS: Among our patients, all ages and all medical subspecialties were represented. Eighty-five new cases of CD were identified. Among the 6516 serum evaluations performed, only 31 tests were discordant. CONCLUSIONS: Our data give information about CD epidemiology in France. They support the contention that ATTG have to be evaluated in first line for CD diagnosis.
24876724	Irritable bowel syndrome in children: pathogenesis, diagnosis and evidence-based treatment.	Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the commonest cause of recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) in children in both more developed and developing parts of the world. It is defined by the Rome III criteria for functional gastrointestinal disorders. It is characterized by abdominal pain that is improved by defecation and whose onset is associated with a change in stool form and or frequency and is not explained by structural or biochemical abnormalities. It is estimated that 10%-15% of older children and adolescents suffer from IBS. IBS can be considered to be a brain-gut disorder possibly due to complex interaction between environmental and hereditary factors. The diagnosis of IBS is made based on the Rome III criteria together with ruling out organic causes of RAP in children such as inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease. Once the diagnosis of IBS is made, it is important to explain to the parents (and children) that there is no serious underlying disease. This reassurance may be effective treatment in a large number of cases. Lifestyle modifications, stress management, dietary interventions and probiotics may be beneficial in some cases. Although there is limited evidence for efficacy of pharmacological therapies such as antispasmodics and antidiarrheals; these have a role in severe cases. Biopsychosocial therapies have shown encouraging results in initial trials but are beset by limited availability. Further research is necessary to understand the pathophysiology and provide specific focused therapies.
34209138	Challenges of Monitoring the Gluten-Free Diet Adherence in the Management and Follow-Up of Patients with Celiac Disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic gluten-responsive immune mediated enteropathy and is treated with a gluten-free diet (GFD). However, a strict diet for life is not easy due to the ubiquitous nature of gluten. This review aims at examining available evidence on the degree of adherence to a GFD, the methods to assess it, and the barriers to its implementation. The methods for monitoring the adherence to a GFD are comprised of a dietary questionnaire, celiac serology, or clinical symptoms; however, none of these methods generate either a direct or an accurate measure of dietary adherence. A promising advancement is the development of tests that measure gluten immunogenic peptides in stools and urine. Causes of adherence/non-adherence to a GFD are numerous and multifactorial. Inadvertent dietary non-adherence is more frequent than intentional non-adherence. Cross-contamination of gluten-free products with gluten is a major cause of inadvertent non-adherence, while the limited availability, high costs, and poor quality of certified gluten-free products are responsible for intentionally breaking a GFD. Therefore, several studies in the last decade have indicated that many patients with CD who follow a GFD still have difficulty controlling their diet and, therefore, regularly consume enough gluten to trigger symptoms and damage the small intestine.
35029612	Healthy and pro-inflammatory gut ecology plays a crucial role in the digestion and tolerance of a novel Gluten Friendly  bread in celiac subjects: a randomized, double blind, placebo control in vivo study.	Gluten Friendly  (GF) is a new gluten achieved through a physicochemical process applied to wheat kernels. The goal of this research was to assess the in vivo effects of Gluten Friendly  bread on celiac gut mucosa and microbiota. In a double-blind placebo-controlled intervention study, 48 celiac disease (CD) patients were randomized into 3 groups to eat 100 g of bread daily, containing different doses (0; 3 g; 6 g) of GF for 12 weeks. The small-bowel morphology (VH/CrD), intraepithelial densities of CD3+, celiac serology, MUC2, CB1, gut permeability, proinflammatory cytokines, gluten in stools, symptoms, and gut microbial composition were assessed. All 48 CD subjects experienced no symptoms. K-means analysis evidenced celiac subjects clustering around unknown parameters independent of GF dosage: K1 35%; K2 30%; K3 35%. VH/CrD significantly decreased in K1 and K2. VH/CrD did not correlate with IEL increase in K2. 33-mer was not detected in 47% and 73% of patients in both K1 and K2, respectively. VH/CrD and IEL did not change significantly and strongly correlated with the absence of 33-mer in K3. Inflammation and VH/CrD decrease are strongly related with the presence of proinflammatory species at the baseline. A boost in probiotic, butyrate-producing genera, is strongly related with GF tolerance at the end of the trial. Our research suggests that a healthy and proinflammatory ecology could play a crucial role in the digestion and tolerance of the new gluten molecule in celiac subjects. However, GF can be completely digested by gut microbiota of CD subjects and shapes it toward gut homeostasis by boosting healthy butyrate-producing populations. The clinical trial registry number is NCT03137862 (https://clinicaltrials.gov).
24524388	Effect of gluten free diet on immune response to gliadin in patients with non-celiac gluten sensitivity.	BACKGROUND: Non-celiac gluten sensitivity is a syndrome characterized by gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms occurring in a few hours/days after gluten and/or other wheat protein ingestion and rapidly improving after exclusion of potential dietary triggers. There are no established laboratory markers for non-celiac gluten sensitivity, although a high prevalence of first generation anti-gliadin antibodies of IgG class has been reported in this condition. This study was designed to characterize the effect of the gluten-free diet on anti-gliadin antibodies of IgG class in patients with non-celiac gluten sensitivity. METHODS: Anti-gliadin antibodies of both IgG and IgA classes were assayed by ELISA in 44 non-celiac gluten sensitivity and 40 celiac disease patients after 6 months of gluten-free diet. RESULTS: The majority of non-celiac gluten sensitivity patients (93.2%) showed the disappearance of anti-gliadin antibodies of IgG class after 6 months of gluten-free diet; in contrast, 16/40 (40%) of celiac patients displayed the persistence of these antibodies after gluten withdrawal. In non-celiac gluten sensitivity patients anti-gliadin antibodies IgG persistence after gluten withdrawal was significantly correlated with the low compliance to gluten-free diet and a mild clinical response. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-gliadin antibodies of the IgG class disappear in patients with non-celiac gluten sensitivity reflecting a strict compliance to the gluten-free diet and a good clinical response to gluten withdrawal.
27392045	Double-Blind Randomized Clinical Trial: Gluten versus Placebo Rechallenge in Patients with Lymphocytic Enteritis and Suspected Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND: The role of gluten as a trigger of symptoms in non-coeliac gluten sensitivity has been questioned. AIM: To demonstrate that gluten is the trigger of symptoms in a subgroup of patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), which presented with lymphocytic enteritis, positive celiac genetics and negative celiac serology. METHODS: Double-blind randomized clinical trial of gluten vs placebo rechallenge. INCLUSION CRITERIA: >18 years of age, HLA-DQ2/8+, negative coeliac serology and gluten-dependent lymphocytic enteritis, and GI symptoms, with clinical and histological remission at inclusion. Eighteen patients were randomised: 11 gluten (20 g/day) and 7 placebo. Clinical symptoms, quality of life (GIQLI), and presence of gamma/delta+ cells and transglutaminase deposits were evaluated. RESULTS: 91% of patients had clinical relapse during gluten challenge versus 28.5% after placebo (p = 0.01). Clinical scores and GIQLI worsened after gluten but not after placebo (p<0.01). The presence of coeliac tissue markers at baseline biopsy on a gluten-free diet allowed classifying 9 out of the 18 (50%) patients as having probable 'coeliac lite' disease. CONCLUSION: This proof-of-concept study indicates that gluten is the trigger of symptoms in a subgroup of patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for NCGS. They were characterized by positive celiac genetics, lymphocytic enteritis, and clinical and histological remission after a gluten-free diet. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02472704.
26690475	The Overlap between Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity: A Clinical Dilemma.	The spectrum of gluten-related disorders has widened in recent times and includes celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, and wheat allergy. The complex of symptoms associated with these diseases, such as diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain may overlap for the gluten related diseases, and furthermore they can be similar to those caused by various other intestinal diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The mechanisms underlying symptom generation are diverse for all these diseases. Some patients with celiac disease may remain asymptomatic or have only mild gastrointestinal symptoms and thus may qualify for the diagnosis of IBS in the general clinical practice. Similarly, the overlap of symptoms between IBS and non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) often creates a dilemma for clinicians. While the treatment of NCGS is exclusion of gluten from the diet, some, but not all, of the patients with IBS also improve on a gluten-free diet. Both IBS and NCGS are common in the general population and both can coexist with each other independently without necessarily sharing a common pathophysiological basis. Although the pathogenesis of NCGS is not well understood, it is likely to be heterogeneous with possible contributing factors such as low-grade intestinal inflammation, increased intestinal barrier function and changes in the intestinal microbiota. Innate immunity may also play a pivotal role. One possible inducer of innate immune response has recently been reported to be amylase-trypsin inhibitor, a protein present in wheat endosperm and the source of flour, along with the gluten proteins.
28067892	Impact of type 1 diabetes mellitus and celiac disease on nutrition and quality of life.	OBJECTIVE: Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and celiac disease (CD) are autoimmune diseases and have similar genetic patterns. T1DM treatment is based on diet, physical activity and insulin therapy, whereas CD depends on dietary changes with restriction of wheat, rye and barley. The aim of the study was to evaluate the quality of life (QoL) of individuals with the association of T1DM and CD, to characterize their nutritional status and to compare it with those with only one disease and healthier controls. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Sixty patients controlled by sex, age and body mass index (BMI) were stratified by previous diagnosis in: T1DM and CD (DMCD group); T1DM (DM group); CD (CD group); or healthy participants (HC). The SF-36 questionnaire was applied to assess psychological well being and results were compared with glycemic control and presence of complications related to diabetes, adhesion to gluten-free diet (GFD). Nutritional status and body mass composition were determined by BMI, waist circumference, bioimpedance, general laboratory tests and whole-body densitometry. RESULTS: The time of diagnosis of T1DM was similar between DMCD and DM groups; however, the duration of CD was significantly higher in the CD group compared with DMCD. The SF-36 analysis revealed statistically significant differences between DM and HC groups in two domains: general health (P=0.042) and energy/vitality (P=0.012). QoL was also correlated with compliance to a GFD, and scores were similar in both groups: DMCD and CD. Forty percent of individuals in the CD group had visceral fat area above 100 cm2, as opposed to 20% in the other groups. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals of DMCD group had similar scores to DM, CD and HC on QoL, as well as on their nutritional status and bone metabolism. Thereby, we should conclude that the association of T1DM and CD did not deteriorate their health status.
30103636	Facial Involvement in Dermatitis Herpetiformis: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.	Dermatitis herpetiformis is a cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease that classically presents as a symmetric pruritic vesicular eruption on extensor surfaces. Typical locations include elbows, knees, and buttocks. Facial involvement has been reported rarely. Here, we report a case of a 44-year-old woman with dermatitis herpetiformis presenting as pruritic vesicles on the face that had previously been misdiagnosed as allergic contact dermatitis. Diagnosis was confirmed with direct immunofluorescence demonstrating granular IgA in the papillary dermis. This eruption cleared with topical dapsone 5% gel and a gluten-free diet. We report this case to raise awareness of facial involvement in dermatitis herpetiformis as well as the possibility of topical dapsone as a therapeutic option.
34319935	Barriers of Adherence to a Gluten-Free Diet in Iranian Adults With Celiac Disease.	This cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate and classify barriers to adherence to the gluten-free diet in 137 Iranian adults with celiac disease. We used a 23-point Likert questionnaire and exploratory factor analysis to identify and classify the barriers. Adherence to gluten-free diet was assessed by measuring the serum level of anti-tTG-IgA. The correlation between the barriers and adherence to gluten-free diet was assessed using logistic regression. A total of 117 subjects completed the study. Seven factors were extracted: "gluten-free diet restrictions," "self-awareness and social awareness," "psychological barriers," "education," "situational barriers and gatherings," "lack of access/labeling," and "cost." There was a significant correlation between the situational barriers and gatherings and nonadherence to the diet in the adjusted model (odds ratio = 1.63; 95% confidence interval [1.03, 2.54], p = .03). Nutritionists and physicians should consider these barriers when consulting patients with celiac disease.
20887172	Celiac disease: an underappreciated issue in women&#x2019;s health.	Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy that is secondary to gluten ingestion and classically associated with gastrointestinal symptoms. Diagnosis is based on serology and confirmatory duodenal biopsy, and the only treatment is lifelong avoidance of gluten. CD has been increasingly recognized to encompass a wide variety of manifestations that are relevant to women&#x2019;s health, including infertility, adverse pregnancy outcomes and reduced BMD. Currently, CD is underdiagnosed, largely owing to lack of recognition of the diverse manifestations by general practitioners. Increased awareness of the clinical spectrum of this disease, as well as targeted testing in at-risk individuals (including women with unexplained infertility and previous adverse pregnancy outcomes, and in specific populations with reduced BMD) is greatly needed in order to improve rates of diagnosis.
21586414	Gluten-free diet in nonceliac disease.	A gluten-free diet (GFD) is commonly recognized as the treatment for celiac disease. It also has been investigated as a treatment option for other medical conditions, including dermatitis herpetiformis, irritable bowel syndrome, neurologic disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus, and HIV-associated enteropathy. The strength of the evidence for the use of a GFD in these nonceliac diseases varies, and future research may better define the benefits of a GFD for those conditions with weak existing evidence.
36713361	Intestinal and blood lymphograms as new diagnostic tests for celiac disease.	Accurate celiac disease (CD) diagnosis is still challenging for some specific patients or circumstances. Thus, much effort has been expended last decades focused on seronegative or low grade enteropathy CD and, especially, on enable early diagnosis of individuals on a gluten-free diet (GFD). We discuss here two diagnostic approaches based on immunophenotyping by flow cytometry that we expect to reduce the persistent low diagnostic rates and the common diagnostic delay. The intraepithelial lymphogram is based on determining the percentage of TCRgammadelta+ and surface CD3- lymphocytes in the intestinal epithelium. The concomitant increase in TCRgammadelta+ and decrease in surface CD3- intraepithelial lymphocytes has been termed the celiac lymphogram and has been proved to be discriminative in seronegative, low grade enteropathy and potential CD, as well as in most CD patients on a GFD. A blood lymphogram based on the analysis of activated gut-homing CD8+ T cells combined with a 3-day gluten challenge is also considered, which has shown high sensitivity and specificity to diagnose seropositive Marsh 1 and Marsh 3 CD in individuals following a GFD. In addition, flow cytometry can be extremely useful in cases of refractory CD type II to identify aberrant cells. Those approaches represent highly accurate methods for CD diagnosis, being simple, fast, highly reproducible and of easy implementation in clinical practice.
23897517	Prevalence of associated disorders in Indian patients with celiac disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated disorder that may be associated with various diseases that share a similar pathogenic immune mechanism. This study reports on the prevalence of various diseases in a cohort of CD patients in northern India. Patients diagnosed with CD based on modified ESPGHAN criteria were prospectively evaluated for associated concomitant diseases. Of the 363 patients evaluated, 207 (57.0 %) were male. The mean age was 19 years. Seventy-one percent of patients presented with typical diarrheal disease, while 29 % presented with atypical nondiarrheal disease. One or more associated diseases were noted in 70 (19.2 %) patients. Liver diseases were the most common association. Portal hypertension was present in 33 (9 %) patients; chronic liver disease was the underlying cause in 17 patients, while noncirrhotic causes were noted in 16 patients. Type 1 diabetes was seen in 13 and hypothyroidism in 11 patients. Other unreported or rarely reported associated diseases were also found in some of the patients. Associated comorbid diseases are common, and may need to be actively screened, in Indian CD patients.

31324159	Survey of the initial management of celiac disease antibody tests by ordering physicians.	BACKGROUND: Appropriate interpretation of a positive celiac antibody test by an ordering physician is important in order to institute proper management. We evaluated why children with an initial positive celiac serology were not referred for diagnostic biopsy or followed with serial testing by the ordering physician. METHODS: Consecutive celiac serologies in all patients less than 18 years of age were evaluated over 3.5 years and 775 children with a positive tissue transglutaminase antibody (TTG) were identified. If no management of a positive TTG could be identified, a survey was sent to the ordering physician. Responses were categorized as appropriate or inappropriate management. RESULTS: Of the 775 patients with a positive TTG, 193 (24.9%, 95% CI 21.9-28.1%) received no follow-up management. We contacted 173 ordering physicians and 120 (69%) responded. Of the 120 responses, 55 patients (45.8%, 95% CI 36.8-55.1%) were managed appropriately and 46 (38.3%, 95% CI 29.7-47.7%) were considered to be inappropriately managed when no repeat TTG was obtained within 18 months. Reasons for inappropriate management included: screen considered to be false positive (44.7%), patient was not experiencing symptoms of celiac disease (31.6%), symptoms had resolved (15.8%), results were not indicative of celiac disease (26.3%) and patients started a gluten-free diet with no evaluation of response (15.8%). In 19 patients the TTG was not acted upon for technical reasons. CONCLUSIONS: Positive TTGs require appropriate interventions. These include: subspecialist referral for further evaluation and/or repeat testing to evaluate: 1) treatment response or 2) patients with minimal or no symptoms.
30909404	Advances in Molecular Mechanisms of Wheat Allergenicity in Animal Models: A Comprehensive Review.	The prevalence of wheat allergy has reached significant levels in many countries. Therefore, wheat is a major global food safety and public health issue. Animal models serve as critical tools to advance the understanding of the mechanisms of wheat allergenicity to develop preventive and control methods. A comprehensive review on the molecular mechanisms of wheat allergenicity using animal models is unavailable at present. There were two major objectives of this study: To identify the lessons that animal models have taught us regarding the molecular mechanisms of wheat allergenicity and to identify the strengths, challenges, and future prospects of animal models in basic and applied wheat allergy research. Using the PubMed and Google Scholar databases, we retrieved and critically analyzed the relevant articles and excluded celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Our analysis shows that animal models can provide insight into the IgE epitope structure of wheat allergens, effects of detergents and other chemicals on wheat allergenicity, and the role of genetics, microbiome, and food processing in wheat allergy. Although animal models have inherent limitations, they are critical to advance knowledge on the molecular mechanisms of wheat allergenicity. They can also serve as highly useful pre-clinical testing tools to develop safer genetically modified wheat, hypoallergenic wheat products, novel pharmaceuticals, and vaccines.
29202198	Adverse effects of gluten ingestion and advantages of gluten withdrawal in nonceliac autoimmune disease.	In light of the coincident surge in overall gluten intake and the incidence of autoimmune diseases, the possible biological adverse effects of gluten were explored. PubMed, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library databases were screened for reports published between 1964 and 2016 regarding the adverse effects of gluten as well as the effects of a gluten-free diet on autoimmune diseases. In vitro and in vivo studies describing gluten intake in animal models or cell lines and gluten-free diets in human autoimmune diseases were reviewed. Multiple detrimental aspects of gluten affect human health, including gluten-dependent digestive and extradigestive manifestations mediated by potentially immunological or toxic reactions that induce gastrointestinal inadequacy. Gluten affects the microbiome and increases intestinal permeability. It boosts oxidative stress and affects epigenetic behavior. It is also immunogenic, cytotoxic, and proinflammatory. Gluten intake increases apoptosis and decreases cell viability and differentiation. In certain nonceliac autoimmune diseases, gluten-free diets may help curtail the adverse effects of gluten. Additional in vivo studies are needed to unravel the puzzle of gluten effects in humans and to explore the potential beneficial effects of gluten-free diets in autoimmune diseases.
38556189	ADVANCES IN NON-RESPONSIVE AND REFRACTORY CELIAC DISEASE.	Non-responsive celiac disease (NRCD) is relatively common. It is generally attributed to persistent gluten exposure and resolves after correction of diet errors. However, other complications of CD and disorders clinically mimicking CD, need to be excluded. Novel therapies are being evaluated to facilitate mucosal recovery, which might benefit NRCD patients. Refractory CD (RCD) is rare and is currently divided into two types. The etiology of RCD type 1 (RCDI) is unclear, a possible switch to gluten-independent autoimmunity is suspected in some patients, while RCD type II (RCDII) represents a low-grade intraepithelial lymphoma. RCDI remains a diagnosis of exclusion, requiring ruling out gluten intake and other non-malignant causes of villous atrophy. Diagnosis of RCDII relies on the demonstration of a clonal population of neoplastic intraepithelial lymphocytes with an atypical immunophenotype. RCDI and RCDII generally responds to open capsule budesonide, but the latter has a dismal prognosis due to severe malnutrition and frequent progression to Enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma and more efficient therapy is needed.
22209739	Changes of body mass index in celiac children on a gluten-free diet.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: Studies of adults and children with celiac disease (CD) performed mostly in tertiary care centers have reported an increased risk of overweight during gluten-free diet (GFD). We measured body mass index (BMI) of CD children followed by family pediatricians in order to estimate prevalence of underweight and overweight at diagnosis and to describe BMI changes during GFD. METHODS AND RESULTS: We compared 150 CD children (age range 2-16 yrs) under GFD from a median (IQR) time of 4.4 (4.2) years with 288 healthy children matched for gender and age. We also evaluated retrospectively BMI changes between CD diagnosis and the current evaluation. The median (IQR) BMI of CD patients was significantly lower than that of controls [-0.38 (1.46) vs. 0.09 (1.18) SDS, p < 0.0001, Italian reference data]. Using the International Obesity Task Force classifications, CD children were less frequently overweight or obese (12% vs. 23.3%, p = 0.014) and more frequently underweight (16% vs. 4.5%, p < 0.001) than controls. During GFD, there was a marked decrease of number of underweight subjects (13 vs. 27) and a minimal increase of number of overweight subjects (9 vs. 6) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of overweight and obesity at diagnosis of CD and during GFD in children followed by family pediatricians is substantially lower than that reported in tertiary care centers. On the other hand, the high frequency of underweight at diagnosis confirms the need of careful personalized nutritional management.
28159837	Haemoglobin decline before coeliac disease diagnosis: a nationwide transfusion cohort study of 1.1 million blood donors.	
25022217	Advances in pediatric celiac disease.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize the recent advances in celiac disease in children. RECENT FINDINGS: New clues to the pathogenesis of celiac disease continue to emerge that may implicate the role of microbiome changes, antirotavirus VP7 antibodies, and the Parkinson's disease seven gene in celiac disease. Updated guidelines in pediatrics no longer support biopsies in all patients with celiac disease who have been identified by serology, clinical signs, and genetics. Serology screening of total immunoglobulin A in all patients may not be necessary in select patients. Prevalence and additional diseases associated with celiac disease continue to be elucidated. SUMMARY: Our knowledge of celiac disease continues to grow with increasing evidence of the pathogenesis, genetics, diagnosis, and risk factors of the disease. Major changes have been made with respect to the guidelines for pediatric celiac disease, and potential improvements to simplify the algorithms for diagnosis and elimination of unessential testing have been proposed by new studies.
28289500	Olmesartan-Induced Enteropathy.	Olmesartan-induced enteropathy mimics celiac disease clinically and pathologically. As in celiac disease, the pathologic findings are villous atrophy and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes. Clinical presentation of olmesartan-induced enteropathy includes diarrhea, weight loss, and nausea. In contrast to celiac disease, tissue transglutaminase is not elevated and there is no response to a gluten-free diet. Including this entity in the differential diagnosis of sprue-like enteropathy is critical for its early diagnosis since replacing olmesartan with an alternative antihypertensive drug can simplify the diagnostic workup and provide both clinical and histologic improvement.
31831931	Novel targets for drug discovery in celiac disease.	Celiac disease is a lifelong, immunological disorder induced by dietary protein-gluten, in a genetically susceptible populations, resulting in different clinical manifestations, the release of antibodies, and damage to the intestinal mucosa. The only recommended therapy for the disease is to strictly follow a gluten-free diet (GFD), which is difficult to comply with. A GFD is found to be ineffective in some active Celiac disease cases. Therefore, there is an unmet need for an alternative nondietary therapeutic approach. The review focuses on the novel drug targets for Celiac disease.
34978241	Gut inflammation in CVID: causes and consequences.	INTRODUCTION: There is a wide spectrum of noninfectious gastrointestinal pathology, causing considerable morbidity and mortality in CVID, where both etiology and effective therapy are under debate. AREAS COVERED: This review will focus on the noninfectious inflammation in the GI tract in CVID patients, covering the both the upper and lower GI tract inflammation, including the liver. The controversy of the CVID enteropathy definition and that of gluten-free diet for celiac-like disease in CVID will be discussed. Furthermore, the review will cover the link between GI inflammation and GI cancer. Finally, the role of gut microbiota, IgA, and genetics and its relationship with CVID enteropathy is scrutinized. The authors reviewed literature from PubMed. EXPERT OPINION: The heterogeneity and the unknown mechanism behind CVID enteropathy, and thereby the lack of effective treatment, is one of the key challenges in the field of CVID. Celiac-like disease in CVID is due to immune dysregulation, and a gluten-free diet is therefore not indicated. Gut microbial dysbiosis and mucosal IgA can initiate systemic and local inflammation and is involved in the immune dysregulation in CVID. Considering the heterogeneity of CVID enteropathy, personalized medicine is probably the future for these patients.
27338852	Prevalence and associated factors of abnormal liver values in children with celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: The prevalence and factors associated with transaminasemia in celiac disease are poorly known. AIMS: To investigate these issues in paediatric celiac patients and controls. METHODS: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was studied in 150 children with untreated celiac disease, 161 disease controls and 500 population-based controls. The association between ALT and clinical and histological variables and the effect of a gluten-free diet were investigated in celiac patients. RESULTS: ALT was >30U/l: celiac disease 14.7%, ulcerative colitis 37.2%, Crohn's disease 16.7%, reflux disease 16.2%, functional gastrointestinal symptoms 8.9%, and controls 3.6%. Factors associated with increased ALT were poor growth (45.5% vs 24.2%, P=0.039) and severe villous atrophy (median 23.0U/l vs partial atrophy 19.0U/l, P=0.008), but not age, sex, body-mass index, type or severity of symptoms and co-morbidities. ALT had a moderate correlation with endomysial (r=0.334, P<0.001) and transglutaminase antibodies (r=0.264, P=0.002) and ferritin (r=-0.225, P=0.03), but not with other laboratory values. On gluten-free diet median ALT decreased from 22.0U/l to 18.0U/l (P=0.002) and 80% of the high values normalized. CONCLUSION: Increased ALT is associated with more advanced serological and histological celiac disease. Adherence to a gluten-free diet appears to result in normalization or reduction of ALT levels.
31472694	An association between crypt apoptotic bodies and mucosal flattening in celiac disease patients exposed to dietary gluten.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is characterized histologically by inflammation and villous atrophy. Villous atrophy is thought to result from a disruption of epithelial cellular proliferation and death. Epithelial cells in intestinal mucosa normally proliferate in the crypts and migrate towards the lumen, eventually dying. Apoptotic bodies in crypts are usually abnormal and are associated with certain disease states. The presence of crypt apoptosis in celiac disease has not been thoroughly examined by routine histologic assessment of crypt apoptotic body count (ABC). METHODS: We quantified the ABC in duodenal biopsies from celiac patients before and after initiation of a gluten-free diet (GFD). We examined twenty-three duodenal biopsies from adult patients with celiac disease at diagnosis and following GFD and determined the maximum ABC in 10 consecutive crypts. Fourteen biopsies from heartburn patients served as controls. RESULTS: Mean duration between paired biopsies was 2.9 (0.5-8.5) years. Mean maximum ABC in active celiac disease was 5.44 per crypt and decreased to 2.60 with GFD (p = <.0001). The mean maximum ABC in controls was 1.79, lower than both active celiac disease and GFD (p = <.0001 and p = .019 respectively). Flat lesions with total villous atrophy (mean: 6.44) showed a higher ABC compared to non-flat lesions (mean: 4.87); p = .04. CONCLUSIONS: Crypt ABC is markedly elevated in active celiac disease and decreases significantly with GFD, however it does not achieve normalcy. Total villous atrophy is associated with a higher ABC than all other lesions. Crypt apoptosis is likely a significant contributor to villous atrophy in celiac disease and can be appreciated by routine histologic examination.
22530453	Celiac disease in children with type 1 diabetes: impact of gluten free diet on diabetes management.	UNLABELLED: Background and aim of the work the coexistence of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) and celiac disease (CD) has been long established. METHODS: Between January 2000 and December 2009, biopsy-proven CD was diagnosed in 12 children with T1D, giving a prevalence of 4.8 % in our out-patient clinic population. For each patient with coexisting T1D and CD, two control subjects with T1D and without CD who matched for age, sex and duration of diabetes were chosen. Prospective study follow up lasted 24 months. At the enrolment time, and at 2-month intervals, time from diagnosis of T1D to diagnosis of CD, presence of gastrointestinal symptoms, HbA1c value, body mass index (BMI), Height and Weight SDS were collected by a single observer. Daily insulin requirements were also retained. RESULTS: In 3 children, CD predated the onset of T1D and these children were excluded from the analysis. The 9 children who subsequently developed CD became earlier diabetic than control group (p=0.002). Eight of these children had CD diagnosis within 1 year after T1D onset. Seven out of 9 children were positive for TTG antibodies and all were positive for EMA. A significant increase in insulin requirement was found in CD children after 1 year of GFD (p= 0.02). The mean HbAlc value in CD children was higher than in the control subjects (p<0.01).A significant increase in the insulin requirement after 1 year in the GFD compliant children was found. There was a significant improvement in height-SDS after institution of GFD in the GFD-compliant children. Families of children with both T1D and CD reported higher burden than those affected by T1D only (p=0.001). The health care providers perceived family burden to increase with CD appearance (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Our study supports the importance of screening for CD in children with T1D 1. The early treatment with GFD of biopsy-confirmed CD children promotes a significant catch-up growth and prevents a growth failure during the follow-up.
34072491	Expanded Role of a Dietitian in Monitoring a Gluten-Free Diet in Patients with Celiac Disease: Implications for Clinical Practice.	Access to a registered dietitian experienced in celiac disease (CD) is still limited, and consultation when available focuses primarily on the elimination of gluten from the diet. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the nutritional value of a gluten-free diet (GFD) in adult CD patients before, and one year after, the standard dietary education. The study included 72 CD patients on a GFD and 30 healthy controls. The dietary intake of both groups was assessed through a 3-day food diary, while adherence to a GFD in celiac subjects was assessed using Standardized Dietician Evaluation (SDE). Subsequently, all CD patients received detailed education on gluten sources, and 48 of them participated in a one-year follow-up. Results: Comparison with the control group showed that consumption of plant protein in CD patients was significantly lower, whereas fat and calories were higher. At baseline, only 62% of CD patients adhered to a GFD, but the standard dietary education successfully improved it. However, the nutritional value of a GFD after one year did not change, except for a reduced sodium intake. The CD subjects still did not consume enough calcium, iron, vitamin D, folic acid or fiber. In conclusion, while the standard dietary education improved GFD adherence, it did not significantly alter its nutritional value. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the role of a dietitian in the treatment of CD.
28780016	What Is Afflicting This Woman With Celiac Disease?	
28627151	[Assessment of an algorithm to identify paediatric-onset celiac disease cases through administrative healthcare databases].	OBJECTIVES: to assess the role of four administrative healthcare databases (pathology reports, copayment exemptions, hospital discharge records, gluten-free food prescriptions) for the identification of possible paediatric cases of celiac disease. DESIGN: population-based observational study with record linkage of administrative healthcare databases. SETTING AND PARTICIPANT S: children born alive in the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region (Northern Italy) to resident mothers in the years 1989-2012, identified using the regional Medical Birth Register. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: we defined possible celiac disease as having at least one of the following, from 2002 onward: 1. a pathology report of intestinal villous atrophy; 2. a copayment exemption for celiac disease; 3. a hospital discharge record with ICD-9-CM code of celiac disease; 4. a gluten-free food prescription. We evaluated the proportion of subjects identified by each archive and by combinations of archives, and examined the temporal relationship of the different sources in cases identified by more than one source. RESULT S: out of 962 possible cases of celiac disease, 660 (68.6%) had a pathology report, 714 (74.2%) a copayment exemption, 667 (69.3%) a hospital discharge record, and 636 (66.1%) a gluten-free food prescription. The four sources coexisted in 42.2% of subjects, whereas 30.2% were identified by two or three sources and 27.6% by a single source (16.9% by pathology reports, 4.2% by hospital discharge records, 3.9% by copayment exemptions, and 2.6% by gluten-free food prescriptions). Excluding pathology reports, 70.6% of cases were identified by at least two sources. A definition based on copayment exemptions and discharge records traced 80.5% of the 962 possible cases of celiac disease; whereas a definition based on copayment exemptions, discharge records, and gluten-free food prescriptions traced 83.1% of those cases. The temporal relationship of the different sources was compatible with the typical diagnostic pathway of subjects with celiac disease. CONCLUSIONS: the four sources were only partially consistent. A relevant proportion of all possible cases of paediatric celiac disease were identified exclusively by pathology reports.
22134550	Expression of microbiota, Toll-like receptors, and their regulators in the small intestinal mucosa in celiac disease.	OBJECTIVES: Less than one-tenth of the carriers of the risk genes HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 develop celiac disease, suggesting that other genetic and environmental factors are important in the pathogenesis. The role of gut microbiota has been addressed previously with inconsistent findings. Our aim was to evaluate microbiota, its receptors (Toll-like receptors [TLRs]), and regulators of the TLRs in the small intestinal mucosa in celiac disease. METHODS: Microbiota was analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (total bacteria and 10 bacterial group- and species-specific primers) and gene expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8), TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR9, and regulators of TLRs, Toll-interacting protein (TOLLIP), and single immunoglobulin IL-1R-related molecule, by relative quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in 10 children with celiac disease (untreated celiacs), 9 children with normal small intestinal mucosa (controls), and 6 adults with celiac disease with normal small intestinal mucosa after following a gluten-free diet (treated celiacs). RESULTS: Small intestinal microbiota was comparable among controls, untreated celiacs, and treated celiacs. Expression of IL-8 mRNA, a marker of intestinal inflammation, was significantly increased in untreated celiacs as compared with treated celiacs (P=0.002) and controls (P=0.001). Expression of TLR-2 mRNA was significantly decreased in untreated (P=0.001) and treated (P=0.03) celiacs, whereas expression of TLR-9 mRNA was increased in untreated celiacs (P=0.001) as compared with controls. Expression of TOLLIP mRNA was downregulated in untreated celiacs as compared with controls (P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Altered gene expression of TLR2, TLR9, and TOLLIP in small intestinal biopsies in celiac disease suggests that microbiota-associated factors may be important in the development of the disease.
32544849	Development of the Dietitian Integrated Evaluation Tool for Gluten-free Diets (DIET-GFD).	OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease (CD) treatment involves a gluten-free diet (GFD). There is no standardized tool for dietitians to objectively grade GFD adherence. This study aimed to develop a standardized tool for dietitians to evaluate and communicate GFD adherence. METHODS: Participants were recruited from the Manitoba Celiac Disease Cohort. Using a consensus process, an expert panel of gastroenterologists, dietitians, clinical health psychologists, and persons with CD developed the Dietitian Integrated Evaluation Tool for Gluten-free Diets (DIET-GFD). Two dietitians performed duplicate assessments of 27 newly diagnosed participants who had been advised to follow a GFD. The global adherence scale was further revised after panel discussions of the cases where there was uncertainty or discordance on dietitian ratings. Subsequently, the scoring system was evaluated using duplicate assessments of an additional 37 participants with CD. Interrater agreement was assessed using square-weight Cohen's kappa. RESULTS: The DIET-GFD includes features related to frequency and quantity of gluten ingestion based on self-reporting and food frequency evaluation, shopping and dining habits, how and where food is prepared and consumed, eating behaviors, and label reading skills. The DIET-GFD global assessment is reported using a 10-point ordinal descriptive scale, ranging from 1 (takes few precautions and regularly eats gluten) to 10 (no gluten in kitchen and rarely eats food prepared outside the home). The kappa of DIET-GFD global assessment was 0.845, which indicates excellent agreement. CONCLUSIONS: DIET-GFD is a useful tool for dietitians to evaluate GFD adherence. Further studies are needed to confirm that the score from the DIET-GFD is reliable across various settings.
35324937	Gluten-free diet exposure prohibits pathobiont expansion and gluten sensitive enteropathy in B cell deficient JH-/- mice.	In humans, celiac disease (CeD) is a T-cell-driven gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE) localized to the small bowel (duodenum). The presence of antibodies specific for gluten- and self-antigens are commonly used diagnostic biomarkers of CeD and are considered to play a role in GSE pathogenesis. Previously, we have described an apparent T-cell-mediated GSE in CD19-/- mice, which develop weak and abnormal B cell responses. Here, we expand on this observation and use a mouse model of complete B cell deficiency (JH-/- mice), to show that absence of a humoral immune response also promotes development of a GSE. Furthermore, 16S analysis of microbial communities in the small intestine demonstrates that a gluten-free diet suppresses the expansion of anaerobic bacteria in the small intestine and colonization of the small intestine by a specific pathobiont. Finally, we also observe that SI enteropathy in mice fed a gluten-rich diet is positively correlated with the abundance of several microbial peptidase genes, which supports that bacterial metabolism of gluten may be an important driver of GSE in our model. Collectively, results from our experiments indicate that JH-/- mice will be a useful resource to investigators seeking to empirically delineate the contribution of humoral immunity on GSE pathogenesis, and support the hypothesis that humoral immunity promotes tolerance to gluten.
33767109	Celiac Disease: Fallacies and Facts.	Our understanding of the pathophysiology of celiac disease has progressed greatly over the past 25 years; however, some fallacies about the clinical characteristics and management persist. Worldwide epidemiologic data are now available showing that celiac disease is ubiquitous. An elevated body mass index is common at the time of the diagnosis. The gluten-free diet (GFD) is an imperfect treatment for celiac disease; not all individuals show a response. This diet is widely used by people without celiac disease, and symptomatic improvement on a GFD is not sufficient for diagnosis. Finally, the GFD is burdensome, difficult to achieve, and thus has an incomplete efficacy, opening exciting opportunities for novel, nondietary treatments.
33844694	In vivo assessment of a delayed release formulation of larazotide acetate indicated for celiac disease using a porcine model.	There is no FDA approved therapy for the treatment of celiac disease (CeD), aside from avoidance of dietary gluten. Larazotide acetate (LA) is a first in class oral peptide developed as a tight junction regulator, which is a lead candidate for management of CeD. A delayed release formulation was tested in vitro and predicted release in the mid duodenum and jejunum, the target site of CeD. The aim of this study was to follow the concentration versus time profile of orally administered LA in the small intestine using a porcine model. A sensitive liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method was developed to quantify LA concentrations in porcine intestinal fluid samples. Oral dosing of LA (1 mg total) in overnight fasted pigs resulted in time dependent appearance of LA in the distal duodenum and proximal jejunum. Peak LA concentrations (0.32-1.76 muM) occurred at 1 hour in the duodenum and in proximal jejunum following oral dosing, with the continued presence of LA (0.02-0.47 muM) in the distal duodenum and in proximal jejunum (0.00-0.43 muM) from 2 to 4 hours following oral dosing. The data shows that LA is available in detectable concentrations at the site of CeD.
27334430	Celiac disease: understanding the gluten-free diet.	PURPOSE: The only effective and safe treatment of celiac disease (CD) continues being strict exclusion of gluten for life, the so-called gluten-free diet (GFD). Although this treatment is highly successful, following strict GFD poses difficulties to patients in family, social and working contexts, deteriorating his/her quality of life. We aimed to review main characteristics of GFD with special emphasis on factors that may interfere with adherence to it. METHODS: We conducted a search of various databases, such as PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, and Scielo, with focus on key words such as "gluten-free diet", "celiac disease", "gluten" and "gluten-free diet adherence". Available literature has not reached definitive conclusions on the exact amount of gluten that is harmless to celiac patients, although international agreements establish cutoff points for gluten-free products and advise the use of clinical assessment to tailor the diet according to individual needs. Following GFD must include eliminating gluten as ingredient as well as hidden component and potential cross contamination in foods. There are numerous grains to substitute wheat but composition of most gluten-free products tends to include only a small number of them, especially rice. The diet must be not only free of gluten but also healthy to avoid nutrient, vitamins and minerals deficiencies or excess. Overweight/obesity frequency has increased among celiac patients so weight gain deserves attention during follow up. Nutritional education by a trained nutritionist is of great relevance to achieve long-term satisfactory health status and good compliance. CONCLUSIONS: A balanced GFD should be based on a combination of naturally gluten-free foods and certified processed gluten-free products. How to measure and improve adherence to GFD is still controversial and deserves further study.
25765959	Glutenase and collagenase activities of wheat cysteine protease Triticain-alpha: feasibility for enzymatic therapy assays.	Insufficient and/or improper protein degradation is associated with the development of various human pathologies. Enzymatic therapy with proteolytic enzymes aimed to improve insufficient proteolytic activity was suggested as a treatment of protease deficiency-induced disorders. Since in many cases human degradome is incapable of degrading the entire target protein(s), other organisms can be used as a source of proteases exhibiting activities distinct from human enzymes, and plants are perspective candidates for this source. In this study recombinant wheat cysteine protease Triticain-alpha was shown to refold in vitro into an autocatalytically activated proteolytic enzyme possessing glutenase and collagenase activities at acidic (or close to neutral) pH levels at the temperature of human body. Mass-spectrometry analysis of the products of Triticain-alpha-catalyzed gluten hydrolysis revealed multiple cleavage sites within the sequences of gliadin toxic peptides, in particular, in the major toxic 33-mer alpha-gliadin-derived peptide initiating inflammatory responses to gluten in celiac disease (CD) patients. Triticain-alpha was found to be relatively stable in the conditions simulating stomach environment. We conclude that Triticain-alpha can be exploited as a basic compound for development of (i) pharmaceuticals for oral administration aimed at release of the active enzyme into the gastric lumen for CD treatment, and (ii) topically active pharmaceuticals for wound debridement applications. 
30920417	Detection of Gluten in Gluten-Free Labeled Restaurant Food: Analysis of Crowd-Sourced Data.	INTRODUCTION: Adherence to a gluten-free (GF) diet is the mainstay of therapy for celiac disease. Until now, those wishing to avoid gluten in restaurants had to rely on menu labels, word of mouth, intuition, and restaurant workers' advice, with a relative dearth of supporting data. We used crowd-sourced data from users of a portable gluten detection device to estimate rates of, and identify risk factors for, gluten contamination of supposed GF restaurant foods. METHODS: We analyzed data from a portable gluten detection device (Nima), collected across the United States during an 18-month period by users who opted to share the results of their point-of-care tests. Data were sorted by region, time of day, median household income in the restaurant's vicinity, restaurant genre, and food items. We used the chi test for bivariate analysis and multiple logistic regression for multivariate analysis to identify predictors of gluten detection in restaurant food. RESULTS: There were 5,624 tests, performed by 804 users, in the examined period. Gluten was detected in 32% of GF labeled foods. Rates of gluten detection differed by meal, with 27.2% at breakfast and 34.0% at dinner (P = 0.0008). GF labeled pizza and pasta were most likely to test positive for gluten, with gluten detected in 53.2% of pizza and 50.8% of pasta samples. On multivariate analysis, GF labeled food was less likely to test positive for gluten in the West than in the Northeast United States (odds ratio 0.80; 95% confidence interval 0.67-0.95). CONCLUSIONS: This study of crowd-sourced data suggests that a substantial fraction of GF labeled restaurant foods contain detectable gluten. Although the highly sensitive Nima device may detect gluten at levels <20 parts per million (ppm), leading to gluten exposure of unknown clinical significance, our findings raise a potential concern. In addition, our findings of higher rates of gluten detection in pizza and pasta provide practical data when providing dining strategies for patients with celiac disease.
24246767	Increased risk of hepatobiliary cancers after hospitalization for autoimmune disease.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Some autoimmune diseases are associated with increased risk of liver cancer. However, there has been no comprehensive evaluation of autoimmune diseases among patients who develop different subtypes of hepatobiliary cancer. We examined the association between autoimmune diseases and cancers of the liver and biliary tract in the Swedish population. METHODS: We analyzed data from national datasets at the Center for Primary Health Care Research (Lund University, Sweden). Data on patients with autoimmune disorders were retrieved from the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register, from 1964 through 2008; 33 diseases were evaluated. Hepatobiliary cancer cases were retrieved from the Swedish Cancer Registry. We calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and hazard ratios for incident cancers and deaths from hepatobiliary cancers. RESULTS: Among 402,462 patients with autoimmune disorders, 582 were diagnosed with primary liver cancer, 330 with gallbladder cancer, 115 with extrahepatic bile duct cancer, and 43 with ampulla of Vater cancers. We identified 14 autoimmune conditions that were significantly associated with increased risk of primary liver cancer (overall SIR [any autoimmune disease], 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0-2.3), 5 conditions associated with gallbladder cancer (overall SIR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.4), and 3 associated with extrahepatic bile duct cancer (overall SIR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.3-1.9). The autoimmune disorders with the strongest association with primary liver cancer were primary biliary cirrhosis (SIR, 39.5; 95% CI, 28.2-53.8) and autoimmune hepatitis (SIR, 29.0; 95% CI, 9.1-68.2); ulcerative colitis was strongly associated with extrahepatic bile duct cancer (SIR, 5.6; 95% CI, 3.6-8.4). Celiac disease, Crohn's disease, systemic sclerosis, and ulcerative colitis were associated with at least 2 types of cancer. Increased hazard ratios were observed only for patients with biliary tract cancer who had been hospitalized for autoimmune conditions. CONCLUSIONS: In a study of the Swedish population, we identified an increased risk of hepatobiliary cancers among individuals diagnosed with autoimmune disease. Associations among different cancer types indicate that shared immunomodulatory mechanisms determine susceptibility to hepatobiliary cancer.
35098721	Gluten-free diet in postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS).	OBJECTIVES: Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a chronic disorder of the autonomic nervous system that is associated with orthostatic intolerance (OI) and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. We aimed to determine if a gluten-free diet (GFD) may be an effective treatment in patients with POTS. METHODS: Patients with confirmed POTS and without celiac disease who followed GFD for  4 weeks retrospectively completed pre- and post- GFD COMPASS-31 questionnaires. Paired-samples t-tests were conducted to compare COMPASS-31 scores before and after adopting GFD. RESULTS: All 20 patients (all females, age 16-62 years (mean age 33)), had POTS symptoms for 1-30 years (mean 10.8, SD  =  10.23 years). Eleven patients had co-morbid mast cell activation syndrome, and 8 had hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Pre-GFD COMPASS-31 scores (mean 57.8) were significantly higher than post-GFD scores (mean 38.2, t(19) = -8.92, p < 0.00001), with the largest improvement noted in the OI (p < 0.00001), vasomotor, (p  =  0.0034), and GI (p  =  0.0004) domains and with a mean reduction in total COMPASS-31 score by 33.9% after implementing GFD. All patients reported improved symptoms on GFD with mean self-assessed improvement of 50.5% (range 10-99%). DISCUSSION: GFD may be effective in reducing the symptom burden in patients with POTS, particularly in the OI, vasomotor, and GI symptom domains. Large prospective studies are necessary to confirm whether GFD is an effective long-term treatment option for patients.
27217874	[Acute intestinal obstruction revealing enteropathy associated t-cell lymphoma, about a case].	Enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL) is a rare complication of celiac disease (CD). We report a case of EATL associated with CD revealed by acute intestinal obstruction. A North African woman of 38 years old with a history of infertility and chronic abdominal pain was admitted in emergency with acute intestinal obstruction. During the surgery, we found a tumor on the small intestine with mesenteric lymphadenopathy. Histology and immunohistochemistry of the specimen objectified a digestive T lymphoma CD3+ and immunological assessment of celiac disease was positive. The diagnosis of EATL was thus retained. Chemotherapy (CHOEP protocol) was established as well as gluten-free diet with a complete response to treatment. The EATL is a rare complication of CD that can be revealed by intestinal obstruction. The prognosis can be improved by early treatment involving surgery and chemotherapy. Its prevention requires early diagnosis of celiac and gluten-free diets. 
27534885	Long-term mucosal recovery and healing in celiac disease is the rule - not the exception.	OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of persistent villous atrophy (VA) in patients with celiac disease (CD) on a gluten-free diet (GFD) varies greatly between studies. Most studies show a relatively high prevalence of mucosal atrophy and inflammation in treated patients, a finding which have led to a concept of non-responsive CD. Few studies have examined the prevalence of long-term mucosal healing. Our study aimed to determine the extent of mucosal healing in a cohort of Norwegian patients with CD treated with GFD for several years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult patients diagnosed with VA between 1989 and 2009 were included. We performed a follow-up gastroscopy with duodenal biopsies. Two pathologists evaluated the biopsies according to the Marsh-Oberhuber classification. Mucosal healing was defined as Marsh 0 while mucosal recovery was defined as Marsh 0-2. RESULTS: Duodenal biopsies were obtained from 127 adult patients with established CD. After a follow-up time of 8.1 years (median, range 2.3-22.3), 103 (81%) of the patients showed mucosal healing, 120 patients (94%) showed mucosal recovery, and 7 patients (6%) showed persistent VA. In addition, 103 of the 127 patients (81%) had undergone a routine follow-up biopsy 12.6 months (median, range 5.2-28.8) after diagnosis. At the time of the routine follow-up, only 52 of these patients (50.5%) had achieved mucosal recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Although half of the patients had persistent VA at the time of routine follow-up, both long-term mucosal recovery and healing is possible for the vast majority of adult patients with CD.
23470429	A proposed reference change value for an IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase immunoassay to improve interpretation of serial results in celiac patients.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder caused by an inappropriate immunological response to gluten ingestion in genetically susceptible individuals. IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies have been widely employed as a specific biochemical marker for CD. Recent studies have also shown its usefulness in evaluating patient compliance with a gluten-free diet. METHODS: A group of 28 subjects with CD was selected for the study. Each fulfilled the requirement of a gluten-free diet for more than one year. IgA anti-tTG determination was performed every two months for half a year. These data were used to estimate the biological variation (BV) of IgA anti-tTG in celiac patients and to calculate the reference change value (RCV). RESULTS: The within-subject biological variation (CVI) and between-subject biological variation (CV(G)) were 19.2% and 75.6%, respectively, and the index of individuality was 0.25. The RCV calculated using these data together with our analytical imprecision (5.7%) was 55.5% for a 95% level of significance. CONCLUSIONS: We have determined for the first time the BV and the RCV for IgA anti-tTG in a celiac population. This value and the probability curve generated from our data could be a valuable tool for monitoring patients' adherence to dietary treatment.
24029448	[Irritable bowel syndrome, celiac disease and gluten].	For many years irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and celiac disease (CD) have been considered 2 completely separate entities, with CD being clearly related to a permanent gluten intolerance and IBS having no relation with gluten ingestion. However IBS and CD symptoms may be indistinguishable, especially when diarrhea, bloating or abdominal pain predominate. In the last decade several studies have shown that the separation between CD and IBS is not so clear. Thus, some patients who have been diagnosed of IBS suffer in fact from CD. In addition, it seems that there is a group of patients who, without having CD, suffer gluten intolerance that cause them digestive symptoms similar to those of IBS. Gluten sensitivity is defined as the spectrum of morphological, immunological and functional abnormalities that respond to a gluten-free diet. This concept includes histological, immunological and clinical manifestations in the absence of evident morphological abnormalities. Therefore, it is mandatory to establish in a scientific way in which patients a gluten-free diet will be beneficial as well as when this is not justified. 
34334709	Self-reported nonceliac wheat sensitivity in an outpatient digestive endoscopy center: high frequency but insufficient medical approach.	OBJECTIVE: 'Self-reported wheat sensitivity' (SRWS) is a self-reported condition caused by wheat ingestion in the absence of celiac disease or wheat allergy. The aim of the study was to investigate the frequency and characteristics of SRWS in outpatients referred for digestive endoscopy. METHODS: The study, performed at the University of Palermo, enrolled 496 outpatients. RESULTS: Seven individuals (1.4%) had an already established diagnosis of celiac disease. The questionnaire was administered to the other 489 individuals: 98 subjects (20%) were SRWS, the remaining 391 served as controls (i.e. not-SRWS). SRWS patients were younger (P < 0.001), with a higher percentage of females (P = 0.002) than not-SRWS. 'gastroesophageal reflux disease and ulcer-like dyspepsia' and 'chronic unexplained diarrhea' were more frequently the reasons for the endoscopy study in SRWS than in not-SRWS (P = 0.002, and P = 0.05, respectively). Food allergies/intolerances (P = 0.04), milk allergy/intolerance (P = 0.0001), GERD (P = 0.0001), IBS (0.0001), anxiety (P = 0.005) and depression (P = 0.04) were the previous medical diagnoses reported more frequently in SRWS patients than in not-SRWS. In the SRWS group, 38% of the patients had already undergone previous upper endoscopy and 24% colonoscopy. After these investigations, 58% of SRWS patients received no diagnosis, and the other 42% were informed that they 'were not suffering from celiac disease or wheat allergy'. Finally, 28.6% SRWS patients had followed a gluten-free diet (GFD), and 71.4% of them referred being asymptomatic on GFD. CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed a high frequency of SRWS in outpatients referred to a digestive endoscopy center and a lack of medical accuracy in identifying a possible gluten-related disease. REGISTRATION: The study was registered on Clinicaltrials.gov (registration number: NCT04154137), accessible at: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04154137?term=non+celiac+wheat&draw=2&rank=1.
22495987	Dietary exposure to fumonisins and evaluation of nutrient intake in a group of adult celiac patients on a gluten-free diet.	SCOPE: The main objectives of this study were to estimate dietary fumonisin exposure and nutrient intake in a group of patients diagnosed with celiac disease compared to non-celiac subjects. METHODS AND RESULTS: The fumonisin level in 118 frequently consumed corn-based products was determined and dietary habits were recorded using a 7-day weighed food record. Data were then compared to those obtained for a control group. The fumonisin intake in the celiac patients was significantly higher than in controls, with mean values (+- SE) of 0.395 +- 0.049 and 0.029 +- 0.006 mug/kg body weight per day, respectively. With regard to nutritional habits, celiac patients showed a preference for a high fat diet, coupled with a high intake of sweets and soft drinks and a low intake of vegetables, iron, calcium and folate. CONCLUSION: These findings may have serious health implications for the celiac population due to the widespread occurrence of fumonisins in most of the widely consumed gluten-free products, leading to continuous exposure to this particular mycotoxin. Moreover, the recorded nutritional quality of the celiac patient's diet raises concerns regarding its long-term adequacy and its potential impact on chronic conditions such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.
26067413	Assessing Nutritional Quality and Adherence to the Gluten-free Diet in Children and Adolescents with Celiac Disease.	PURPOSE: Little is known regarding nutritional adequacy of the gluten free diet (GFD) in children and adolescents with celiac disease (CD). The study aim was to examine macro- and micronutrient intake in children with CD. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in children and adolescents (4-18 years of age) with CD (n = 32) and healthy controls (n = 32). Macro- and micronutrient intake, and glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL) intake was assessed using validated measures. Diet quality was assessed using the Canadian Healthy Eating Index (HEI-C) and the Alberta Nutrition Guidelines. Values are shown as mean +- SE. RESULTS: Age (10.4 +- 0.7 years vs 8.7 +- 0.7 years; P = 0.06), weight-for-age z score (P = 0.27), and height-for-age z score (P = 0.23) were not different between groups. CD children consumed more fibre (15.9 +- 1.2 g per day(CD) vs 10.8 +- 0.8 g per day (controls); P < 0.001), had higher GI (CD: 54 +- 2 vs 48 +- 1; P < 0.01) and GL (CD: 118 +- 8 vs 93 +- 7; P = 0.02), and lower folate (146.7 +- 15.3 (CD) vs 245.4 +- 21.8 microg per day (controls); P < 0.001) than controls. No differences in HEI-C scores (<= and > 80) were observed between groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Children with CD had high intakes of fibre, GI, and GL and lower intakes of folate. This has implications for dietary counselling in this population.
27185419	The Gluten-Free Diet: Recognizing Fact, Fiction, and Fad.	
26636515	Nutritional profile of adult patients with celiac disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic immune-mediated gluten dependent enteropathy induced by ingestion of gluten, characterized by intestinal malabsorption and subtotals or total atrophy of intestinal villi. The predominant consequence of CD in untreated patients, is malnutrition as a result of malabsorption. Moreover, several and increasing extra-intestinal clinical manifestations have been described in the CD patients. Strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) improves nutritional status, inducing an increase in fat and bone compartments, but does not completely normalize body composition and nutritional deficiencies. An early and accurate evaluation of nutritional status can be of the pivotal step in the clinical management of the adult CD patients. The aim of this review is to present the most important and recent data on nutritional and metabolic features in the CD adult patients, the related implications and the effects of the GFD on these conditions. 
36574002	Celiac Disease Frequency Is Increased in IgE-Mediated Food Allergy and Could Affect Allergy Severity and Resolution.	OBJECTIVES: An increased frequency of celiac disease (CeD) has been reported in severe Immunoglobulin E (IgE) -mediated food allergy (FA). This observation requires confirmation, and whether CeD affects FA severity and resolution is unknown. The study aims to estimate the prevalence of CeD in patients with FA and to investigate whether CeD affects FA severity and oral tolerance. METHODS: Consecutive patients with FA referred for allergen reintroduction, either to evaluate allergy resolution or to start oral immunotherapy (OIT), were evaluated for CeD and for FA severity. The primary outcome was the prevalence of CeD. Secondary outcomes were the frequency of severe FA and the level of clinical tolerance at study entry and at last follow-up in patients with isolated FA versus patients with FA + CeD. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-eight patients were included. CeD was confirmed in 15 patients (6.6%) of whom, 8 patients had a previously established diagnosis of CeD and were on a gluten-free diet. Severe FA was observed in 12 patients with FA + CeD (80%) versus 88 patients with FA (42%) ( P = 0.006). At baseline, patients with FA + CeD had significantly higher median allergen-specific IgE levels [61.8 kU/L; interquartile range (IQR) 11.6-279.0] compared to patients with FA (20.3 kU/L; IQR 2.9-72.7) ( P < 0.001). Complete clinical tolerance was observed in 1 of 15 patients (7%) with FA + CeD versus 98 of 205 patients (48%) with FA ( P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: CeD is highly prevalent in patients with FA and could affect FA severity and response to OIT. CeD screening should be considered in patients with severe or persistent FA.
38708884	Exploring the association between microscopic colitis and celiac disease: A comprehensive analysis using the national in-patient data (2016-2019).	BACKGROUND: Several investigations suggested correlation between microscopic colitis (MC) and celiac disease (CD). This study aimed to examine this relationship using large-sized, population-based data with adequate control for confounding factors. METHODS: This study employed the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database over 4 years (2016-2019). Patients with/without MC in the presence/absence of CD were identified through ICD-10 codes. Univariate and multi-variate analyses involving odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were performed. RESULTS: Overall, 26,836,118 patients were analyzed. Of whom, 6,836 patients had MC (n = 179 with CD and n = 6,657 without CD). The mean hospital stay was not significantly different between both groups (5.42 +- 5.44 days vs. 4.95 +- 4.66 days, P = 0.202). The univariate analysis revealed a significant association between MC and CD (OR = 22.69, 95% [19.55, 26.33], P < 0.0001). In the multi-variate analysis, which adjusted for potential confounders including age, race, hospital region, hospital teaching status, ZIP income, smoking status, alcohol overuse, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, lipidemia-related disorders, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, and selected auto-immune diseases, the association remained significant (OR = 15.71, 95% CI [13.52, 18.25], P < 0.0001). Moreover, in patients with MC, the presence of CD emerged as a significant, independent variable of in-hospital mortality in univariate (OR = 2.87, 95% [1.14, 7.21], P = 0.025) and multi-variate (OR = 3.37, 95% CI [1.32, 8.60], P = 0.011) analyses. CONCLUSION: This study establishes a probable link between MC and CD, backed by both univariate and multi-variate analyses, while also identifying CD as an independent risk factor for increased mortality among MC patients. These findings need to be validated in real-world clinical studies.
30801395	Effects of the Gluten-free Diet on Body Mass Indexes in Pediatric Celiac Patients.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine the effects of the gluten-free diet (GFD) on body mass indexes (BMIs) in children with celiac disease at University of Chicago before and after 2011, when processed gluten-free foods became readily available on the market. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of children seen at University of Chicago Celiac Center from January 2002 to May 2016. BMI was recorded upon GFD initiation in addition to at least 1 other timepoint: 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and 4+ years. We compared the rate of BMI increase in children who were diagnosed before versus after 2011. RESULTS: A total of 147 children (66% girls) with biopsy-confirmed celiac disease were included in the study. The mean BMI at diagnosis was 17.8 (standard deviation 3.9) for those diagnosed before 2011 and 17.1 (standard deviation 2.7) for those diagnosed after 2011. Based on a mixed-effects random-intercept random-slope regression model, there was no evidence for significant difference in BMI change over time between the 2 groups (P value = 0.36). BMI values overall were noted to increase after starting the GFD, even at the first appointment. Serologies were monitored after patients started the GFD and approached normal values, allowing us to conclude that patients were adherent to the GFD. CONCLUSIONS: Although overall we observed no significant changes in BMI before and after 2011, we did notice that in adolescent celiac patients there was a trend toward a higher postdiagnosis BMI in the years after 2011. We speculate that teenagers may be especially vulnerable to choosing quick and easy processed gluten-free options over more healthy, natural alternatives leading to a rise in their BMIs after the 2011 surge in production of processed gluten-free foods on the market. Therefore, special attention must be paid to this population to insure ongoing healthy food choices even after many years on the GFD.
24272886	Laparoscopic placement of adjustable gastric band in patients with autoimmune disease or chronic steroid use.	BACKGROUND: Past medical or family history of autoimmune diseases and patient chronic steroid use are label contraindications for laparoscopic placement of adjustable gastric band (LAGB). We reviewed our experience with placement of LAGB in patients with autoimmune disease or chronic steroid use. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of our prospective bariatric database. All patients who underwent LAGB and had a diagnosis of autoimmune disease or chronic steroid use with at least 1-year follow-up data were included in the study. Data on demographics, weight loss, and complications were collected. RESULTS: Sixteen patients with autoimmune diseases or chronic steroid use underwent LAGB. Diseases included were lupus (n = 6), sarcoidosis (n = 4), renal transplant (n = 2), rheumatoid arthritis (n = 1), ulcerative colitis (n = 1), Grave's disease (n = 1), and celiac disease (n = 1). No patients developed infectious complications. One patient required port replacement due to malfunction, and one patient underwent a conversion to gastric bypass due to failure of weight loss. The average preoperative body mass index was 46.8 kg/m(2) with an average weight of 292.0 lbs. Average excess weight loss was 39.8 % (range, 7.4 to 95.5 %) at a median follow-up of 54 months. CONCLUSIONS: Our review indicates that LAGB in patients with autoimmune diseases or chronic steroid use is safe, with no infectious complications and only one explant. Some of these autoimmune conditions may improve following significant weight loss, but larger studies are required to further substantiate these findings.
33878915	Celiac disease: Understandings in diagnostic, nutritional, and medicinal aspects.	Celiac disease (CD) is characterized by clinical polymorphism, with classic, asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic, and extra-intestinal forms, which may lead to diagnostic delay and exposure to serious complications. CD is a multidisciplinary health concern involving general medicine, pediatric, and adult gastroenterology, among other disciplines. Immunology and pathology laboratories have a fundamental role in diagnosing and monitoring CD. The diagnosis consists of serological testing based on IgA anti-transglutaminase (TG2) antibodies combined with IgA quantification to rule out IgA deficiency, a potential misleading factor of CD diagnosis. Positive TG2 serology should be corroborated by anti-endomysium antibody testing before considering an intestinal biopsy. Owing to multiple differential diagnoses, celiac disease cannot be confirmed based on serological positivity alone, nor on isolated villous atrophy. In children with classical signs or even when asymptomatic, with high levels of CD-linked markers and positive HLA DQ2 and/or DQ8 molecules, the current trend is to confirm the diagnosis on basis of the non-systematic use of the biopsy, which remains obligatory in adults. The main challenge in managing CD is the implementation and compliance with a gluten-free diet (GFD). This explains the key role of the dietitian and the active participation of patients and their families throughout the disease-management process. The presence of the gluten in several forms of medicine requires the sensitization of physicians when prescribing, and particularly when dispensing gluten-containing formulations by pharmacists. This underlines the importance of the contribution of the pharmacist in the care of patients with CD within the framework of close collaboration with physicians and nutritionists.
23083994	Nutrition assessment in celiac disease.	The gluten-free diet is currently the only treatment for celiac disease, and patients should be monitored closely by a dietitian who is knowledgeable regarding this diet. Evaluation by a dietitian includes a comprehensive assessment of dietary history, with an emphasis on caloric and micronutrient intake. Patient knowledge of the gluten-free diet is assessed and interpretation of food labels is taught. Identification of micronutrient deficiencies or comorbid gastrointestinal conditions may occur during a comprehensive dietary assessment. In patients with evidence of gluten exposure, a thorough evaluation for cross-contamination is performed.
29324472	Collagenous Enteritis is Unlikely a Form of Aggressive Celiac Disease Despite Sharing HLA-DQ2/DQ8 Genotypes.	Collagenous enteritis is an uncommon small intestinal injury pattern with unclear pathogenesis. While it has been speculated that collagenous enteritis represents a form of refractory celiac disease, recent clinical studies suggest a potential link to exposure to the antihypertensive medication olmesartan. Here we hypothesized that the pathogenesis of collagenous enteritis involves both genetic and environmental factors. All subjects with biopsy-proven collagenous enteritis diagnosed between 2002 and 2015 were identified from 2 tertiary care medical centers. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction on archived tissue. Celiac disease serology, past medical history, medications, smoking history, demographics, histology, clinical management, and follow-up were recorded. A total of 32 subjects were included. In contrast to celiac disease, subjects with collagenous enteritis were mostly elderly (median age at diagnosis, 69 y; range, 33 to 84 y). Seventy percent of collagenous enteritis subjects harbored celiac disease susceptibility alleles HLA-DQ2/DQ8; however, only 1 subject had elevated serum levels of celiac disease-associated autoantibodies while on a gluten-containing diet. Furthermore, 56% of subjects were taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 36% proton-pump inhibitors, 28% statins, and 32% olmesartan at the time of diagnosis. Discontinuation of olmesartan and treatments with steroids and/or gluten-free diet resulted in symptomatic and histologic improvement. Neither lymphoma nor collagenous enteritis-related death was seen in this cohort. Therefore, while collagenous enteritis shares similar HLA genotypes with celiac disease, the difference in demographics, the lack of celiac disease-associated autoantibodies, and potential link to medications as environmental triggers suggest the 2 entities are likely distinct in pathogenesis.
29991548	Gluten-free diet: a possible treatment for chronic diarrhoea in common variable immunodeficiency.	Gastrointestinal disorders are frequent in common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). Clinical symptoms and histological alterations in CIVD can resemble celiac disease. Usually, patients with chronic diarrhoea associated with CVID do not improve with a gluten-free diet. The authors present a case of a male patient who was diagnosed with CVID at age 33 and had chronic diarrhoea which resolved after initiating a gluten-free diet. Clinical relapse occurred after gluten reintroduction. The main objective of this case report is to alert clinicians to implement a gluten-free diet in patients with CVID with chronic diarrhoea.
34402581	Advances in quantification and analysis of the celiac-related immunogenic potential of gluten.	Gluten-free products have emerged in response to the increasing prevalence of gluten-related disorders, namely celiac disease. Therefore, the quantification of gluten in products intended for consumption by individuals who may suffer from these pathologies must be accurate and reproducible, in a way that allows their proper labeling and protects the health of consumers. Immunochemical methods have been the methods of choice for quantifying gluten, and several kits are commercially available. Nevertheless, they still face problems such as the initial extraction of gluten in complex matrices or the use of a standardized reference material to validate the results. Lately, other methodologies relying mostly on mass spectrometry-based techniques have been explored, and that may allow, in addition to quantitative analysis, the characterizationof gluten proteins. On the other hand, although the level of 20 mg/kg of gluten detected by these methods is sufficient for a product to be considered gluten-free, its immunogenic potential for celiac patients has not been clinically validated. In this sense, in vitro and in vivo models, such as the organoid technology applied in gut-on-chip devices and the transgenic humanized mouse models, respectively, are being developed for investigating both the gluten-induced pathogenesis and the treatment of celiac disease. Due to the ubiquitous nature of gluten in the food industry, as well as the increased prevalence of gluten-related disorders, here we intend to summarize the available methods for gluten quantification in food matrices and for the evaluation of its immunogenic potential concerning the development of novel therapies for celiac disease to highlight active research and discuss knowledge gaps and current challenges in this field.
30384202	The role of gluten in multiple sclerosis: A systematic review.	BACKGROUND: There is an increasing interest in diet as a modifying factor in multiple sclerosis (MS), and gluten has been suggested to affect MS. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review is to qualitatively evaluate the evidence on the role of gluten in MS. METHODS: A review protocol was submitted to PROSPERO. A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, Cab Abstracts, and Google Scholar. Studies on patients with MS, clinically isolated syndrome, or celiac disease presenting with MS-related markers were included, if they investigated effects of diets containing specified amounts of gluten or associations between gluten sensitivities and MS. RESULTS: Forty-nine publications presenting 50 studies/cases met the inclusion criteria. Study designs, methods, and outcomes varied broadly across studies. Two intervention studies found a positive effect of a gluten-free diet on disease-related markers in patients with MS. One prospective cohort study also found a positive effect of a gluten-free diet, while a survey found intake of cereal/bread to be protective against MS. Four observational studies did not find increased comorbidity of MS and celiac disease. Seventeen studies investigated the level of different gluten-sensitivity markers in patients with MS with inconsistent results. Finally, 12 cases and 13 posters/abstracts/master's theses contributed to shed light on the topic. CONCLUSIONS: There is still not sufficient evidence to state whether gluten plays a role in MS, but limitations of current evidence have been identified and directions of future research have been suggested.
22825364	Persistent duodenal intraepithelial lymphocytosis despite a long-term strict gluten-free diet in celiac disease.	OBJECTIVES: In celiac disease, complete histological normalization of the small-intestinal mucosa occurs in only 8-20% of adult patients after commencing a gluten-free diet. Intraepithelial lymphocytosis may persist for years while villous morphology normalizes. Factors contributing to this and the clinical relevance of persistent intraepithelial lymphocytosis were here investigated. METHODS: Altogether 177 adult celiac disease patients adhering to a long-term strict gluten-free diet were enrolled. Co-morbidities, ongoing medications, and consumption of oats and wheat-starch were recorded. Small-bowel morphology and intraepithelial lymphocyte count as well as laboratory parameters of malabsorption were evaluated. Gastrointestinal symptoms and psychological well-being were measured by structured questionnaires. RESULTS: In all, 170 (96%) out of the 177 patients evinced normal villous architecture and 7 (4%) villous atrophy. Among patients with normal villous structure, 96 (56%) had persistent intraepithelial lymphocytosis and 74 (44%) completely normal small-intestinal mucosa. Consumption of oats was the only factor contributing to the persistent intraepithelial lymphocytosis. Co-morbidities, Helicobacter pylori gastritis, drugs, or wheat-starch in the diet had no effect. The clinical outcome of the patients with persistent intraepithelial lymphocytosis was good, since no signs of malabsorption, excess malignancies, increase in gastrointestinal symptoms, or impaired quality of life were associated with it when compared to subjects with completely normal mucosa. The only outcome found in this study was a significantly lower, although normal villous height-crypt depth ratio among the patients with persistent intraepithelial lymphocytosis as compared to those with completely normal mucosa. CONCLUSIONS: Despite excellent villous recovery in this study, persistent intraepithelial lymphocytosis was still common among celiac disease patients on a long-term strict gluten-free diet. Consumption of oats was associated with persistent duodenal lymphocytosis and this calls for further investigations. The prognosis of patients with persistent intraepithelial lymphocytosis seems to be good while adhering to a gluten-free diet for a mean of 11 years.
22465751	Urticaria pigmentosa in a female patient with celiac disease: response to a gluten-free diet.	
23496382	Celiac disease.	Celiac disease, with a prevalence around 1% of the general population, is the most common genetically-induced food intolerance in the world. Triggered by the ingestion of gluten in genetically predisposed individuals, this enteropathy may appear at any age, and is characterized by a wide variety of clinical signs and symptoms. Among them, gastrointestinal presentations include chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss or failure to thrive in children; but extra-intestinal manifestations are also common, and actually appear to be on the rise. They include a large variety of ailments, such as dermatitis Herpetiformis, anemia, short stature, osteoporosis, arthritis, neurologic problems, unexplained elevation of transaminases, and even female infertility. For the clinician interested in oral diseases, celiac disease can lead to delayed tooth eruption, dental enamel hypoplasia, recurrent oral aphthae. Diagnosing celiac disease requires therefore a high degree of suspicion followed by a very sensitive screening test: serum levels of the autoantibody anti-tissue transglutaminase. A positive subject will then be confirmed by an intestinal biopsy, and will then be put on a strict gluten-free diet, that in most cases will bring a marked improvement of symptoms. Newer forms of treatment which in the future will probably be available to the non-responsive patients are currently being actively pursued. 
34441049	Dermatitis Herpetiformis: An Update on Diagnosis, Disease Monitoring, and Management.	Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), Duhring disease, is caused by gluten sensitivity and affects 11.2 to 75.3 per 100,000 people in the United States and Europe with an incidence of 0.4 to 3.5 per 100,000 people per year. DH is characterized by a symmetrical blistering rash on the extensor surfaces with severe pruritus. The diagnosis continues to be made primarily by pathognomonic findings on histopathology, especially direct immunofluorescence (DIF). Recently, anti-epidermal transglutaminase (TG3) antibodies have shown to be a primary diagnostic serology, while anti-tissue transglutaminase (TG2) and other autoantibodies may be used to support the diagnosis and for disease monitoring. Newly diagnosed patients with DH should be screened and assessed for associated diseases and complications. A gluten-free diet (GFD) and dapsone are still mainstays of treatment, but other medications may be necessary for recalcitrant cases. Well-controlled DH patients, managed by a dermatologist, a gastroenterologist, and a dietician, have an excellent prognosis. Our review comprehensively details the current diagnostic methods, as well as methods used to monitor its disease course. We also describe both the traditional and novel management options reported in the literature.
32833796	Update on celiac disease.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to describe current updates in celiac disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent developments in the understanding of the pathogenesis of celiac disease continue to emerge that may implicate the role of gluten exposure. Several studies have shown that the amount of gluten consumed by the infant may affect the age of onset of celiac disease in genetically predisposed individuals. New guidelines from the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition allow serology-based celiac diagnosis, omitting endoscopic biopsies, in children. Recent data and updated guidelines in adults no longer support biopsies in all patients who are genetically susceptible with celiac disease who have been identified by serology with clinical signs and symptoms of celiac disease. A new assay was identified in the immune response to epitopes of the tissue transglutaminase-deamidated gliadin peptide complex. In addition, a recent study shows that serum IL-2 elevations correlate with timing and severity of symptoms after gluten ingested in celiac disease patients. Measuring gluten immunogenic peptides (GIPs) in the stool of celiac patients may help monitor adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). Of importance, we should be aware that the quality of life is affected in celiac disease patients. During adolescence, the education on the importance of long-term follow-up with an adult gastroenterologist is associated with more successful rates of medical care transition for young adults with celiac disease. Latiglutenase, an orally administered mixture of two gluten-specific recombinant proteases that degrades gluten proteins into small physiologically irrelevant fragments, is currently in a phase 2 trial. Latiglutenase has shown to be safe and effective in reducing symptoms of celiac disease patients upon a GFD with improvement of quality of life. Lastly, a recent study describes a mouse model that is characteristic of celiac disease. SUMMARY: Our knowledge of celiac disease continues to grow with increasing evidence of contributory factors to its pathogenesis. There is some evidence that the quantity ingested of gluten by the infant effects the age of onset of celiac disease in genetically susceptible patients. Changes have been made to the guidelines in the diagnosis of celiac disease proposed by new studies. Recent studies have shown the significant effects on quality of life for celiac patients. As improved laboratory methods continue to be developed, these tests can have utility in both diagnosis of celiac disease and monitoring adherence to the GFD. Current therapeutic trials offer promising nondietary treatment for celiac patients. The development of an animal model can provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis of celiac disease.
23430309	Hepatitis B vaccine in celiac disease: yesterday, today and tomorrow.	Some studies showed that in celiac patients the immunological response to vaccination is similar to that one found in general population except for vaccine against hepatitis B virus (HBV). The non-responsiveness to HBV vaccine has also been described in healthy people, nevertheless the number of non-responders has been demonstrated to be higher in celiac disease (CD) patients than in healthy controls. Several hypothesis explaining this higher rate of unresponsiveness to HBV vaccine in CD patients have been described, such as the genetic hypothesis, according with CD patients carrying the disease-specific haplotype HLA-B8, DR3, and DQ2, show a lower response to HBV vaccine both in clinical expressed CD patients and in healthy people carrying the same haplotype. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that the gluten intake during the vaccination seems to influence the response to the same vaccine. Moreover, it has been demonstrated a possible genetic predisposition to hepatitis B vaccine non-responsiveness likely due to the presence of specific human leukocyte antigen haplotypes and specific single nucleotide polymorphism in genes of cytokine/cytokine receptors and toll like receptors, but the pathogenic mechanism responsible for this low responsiveness still remains unclear. The aim of this review is to focus on the possible pathogenic causes of unresponsiveness to HBV vaccine in CD patients and to propose an alternative vaccination schedule in order to improve the responsiveness to HBV vaccine in this at-risk patients.
22073907	Biochemical and immunochemical characterization of different varieties of amaranth (Amaranthus L. ssp.) as a safe ingredient for gluten-free products.	Celiac disease is a food intolerance triggered by the ingestion of gluten-containing cereals; the only therapy is a strict gluten-free diet for life. In recent years, amaranth flour has received considerable attention as an interesting source for the formulation of gluten-free products due to its high nutritional value and low content of prolamins, the toxic proteins for celiacs. The aim of this study was to characterize 40 amaranth varieties using both SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting and ELISA to assess their possible tolerance by celiac subjects. All of the amaranth samples studied showed similar binding affinities for both specific anti-gliadin antibodies and human IgAs. In most amaranth grains, the content of gluten-like proteins measured by ELISA was <20 ppm. The molecular characterization of amaranth proteins suggests that amaranth is safe for celiacs to consume. It is recommended that the most suitable amaranth varieties are those having the lowest content of proteins cross-reacting with anti-gliadin antibodies.
31513026	Celiac Disease: Extraintestinal Manifestations and Associated Conditions.	Celiac disease is a common form of enteropathy with frequent extraintestinal manifestations (EIM). Misrecognition of these presentations may lead to significant delays in diagnosis. Any organ may be involved, either through an immune/inflammatory phenomenon, or nutritional deficiencies. Some EIM, such as gluten ataxia, may be irreversible if left untreated, but most will improve with a gluten-free diet. Knowledge of the various EIM, as well as the associated conditions which do not improve on a gluten-free diet, will avoid delays in the diagnosis and management of celiac disease and associated manifestations.
31540014	Impact of FODMAP Content Restrictions on the Quality of Diet for Patients with Celiac Disease on a Gluten-Free Diet.	Restrictive diets as gluten-free (GFD) or reduced in Fermentable, Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, and Polyols (FODMAP) are used to improve gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in sensitive individuals. Aiming at comparing the nutritional quality and effects of a regular GFD regimen (R-GFD) and a low-FODMAP GFD (LF-GFD), in 46 celiac patients with persistent GI symptoms we conducted a randomized, double-blind intervention-controlled study. Patients received a personalized diet, either a strict GFD (n = 21) or a LF-GFD (n = 25) for 21 days. A validated food-frequency questionnaire before intervention and a 7-day weighed-food record after the intervention assessed the diets. Patients were 41.1 +- 10.1 years (mean +- SD), 94% women, with mean BMI 21.8 +- 2.9 kg/m2. On day 21, patients on R-GFD still showed poor nutritional adequacy compared to dietary recommendations, with decreased energy intake, even though an improvement in carbohydrates and folates was observed (all p < 0.025). In both groups, intake of iron, calcium, vitamin D, sodium and folates did not meet daily recommendations. As expected, consumption of legumes and grains was lower and that of fruits was higher in the LF-GFD group than in the R-GFD one (all p < 0.05). The nutritional quality of both diets was not different. When restrictive diets are useful to improve the persistent GI symptoms, careful nutritional surveillance and counseling is mandatory.
24780176	Diet and psoriasis, part II: celiac disease and role of a gluten-free diet.	Patients with psoriasis have been shown to have a higher prevalence of other autoimmune diseases including celiac disease, a condition marked by sensitivity to dietary gluten. A number of studies suggest that psoriasis and celiac disease share common genetic and inflammatory pathways. Here we review the epidemiologic association between psoriasis and celiac disease and perform a meta-analysis to determine whether patients with psoriasis more frequently harbor serologic markers of celiac disease. We also examine whether a gluten-free diet can improve psoriatic skin disease.
31244841	Dermatitis Herpetiformis: Novel Perspectives.	Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an inflammatory disease of the skin, considered the specific cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease (CD). Both DH and CD occur in gluten-sensitive individuals, share the same Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) haplotypes (DQ2 and DQ8), and improve following the administration of a gluten-free diet. Moreover, almost all DH patients show typical CD alterations at the small bowel biopsy, ranging from villous atrophy to augmented presence of intraepithelial lymphocytes, as well as the generation of circulating autoantibodies against tissue transglutaminase (tTG). Clinically, DH presents with polymorphic lesions, including papules, vesicles, and small blisters, symmetrically distributed in typical anatomical sites including the extensor aspects of the limbs, the elbows, the sacral regions, and the buttocks. Intense pruritus is almost the rule. However, many atypical presentations of DH have also been reported. Moreover, recent evidence suggested that DH is changing. Firstly, some studies reported a reduced incidence of DH, probably due to early recognition of CD, so that there is not enough time for DH to develop. Moreover, data from Japanese literature highlighted the absence of intestinal involvement as well as of the typical serological markers of CD (i.e., anti-tTG antibodies) in Japanese patients with DH. Similar cases may also occur in Caucasian patients, complicating DH diagnosis. The latter relies on the combination of clinical, histopathologic, and immunopathologic findings. Detecting granular IgA deposits at the dermal-epidermal junction by direct immunofluorescence (DIF) from perilesional skin represents the most specific diagnostic tool. Further, assessing serum titers of autoantibodies against epidermal transglutaminase (eTG), the supposed autoantigen of DH, may also serve as a clue for the diagnosis. However, a study from our group has recently demonstrated that granular IgA deposits may also occur in celiac patients with non-DH inflammatory skin diseases, raising questions about the effective role of eTG IgA autoantibodies in DH and suggesting the need of revising diagnostic criteria, conceivably emphasizing clinical aspects of the disease along with DIF. DH usually responds to the gluten-free diet. Topical clobetasol ointment or dapsone may be also applied to favor rapid disease control. Our review will focus on novel pathogenic insights, controversies, and management aspects of DH.
27753436	Screening for Celiac Disease in Irritable Bowel Syndrome: An Updated Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.	OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease (CD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) share similar symptoms, leading to confusion between the two and diagnostic delay. International guidelines recommend screening individuals with IBS for CD, via serological testing. However, studies published recently have cast doubt on the utility of this. We updated a previous meta-analysis examining this issue. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and EMBASE Classic were searched through to May 2016. Eligible studies recruited adults with IBS according to symptom-based criteria, physician's opinion, or questionnaire data. Tests for CD included IgA-class antigliadin antibodies (AGA), endomysial antibodies (EMA), tissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTG), or duodenal biopsies following positive serology. The proportion of individuals meeting criteria for IBS testing positive for CD was combined to give a pooled prevalence for all studies, and compared between cases with IBS and, healthy controls without (where reported), using an odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: There were 36 eligible studies, recruiting 15,256 individuals, of whom 9,275 (60.8%) met criteria for IBS. Pooled ORs for positive IgA AGAs, EMA and/or tTG, and biopsy-proven CD in IBS subjects vs. controls were 3.21 (95% CI 1.55-6.65), 2.75 (95% CI 1.35-5.61), and 4.48 (95% CI 2.33-8.60), respectively. There was no increase in ORs for any test for CD among cases with IBS in North American studies, and results were inconsistent in population-based studies. The prevalence of biopsy-proven CD was significantly higher across all subtypes of IBS. Limitations included heterogeneity in some analyses, and few North American studies. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, prevalence of positive celiac serology and biopsy-proven CD was significantly higher in subjects with symptoms suggestive of IBS vs. healthy controls. However, the utility of screening for CD in individuals with suspected IBS in North America or in the community is less clear.
33236426	Autoimmune diseases associated with common variable immune deficiency.	Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is the most prevalent primary immune deficiency, affecting roughly 2-4/100 000 individuals in the general population. The etiology is currently unknown, even if several genetic mutations have been described, and no single clinical feature or single laboratory test can establish the diagnosis, which is based on multiple criteria. CVID is characterized by B- and T-cell dysfunction that predisposes to an increased risk of infections, with the typical involvement of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Besides this well-established complication, though the coexistence of immunodeficiency and autoimmunity appears paradoxical, two-thirds of CVID patients present concomitant autoimmune disorders. Of note, autoimmunity can often be the only clinical manifestation of CVID at the time of diagnosis. The most common autoimmune disorders associated with CVID are autoimmune cytopenias, that is, immune thrombocytopenic purpura and autoimmune hemolytic anemia, either as separate entities or as concurrently (Evans syndrome). CVID patients can also manifest rheumatologic diseases (eg, arthritis, Sjogren's disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis, Behcet's syndrome) and gastrointestinal autoimmune disorders (eg, ulcerative colitis, autoimmune atrophic gastritis, celiac disease). This latter may pose a particular diagnostic challenge, as celiac-specific autoantibodies can be absent in CVID patients. Understanding the molecular basis and the clinical impact of autoimmunity in CVID patients might help manage CVID, thus reducing its diagnostic delay and preventing its complications.
29415685	Gluten-free diet may improve obstructive sleep apnea-related symptoms in children with celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: Enlarged tonsils and adenoids are the major etiology of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in children. Lymphatic hyperplasia is common to both OSA and celiac disease. We aimed to investigate the effect of a gluten-free diet on OSA symptoms in children with celiac disease. METHODS: Children with celiac disease aged 2-18 years were prospectively recruited before the initiation of a gluten-free diet. Children with negative celiac serology who underwent gastrointestinal endoscopies for other indications served as controls. All participants completed a validated OSA-related symptoms questionnaire and the pediatric sleep questionnaire (PSQ) at baseline and 6 months later. RESULTS: Thirty-four children with celiac disease (mean age 6.6 +- 3.5 years) and 24 controls (mean age 7.3 +- 4.6 years, P = 0.5) were recruited. There were no significant differences in gender, body mass index or season at recruitment between the two groups. The rate of positive PSQ scores was higher (more OSA-related symptoms) in the control group compared to the celiac group, both at recruitment and at the 6-month follow-up (33.3% vs. 11.8%, P = 0.046, and 16.7% vs. 0, P = 0.014, respectively). PSQ scores improved significantly in both groups at the 6-month follow-up (P < 0.001 for both). Improvement was significantly higher in the celiac group compared to controls (0.1 +- 0.09 vs.0.06 +- 0.06, respectively, P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Children with celiac disease had fewer OSA-related symptoms than controls, but the degree of improvement following the initiation of a gluten-free diet was significantly higher. These findings suggest that a gluten-free diet may improve OSA-related symptoms in children with celiac disease.
36416458	Frequently Asked Questions and Evidence-Based Answers on Medical Nutritional Therapy in Children with Type 1 Diabetes for Health Care Professionals.	Medical nutrition therapy is a cornerstone in type 1 diabetes management and is based on the principles of healthy eating and the recommendations presented are valid for all children and their families. Although carbohydrates are the main nutrient that affects postprandial blood glucose in individuals with type 1 diabetes, intake of carbohydrates (type and amount), protein and fat content of the meal, and glycemic index affect the postprandial glycemic response. In recent years, the relative increase in studies on Ramadan fasting for individuals with type 1 diabetes has required health professionals to be informed about this issue. The difficulties in the nutrition management of preschool children should be solved with a professional approach. The increasing frequency of celiac disease in people with type 1 diabetes and an increasing interest in a gluten-free diet for non-celiac reasons (popular diet trends for weight loss or healthy eating) make diabetes management difficult. This review provides evidence-based approaches to frequently encountered problems on medical nutrition therapy in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.
31057009	Genetic and flow cytometry analysis of seronegative celiac disease: a cohort study.	Background: Seronegative celiac disease (CD) poses a diagnostic challenge. Aims: Characterize and identify differences between seronegative and seropositive CD. Patients and methods: Retrospective cohort study examining adult patients diagnosed with CD (1980-2017). Clinical, analytical, histological, genetic and immunophenotypic data were compiled. Seronegative CD was defined as a anti-tissue transglutaminase type 2 IgA and endomysial antibodies (EMA) negative and HLA-DQ2 and/or DQ8 positive, showing clinical signs of CD plus an abnormal duodenal biopsy, and responding to a gluten-free diet (GFD). Factors associated with seronegative CD were identified through binomial logistic regression. Results: Of 315 CD patients, 289 were seropositive (91.7%) and 26 seronegative (8.3%). Among the seronegative patients, higher prevalence was observed for autoimmune thyroiditis (26.9% vs. 9.7%, p = .016), HLA-DQ8 heterozygosity (23.1% vs. 2.5%, p   .001) and Marsh I lesion (34.6% vs. 3.7%, p   .001). The two groups showed similar flow cytometry-determined duodenal immunophenotypes and rates of refractory CD. Conclusions: Seronegative CD differs mostly in genetic (more HLA-DQ8) and histologic (milder atrophy) features as compared with seropositive. Intestinal intraepithelial immunophenotype by flow cytometry, similar in both modalities, is a useful tool to diagnose seronegative CD.
28487600	Dietary compliance in celiac disease.	Celiac disease is an immune-mediated disorder that causes severe architectural disturbance in the small intestinal mucosa of genetically-predisposed individuals. Impaired absorption of multiple nutrients results and diarrhea and weight loss develop. Evidence has accumulated that a strict gluten-free diet can result in resolution of diarrhea, weight gain and normalization of nutrient malabsorption. In addition, histopathological changes also normalize, but this histopathological response appears to be time-dependent, sex-dependent and age-dependent. Compliance to a gluten-free diet is difficult and costly resulting in poor compliance and only a limited clinical response. This poses a risk for later long-term complications, including malignancy. A major practical clinical problem is the assessment of compliance to the gluten-free diet. Although symptoms may resolve and serological antibody markers may improve, multiple studies have documented ongoing architectural disturbance and inflammatory change, and with these continued inflammatory changes, a persistent risk for long-term complications. Recent immunological studies have suggested that peptides can be detected in both urine and fecal specimens that may be indicative of limited compliance. At the same time, multiple biopsy studies have demonstrated that complete normalization of the mucosa may occur in some patients within 6 mo of initiation of a gluten-free diet, but more often, up to 2 years or more may be required before repeated biopsies eventually show mucosal recovery and mucosal healing.

30802444	Lactobacilli Degrade Wheat Amylase Trypsin Inhibitors to Reduce Intestinal Dysfunction Induced by Immunogenic Wheat Proteins.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Wheat-related disorders, a spectrum of conditions induced by the ingestion of gluten-containing cereals, have been increasing in prevalence. Patients with celiac disease have gluten-specific immune responses, but the contribution of non-gluten proteins to symptoms in patients with celiac disease or other wheat-related disorders is controversial. METHODS: C57BL/6 (control), Myd88-/-, Ticam1-/-, and Il15-/- mice were placed on diets that lacked wheat or gluten, with or without wheat amylase trypsin inhibitors (ATIs), for 1 week. Small intestine tissues were collected and intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) were measured; we also investigated gut permeability and intestinal transit. Control mice fed ATIs for 1 week were gavaged daily with Lactobacillus strains that had high or low ATI-degrading capacity. Nonobese diabetic/DQ8 mice were sensitized to gluten and fed an ATI diet, a gluten-containing diet or a diet with ATIs and gluten for 2 weeks. Mice were also treated with Lactobacillus strains that had high or low ATI-degrading capacity. Intestinal tissues were collected and IELs, gene expression, gut permeability and intestinal microbiota profiles were measured. RESULTS: In intestinal tissues from control mice, ATIs induced an innate immune response by activation of Toll-like receptor 4 signaling to MD2 and CD14, and caused barrier dysfunction in the absence of mucosal damage. Administration of ATIs to gluten-sensitized mice expressing HLA-DQ8 increased intestinal inflammation in response to gluten in the diet. We found ATIs to be degraded by Lactobacillus, which reduced the inflammatory effects of ATIs. CONCLUSIONS: ATIs mediate wheat-induced intestinal dysfunction in wild-type mice and exacerbate inflammation to gluten in susceptible mice. Microbiome-modulating strategies, such as administration of bacteria with ATI-degrading capacity, may be effective in patients with wheat-sensitive disorders.
31769275	Acquired autoimmune hypothyroidism as a cause of severe growth deficiency in one of the twin sisters.	Acquired autoimmune hypothyroidism is rare in early childhood, however, it must be considered in a 4 year old child with medical his-tory of delayed growth, increased somnolence, difficulty concentrating, and reduced activity. We report on the case of full clinical picture of severe hypothyroidism in one of the twins. Thyroid function deteriorated in one of the sisters, resulting in mental, motor and growth slowdown, remaining undiagnosed for about 2 years, while the other sister developed normally. In the reported case, severe hypothy-roidism and growth deficiency were accompanied by celiac disease. Initiation of L-thyroxine therapy resulted in an immediate response that increased the growth velocity by more than 2.2 times. This confirms the dominant role of thyroid hormones over celiac disease in the growth process, as the catch up effect started before gluten free diet was introduced.
30987472	Pneumococcal vaccination in celiac disease.	INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated disorder associated with gluten exposure in genetically predisposed subjects. Areas covered: Infectious disease is one of the causes of morbidity and mortality in CD patients. Invasive streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is a particularly dangerous morbid condition in both the general population and celiac patients. Pneumococcal vaccination is the most effective means for its prevention. Expert opinion: In CD, evaluation of spleen function should be useful to select patients who may benefit from vaccination to reduce the risk of pneumococcal disease. Different strategies could be employed: physicians could search for signs of hyposplenism on peripheral blood smear or abdominal ultrasound. However, the best strategy to identify which patients will benefit from pneumococcal vaccination has not yet been defined.
35656914	Celiac patient satisfaction with nursing consultations in a gastroenterology department.	The assessment of the personal care received is an indicator of the quality of the health care system. The diagnosis of celiac disease generates concern in the patient and limits the quality of life, and adherence to treatment determines symptomatic improvement. For this reason, a nursing consultation for health and nutritional education for celiac patients has been set up in our hospital. The objectives were to know the degree of patient s satisfaction of this health program regarding technical and communicative aspects, as well as to assess the influence of adherence to the gluten-free diet (GFD) on health through clinical and analytical parameters. This is a descriptive cross-sectional observational study in patients diagnosed of celiac disease from January 2019 to June 2021 according to the Catassi criteria and who have attended the nursing consultation. Subsequently, the satisfaction survey was carried out and the clinical and analytical results were analyzed descriptively and statistically using the Student's t-test. The satisfaction of the nursing consultation was higher than 90%, highlighting aspects such as the clarity of the information, the interest and the kindness of the healthcare professionals. About 94.5% of the patients showed clinical improvement after the health education and the levels of hemoglobin, ferritin and vitamin B12 increased significantly in the analytical control after the GFD.
29084190	Celiac disease on YouTube - a study of the Polish content available on the popular video-sharing website.	Celiac disease affects about 1% of the population. Since most Polish households have a broadband Internet connection, a lot of people use web resources to learn about health and disease. YouTube service (www.youtube.com) offers a lot of videos concerning celiac disease. However, the credibility of the Polish videos available on YouTube and concerning celiac disease has never been analyzed. AIM: The aim of the study was to determine whether the YouTube service offers valuable content for Polish people affected by celiac disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and fifty-four unique videos devoted to celiac disease and available in the Polish language were identified and critically assessed. Each video was categorized due to its topic(s), and evaluated for its credibility by two independent researchers. RESULTS: In general, 127 (82.5%) videos were found to be credible. The most credible categories of content presented organizations and events related to celiac disease/celiac society, followed by culinary recipes (100.0, 100.0, and 95.6% of credible videos, respectively). The least trustworthy categories were devoted to pathobiology and advertisements (55.6 and 54.3% of credible videos, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: YouTube service can serve as a supplementary source of knowledge for people affected by celiac disease, after careful selection of trustworthy content.
23302101	Negativation of type 1 diabetes-associated autoantibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase and insulin in children treated with oral calcitriol.	BACKGROUND: Based on recent knowledge of the possible involvement of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and the results of its administration in animal models, we conducted a clinical trial by treating high-risk children, positive for T1D autoantibodies, with oral calcitriol. METHODS: The present prospective trial was performed on 12 children (1.5-13 years old) who were investigated for the potential risk of T1D because of an already diagnosed association of celiac disease and autoimmune thyroiditis (four girls), autoimmune thyroiditis at a very young age (two girls, two boys), a diagnosis of T1D in siblings (two boys), and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT; one boy, one girl). Serum autoantibody levels, including islet cell autoantibodies, anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) 65, insulin autoantibodies (IAA), and anti-tyrosine phosphatase, and markers of calcium metabolism were evaluated prior to and at 6-monthly intervals after the initiation of 0.25 mug/day calcitriol for 1-3 years. RESULTS: In all children, persistent negativation of the anti-GAD65 antibodies and IAA was observed within 0.4-2.1 years. Of the two children with IGT, the boy proved to have maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) 2, whereas the glycemic profile was normalized in the girl. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the small number of subjects and the absence of a control group in the present study, 0.25 mug/day calcitriol effectively negativates anti-GAD65 antibodies and IAA after a median time of 6 months. This simple, safe, and low-cost strategy may prove effective in the prevention of T1D in the future.
25443541	[Approach to the diagnosis and treatment of chronic anemia secondary to gastrointestinal diseases].	Iron deficiency anemia is the most common type of anemia and can cause asthenia, cognitive and functional impairment, and decompensation of underlying diseases. Iron deficiency anemia is not a disease but is the result of a potentially serious medical problem. Consequently, patients should always undergo investigation of the underlying cause. In men and postmenopausal women, the condition is caused by gastrointestinal loss and malabsorption of iron. In this group, recommended procedures are gastroscopy, colonoscopy and serological testing for celiac disease. If the results of these tests are negative, repeat examinations and iron therapy should be considered. In treatment-refractory or recurrent anemia, the small intestine should be investigated. In this case, the procedure of choice is capsule endoscopy. Iron deficiency anemia should always be treated until iron deposits have returned to normal levels. A wide variety of preparations are available, in both oral and parental formulations.

36615856	Gluten-Free Diet in Co-Existent Celiac Disease and Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus: Is It Detrimental or Beneficial to Glycemic Control, Vascular Complications, and Quality of Life?	Celiac disease (CeD) is associated with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), and both have the same genetic background. Most patients with T1DM who develop CeD are either asymptomatic or have mild CeD-related gastrointestinal symptoms. Therefore, children affected by T1DM should undergo screening for asymptomatic CeD. The aim of this review is to highlight the influence of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on glycemic control, growth rate, microvascular complications, and quality of life in patients with T1DM and CeD. PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central databases were searched. Reports reviewed were those published from 1969 to 2022 that focused on the interplay of T1DM and CeD and examined the effect of diet on glycemic control, growth rate, and quality of life. The most challenging aspect for a child with T1DM and CeD is that most GFD foods have a high glycemic index, while low glycemic index foods are recommended for T1DM. Interestingly, dietary therapy for CeD could improve the elevated HbA1c levels. Avoiding gluten added to a diabetic dietary regimen in T1DM patients might impose practical limitations and lead to important restrictions in the lifestyle of a young patient. Consequently, non-adherence to GFD in patients with T1DM and CeD is common. GFD in patients with T1DM and CeD seems to lower the incidence of micro- and macrovascular complications, but this requires further investigation. It seems that adherence to GFD in young patients with T1DM and CeD leads to regular growth and a stable body mass index without any negative effect on HbA1c or insulin requirements. Furthermore, the lipid profile and quality of life seem to have improved with the introduction of GFD.
26999328	Immunopathogenesis and therapeutic approaches in pediatric celiac disease.	Celiac Disease is an autoimmune enteropathy with increasing incidence worldwide in both adults and children. It occurs as an inflammatory condition with destruction of the normal architecture of villi on consumption of gluten and related protein products found in wheat, barley and rye. However, the exact pathogenesis is not yet fully understood. A gluten-free diet remains the main modality of therapy to date. While some patients continue to have symptoms even on a gluten-free diet, adherence to this diet is also difficult, especially for the children. Hence, there is continued interest in novel methods of therapy and the current research focus is on the promising novel non-dietary modalities of treatment. Here, we critically reviewed the existing literature regarding the pathogenesis of celiac disease in children including the role of in-utero exposure leading to neonatal and infant sensitization and its application for the development of new therapeutic approaches for these patients. 
33800620	Gluten-Free Diet: Nutritional Strategies to Improve Eating Habits in Children with Celiac Disease: A Prospective, Single-arm Intervention Study.	BACKGROUND: Elimination of gluten-containing cereals and consumption of ultra-processed gluten-free foods might cause an unbalanced diet, deficient in fiber and rich in sugar and fat, circumstances that may predispose celiac children to chronic constipation. AIM: to evaluate if counseling with a registered dietitian (RD) was capable of improving eating and bowel habits in a celiac pediatric population. METHODS: Dietetic, lipid profile and stool modifications were analyzed, comparing baseline assessments with those twelve months after receiving heathy eating and nutrition education sessions. At both time points, 3-day food records, a bowel habit record and a lipid panel were conducted. Calculated relative intake of macro- and micro-nutrients were compared with current recommendations by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Student's paired t-test, McNemar test, Mandasky test and Pearson correlation tests were used. RESULTS: Seventy-two subjects (58.3% girls) with a mean (standard deviation (SD)) age of 10.2 (3.4) years were included. Baseline diets were imbalanced in macronutrient composition. Significant improvements were observed in their compliance with dietary reference values (DRVs), where 50% of the subjects met fat requirements after the education and 67% and 49% with those of carbohydrates and fiber, respectively (p < 0.001). Celiac children decreased red meat and ultra-processed foods consumption (p < 0.001) and increased fruits and vegetables intake (p < 0.001), leading to a reduction in saturated fat (p < 0.001) and sugar intake (p < 0.001). Furthermore, 92% of the patients achieved a normal bowel habit, including absence of hard stools in 80% of children constipated at baseline (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: RD-led nutrition education is able to improve eating patterns in children with celiac disease (CD).
30934747	A Durum Wheat Variety-Based Product Is Effective in Reducing Symptoms in Patients with Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity: A Double-Blind Randomized Cross-Over Trial.	Patients with non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) do not have celiac disease, but their symptoms improve after a gluten-free diet (GFD). However, to date, it is uncertain if gluten or other components of wheat are responsible for these symptoms. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of an organic durum wheat variety with those of standard commercial wheat in patients with known NCGS. We performed a double-blind randomized cross-over trial of 42 patients (mean age 45 years, 8 men) with NCGS diagnosed according to the Salerno criteria and adherence to GFD for at least 12 weeks from screening. Enrolled subjects were randomly assigned to one the following groups of treatment: (A) a two-week diet with Senatore Cappelli wheat variety pasta; (B) a two-week diet with standard commercial pasta. Then, after a two-week washout period on gluten-free diet, each patient crossed over to the other treatment group. Symptoms were assessed through a modified version of the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS), tailored on NCGS. Between April 2018 and July 2018, 42 patients with NCGS were enrolled in the study (70.6% females), and 34 patients completed the study. Patients reported lower overall symptoms scores after eating Senatore Cappelli pasta than standard pasta (p = 0.03) and also significantly lower scores in several specific gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms after eating Senatore Cappelli pasta than standard pasta, specifically, bloating (p = 0.04), abdominal distention (p = 0.004), eructation (p = 0.01), flatus (p = 0.02), feeling of incomplete evacuation (p = 0.001), dermatitis (p = 0.01), and limb numbness (p = 0.03). In our study, patients with NCGS experienced lower gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal symptom scores after eating the Senatore Cappelli wheat variety than a standard commercial wheat. Should our preliminary results be confirmed by further studies, new dietary alternatives may be available to patients with NCGS, with consequent health, economic, and social benefits.
26988169	[Refractory encephalitis because of seronegative celiac disease: a case report].	INTRODUCTION: The celiac disease is an autoimmune bowel disease trigger by gliadine proteins, that can has systemic involvement with varied neurological manifestation since polineuropathy, ataxia, epilepsy, migraine to encephalitis. The aim of the current work is to report a case of possible refractory encephalitis due to celiac disease. CASE REPORT: A 45 years-old man with histopathologic diagnosis of celiac disease but negative celiac antibodies developed encephalic, brainstem and periphery nervous system manifestations: cognitive declaim and seizures, diplopia and ataxia, polyneuropathy and polyradiculopathy respectively; inflammatory cebrospinal fluid and cortico-subcortical and multiple brainstem lesions with mild contrast enhancement; the neurologic deficits progress in spite of gluten a free diet and immuno-suppressive treatment. During the illness process some pathologies with nervous system and intestinal involvement were discarded: sarcoidosis, systemic lupus; Sjogren syndrome, paraneoplastic syndromes, Whipple disease, AIDS and B12 vitamin deficit. CONCLUSION: The encephalitis is an infrequent clinical manifestation of the celiac disease despite the high prevalence of the celiac disease in the general population. It presents with numerous differential diagnosis, with requires high suspicious diagnosis.
21504457	Repigmentation of vitiligo lesions in a child with celiac disease after a gluten-free diet.	There is a well-established association of vitiligo with autoimmune conditions, and circulating autoantibodies to melanocytes have been demonstrated in the serum of patients with vitiligo. We present a case of repigmentation of vitiligo lesions in a girl with celiac disease after initiating a gluten-free diet, which to our knowledge has not been reported.
25925918	Celiac disease: prevention in children.	Several studies have suggested a protective role of breastfeeding and/or the timing and quantity of gluten introduction in the subsequent development of celiac disease. Especially, prolonged breastfeeding during the introduction of gluten-containing feeding has been associated with a reduced risk of developing celiac disease in infancy. The mentioned results suggest the existence of a 'window of opportunity' between 4 and 6 months of age in which gluten can be introduced in small amounts. Therefore, the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition recommends avoiding gluten introduction before the age of 4 months and after the age of 7 months and that gluten should be preferably introduced during ongoing breastfeeding. However, the influence of breastfeeding in the development of celiac disease is not clear, since some studies report prevention and others do not, and the studies reporting a protective effect of breastfeeding do not make clear if it concerns prevention of the disease or delays the onset of symptoms. In addition, most of the studies on this topic have been observational and retrospective. For these reasons, prospective studies are needed to understand the relationship between early nutrition in particular and environmental factors in general, concerning the development and possible prevention of celiac disease. Some of these studies are ongoing. One example is the European multicenter PreventCD project (www.preventcoeliacdisease.com) among infants with a first-degree family member with celiac disease carrying HLA-DQ2 and/or -DQ8, randomized to a double-blind dietary intervention with 100 mg of gluten daily or placebo between the age of 4-6 months. All included children are already 3 years old, and the first analyses are being prepared (http://www.trialregister.nl).
29228908	Self-reported dietary adherence, disease-specific symptoms, and quality of life are associated with healthcare provider follow-up in celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: The only treatment for celiac disease (CeD) is a lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD). The restrictive nature of the GFD makes adherence a challenge. As an integral part of CeD management, multiple professional organizations recommend regular follow-up with a healthcare provider (HCP). Many CeD patients also participate in patient advocacy groups (PAGs) for education and support. Previous work found that follow-up of CeD patients is highly variable. Here we investigated the self-reported factors associated with HCP follow-up among individuals diagnosed with CeD who participate in a PAG. METHODS: We conducted a survey of members of Beyond Celiac (a PAG), collecting responses from 1832 U.S. adults ages 19-65 who reported having CeD. The survey queried HCP follow-up related to CeD and included validated instruments for dietary adherence (CDAT), disease-specific symptoms (CSI), and quality of life (CD-QOL). RESULTS: Overall, 27% of respondents diagnosed with CeD at least five years ago reported that they had not visited an HCP about CeD in the last five years. The most frequent reason for not visiting an HCP was "doing fine on my own" (47.6%). Using multiple logistic regression, we identified significant associations between whether a respondent reported visiting an HCP about CeD in the last five years and the scores for all three validated instruments. In particular, as disease-specific symptoms and quality of life worsened, the probability of having visited an HCP increased. Conversely, as dietary adherence worsened, the probability decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that many individuals with CeD manage their disease without ongoing support from an HCP. Our results thus emphasize the need for greater access to high quality CeD care, and highlight an opportunity for PAGs to bring together patients and HCPs to improve management of CeD.

32220373	Can individuals with celiac disease identify gluten-free foods correctly?	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with celiac disease (CD) often report inadvertent gluten exposures and challenges reading labels. The most common cause of non-responsive CD is gluten exposure. We aimed to assess whether recently diagnosed CD patients can determine whether a food is gluten-free based on labeling, and to assess skills over time. A secondary aim was to identify factors associated with label reading proficiency. METHODS: Inception cohort with follow-up at 6, 12, and 24 months after diagnosis. Participants were asked to determine whether 25 food items were gluten-free based on labeling information. Diet adherence was assessed using the Celiac Diet Assessment Tool (CDAT) and the Gluten-Free Eating Assessment Tool (GF-EAT). 144 adults with newly diagnosed celiac disease were enrolled. The initial quiz at 6 months was completed by 83%. Quizzes were completed by 72% at 12 months and 70% at 24 months. RESULTS: Median overall accuracy scores were: 23/25, 24/25 and 21/25 at 6, 12 and 24 months respectively. Gluten-free products with explicit "gluten-free" claims had the fewest errors. Quiz scores were not correlated with tTG IgA levels, or CDAT or GF-EAT scores. Diet adherence was generally good (>85% with CDAT <13 suggesting adequate GFD adherence); however, at 24 months, only 11% reported no gluten exposure. CONCLUSIONS: CD patients may be unable to consistently choose gluten-free foods based on product labeling. Explicit identification of gluten-free products may be helpful. Label reading ability appears stable over time. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether erroneous label reading or misleading labels are associated with persistent villous atrophy.
28929921	Clinical implications of interictal epileptiform discharges in cognitive functioning in CEC syndrome with evolution into epileptic encephalopathy.	In epileptic encephalopathies (EE), interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) contribute to cognitive impairment. The EE process has been studied in a patient affected by epilepsy with occipital calcification and celiac disease (CEC syndrome) by combining the administration of brain area stimulus specific (visual and auditory) reaction times (RT) during continuous EEG monitoring with the off-line reconstruction of auditory and visual evoked potentials (EP). Visual RT and VEP were abnormal only if recorded concomitantly to the IEDs. Auditory RT and EP were normal. When the EE process is going on, IEDs transiently disrupt aspects of cortical functioning, contributing to the cognitive impairment.
25583468	Nonceliac gluten sensitivity.	During the past decade there has been an impressive increase in popularity of the gluten-free diet (GFD)-now the most trendy alimentary habit in the United States and other countries. According to recent surveys, as many as 100 million Americans will consume gluten-free products within a year. Operating under the concept that the GFD benefits only individuals with celiac disease, health care professionals have struggled to separate the wheat from the chaff; there are claims that eliminating gluten from the diet increases health and helps with weight loss, or even that gluten can be harmful to every human being. However, apart from unfounded trends, a disorder related to ingestion of gluten or gluten-containing cereals, namely nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), has resurfaced in the literature, fueling a debate on the appropriateness of the GFD for people without celiac disease. Although there is clearly a fad component to the popularity of the GFD, there is also undisputable and increasing evidence for NCGS. However, we require a better understanding of the clinical presentation of NCGS, as well as its pathogenesis, epidemiology, management, and role in conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue, and autoimmunity. Before we can begin to identify and manage NCGS, there must be agreement on the nomenclature and definition of the disorder based on proper peer-reviewed scientific information. We review the most recent findings on NCGS and outline directions to dissipate some of the confusion related to this disorder. 
27101536	Anemia and Iron Deficiency in Children With Potential Celiac Disease.	OBJECTIVES: Active screening for celiac disease frequently detects seropositive children with normal villous morphology (potential celiac disease). It remains unclear whether these subjects should be treated. We here investigated the prevalence of anemia and iron deficiency in children with potential and mucosal atrophy celiac disease. METHODS: The prospective study involved 19 children with potential disease, 67 with partial or subtotal villous atrophy (P/SVA), and 16 with total villous atrophy (TVA). Twenty-three healthy children comprised the control group. The groups were compared for various clinical, histological, and laboratory parameters and hepcidin. RESULTS: The prevalence of abnormal parameters was as follows (controls, potential celiac disease, P/SVA, and TVA, respectively): anemia 0%, 15%, 22%, and 63%; low iron 5%, 0%, 14%, and 50%; increased transferrin receptor 1 5%, 16%, 20%, and 47%; low ferritin 0%, 21%, 35%, and 87%; and low transferrin saturation 10%, 11%, 41%, and 71%. One subject had low folate and none had low vitamin B12. The median values for hemoglobin, total iron, ferritin, and transferrin saturation were significantly lower and transferrin receptor 1 values higher in TVA group compared with other groups. After a median of 7 months on a gluten-free diet hemoglobin, total iron, ferritin, and albumin in children with P/SVA exceeded the baseline values in the potential celiac disease group. CONCLUSIONS: The development of anemia and iron deficiency in celiac disease is a continuum and may already be present in children with normal villous morphology, advocating an early diagnosis and possible dietary treatment of these patients.
26150087	Prevalence of abnormal liver function tests in celiac disease and the effect of a gluten-free diet in the US population.	OBJECTIVES: Guidelines recommend routine screening of liver function tests (LFTs) in patients diagnosed with celiac disease (CD). However, little is known about the prevalence of liver disorders in CD outside of Europe. Our aims were to estimate the prevalence of LFT abnormalities in CD and to evaluate the effect of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on LFTs. METHODS: Adult patients with biopsy-proven CD were identified from a prospectively maintained database and matched with healthy controls. LFT levels for women and men were defined as abnormal based on the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) criteria. Data on demographics, coexisting liver diseases, and laboratory work-ups including aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) values at the time of diagnosis and on a GFD were recorded. Subsequently, data from this cohort were compared with data from 7,789 individuals participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2009-2010. Univariate logistic regression, Wilcoxon signed-ranks, Student's t-test, chi(2), and Fischer's exact test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: In 463 CD patients with ALT or AST levels at the time of CD diagnosis, 40.6% had elevated LFTs compared with 24.2% of treated CD patients (P<0.001) and 16.6% of matched controls (P<0.001). Similarly, 36.7% of CD patients on the NHANES database had abnormal ALT values compared with 19.3% of non-celiac patients (P=0.03). Approximately, 78.6% of CD patients with elevated LFTs at diagnosis normalized LFTs on a GFD after a mean duration of 1.5+-1.5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Forty percent of individuals will have elevated LFTs at CD diagnosis; however, the majority will normalize with standard CD therapy. LFTs should be checked in all patients with CD and coexisting liver disorder should be considered in patients whose LFTs have not improved within a year on a GFD.
32784763	Updated Food Composition Database for Cereal-Based Gluten Free Products in Spain: Is Reformulation Moving on?	We developed a comprehensive composition database of 629 cereal-based gluten free (GF) products available in Spain. Information on ingredients and nutritional composition was retrieved from food package labels. GF products were primarily composed of rice and/or corn flour, and 90% of them included added rice starch. The most common added fat was sunflower oil (present in one third of the products), followed by palm fat, olive oil, and cocoa. Only 24.5% of the products had the nutrition claim "no added sugar". Fifty-six percent of the GF products had sucrose in their formulation. Xanthan gum was the most frequently employed fiber, appearing in 34.2% of the GF products, followed by other commonly used such as hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (23.1%), guar gum (19.7%), and vegetable gums (19.6%). Macronutrient analysis revealed that 25.4% of the products could be labeled as a source of fiber. Many of the considered GF food products showed very high contents of energy (33.5%), fats (28.5%), saturated fatty acids (30.0%), sugars (21.6%), and salt (28.3%). There is a timid reformulation in fat composition and salt reduction, but a lesser usage of alternative flours and pseudocereals.
25313572	New approaches in hepatitis B vaccination for celiac disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is a gluten-induced immune-mediated disorder that has been associated with a defective response to the hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination. This unresponsiveness could lead to a world health problem, because non-responder patients could represent a reservoir of HBV-susceptible people that will persist as healthy carriers, leading to the diffusion of the disease. This article presents a literature review of both intramuscular (IM) and intradermal (ID) routes for boosters in celiac patients. We used PubMed database and generated the odds ratio (OR) of the response on the basis of electronic searches of clinical trials. Although our results confirm the positive response of celiac patients to IM vaccination, the ID route seems to be better than the conventional one, since it could provide a saving in cost and a greater immunogenicity.

35151110	Circulating microRNAs as novel non-invasive biomarkers of paediatric celiac disease and adherence to gluten-free diet.	BACKGROUND: Celiac Disease (CD) is a multifactorial autoimmune enteropathy (with a prevalence of approximately 1% worldwide) that exhibits a wide spectrum of clinical, serological and histological manifestations. For the diagnosis of paediatric CD, the gold standard is the combination of serological tests (with high TGA-IgA values greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal) and duodenal biopsy (with a positive TGA-IgA but low titer). Therefore, a diagnostic test that totally excludes an invasive approach has not been discovered so far and the discovery of novel biological markers would represent an undoubted advantage for the diagnosis of CD and prognostic evaluation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNAs (18-22 nucleotides) that regulate gene expression at post-transcriptional level and play important roles in many biological processes, represent a novel class of potential disease biomarkers. Their presence in biological fluids (i.e., serum, plasma, saliva, urine) provides the opportunity to employ circulating miRNAs as novel non-invasive biomarkers. METHODS: In our prospective observational study, we examined the expression of circulating miRNAs in a cohort of CD patients (both at diagnosis and on gluten-free diet, respectively referred as CD and GFD) compared to healthy controls. By small RNA-Seq we discovered a set of circulating miRNAs that were further validated by qPCR with specific assays. FINDINGS: We found that out of the 13 miRNAs able to discriminate the three groups (i.e., CD, GFD and controls), three of them, namely miR-192-5p, miR-215-5p and miR-125b-5p (alone or in combination), were able to discriminate these three groups with high accuracy and specificity. INTERPRETATION: Our conclusions emphasize that these circulating miRNAs can be employed not only for the diagnosis of CD patients with a low TGA-IgA titer but also to monitor the adherence to a gluten-free diet by CD patients. In conclusion, we suggest the use of the circulating miRNAs identified in this work as a novel diagnostic and follow-up tool for paediatric CD. FUNDING: This work was supported by Fondazione Celiachia Onlus (FC) Grant n  018/FC/2013 and by Italian Ministry of Health (Ricerca Corrente).
36662341	- No Title -	
21174642	[Celiac disease and "gluten sensitivity"].	It is known that celiac disease is characterized by a huge variety of clinical forms ranging from classical ones to silent forms, potential ones and to an increased number of cases of gluten-sensitivity. The latter is an abnormal non-allergic sensibility to gluten. Clinical manifestations can be very different without a severe intestinal damage (Marsh/Oberhuber 0-I) and this condition seems to benefit from a gluten free diet. Cases of gluten-sensitivity appear very interesting in the search of histological markers with elevated specificity, which are able to identify slight and early gluten dependent enteropathy, especially in at risk patients for celiac disease even before classical autoantibodies appear: for instance, this is the case of intraepithelial lymphocytes T-cell receptor gamma delta and mucosal deposits of class IgA anti transglutaminase antibodies. Other studies are investigating transglutaminase isoenzimes (different from tissue one), that can be identified in patients with gluten dependent symptoms without classical autoantibodies. Forms of gluten allergy have a different pathogenesis from celiac disease and are represented by "backer's asthma" or by classical allergy to wheat proteins. Clinical manifestations can vary from anaphylactic reactions to dermatological, respiratory and intestinal symptoms. Also in these cases the therapeutic approach is based on gluten free diet.
31408119	Gluten and Celiac Disease Risk: Is It Just a Matter of Quantity?	
24412009	[Intracardiac thrombosis during celiac disease].	Thrombotic events occurring in the course of celiac disease are frequently reported in the literature. The localization is often unusual, mainly affecting the hepatic veins. To our knowledge, this is the first report of intracardiac thrombosis occurring in a patient with celiac disease. A 32-year-old patient with celiac disease adhered poorly to his gluten-free diet. He suffered an ischemic stroke revealing an intracardiac thrombus, which, on radiological imaging, simulated a multiple myxoma. Histological examination of the resected tumor enabled the correct diagnosis. Biological findings revealed severe protein C and S deficiency. The patient improved with anticoagulant therapy and gluten-free diet.

32791131	Alterations in Intestinal Microbiota of Children With Celiac Disease at the Time of Diagnosis and on a Gluten-free Diet.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: It is not clear whether alterations in the intestinal microbiota of children with celiac disease (CD) cause the disease or are a result of disease and/or its treatment with a gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: We obtained 167 fecal samples from 141 children (20 with new-onset CD, 45 treated with a GFD, 57 healthy children, and 19 unaffected siblings of children with CD) in Glasgow, Scotland. Samples were analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing, and diet-related metabolites were measured by gas chromatography. We obtained fecal samples from 13 children with new-onset CD after 6 and 12 months on a GFD. Relationships between microbiota with diet composition, gastrointestinal function, and biomarkers of GFD compliance were explored. RESULTS: Microbiota alpha diversity did not differ among groups. Microbial dysbiosis was not observed in children with new-onset CD. In contrast, 2.8% (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index, P = .025) and 2.5% (UniFrac distances, P = .027) of the variation in microbiota composition could be explained by the GFD. Between 3% and 5% of all taxa differed among all group comparisons. Eleven distinctive operational taxonomic units composed a microbe signature specific to CD with high diagnostic probability. Most operational taxonomic units that differed between patients on a GFD with new-onset CD vs healthy children were associated with nutrient and food group intake (from 75% to 94%) and with biomarkers of gluten ingestion. Fecal levels of butyrate and ammonia decreased during the GFD. CONCLUSIONS: Although several alterations in the intestinal microbiota of children with established CD appear to be effects of a GFD, specific bacteria were found to be distinct biomarkers of CD. Studies are needed to determine whether these bacteria contribute to pathogenesis of CD.
30785904	Involvement of gliadin, a component of wheat gluten, in increased intestinal permeability leading to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced small-intestinal damage.	Gliadin, a component of wheat gluten known to be an important factor in the etiology of celiac disease, is related to several other diseases through its enhancing effect on intestinal paracellular permeability. We investigated the significance of gliadin in non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced small-intestinal damage in mice. 7-week-old C57BL/6 male mice were divided into the following groups: standard diet group, in which mice were fed with wheat-containing standard rodent diet (CE-2); gluten-free diet group, in which mice were fed with gluten-free diet (AIN-76A); and gliadin-administered group, in which mice fed with gluten-free diet were administered with gliadin (~250 mg/kg BW). Each group was subdivided into negative, healthy control group and NSAID-treated group. To some mice fed with gluten-free diet and administered with gliadin, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor was administered for clarification of the significance of EGFR in NSAID-induced small intestinal damage and intestinal permeability. In mice fed with a gluten-free diet, indomethacin or diclofenac induced very mild mucosal damage in the small intestine compared with that in mice fed with a wheat-containing standard diet. Gliadin exacerbated the NSAID-induced small-intestinal damage in mice fed with a gluten-free diet. With the administration of indomethacin, MPO activity, a marker of neutrophil infiltration into the mucosa and mRNA expression level of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1beta in the small intestine were higher in the gliadin-administered mice. Gliadin increased the intestinal paracellular permeability without indomethacin administration (4.3-fold) and further increased the permeability after indomethacin administration (2.1-fold). Gliadin induced phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in small-intestinal tissues, and erlotinib (an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor) attenuated the indomethacin-induced intestinal damage and permeability exacerbated by gliadin, accompanied by inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation. These results suggest that gliadin plays an important role in the induction and exacerbation of NSAID-induced small-intestinal damage, and that increase in intestinal permeability via the EGFR signalling pathway is involved in its mechanism.
33213379	How to manage celiac disease and gluten-free diet during the COVID-19 era: proposals from a tertiary referral center in a high-incidence scenario.	The outbreak of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 infection is spreading worldwide as the first coronavirus pandemic. The clinical picture is variable but flu-like symptoms are common with bilateral interstitial pneumonia being the most frightening presentation. No specific therapies nor vaccine have been developed to date and the only way to limit the virus diffusion is by modifying one's lifestyle limiting social life and following strict hygienic precautions. No data is available on the risk of COVID-19 and its outcomes in celiac disease (CeD). The restrictions applied to counter COVID-19 can impact on CeD treatment and gluten-free dieting, the only available therapy for CeD. With the present manuscript, we aim to support gastroenterologists and nutritionists in the management of CeD patients in the new pandemic scenario, being conscious that availability and local situations are extremely various.
22309461	Comparison of oxidized and reduced glutathione in the bread-making qualities of rice batter.	The demand for gluten-free bread is growing as the recognition of celiac disease and wheat allergy has increased worldwide. In our previous study, reduced glutathione (GSH) was found to improve the gas-retaining properties of rice batter used for gluten-free bread. In this article, oxidized glutathione (GSSG) was shown to have the same effect. Moreover, sensory tests revealed that GSSG bread had a significantly reduced sulfurous odor. Analyses by a gas chromatography-flame photometric detector demonstrated the presence of hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan in the headspace of GSH bread, and also their significant reduction in GSSG bread. The viscoelastic properties and microstructures of GSSG and GSH bread did not noticeably differ. These observations suggest the usefulness of GSSG in making gluten-free rice bread and extend our knowledge of the use of glutathione in food processing. Practical Application: Glutathione, a widely-distributed peptide in cells, improves the bread-making quality of gluten-free rice batter. While both the reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione are effective, GSSG-bread has significantly reduced sulfurous odor compared to GSH-bread.

23165576	[Quality of life and diagnosis process in adult celiacs from the Valencian Community].	INTRODUCTION: In adult patients, the diagnostic process for celiac disease (CD) is often very late and generates health complications that would be avoided by earlier diagnosis. The diseases of wich these patients were diagnosed before setting the diagnosis of CD were many and diverse. In addition, following a gluten-free diet (GFD) leads to a reduction in the quality of life for patients, who find it difficult to travel, to find accredited restaurants with menus without gluten, to interpretate food labels or to go to friends' houses. OBJECTIVE: To determine the delay in diagnosis, the satisfaction of the information provided by different sources and circumstances related to the quality of life. METHOD: A retrospective cross-sectional observational study in 98 adult celiac through a validated questionnaire for celiac patientes. RESULTS: The average delay in diagnosis was 11 years and the average of doctors consulted prior to confirmation of the CD was 6. Osteoporosis or osteopenia were nearly twice as common among those who took more than five years to be diagnosed. Some 90% say they transgress the dietary pattern, however, 58% show clinical symptoms due to unnoticed consumption of gluten. The impact of GFD on the quality of life is very high. CONCLUSIONS: Long delays in diagnosis suggest the need for greater awareness among physicians about the EC and the use of serological tests in potential patients or risk groups.
30821220	Thymic stromal lymphopoietin levels are increased in patients with celiac disease.	Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a cytokine produced by epithelial cells in the lungs, skin, and intestinal mucosa and is involved in several physiological and pathological processes. In this study, we evaluated serum TSLP levels in patients with celiac disease (CD). The prospective study was conducted at a gastroenterology outpatient clinic between March 2018 and August 2018. Eighty-nine participants aged between 18 and 75 years were classified into following groups: 22 patients with newly diagnosed CD; 20 patients with CD who were compliant with a gluten-free diet (GFD); 32 patients with CD who were not compliant with a GFD; and 15 healthy controls. Demographic characteristics, disease duration, and selected biochemical and hematologic parameters were recorded and compared between groups. Median serum TSLP levels were 1193.65 pg/mL (range: 480.1-1547.1) in newly diagnosed CD patients, 110.25 pg/mL (range: 60.3-216.7) in CD patients who were compliant with a GFD, 113.1 pg/mL (range: 76.3-303.4) in CD patients who were not compliant with a GFD, and 57 pg/mL (range: 49-67.8) in healthy controls. Overall, there was a significant difference in serum TSLP levels between groups (p = 0.001). Patients with newly diagnosed CD had the highest serum TSLP levels. There was no significant difference in serum TSLP levels between patients with CD who were and were not compliant with a GFD. TSLP appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of CD. Further studies are required to determine if the TSLP signaling pathway can be used in the treatment of CD.
24521630	Effect of zoledronic acid on bone mineral density in patients of celiac disease: a prospective, randomized, pilot study.	BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: The symptoms of celiac disease (CD) are varied and metabolic bone disease (MBD) is less recognized amongst all manifestations in CD patients. Bone disease in CD is attributed to secondary hyperparathyroidism, which in turn is associated with increased bone remodelling. Improvement in bone mineral density (BMD) with gluten free diet (GFD) is known, but the data on efficacy of bisphosphonates in CD patients are limited. Bisphosphonates being a potent inhibitor of bone resorption may be useful in patients with CD having low BMD. The aim of the present investigation was to study the effect of zoledronic acid on BMD in CD patients. METHODS: A total of 28 CD patients were randomized to receive GFD, calcium and cholecalciferol (group A), and zoledronic acid (group B). Baseline biochemical tests and T-score by dual energy x-ray absorptiometer were done and repeated after 12 months. RESULTS: The T-score showed improvement in the control arm (group A) from -3.31 +- 1.46 to -2.12 +- 1.44, a gain of 35.9 per cent (P<0.05) and in drug arm (group B) -2.82 +- 1.27 to -1.06 +- 1.84, registering a gain of 62.4 per cent (P<0.001). However, there was no difference in improvement of T-score in zoledronic acid group as compared to the control group. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Administration of zoledronic acid was not found to be better than GFD alone in increasing BMD in CD patients with low BMD in this pilot study.
22277809	Bone mass in women with celiac disease: role of exercise and gluten-free diet.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: Celiac patients report fatigue and reduced social activities, which may decrease physical activity. This study investigated the physical activity, fatigue and bone mineral density in celiac women at diagnosis and during diet. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The first group (n=48) had the bone mineral density measured at diagnosis and after 2 years of a gluten-free diet; in the second group (n=47) bone mineral density was measured at diagnosis and after 5 years of a gluten-free diet. Both groups completed a physical activity questionnaire and visual analogue scale for the perception of fatigue at diagnosis and follow-up. Data about smoking habits, alcohol use, presence of gastrointestinal symptoms, drug therapy and body mass index were also collected. RESULTS: At diagnosis, the two groups were similar for all considered variables. At follow-up, the mean body mass index and physical activity questionnaire's score were similar to baseline. The bone density increased in both groups, whilst the physical activity questionnaire and visual analogue scale remained unchanged. CONCLUSION: The improvement in bone density following a gluten-free diet was significant after 2 years; physical activity is frequently low and plays a minor role in determining the changes in bone mineral density.
34561158	Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin profile in patients with celiac disease living in a high incidence area.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: How symptoms and antibodies related to SARS-CoV-2 infection develop in patients with celiac disease (CD) is unclear. We aimed to investigate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in CD patients. METHODS: CD patients were interviewed about the development of COVID-19 symptoms, compliance with anti-virus measures and adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). The presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA (anti-RBD and N proteins) was compared to that in non-CD subjects. Expression of the duodenal ACE2 receptor was investigated. When available, data on duodenal histology, anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA (tTGA), comorbidities and GFD adherence were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 362 CD patients, 42 (12%) reported COVID-19 symptoms and 21% of these symptomatic patients presented anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ig. Overall, 18% of CD patients showed anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ig versus 25% of controls (p = 0.18). CD patients had significantly lower levels of anti-N IgA. tTGA, duodenal atrophy, GFD adherence or other comorbidities did not influence symptoms and/or antibodies. The ACE2 receptor was detected in the non-atrophic duodenal mucosa of patients; atrophy was associated with lower expression of the ACE2 receptor. CONCLUSION: CD patients have an anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ig profile similar to non-celiac controls, except for anti-N IgA. No risk factors were identified among CD parameters and GFD adherence.
32290294	Possible Role of Vitamin D in Celiac Disease Onset.	Beside skeletal system maintenance and protection, possible extra-calcium roles of vitamin D have been recently described. In particular, studies have investigated possible roles of vitamin D as a key modulator of inflammation and immune mechanisms and of the intestinal mucosa barrier. In this regard, vitamin D has been considered as a factor that affects different conditions such as immune-mediated diseases. The new emerging role of vitamin D and its involvement in immune modulation has led it to be considered as a possible key factor involved in celiac disease (CD) onset. CD is a chronic immune-mediated enteropathy of the small intestine that is triggered by dietary gluten protein exposure in individuals who are genetically predisposed. However, along with gluten, other environmental factors are also involved in CD onset. The renewed interest in a molecule that offers great possibilities for new roles has led to an increase in studies, although there remains a lack of studies aimed at contextualizing the role of vitamin D on CD. This review aims to define the possible role of vitamin D in CD onset as it is presently understood, taking into account potential links among vitamin D, the immune system and CD.
26084006	Socioeconomic Risk Factors for Celiac Disease Burden and Symptoms.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease (CD) affects approximately 1% of the population and negatively affects aspects of life including physical and social function. The relationship between socioeconomic (SE) factors, symptom severity, and perceived burden of living with CD is not well understood. The objective of this study was to assess the relationships between income, symptoms, and perceived burden of CD. METHODS: In this survey study conducted at a tertiary care center, 773 patients 18 years of age or more with biopsy confirmed CD were eligible to participate. Patients completed a survey with information on SE data, the validated Celiac Symptom Index (CSI), and visual analog scales (VAS) assessing overall health, CD-related health, difficulty in following a gluten-free diet (GFD), and importance of following a GFD. RESULTS: Three hundred forty one patients completed the survey. Higher income predicted better overall health, better CD related health, and fewer symptoms. In the logistic regression model, low income was associated with greater CD symptoms (odds ratio=6.04, P=0.002). Other factors associated with greater symptoms were younger age, poor overall health state, and more physician visits. Factors associated with increased burden of CD included hospitalizations, more symptoms, poor overall health state, and burden of following a GFD. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with lower incomes have worse CD-related health and greater symptoms. Those with low income had 6 times the odds of greater symptoms compared with those with high income. Our data suggest that income is associated with perceived overall health, CD-related health, and CD symptoms.
38552723	Gluten-free diet induces rapid changes in phenotype and survival properties of gluten-specific T cells in celiac disease.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The treatment of celiac disease (CeD) with gluten-free diet (GFD) normalizes gut inflammation and disease-specific antibodies. CeD patients have HLA-restricted, gluten-specific T cells persisting in the blood and gut even after decades of GFD, which are re-activated and disease driving upon gluten exposure. Our aim was to examine the transition of activated gluten-specific T cells into a pool of persisting memory T cells concurrent with normalization of clinically relevant biomarkers during the first year of treatment. METHODS: We followed 17 CeD patients during their initial GFD year, leading to disease remission. We assessed activation and frequency of gluten-specific CD4+ blood and gut T cells with HLA-DQ2.5:gluten tetramers and flow cytometry, disease-specific serology, histology and symptom scores. We assessed gluten-specific blood T cells within the first three weeks of GFD in six patients and serology in additional nine patients. RESULTS: Gluten-specific CD4+ T cells peaked in blood at day 14 while upregulating Bcl-2 and downregulating Ki-67, then decreased in frequency within 10 weeks of GFD. CD38, ICOS, HLA-DR and Ki-67 decreased in gluten-specific cells within three days. PD-1, CD39 and OX40 expression persisted even after 12 months. IgA-TG2 decreased significantly within four weeks. CONCLUSION: GFD induces rapid changes in phenotype and number of gluten-specific CD4+ blood T cells, including a peak of non-proliferating, non-apoptotic cells at day 14. Subsequent alterations in T-cell phenotype associate with the quiescent but chronic nature of treated CeD. The rapid changes affecting gluten-specific T cells and disease-specific antibodies offer opportunities for clinical trials aiming at developing non-dietary treatments for newly diagnosed CeD patients.
38768856	A bispecific antibody targeting HLA-DQ2.5-gluten peptides potently blocks gluten-specific t cells induced by gluten ingestion in patients with celiac disease.	The gluten-free diet for coeliac disease (CeD) is restrictive and often fails to induce complete symptom and/or mucosal disease remission. Central to CeD pathogenesis is the gluten-specific CD4+ T cell that is restricted by HLA-DQ2.5 in over 85% of CeD patients, making HLA-DQ2.5 an attractive target for suppressing gluten-dependent immunity. Recently, a novel anti-HLA-DQ2.5 antibody that specifically recognizes the complexes of HLA-DQ2.5 and multiple gluten epitopes was developed (DONQ52). OBJECTIVE: To assess the ability of DONQ52 to inhibit CeD patient-derived T-cell responses to the most immunogenic gluten peptides encompassing immunodominant T cell epitopes. METHODS: We employed an in vivo gluten challenge model in patients with CeD that affords a quantitative readout of disease-relevant gluten-specific T-cell responses. HLA-DQ2.5+ CeD patients consumed food containing wheat, barley, or rye for 3 days with collection of blood before (D1) and 6 days after (D6) commencing the challenge. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and assessed in an interferon (IFN)-gamma enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay (ELISpot) testing responses to gluten peptides encompassing a series of immunodominant T cell epitopes. The inhibitory effect of DONQ52 (4 or 40 mug/mL) was assessed and compared to pan-HLA-DQ blockade (SPVL3 antibody). RESULTS: In HLA-DQ2.5+ CeD patients, DONQ52 reduced T cell responses to all wheat gluten peptides to an equivalent or more effective degree than pan-HLA-DQ antibody blockade. It reduced T cell responses to a cocktail of the most immunodominant wheat epitopes by a median of 87.3% (IQR 72.4-92.4). Notably, DONQ52 also substantially reduced T-cell responses to dominant barley hordein and rye secalin derived peptides. DONQ52 had no effect on T-cell responses to non-gluten antigens. CONCLUSION: DONQ52 can significantly block HLA-DQ2.5-restricted T cell responses to the most highly immunogenic gluten peptides in CeD. Our findings support in vitro data that DONQ52 displays selectivity and broad cross-reactivity against multiple gluten peptide:HLA-DQ2.5 complexes. This work provides proof-of-concept multi-specific antibody blockade has the potential to meaningfully inhibit pathogenic gluten-specific T-cell responses in CeD and supports ongoing therapeutic development.
21764291	Magneto immunosensor for gliadin detection in gluten-free foodstuff: towards food safety for celiac patients.	Gliadin is a constituent of the cereal protein gluten, responsible for the intolerance generated in celiac disease. Its detection is of high interest for food safety of celiac patients, since the only treatment known until now is a lifelong avoidance of this protein in the diet. Therefore, it is essential to have an easy and reliable method of analysis to control the contents in gluten-free foods. An electrochemical magneto immunosensor for the quantification of gliadin or small gliadin fragments in natural or pretreated food samples is described for the first time and compared to a novel magneto-ELISA system based on optical detection. The immunological reaction was performed on magnetic beads as solid support by the oriented covalent immobilization, of the protein gliadin on tosyl-activated beads. Direct, as well as indirect competitive immunoassays were optimized, achieving the best analytical performance with the direct competitive format. Excellent detection limits (in the order of mug L(-1)) were achieved, according to the legislation for gluten-free products. The matrix effect, as well as the performance of the assays was successfully evaluated using spiked gluten-free foodstuffs (skimmed milk and beer), obtaining excellent recovery values in the results.
31986568	[Non-celiac Gluten Sensitivity].	Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a term that is used to describe individuals who are not affected by celiac disease or wheat allergy, yet they have intestinal and/or extra-intestinal symptoms related to gluten ingestion with improvement of their symptoms upon withdrawing gluten from their diet. Gluten-related disorder groups are manifested by symptoms of gastrointestinal tract disorders, as well as hematological dermatological endocrinological, gynecological, rheumatological and nervous system symptoms. It is believed that NCGS represents heterogeneous groups with different subgroups characterized by different etiologies, clinical histories and clinical courses. There also appears to be an overlap between NCGS and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). There is a need for establishing strict criteria for diagnosing NCGS. The absence of validated biomarkers remains a significant limitation for research studies on NCGS. New evidence shows that a gluten-free diet may be beneficial for some patients with gastrointestinal symptoms, such as those symptoms commonly found in patients with IBS. Further studies about NCGS are needed.
22740094	A pathogenetic link between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and celiac disease.	Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has recently been recognized as the leading cause of the abnormalities in the liver function tests in the Western countries. Celiac disease (CD) is a permanent immunological intolerance to gluten proteins in genetically predisposed individuals. CD has been reported in 4-13 % of the cases with steatohepatitis, although the pathogenesis of the liver steatosis in CD patients is unclear. Based on the literature data, it can be concluded that the inclusion of serological markers of CD should be a part of the general workup in the patients with steatosis when other causes of the liver disease are excluded and in the patients with NAFLD when metabolic risk factors are not evident.
34962314	Evaluation of the Relationship Between Carotid Intima Media Thickness and Dietary Compliance in Pediatric Celiac Patients: A Single-Center Pilot Study.	OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to show the relationship between gluten-free diet (GFD) compliance in Celiac Disease (CD) and early atherosclerotic findings in pediatric patients and to test the effectiveness of carotid-intima-media-thickness (cIMT) to possibly predict long-term compliance to the GFD. METHODS: Patients from 6 to 18 years of age with a diagnosis of CD confirmed by endoscopic duodenal biopsy who were followed at our hospital's pediatric gastroenterology outpatient clinic between November 2020 and May 2021 were evaluated in this single-center, prospective study. The study patients were divided into two groups according to GFD compliance. Serologic and biochemical tests were conducted routinely during the follow-up period. cIMT was measured using ultrasound for both groups. RESULTS: A total of 80 patients (GFD-non-compliant: n = 35, GFD-compliant: n = 45) were evaluated. No significant differences were observed between the groups in terms of demographic data and pathology results. The mean cIMT value was 0.44 +- 0.028 mm for the GFD-compliant group and 0.54 +- 0.036 mm for the GFD-non-compliant group, with a statistically significant between-group difference (P < .001). The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed an area under the curve of 0.992 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.978-1, P < .001) for discrimination of the groups. In addition, a cutoff value of 0.486 mm for cIMT showed 96% (95% CI: 0.83-0.99) sensitivity and 94% (95% CI: 0.79-0.99) specificity for distinguishing GFD-compliant patients from non-GFD-compliant patients. CONCLUSION: In this study, the relationship between long-term GFD compliance and cIMT was demonstrated in CD. Currently used by some authors for the assessment of preclinical atherosclerosis, cIMT can also be used as a long-term indicator of dietary compliance as well as cardiovascular risk.
32260408	Prevalence of Adverse Reactions to Gluten and People Going on a Gluten-Free Diet: A Survey Study Conducted in Brazil.	BACKGROUND: The prevalence of gluten-related disorders (GRD) and adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) remains unknown in Brazilian population and there is no published information on the scientific literature about the proportion of Brazilians that were diagnosed with a gluten-related disorder. Thus, the aim of this work was to estimate the prevalence of GRDs and adherence to a GFD by self-report in adult Brazilian population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was conducted in two Brazilian cities. RESULTS: The response rate was 93.2% (1630/1749). The self-reported prevalence rates were (95% CI): adverse reactions to gluten 10.06% (8.64-11.62); gluten sensitivity 2.33% (1.65-3.18); physician-diagnosed celiac disease 0.3% (0.09-0.71); non-celiac gluten sensitivity 1.71% (1.14-2.47); wheat allergy 0.79% (0.42-1.36); adherence to gluten-free diet 7.48% (6.25-8.87); gluten avoiders 15.21% (13.5-17.05). Among those who were following a GFD (n = 122), 65.6% (n = 80) of them reported that they did not develop symptoms after wheat/gluten ingestion and 50% (n = 61) were following the diet without medical/dietitian advice. The main motivation for following a GFD in the self-reported and non-self-reported gluten sensitivity groups were the symptoms triggered after wheat/gluten ingestion (86.8%) and weight control (57.1%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of programs to increase awareness about GRDs among healthcare professionals and giving scientifically sound information to the general population about the risks and benefits for following a GFD are desirable actions in Brazil. The results also add to the growing body of evidence for highlighting the under-diagnosis of GRD and the trend for following a GFD in Latin America.
29113007	[Gluten-free diet - Update 2017].	Since sixty years, the gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only therapeutic option for patients with celiac disease or dermatitis herpetitormis to normalize symptoms and prevent complications. In recent years, the use of a gluten-free diet is rapidly growing because of presumed effects on well-being and control of body weight. GFD is becoming a popular health choice for everybody.In the present review, evidence-based indications for a gluten-free diet are stressed, the need for profound dietary counselling and education of the patient is underlined, problems and pitfalls of the implementation of a gluten-free diet in daily practice and possible side effects of long-term gluten-free diets are mentioned. New methods to control adherence to a gluten-free diet and aspects of nutritional quality of commercial gluten-free products are discussed in detail.
25345277	[Late diagnosed celiac disease in a mother and thre doughters].	A family of seven members with lately diagnosed celiac disease in mother and three doughters was described in the present work. In mother, atypical celiac disease was diagnosed at the age of 39 yers. In two twin dughters potential celiac disease was diagnosed at the age of 4,5 years and in 18-years old daughter- atypical celiac disease. In father and two sons celiac disease was excluded. In genetic studies, in mother and three daughters the presence of HLA DQ2 or DQ8 was confirmed. In father and one son HLA DQ8 was present and in the remaining son HLA DQ2/DQ8 haplotyp was absent. In all family members with diagnosed celiac disease free-gluten diet was introduced.
25952690	Evaluation of the impact of celiac disease and its dietary manipulation on children and their caregivers.	BACKGROUND: Lifelong dietary abstinence of gluten is the only treatment available for celiac disease. This is not only challenging but also leads to several psychosocial morbidities and affects the quality of life of children and their parents. METHODS: An observational study was conducted on 50 children (5-18 years) diagnosed with celiac disease on gluten-free diet for at least 6 months and their parents to evaluate of the impact of celiac disease and its dietary manipulation on them. The quality of life was assessed by applying celiac disease-specific questionnaire. Dietary compliant and noncompliant groups were compared to assess the factors leading to poor compliance. Anthropometric parameters were utilized to ascertain clinical response. RESULTS: Fifty children with a mean age of 9.06 years were enrolled. Seventy-four percent of the children were compliant. In the compliant group, height and weight correlated with dietary compliance (p = 0.0087 and p = 0.023). Dietary compliance was found to be better in adolescent males and single child and those living in nuclear families. Quality of life was found to be higher among parents of noncompliant children (quality of life score: 63) as compared to the compliant children (quality of life score: 59). The acceptance of celiac disease was better among children whose parents had a higher level of education. The scale diet proved to be a useful indicator for evaluating compliance among children (p = 0.0036). CONCLUSIONS: Noncompliance to gluten-free diet was noted in 24 % of children with celiac disease.
29565145	Blood iron levels in accordance with adherence to a gluten-free diet in celiac school aged children.	INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease (CD) causes intestinal damage, inability to absorb nutrients, and progressive malnutrition. Iron deficiency is one of the predominant nutritional problems. A strict gluten-free diet (GF) allows for an optimal quality of life. OBJECTIVE: To assess the nutritional situation of iron in school-aged celiac children by determining biochemical parameters, their relation to the consumption of the mineral and adherence to gluten-free diets in San Luis. METHODS: Observational, analytical and cross-sectional study. We included 44 children with CD, from 6-10 years of age, with diagnosis of celiac disease and registered in public and private entities of San Luis (Argentina) during 2011-2012. A qualitative-quantitative survey was used to determine dietary habits and sociodemographic characteristics. Iron levels and adherence to a GF diet were evaluated. Generalized linear regression models were constructed to verify the association of ferritin with iron consumption and adherence to diet. RESULTS: Most families had low socioeconomic status and were large families. Current feeding did not prevent iron deficiency anemia. Most children had normal immune system, and normal antiendomysial and antitransglutaminase antibodies; 7% of the children showed low levels of iron. Under adequate iron consumption conditions, ferritin was associated to predictor antibodies and the presence of both parents in the home. CONCLUSION: Under adequate conditions of iron consumption, the levels of iron in blood were related to adherence to gluten-free diets.
32213063	Putting celiac disease in perspective: Pathogenesis, comorbidity and transition of care.	
32083828	[Modern approaches to the development of gluten-free bakery formulations].	According to WHO, currently about 1% of the world's population suffers from celiac disease, a disease associated with a deficiency of enzymes that break down gluten and proteins close to it. In celiac disease, there is a malabsorption of disaccharides, fats, vitamins and amino acids, which imposes restrictions on food formulations that can be used in the diet of people with celiac disease. Analysis of the market of gluten-free bakery products showed a lack in this segment of products, including the complete absence of products with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), the total deficit of which is noted in the diet of Russians and around the world. The aim of the study was to develop recipes for gluten-free bakery products enriched with omega-3 PUFAs, dietary fibers and protein. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The quality of the resulting bread was evaluated by conventional methods including the determination of the content of protein, dietary fiber, fat and its fatty acid composition. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: To achieve this goal, we used approaches that combined both traditional and non-traditional food raw materials, namely gluten-free flour of chia seeds (a source of PUFA and dietary fiber), lupin flour (a source of protein), as well as enzyme transesterificated milk fat substitute containing omega-3 PUFAs. A protein-polysaccharide mixture was used as a thickener and structure-forming agent. The developed formulations allowed to obtain finished products characterized by the content of omega-3 fatty acids - 0.4-0.6 g/100 g, while maintaining a balance between essential omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids at the level (2.5-3.5):1, recommended for therapeutic nutrition, dietary fiber - 11.1-12.4 g/100 g, and protein content - 5.2-6.7 g/100 g, while maintaining good organoleptic properties. The achieved level of enrichment in accordance with the current legislation allows labeling the resulting products as <<high in omega-3 fatty acids and dietary fibers>>. According to the available data on the biological effect of the components of the developed product, it can affect lipid metabolism, contributing to the reduction of atherogenic lipids in the blood. CONCLUSION: The implementation of the results of this work in the industry will expand the range of gluten-free products through the production of specialized bakery products with the strengthening of their dietary therapeutic and preventive orientation due to the high content of omega-3 fatty PUFAs and dietary fibers.
36768398	Celiac Disease Genetics, Pathogenesis, and Standard Therapy for Japanese Patients.	Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease primarily affecting the small intestine that is caused by the ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. The development of celiac disease is based on a complex immune response to gluten proteins. The global average prevalence in the general population is about 1%. In recent years, it has become clear that celiac disease is not less common in Asian countries than in Western countries but often remains undiagnosed. Although the number of patients with celiac disease in Asia is expected to increase with improving disease recognition and advances in diagnostic techniques, there remain few reports of celiac disease in the Far East region of Asia, especially in Japan. In this paper, we outline the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of celiac disease. In addition, we summarize the reported Japanese cases of celiac disease with an overview in Japan.
23706063	Search for atoxic cereals: a single blind, cross-over study on the safety of a single dose of Triticum monococcum, in patients with celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: Cereals of baking quality with absent or reduced toxicity are actively sought as alternative therapy to a gluten-free diet (GFD) for patients with coeliac disease (CD). Triticum monococcum, an ancient wheat, is a potential candidate having no toxicity in in-vitro and ex-vivo studies. The aim of our study was to investigate on the safety of administration of a single dose of gluten of Tm in patients with CD on GFD. METHODS: We performed a single blind, cross-over study involving 12 CD patients who had been on a GFD for at least 12 months, challenged on day 0, 14 and 28 with a single fixed dose of 2.5 grams of the following (random order): Tm, rice (as reference atoxic protein) and Amygluten (as reference toxic protein) dispersed in a gluten-free pudding. The primary end-point of the study was the change in intestinal permeability, as assessed by changes in the urinary lactulose/rhamnose ratio (L/R ratio) measured by High Pressure Liquid Chromatography. We also assessed the occurrence of adverse gastrointestinal events, graded for intensity and duration according to the WHO scale. Variables were expressed as mean +- SD; paired t-test and chi2 test were used as appropriate. RESULTS: The urinary L/R ratio did not change significantly upon challenge with the 3 cereals, and was 0.055 +- 0.026 for Tm Vs 0.058 +- 0.035 for rice (p = 0.6736) and Vs 0.063 +- 0.054 with Amygluten (p = 0.6071). Adverse gastrointestinal events were 8 for Tm, Vs 11 for rice (p = 0.6321) and Vs 31 for Amygluten p = 0.0016), and, in all cases events were graded as "mild" or "moderate" with TM and rice, and as "severe" or "disabling" in 4 cases during Amygluten. CONCLUSIONS: No definite conclusion can be drawn on the safety of Tm, based on no change in urinary L/R because even Amygluten, a toxic wheat protein, did not cause a significant change in urinary L/R indicating low sensitivity of this methodology in studies on acute toxicity. Tm was, however, well tolerated by all patients providing the rationale for further investigation on the safety of this cereal for CD patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: EudraCT-AIFA n2008-000697-20.
29634666	Concurrent extrahepatic autoimmune disorders: unexplored dimension of autoimmune liver disease in children.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: No comprehensive and prospective data are available for concurrent extrahepatic autoimmune disorders (CEAIDs) in children with autoimmune liver disease (AILD). The aim of this study was to evaluate CEAIDs in AILD and their effect on AILD outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Enrolled AILD and CEAIDs children were diagnosed on the basis of simplified and standard diagnostic criteria, respectively. The clinicopathological profile, treatment response, and outcome were compared between AILD with CEAIDs (group A) and AILD without CEAIDs (group B). RESULTS: In 62 AILD children, CEAIDs were found in 42% (n=26) [vitiligo (42%), celiac disease (CD) (15%), potential CD (15%), autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) (15%)]. CEAIDs were asymptomatic in 75%. Single CEAID was found in 81% (21/26) and multiple CEAID was found in 19% (5/26). Significantly less biochemical remission (46.1 vs. 74.2%, P=0.03), more treatment failure (23 vs. 3.2%, P=0.04), and higher mortality (15.3 vs. 3.2%, P=0.04) were encountered in group A compared with group B. On multivariate analysis (n=57), less biochemical remission in vitiligo (P=0.04); more treatment failure in AIHA (P=0.004) and vitiligo (P=0.04); and high mortality in AIHA (P=0.02) subgroups were reported. CD treatment has good impact on AILD outcome. All cases of diabetes mellitus in AILD were steroid-induced rather than because of autoimmunity (absence of antibody against tyrosine phosphatase and glutamic acid decarboxylase and elevated C-peptide). CONCLUSION: All AILD children should be screened for CEAIDs as the majority are asymptomatic. The AILD outcome was favorable in CD, but poor in vitiligo and AIHA. We suggest the incorporation of CEAIDs in a pediatric AILD scoring system.
23506211	Prevalence and natural history of potential celiac disease in adult patients.	OBJECTIVE: Potential celiac disease (PCD) is a form of CD characterized by positive endomysial/tissue transglutaminase antibodies and a preserved duodenal mucosa despite a gluten-containing diet (GCD); it can evolve into flat, active CD. This evolution is, however, not certain. Our aim was to retrospectively study the prevalence and the natural history of adult patients with PCD. METHODS: The clinical notes of all 47 patients with PCD attending our clinic between September 1999 and October 2011 were retrospectively reevaluated. To study their clinical features, patients with active CD, randomly selected and matched for sex and date of birth, served as controls. Symptoms, associated diseases, familiarity, and laboratory data at diagnosis were compared. RESULTS: Prevalence of PCD among all celiac patients directly diagnosed in our center was 42/187, (1/4.4, 18.3%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 13.3-23.4%). Age at diagnosis, laboratory data, prevalence of symptoms, associated diseases, and familiarity for CD did not differ between patients with PCD and those with active CD. Some patients with PCD maintained a normal duodenal mucosa for many years and their symptoms spontaneously improved despite maintaining a GCD. CONCLUSIONS: PCD is not a rare form of CD. Having found no difference at all in age at diagnosis and clinical features between PCD and active CD could suggest that PCD is not a prodrome of CD but is a separate entity that can only subsequently evolve into active CD.
35279730	Does contrast-enhanced computed tomography raise awareness in the diagnosis of the invisible side of celiac disease in adults?	PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the diagnosis and determine major and minor criteria of celiac disease (CD) with the malabsorption patterns (MABP) in the small intestine and colon on computed tomography (CT) and additional CT findings. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted with 116 patients diagnosed with CD, 14 CD patients recovering with treatment, and 35 control patients with non-CD. All patients had CT examinations and histopathological diagnoses. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy values of each CT finding defined in the literature were statistically evaluated. According to the patient and control groups, the numerical values of the findings and the sensitivity and specificity values were measured according to this cut-off value. The distribution of CT findings according to pathological Marsh data was evaluated in CD patients. RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity were found to be higher in small bowel MABP findings, mesenteric hypervascularity, and increased SMV/aorta diameter. There was a numerically significant difference in MDCT findings between the control and pathological Marsh groups. In the ROC analysis performed in terms of the total numerical values of each MDCT finding observed between the groups, it was found that there were more than 7 MDCT findings, 100% sensitivity, and 92% specificity. The presence of four major and three minor criteria or three major and four minor criteria were considered significant. CONCLUSIONS: Being aware of CT findings below the iceberg that may suggest CD in abdominal CT examinations performed in patients with atypical clinical and malabsorption findings or other nonspecific findings may prevent diagnostic delay and unnecessary procedures.
27104578	Harnessing Aptamers to Overcome Challenges in Gluten Detection.	Celiac disease is a lifelong autoimmune disorder triggered by foods containing gluten, the storage protein in wheat, rye, and barley. The rapidly escalating number of patients diagnosed with this disease poses a great challenge to both food industry and authorities to guarantee food safety for all. Therefore, intensive efforts are being made to establish minimal disease-eliciting doses of gluten and consequently to improve gluten-free labeling. These efforts depend to a high degree on the availability of methods capable of detecting the protein in food samples at levels as low as possible. Current analytical approaches rely on the use of antibodies as selective recognition elements. With limited sensitivity, these methods exhibit some deficiencies that compromise the accuracy of the obtained results. Aptamers provide an ideal alternative for designing biosensors for fast and selective measurement of gluten in foods. This article highlights the challenges in gluten detection, the current status of the use of aptamers for solving this problem, and what remains to be done to move these systems into commercial applications. 
31599818	Trend of Antitissue Transglutaminase Antibody Normalization in Children With Celiac Disease Started on Gluten-free Diet: A Comparative Study Between Chemiluminescence and ELISA Serum Assays.	BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to compare the performance of antitissue transglutaminase (atTG) chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) with the standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods in monitoring celiac children after the start of gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: Celiac children diagnosed between 2005 and 2016 at our centre were classified into 2 groups based on serum assay (ELISA vs CLIA) used for atTG monitoring, and were compared on percentage of decrease and time to normalization of atTG on GFD. RESULTS: Among 260 included children, the rate of normalization of atTG levels at 30 months' follow-up was 86% and 70% in ELISA and CLIA group, respectively (P < 0.01). Median time to normalization was 11.7 and 14.7 months in ELISA and CLIA group respectively (P = 0.003). Marsh score at diagnosis was not associated with time to atTG normalization (P = 0.770), whereas older age at diagnosis and higher baseline atTG predicted longer time to atTG normalization (P = 0.01, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The percentage and the time of the atTG normalization in celiac children on GFD should be interpreted according to the utilized assay: at 30 months' follow-up children tested by CLIA are less likely to normalize atTG levels compared to those tested by ELISA. Younger age at diagnosis and lower baseline atTG are predictors of earlier atTG normalization, regardless of the adopted assay.
27214203	Mobile Health Apps to Facilitate Self-Care: A Qualitative Study of User Experiences.	OBJECTIVE: Consumers are living longer, creating more pressure on the health system and increasing their requirement for self-care of chronic conditions. Despite rapidly-increasing numbers of mobile health applications ('apps') for consumers' self-care, there is a paucity of research into consumer engagement with electronic self-monitoring. This paper presents a qualitative exploration of how health consumers use apps for health monitoring, their perceived benefits from use of health apps, and suggestions for improvement of health apps. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 'Health app' was defined as any commercially-available health or fitness app with capacity for self-monitoring. English-speaking consumers aged 18 years and older using any health app for self-monitoring were recruited for interview from the metropolitan area of Perth, Australia. The semi-structured interview guide comprised questions based on the Technology Acceptance Model, Health Information Technology Acceptance Model, and the Mobile Application Rating Scale, and is the only study to do so. These models also facilitated deductive thematic analysis of interview transcripts. Implicit and explicit responses not aligned to these models were analyzed inductively. RESULTS: Twenty-two consumers (15 female, seven male) participated, 13 of whom were aged 26-35 years. Eighteen participants reported on apps used on iPhones. Apps were used to monitor diabetes, asthma, depression, celiac disease, blood pressure, chronic migraine, pain management, menstrual cycle irregularity, and fitness. Most were used approximately weekly for several minutes per session, and prior to meeting initial milestones, with significantly decreased usage thereafter. Deductive and inductive thematic analysis reduced the data to four dominant themes: engagement in use of the app; technical functionality of the app; ease of use and design features; and management of consumers' data. CONCLUSIONS: The semi-structured interviews provided insight into usage, benefits and challenges of health monitoring using apps. Understanding the range of consumer experiences and expectations can inform design of health apps to encourage persistence in self-monitoring.
30081576	A Low FODMAP Gluten-Free Diet Improves Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders and Overall Mental Health of Celiac Disease Patients: A Randomized Controlled Trial.	A subset of patients with celiac disease (CD) on a gluten-free diet (GFD) reported the persistence of functional gastrointestinal disorders. Foods containing fermentable, oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) can trigger a broad range of gastrointestinal symptoms in sensitive individuals. We evaluated the effects of a low FODMAP diet (LFD) on gastrointestinal and psychological symptomatology in CD patients. A total of 50 celiac patients on GFDs and with persistence of gastrointestinal symptoms were included. The patients were randomly allocated to one of two dietary groups-one on a low FODMAP GFD (LF-GFD, n = 25) and the other on a regular GFD (R-GFD, n = 25)-for 21 days. Psychological symptomatology and quality of life were evaluated by the Symptom Checklist-90-R (SCL-90) and the Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaires, respectively. Gastrointestinal symptomatology and general well-being were evaluated by visual analogue scale (VAS) scores. After 21 days, 21 and 23 patients completed the dietary treatment on LF-GFD and R-GFD, respectively. A reduced global SCL-90 index (p < 0.0003) was found in the LF-GFD group but not in the R-GFD one. However, the SF-36 scores did not differ between groups after treatment. The VAS for abdominal pain was much lower, and the VAS for fecal consistency enhanced after treatment in the LF-GFD group. General well-being increased in both groups but with a much higher improvement in the LF-GFD (p = 0.03). A short-term LFD regimen helps to improve the psychological health and gastrointestinal symptomatology with enhanced well-being of CD patients with persisting functional gastrointestinal symptomatology. The long-term clinical effects of LFD in particular subgroups of CD patients need further evaluation.

29785564	Helicobacter pylori Infection in Pediatric Patients: Update on Diagnosis and Eradication Strategies.	Helicobacter pylori infection is acquired mainly in childhood and remains an essential cause of peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. This article provides commentary on the last ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN guidelines and on publications made after the consensus conference of 2015. The majority of infected children are asymptomatic and pediatric studies do not support a role for H. pylori in functional disorders such as recurrent abdominal pain. The role of H. pylori infection in failure to thrive, children's growth, type I diabetes mellitus (T1DM), and celiac disease remains controversial. The diagnosis of infection should be based on upper-digestive endoscopy with biopsy-based methods. Eradication control after treatment should be based on validated non-invasive tests. Nodular gastritis is the main endoscopic finding of childhood H. pylori infection, but gastroduodenal erosions/ulcers are seen in some children, especially after 10 years of age. When indicated, eradication treatment should be given when good compliance is expected and based on the antimicrobial susceptibility profile.
23193005	Might gluten traces in wheat substitutes pose a risk in patients with celiac disease? A population-based probabilistic approach to risk estimation.	BACKGROUND: In patients with treated celiac disease (CD), the ingestion of gluten traces contained in gluten-free (GF) wheat substitutes (eg, GF bread, flour, and pasta) could cause persisting intestinal mucosal damage. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the proportion of CD patients at risk of mucosal damage due to the consumption of GF products in 4 European countries (Italy, Spain, Germany, and Norway). DESIGN: A probabilistic modeling approach was used to assess the risk of gluten intake at the population level. The input variables were 1) consumption of GF products, 2) concentration of gluten traces in GF products determined by the sandwich R5 ELISA method, and 3) the gluten threshold for mucosal damage of 10 to 50 mg/d. Different population and product availability scenarios were examined for risk assessment. RESULTS: The gluten content of 205 commercially available GF products ranged between <5 and 27.8 mg/kg. Overall, 99.5% of the analyzed samples had a gluten concentration <20 mg/kg. Most (94%) had a gluten concentration below the limit of quantification (5 mg/kg). The mean percentage of the CD European population at risk of mucosal damage resulting from consumption of GF products ranged between 0.01 (Germany) and 0.15 (Italy) and remained very low, even in the worst-case scenario (<1%). CONCLUSIONS: The adoption of a single gluten threshold (20 mg/kg) for gluten contamination is suggested. GF products in Europe constitute a very safe option for patients with CD. The dietary follow-up of CD patients should focus on other potential sources of gluten contamination.
24784553	State of the art in gluten-free research.	Celiac disease (CD) is widespread and is often under diagnosed. It can affect a variety of genetically susceptible people from the young to the old. Presently, the only treatment for celiac patients is lifelong avoidance of any food, drink, sauce, or dressing containing gluten. Scientists and technologists continue in their quest to improve the quality of gluten-free products. Their main goal is to create a product of a similar standard to the gluten-containing products, currently on the market. However, the quality of these products still tends to be poor. Bread products have a low volume, pale crust, crumbly texture, bland flavor and a high rate of staling. Other gluten-free products contain minimal nutrition and substandard product characteristics, for example, pasta having an inferior texture, sauces which separate more easily. The main focus of this review is to discuss the most recent advances in gluten-free research which have arisen between the years 2011 and 2013. In particular, the manuscript focuses on ingredients and processing methods which have been documented to develop or improve the processing characteristics and nutritional properties of gluten-free products. 
38753225	Gluten-free foods are expensive and nutritionally imbalanced than their gluten-containing counterparts.	OBJECTIVES: Nutritional quality of gluten-free (GF) food products is very important, as patients with celiac disease consume these products for lifelong. There is paucity of data on the nutritional content and cost of GF food products compared with their gluten-containing (GC) counterparts from India (Asia). DESIGN: After a detailed market survey, packaged and labeled GF food products (n=485) and their packaged GC counterparts (n=790) from the supermarkets of Delhi (India) and e-commerce websites were included. Nutritional content and cost/100 g food (in US dollars) were calculated using the information on food label. RESULTS: Gluten-free food products were 232% (range: 118% to 376%) more expensive than their GC counterparts. Energy content of all GF food products was similar to their GC counterparts, except cereal-based snacks (GF: 445 kcal vs. GC: 510 kcal, p<0.001). The protein content was significantly lower in GF pasta and macaroni products (single-grain: GF: 6.5 g vs. GC:11. 5 g, p-0.002; multigrain: GF:7.6 g vs. GC:11.5 g, p-0.027), cereal flours (single-grain: GF: 7.6 g vs. GC: 12.3 g, p<0.001; multigrain: GF:10.9 g vs. GC: 14.1 g, p-0.009) and nutritional bars (GF: 21.81 g vs. GC:26 g, p-0.028) than their GC counterparts. Similarly, the dietary-fiber content of GF pasta and macaroni products, cereal flours, cereal premix and nutritional bars of GF foods was significantly lower than their GC counterparts. Gluten-free bread and confectionary items, biscuits and cookies and snacks had higher total fats and trans-fat content than their GC counterparts. Gluten-free cereal-based snacks had higher sodium content than their GC counterparts (GF: 820 mg vs. GC:670 mg; p<0.001). CONCLUSION: GF foods are significantly more expensive, contain less protein and dietary fiber and higher fat, trans-fat and sodium than their GC counterparts. Strategies must be developed to reduce the cost and improve the nutritional profile of GF foods.

33670760	A Cumulative Effect of Food and Viruses to Trigger Celiac Disease (CD): A Commentary on the Recent Literature.	Celiac disease (CD) is a type of inflammatory chronic disease caused by nutrients such as gliadin that induce a TC (T cell)-mediated response in a partially known genetical background in an environment predisposed to inflammation, including viruses and food. Various experimental and clinical observations suggest that multiple agents such as viruses and bacteria have some common, inflammatory pathways predisposing individuals to chronic inflammatory diseases including celiac disease (CD). More recently, a Western diet and lifestyle have been linked to tissue inflammation and increase in chronic inflammatory diseases. In CD, the gliadin protein itself has been shown to be able to induce inflammation. A cooperation between viruses and gliadin is present in vitro and in vivo with common mechanisms to induce inflammation. Nutrients could have also a protective effect on CD, and in fact the anti-inflammatory Mediterranean diet has a protective effect on the development of CD in children. The possible impact of these observations on clinical practice is discussed.
26510080	Is there any relationship between unrecognized Celiac disease and unexplained infertile couples?	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Celiac Disease (CD) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by small intestinal malabsorbtion and diarrhea, triggered by the ingestion of food products containing gluten. There are studies reporting that some nutritional deficiencies and some factors related to immunity may cause a decrease in fertility as well as some problems in sperm parameters. The prevalence of CD in unexplained infertility (UEI) couples is not as high as that mentioned in some reports. There is no accurate knowledge about the prevalence of CD in a UEI couple. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 68 couples with UEI who were admitted at Turk Diyanet Vakfi 29 Mayis Hospital Center of in vitro fertilization (IVF) between January and June 2014 were included in this prospective pilot study. The diagnosis of UEI was made with basic infertility tests. A history of CD was questioned in the initial evaluation. Anti-gliadin, anti-endomysial, and tissue transglutaminase antibodies as well as total IgA were tested. Gastroscopy was performed in patients with positive serologic tests. Histopathological CD diagnosis was made according to Marsh criteria. RESULTS: The mean age of the study population was 33.40+-4.59 years. Out of the 65 couples who were included into the study group, one of the five couples was positive for the autoantibodies (7.69%). Out of these 65 couples, none of them had autoantibody positivity at the same time in both partners. Anti-gliadin antibodies were found to be positive for two females out of five couples and in three male partners of the same group. Out of these five couples, only one male partner had all the antibodies as positive (1.5%). In the histopathological examination of patients with positive autoantibodies, only the patient in whom all autoantibodies were positive had findings compatible with Marsh IIIa gluten enteropathy. Only one couple had a diagnosis of CD (1.5%). CONCLUSION: In many studies, CD was shown to affect the reproductive system of women. CD may also cause a decrease in fertility in men by affecting sperm motility and androgen levels. Our study is based on a limited sample size. Our data should be confirmed in a larger cohort of subjects. These results suggest that investigation of both couples with a diagnosis of UEI may be more beneficial in clarifying the etiology.
30582343	Gluten contamination in food services and industry: A systematic review.	Gluten-related disorders (GRD) affects approximately 10% of the general population. The only treatment for GRD is still so far is the lifelong complete exclusion of gluten from the daily diet. The correct information about the presence/absence of gluten in food is very important to this group. The present study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of gluten contamination in gluten-free industrial and non-industrial products. In this systematic review, 24 cross-sectional studies were analyzed. The authors developed specific search strategies for Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global. The authors evaluated the methodological quality of the included studies using criteria from Meta-analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (MASTARI). We performed the statistical meta-analysis by metafor package of R program. 95.83% (n = 23) of the studies presented positive results for contamination (over 20 ppm). In industrial food products, studies showed a contamination prevalence of 13.2% (95% CI: 10.8%-15.7%). In non-industrial food products, studies showed a contamination prevalence of 41.5% (95% CI: 16.6%-66.4%). Despite the non-industrial products presented higher contamination prevalence than the industrial products, the difference was not significant (p = 0.072). The findings indicate cross-contamination in industrialized and non-industrialized products. As expected, industrial products labeled as gluten-free showed a lower percentage of gluten-contamination than non-industrialized. Despite that, any contaminated sample found in this group present greater relevance than non-labeled foods. It indicates that foods labeled as "gluten-free" should not be considered safe for patients with GRD since information on the label regarding the presence/absence of gluten is unreliable. Therefore, any gluten-contamination in products labeled as gluten-free is a serious problem to whom present GRD. Further studies are needed to estimate gluten cross-contamination in food service meals and industry better.
33908739	Age-Dependent Trends in the Celiac Disease: A Tertiary Center Experience.	OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease (CD) is a common intestinal autoimmune disorder with diverse presenting features. We aimed to determine age-dependent patterns in CD presentation, diagnosis and management at a large tertiary referral center. METHODS: A retrospective review of electronic medical records of pediatric patients diagnosed with CD between January 1999 and December 2018 at Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel. We compared demographics, clinical and laboratory parameters between four age groups at CD presentation. RESULTS: A cohort of 932 children was divided into four groups by age (in years) at diagnosis: 0-3 (17.9%), 3-6 (31.8%), 6-12 (34.5%), 12-18 (15.8%). The youngest age group presented more frequently with diarrhea, weight loss, abdominal distention, vomiting and lower weight z scores, P < 0.01. Hypoalbuminemia and zinc deficiency were also more frequent in this age group, compared to older patients (P < 0.05, each). Rates of anemia were higher in younger age groups (0-3 and 3-6 years), compared to older age groups, P < 0.05. Patients in the younger age groups (0-3 and 3-6 years) presented more frequently with tissue transglutaminase (TTG) levels above 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN; P < 0.05), and more often normalized their CD serologies by 24 months of gluten-free diets (GFD) compared to older age groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: There is an age-dependent variation in CD presentation during childhood. Younger patients present more often with malabsorptive features, and higher TTG levels, yet normalize TTG while on GFD more rapidly than older patients. Clinicians should be aware of the diversity in CD presentation and course at the various presentation age.
34993643	Individual variability in patterns and dynamics of fecal gluten immunogenic peptides excretion after low gluten intake.	PURPOSE: Determination of Gluten Immunogenic Peptides (GIP) in feces is a direct tool for gluten exposure detection. The sensitivity of GIP detection methods for cases of unintentional low gluten intakes is unknown. We studied the interindividual variability in the kinetic of excretion under homogeneously controlled dietary conditions, and the sensitivity of fecal GIP tests after low amounts of punctual gluten ingestions. METHODS: Participants (n = 20) followed the same gluten-free menu for 12 days in which two separated doses of gluten (50 mg and 2 g) were ingested and all the depositions were collected. GIP from stool samples were analyzed by ELISA and lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) tests. RESULTS: Most participants had detectable GIP after 50 mg and 2 g gluten ingestions using ELISA test (72.2% and 95%, respectively), whereas the LFIA test showed less sensitivity (22.2% and 80%, respectively). GIP were detected at higher either frequency or concentration in the range of 12-36 h after 50 mg intake, and 12-84 h after 2 g consumption. Considering this period, diagnostic sensitivity of GIP detection after a single 50 mg ingestion may be significatively increased analyzing three stool samples per individual. High variability among participants was found in the time and amount of GIP excretion; however, some individuals showed common patterns for both gluten intakes. CONCLUSION: Sporadic gluten exposure detection may require several fecal samples to achieve level of sensitivity above 90%. Interindividual variability in the dynamic of GIP excretion may suggest patterns of gluten metabolism.
30918433	Gluten immunogenic peptide excretion detects dietary transgressions in treated celiac disease patients.	BACKGROUND: Life-long removal of gluten from the diet is currently the only way to manage celiac disease (CeD). Until now, no objective test has proven useful to objectively detect ingested gluten in clinical practice. Recently, tests that determine consumption of gluten by assessing excretion of gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) in stool and urine have been developed. Their utility, in comparison with conventional dietary and analytical follow-up strategies, has not been fully established. AIM: To assess the performance of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and point-of-care tests (PoCTs) for GIP excretion in CeD patients on gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: We conducted an observational, prospective, cross-sectional study in patients following a GFD for at least two years. Using the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale questionnaire, patients were classified at enrollment as asymptomatic or symptomatic. Gluten consumption was assessed twice by 3-d dietary recall and GIP excretion (by ELISA in stool and PoCTs (commercial kits for stool and urine) in two consecutive samples. These samples and dietary reports were obtained 10 day apart one from the other. Patients were encouraged to follow their usual GFD during the study period. RESULTS: Forty-four patients were enrolled, of which 19 (43.2%) were symptomatic despite being on a GFD. Overall, 83 sets of stool and/or urine samples were collected. Eleven out of 44 patients (25.0%) had at least one positive GIP test. The occurrence of at least one positive test was 32% in asymptomatic patients compared with 15.8% in symptomatic patients. GIP was concordant with dietary reports in 65.9% of cases (Cohen s kappa: 0.317). PoCT detected dietary indiscretions. Both ELISA and PoCT in stool were concordant (concomitantly positive or negative) in 67 out of 74 (90.5%) samples. Excretion of GIP was detected in 7 (8.4%) stool and/or urine samples from patients considered to be strictly compliant with the GFD by dietary reports. CONCLUSION: GIP detects dietary transgressions in patients on long-term GFD, irrespective of the presence of symptoms. PoCT for GIP detection constitutes a simple home-based method for self-assessment of dietary indiscretions.
34091620	The impact of a gluten-free diet on the growth pattern of Saudi children with coeliac disease.	OBJECTIVE: To assess the growth pattern of children with coeliac disease after the introduction of a gluten-free diet. METHOD: The retrospective study was conducted at King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and comprised data from January 2015 to December 2018 of children aged 2-16 years with biopsy-proven coeliac disease. Serial measurements of height-for-age and weight-for-age z-scores were recorded at 0, 4, 8, 12 and 16 months. Data on insulin-like growth factor-1 and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 obtained at diagnosis and during follow-up was retrieved. Clinical, demographic, and laboratory data was extracted from the patients' medical files. Data was analysed using SPSS 22. RESULTS: Of the 47 patients, 25(53.2%) were boys and 22(46.8%) were girls. The overall mean age was 8.7+-3.4 years. There was a significant time effect for weight-for-age and height-for-age z-scores (p<0.001). There was significant increase in the secretion of insulin-like growth factor-1 and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (p<0.05) during the first 8 months of a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of gluten-free diet for Saudi children with coeliac disease normalized growth parameters and improved the endogenous secretion of growth factors.

21447770	Nutritional and dietary aspects of celiac disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is a primarily digestive systemic disease triggered and maintained by the ingestion of gluten in the diet. Its has a wide clinical spectrum of manifestations, particularly varied in adult patients, in whom, because of their frequent negative serology and mild, nonspecific symptoms, there is a considerable delay in diagnosis. The intestinal lesion caused by CD leads to various deficiencies of nutrients, vitamins, and dietary minerals, with ferropenia, vitamin B12, folic acid, and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies being especially frequent. The deficiencies, together with dairy intolerance, cause low bone density and an increased risk of fractures. Treatment using a gluten-free diet (GFD) does involve certain complications, since gluten is found in up to 70% of manufactured food products and manufacturing regulations are not standard in all countries. In addition, certain nutrient deficiencies require specific management. This article reviews the nutritional aspects of CD and provides practical guidelines to correct these deficiencies and to ensure optimum GFD compliance.
24621595	Reduced-gliadin wheat bread: an alternative to the gluten-free diet for consumers suffering gluten-related pathologies.	Wheat flour cannot be tolerated by those who suffer allergies to gluten. Human pathologies associated with grain proteins have increased worldwide in recent years, and the only effective treatment available is a lifelong gluten-free diet, which is complicated to follow and detrimental to gut health. This manuscript describes the development of wheat bread potentially suitable for celiac patients and other gluten-intolerant individuals. We have made bread using wheat flour with very low content of the specific gluten proteins (near gliadin-free) that are the causal agents for pathologies such as celiac disease. Loaves were compared with normal wheat breads and rice bread. Organoleptic, nutritional, and immunotoxic properties were studied. The reduced-gliadin breads showed baking and sensory properties, and overall acceptance, similar to those of normal flour, but with up to 97% lower gliadin content. Moreover, the low-gliadin flour has improved nutritional properties since its lysine content is significantly higher than that of normal flour. Conservative estimates indicate that celiac patients could safely consume 67 grams of bread per day that is made with low-gliadin flour. However, additional studies, such as feeding trials with gluten-intolerant patients, are still needed in order to determine whether or not the product can be consumed by the general celiac population, as well as the actual tolerated amount that can be safely ingested. The results presented here offer a major opportunity to improve the quality of life for millions of sufferers of gluten intolerance throughout the world. 
30561392	Peripheral neuropathy and gastroenterologic disorders: an overview on an underrecognized association.	BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE WORK: Although peripheral neuropathies in children are often of genetic origin, acquired causes should be carefully looked for and ruled out also in the pediatric age. Gastroenterological disorders can be complicated by peripheral neuropathy as a result of micronutrients deficiency, drug toxicity or because of shared pathophysiological mechanisms. METHODS: In this descriptive review we sought to give an overview on the most relevant clinical conditions in which peripheral neuropathies are associated with gastro-intestinal disorders or symptoms. RESULTS: We describe the clinical, demographic, and electrophysiological features of peripheral neuropathy in three main clinical scenarios: in the context of common gastroenterological disorders (inflammatory bowel and celiac disease), in the context of micronutrients deficiencies arising from malabsorption irrespective of etiology, and in a rare degenerative mitochondrial disorder, mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE) disorder. CONCLUSIONS: The association between gastrointestinal and peripheral nervous system symptoms is probably still underrecognized but has to be actively sought, in order to provide prompt diagnosis resulting in optimal care and long-term management with the aim to improve quality of life and, at least in some conditions, try to impact on prognosis.
35916816	The prevalence of celiac disease and the appropriateness of the diagnosis in family medicine setting could be lower than expected.	OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of celiac disease (CD) and the appropriateness of this diagnosis in the family medicine setting in Italy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The electronic databases of 16 general practitioners working in Rome (Italy) were analyzed. The prevalence of CD according to the Italian pathology identification code issued by the Italian National Health System was assessed. In addition, patients registered as having celiac disease without being assigned a pathology identification code were interviewed. RESULTS: Overall, a population of 22,064 patients was analyzed. 91 patients had a diagnosis of CD (0.41%), 60 of whom had a pathology identification code (0.27%), and 31 did not (0.14%). 29 of these patients were interviewed, 16 (17.58% of the CD recorded patients) of whom reported being on a gluten-free or gluten restricted diet, with reported improvement in their clinical symptoms. Half of them further stated that they would not agree to resume a restriction free diet in order to make a definitive CD diagnosis, due to the risk of symptom recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: In a family medicine setting, the prevalence of CD seems to be lower than expected, and one third of patients diagnosed with CD do not fulfill all diagnostic criteria. Any effort to improve the diagnostic work-up for CD should also be made in this setting.
22529691	No evidence of circulating autoantibodies against osteoprotegerin in patients with celiac disease.	AIM: To investigate risk factors for low bone mineral density (BMD) in celiac disease (CD) patients, focusing on circulating autoantibodies against osteoprotegerin (OPG). METHODS: Seventy asymptomatic CD adult patients on gluten-free diet (GFD) and harbouring persistent negative CD-related serology were recruited. Conventional risk factors for osteoporosis (e.g., age, sex, menopausal status, history of fractures, smoke, and body mass index) were checked and BMD was assessed by dual energy X ray absorptiometry. Serum calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were evaluated. Thirty-eight patients underwent repeat duodenal biopsy. Serum samples from a selected sub-group of 30 patients, who were also typed for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQ2 and DQ8 haplotype, were incubated with homodimeric recombinant human OPG and tested by western blotting with an anti-OPG antibody after immunoprecipitation. RESULTS: Despite persistent negative CD-related serology and strict adherence to GFD, 49 out of the 70 (74%) patients displayed low BMD. Among these patients, 13 (24%) showed osteoporosis and 36 (76%) osteopenia. With the exception of age, conventional risk factors for osteoporosis did not differ between patients with normal and low BMD. Circulating serum calcium and PTH levels were normal in all patients. Duodenal mucosa healing was found in 31 (82%) out of 38 patients who underwent repeat duodenal biopsy with 20 (64%) still displaying low BMD. The remaining 7 patients had an incomplete normalization of duodenal mucosa with 6 (84%) showing low BMD. No evidence of circulating antibodies against OPG was found in the serum of 30 celiac patients who were tested for, independent of BMD, duodenal histology, and HLA status. CONCLUSION: If any, the role of circulating autoantibodies against OPG in the pathogenesis of bone derangement in patients with CD is not a major one.

25203364	Dietary Supplement Use in Patients With Celiac Disease in the United States.	BACKGROUND: There has been increasing interest in the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in the general population. Little is known about CAM use in patients with celiac disease (CD). GOALS: We aimed to determine the demographics and clinical characteristics of patients with biopsy-proven CD who use dietary supplements to treat their symptoms. STUDY: CD patients completed a questionnaire on demographics, types of dietary supplement use, attitudes toward CAM, and 3 validated scales: CD-related Quality Of Life (CD-QOL), the CD Symptoms Index (CSI), and the CD Adherence Test (CDAT). RESULTS: Of 423 patients, 100 (23.6%) used dietary supplements to treat CD symptoms. The most frequently used supplement was probiotics (n=59). Supplement users had a higher CD-QOL score (75.06 vs. 71.43, P=0.04) but had more symptoms based on CSI (35.64 vs. 32.05, P=0.0032). On multivariable analysis, adjusting for age, sex, education, symptom improvement following a gluten-free diet, and where the survey was completed, patients presenting with classic symptoms (OR, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.01-6.44) or nonclassic symptoms (OR, 2.75; 95% CI, 1.04-7.24) were significantly more likely to use supplements than those with asymptomatic/screen-detected CD. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with biopsy-proven CD who have symptoms at diagnosis tend to use dietary supplements more than those that are screen detected. Those using supplements report persistent symptoms, but a higher quality of life. The contribution of the gluten-free diet and supplement use to quality of life in the symptomatic CD patient needs to be determined.
26426383	Idelalisib-associated Enterocolitis: Clinicopathologic Features and Distinction From Other Enterocolitides.	Idelalisib is a highly specific small-molecule phosphoinositide-3-kinase delta inhibitor that was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. The known side effects of idelalisib include severe diarrhea and colitis. Here we report the histologic findings in idelalisib-associated enterocolitis in 11 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or follicular lymphoma receiving idelalisib over a 5-year period (2011 to 2015) at our institution. All 11 patients were receiving idelalisib and underwent colonoscopy for the evaluation of diarrhea. None of the patients had previously received a stem cell transplant. Histologically, the colon biopsies in all 11 cases showed some degree of apoptosis within crypts, with 5 cases showing moderate to severe apoptosis involving the majority of the crypts with loss of goblet cells. No viral inclusions were seen in any case and immunohistochemical stains for cytomegalovirus performed in 9/11 cases were negative. All cases showed at least focal acute cryptitis, and 8 of these cases showed mild architectural distortion. Increased inflammation within the lamina propria was seen in 7 cases, and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes within crypts was seen in 8 cases; the lymphocytes were mostly T cells with a predominance of CD8 T cells, with the majority expressing the alpha/beta T-cell receptor. Diagnoses of graft-versus-host disease, autoimmune enteropathy, infectious enterocolitis, and although thought to be less likely, inflammatory bowel disease were considered in each case. The presence of numerous intraepithelial lymphocytes in addition to severe villous blunting and apoptosis in the small intestinal biopsies from a subset of these patients additionally raised the possibility of autoimmune enteropathy, common variable immunodeficiency, or less likely, celiac disease. Awareness of the histologic features of idelalisib-associated enterocolitis is important to distinguish it from potential mimics, particularly graft-versus-host disease, autoimmune enteropathy, and cytomegalovirus/infectious enterocolitis. 
32711513	Health-related quality of life using specific and generic questionnaires in Spanish coeliac children.	BACKGROUND: We aimed to compare the perception of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and related factors in Spanish coeliac children and their parents, using two questionnaires, the generic KIDSCREEN-52 and the specific the Celiac Disease DUX (CDDUX), and to assess the correlation between them. METHODS: Coeliac children, aged 8-18, who are members of the Madrid Coeliac Association (MCA) and their parents, answered the Spanish version of the CDDUX and KIDSCREEN-52 questionnaires via e-mail. CDDUX was answered by 266 children and 428 parents and KIDSCREEN-52 by 255 children and 387 parents. Linear regression models were fitted to evaluate the association of demographic and clinical factors with HRQOL scores. CDDUX scores were compared with the subjective perception of health status assessed by the first question of KIDSCREEN-52. The correlation between the questionnaires was analysed. RESULTS: We found that the main factors that negatively affected HRQOL were having social or economic difficulties associated with following the diet and having transgression-related symptoms. The maximum correlation between the questionnaires was 0.309 and - 0.254 in parents and children respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is a poor correlation between the two questionnaires, both agreed that the main concerns of the respondents were related to the social and economic difficulties of following the diet. It would be interesting to use both types of questionnaires in order to perform a more complete assessment of HRQOL in coeliac children. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Not applicable.
28317399	Recent advances in pediatric celiac disease.	INTRODUCTION: The incidence of celiac disease (CD) has increased over the last half-century, resulting in rising interest in identifying risk factors for CD. The necessity of duodenal biopsies in the diagnosis of CD has recently been challenged. Areas covered: This review covers the recent literature regarding the role of infant feeding practices, including breastfeeding and timing of gluten introduction, and the microbiota in the development of CD. Additionally, the application of the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition guidelines for a non-biopsy approach to the diagnosis of CD is reviewed. Expert commentary: Recent investigations have not revealed any significant effect of breastfeeding or timing of gluten introduction on the risk of CD in at-risk populations. There are alterations in the microbiota of CD patients. However, the role of the microbiome and whether its manipulation has a clinical effect are unknown. Preliminary data suggests a non-biopsy approach to diagnosis of pediatric CD can be applied to several populations, although additional studies are needed. Prospective investigations are underway to examine the interplay of infant feeding practices and the microbiome and to identify particular CD-specific biomarkers that may aid in the diagnosis and ultimately prevention of CD.
27012449	Enteroscopy and radiology for the management of celiac disease complications: Time for a pragmatic roadmap.	Celiac disease is the most common autoimmune enteropathy in Western countries, and is usually associated with a good response to the gluten free diet and an excellent prognosis. However, a minority of patients develop complications of the disease, such as refractory celiac disease, ulcerative jejunoileitis and neoplastic complications such as adenocarcinoma of the small bowel and enteropathy associated T cell lymphoma. Neoplastic complications described in association with celiac disease have a high mortality rate, due to their aggressive behavior and to the usual advanced stage at the time of diagnosis. In recent years, the detection of small bowel lesions has dramatically improved thank to the availability of highly performing radiologic and endoscopic techniques. The diagnostic delay of malignant complications in patients with celiac disease may be improved by establishing a pragmatic flowchart for the identification and follow up of "at risk" patients. We performed a comprehensive review of the articles published on this issue in order to promote a roadmap to be applied when facing with celiac patients with suspected small bowel complications. 
31619632	Gluten-Free Rice Breading Using Composited Rice Flour and Pre-Germinated Brown Rice Flour for Health Benefits.	Gluten-free rice breading (RB) is generally prepared by shredding of gluten-free rice bread. It is an alternative product for Celiac patients, who are gluten allergic. The aim of this research was to formulate gluten-free rice bread formula by using composited rice flour (RF) and pre-germinated brown rice flour (PGBRF) from two Thai rice cultivars, Pathum-Thani1 (15% amylose) and Phitsanulok2 (27% amylose) at the ratio of 1:1, by considering the structural properties of bread, health benefit of breading, and the properties of breading as coating material of fried frozen croquette (C-) and compared to those of samples prepared from wheat flour. Increasing PGBRF from 0% to 50% in gluten-free rice bread formula increased the puffed cell wall of air cell in gluten-free rice bread. Antioxidative activity of RB containing 50% PGBRF (RB-50%) was 4 and 9 times higher than RB without PGBRF (RB-0%) and wheat breading (WB), respectively. WB contained 356,289 mg/kg of gluten, while RB contained less than 2 mg/kg of gluten, which could be labeled "gluten-free". When compared all breading samples as coating material of C-, oil absorption of C-RB-50% (14.32%) was 3 times lower than that of WB (44.36%). Therefore, the RB-50% had health benefits for consumers who are suffered from Celiac disease and also other health-conscious consumers considering the higher antioxidative properties and lower oil uptake than the consumption of WB.
26283211	Quality of life in children with celiac disease: A paediatric cross-sectional study.	BACKGROUND: Few studies investigated factors influencing the quality of life of children with celiac disease on a gluten-free diet. AIMS: To investigate the impact of the gluten-free diet on the psycho-physical well-being of celiac children. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we interviewed 76 celiac and 143 non-celiac children (2-18 years) by using a non-disease specific questionnaire (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Test) and we explored the impact of the diet on social life with an open-ended questionnaire. Scores were compared by Wilcoxon rank-sum test. A quantile regression analysis was used to evaluate the impact of celiac disease on score distribution. RESULTS: No significant differences in quality of life were found between the two groups (total score: 84.1 (81.1-87.2) vs 81.5 (79.7-83.4), median (95% CI), patients and controls respectively, p=0.4). Treatment positively affected quality of life in children that showed "intermediate" scores in the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Test. Lowest scores were observed in children reporting a higher number of diet difficulties or co-morbidities. CONCLUSIONS: Although celiac patients showed an overall good quality of life in comparison with a control group, by using appropriate analytical methods we elicited specific factors contributing to a lower quality of life in patients, such as co-morbidities and difficulties with the diet.
29160641	Pediatric epilepsy and psychiatric comorbidity: could celiac disease diagnosis improve the outcome?	
22739230	Subclinical celiac disease and crystal-induced kidney disease following kidney transplant.	Decreased kidney function from kidney deposition of calcium oxalate has been described previously in inflammatory bowel disease and after jejuno-ileal and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgeries. Although celiac disease is the most prevalent bowel abnormality associated with intestinal malabsorption, its relationship to high kidney oxalate burden and decreased kidney function has not been established. We report a case of subclinical celiac disease and hyperoxaluria that presented with loss of kidney function as a result of high oxalate load in the absence of overt diarrhea, documented intestinal fat malabsorption, and nephrolithiasis. Subclinical celiac disease is commonly overlooked and hyperoxaluria is not usually investigated in kidney patients. We propose that this entity should be suspected in patients with chronic kidney disease in which the cause of kidney damage has not been clearly established.
30043079	Plasma profile and urine excretion of amino acids in children with celiac disease on gluten-free diet after oligofructose-enriched inulin intervention: results of a randomised placebo-controlled pilot study.	The circulating amino acid (AAs) concentrations are indicators of dietary protein intake and metabolic status. In celiac disease (CD), the AA imbalance is frequently observed. Prebiotics are found to alleviate nutrient deficiencies. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyse the impact of oligrofructose-enriched inulin (Synergy 1), administered for 3 months as a gluten-free diet (GFD) supplement to children with CD, on the plasma and urine concentrations of AAs. CD children (N = 34) were randomised into two groups, receiving Synergy 1 (10 g/day) or placebo (maltodextrin) for 3 months. The AA profile and concentration was determined in plasma and urine before and after the dietary intervention by gas chromatography. 22 and 28 AAs were determined in plasma and urine samples, respectively. After the intervention, the plasma concentrations of several AAs (Ala, Pro, Asn, Glu, Tyr, Lys, His, Orn) increased significantly in both experimental groups, while Gln increased only in the Synergy 1 group. The urinary excretion of Asn, Lys and Aaa increased significantly in the Synergy 1 group, and the excretion of Asp and Met decreased (p < 0.05) in the placebo group. The Gln:Glu ratio in urine increased in both groups after the intervention. An increased urinary excretion of AAs observed in Synergy 1 group with a simultaneous increase in the content of circulating AAs could be attributed to higher absorption or intensified metabolism of AAs, and on the other hand further healing of the intestinal mucosa being the result of continuous treatment with GFD. Moreover, the observed changes in Glu concentration suggest that oligofructose-enriched inulin could improve the intestinal condition and permeability. To conclude, a prebiotic-supplemented GFD influences beneficially the overall AAs metabolism in CD children; however, further prospective cohort studies are needed to confirm the results obtained.
32314256	Celiac Disease and Obesity: Is Bariatric Surgery an Option?	Celiac disease is an immune-mediated enteropathy associated with malabsorptive syndrome and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies. Celiac disease affects 1% of individuals but is largely underdiagnosed, as its multifaceted clinical presentations create challenging diagnostic scenarios. With the rise of the obesity epidemic, doctors are increasingly seeing celiac disease patients with overweight or obesity, which raises the question of bariatric surgery. However, few studies so far have investigated bariatric surgery in this patient population. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the literature on celiac disease, its nutritional consequences and complications, and we discuss the possible impact of bariatric surgery on weight loss, nutritional deficiencies, response to gluten-free diet, and long-term post-operative complications. We also review the effect of bariatric surgery on the incidence of celiac disease.
24502536	Refractory celiac disease.	A small subset of celiac disease (CD) patients becomes refractory to a gluten-free diet with persistent malabsorption and intestinal villous atrophy. Diagnosis of this condition defined as refractory celiac disease (RCD) is made after exclusion of other small bowel diseases with villous atrophy. RCD has been subdivided into two subgroups according to the normal or abnormal phenotype of intraepithelial lymphocytes. Whereas normal RCD is hardly distinguishable from active CD, abnormal RCD has a severe clinical presentation and a very poor prognosis. We precisely describe below the different types of RCD and propose diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines for its clinical management. 
26785763	Rare association of celiac disease with myasthenia gravis in a patient with other immune disorders: a case report.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is described in association with several autoimmune diseases, but rarely with myasthenia gravis. CASE REPORT: We describe the case of a 31-year-old white woman with celiac disease who presented manifestations related to a hyperactive immune system, including macroamylasemia, false-positive anti-HCV, positive antinuclear antibody, and Raynaud's phenomenon. The introduction of a gluten-free diet (GFD) resolved these features, but myasthenia gravis (MG) symptoms unexpectedly occurred on that occasion. DISCUSSION: The role of a GFD in the course of autoimmune diseases has been studied and improvement has been reported in many diseases. However, there is no consensus in the literature regarding the course of neurological disorders associated with celiac disease. In the present case, a GFD did not prevent the appearance of symptoms related to myasthenia gravis. There are few reports on the association of celiac disease with myasthenia gravis and therefore little is known about the course and time of onset of myasthenia in celiac patients. The present case increases the knowledge about this unusual autoimmune neurological disease associated with celiac disease.
38674808	Intraepithelial Lymphogram in the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease in Adult Patients: A Validation Cohort.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is a gluten-related pathology, highly prevalent and heterogeneous in its clinical presentation, which leads to delays in diagnosis and misdiagnosis. The analysis of duodenal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) by flow cytometry (lymphogram) is emerging as a discriminative tool in the diagnosis of various forms of celiac disease (CD). AIMS: The aim of this study was to validate IEL lymphogram performance in the largest adult series to our knowledge, in support of its use as a diagnostic tool and as a biomarker of the dynamic celiac process. METHODS: This was a retrospective study including 768 adult patients (217 with active CD, 195 on a gluten-free diet, 15 potential CD patients, and 411 non-celiac controls). The IEL subset cut-off values were established to calculate the diagnostic accuracy of the lymphogram. RESULTS: A complete celiac lymphogram profile (>=14% increase in T cell receptor [TCR]gammadelta IELs and simultaneous <=4% decrease in surface-negative CD3 [sCD3-] IELs) was strongly associated with active and potential forms in over 80% of the confirmed patients with CD, whereas the remaining patients with CD had partial lymphogram profiles (>=14% increase in TCRgammadelta or <=4% decrease in sCD3- IELs), with lower diagnostic certainty. None of these patients had a non-celiac lymphogram. Quantifying the TCRgammadelta versus sCD3- imbalance as a ratio (>=5) is a discriminative index to discard or suspect CD at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: We have validated the IEL lymphogram's diagnostic efficiency (79% sensitivity, 98% specificity), with an LR+ accuracy of 36.2. As expected, the increase in TCRgammadelta IELs is a reliable marker for celiac enteropathy, while changes in sCD3- IEL levels throughout the dynamic CD process are useful biomarkers of mucosal lesions.

32157915	Serum IL-21 levels from celiac disease patients correlates with anti-tTG IgA autoantibodies and mucosal damage.	Objectives: Coeliac disease is a multifactorial disorder influenced by environmental, genetic and immunological factors. Interleukin (IL)-21 has been linked to an increase disease risk and the serum level of IL-21 seems to be increased in CD compared to a healthy control population.Methods: Sera were collected from 160 CD patients, 120 untreated and 40 following a gluten-free diet, and form 45 healthy subjects. Serum IL-21 was evaluated by specific ELISA tests.Results: Our data show that patients with untreated CD display IL-21 concentrations significantly higher than both treated-CD patients (following a gluten-free diet) and controls. In addition, serum IL-21 correlates with serum titres of anti-tTG IgA autoantibodies. Finally, our results show a correlation of this cytokine with duodenal mucosal damage.Conclusions: A role of gluten, as antigen with stimulatory function on IL-21 production, seems to be confirmed by the longitudinal analyses showing that the gluten-free diet decreases to a nearly undetectable amount this cytokine. In addition, the finding of a positive correlation between the serum amount of IL-21 and the grade of duodenal mucosa damage suggests a strong immunomodulatory effect of this cytokine on cytotoxic T lymphocyte functions. This study provides an extra evidence to emerging data on the potential role IL-21 in CD pathogenesis, suggesting its involvement in the development and progression of CD. Significance statement: In untreated CD, serum IL-21 shows higher levels compared with treated CD and healthy subjects. Serum amounts of IL-21 correlate with anti-tTG IgA autoantibodies and with duodenal mucosa damage.
33923097	Mycotoxin Occurrence and Risk Assessment in Gluten-Free Pasta through UHPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap MS.	Celiac disease (CD) is a genetic-based autoimmune disorder which is characterized by inflammation in the small intestinal mucosa due to the intolerance to gluten. Celiac people should consume products without gluten, which are elaborated mainly with maize or other cereals. Contamination of cereals with mycotoxins, such as fumonisins (FBs) and aflatoxins (AFs) is frequently reported worldwide. Therefore, food ingestion is the main source of mycotoxin exposure. A new analytical method was developed and validated for simultaneous analysis of 21 mycotoxins in gluten-free pasta, commonly consumed by celiac population as an alternative to conventional pasta. Ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap MS) was used for analyte separation and detection. The mycotoxins included in this work were those widely reported to occur in cereal samples, namely, ochratoxin-A (OTA), aflatoxins (AFB1, AFB2, AFG1 and AFG2), zearalenone (ZON), deoxynivalenol (DON), 3-acetyl-deoxynivalenol and 15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (3-AcDON and 15-AcDON, respectively), nivalenol (NIV), neosolaniol (NEO), fusarenone-X, (FUS-X), T-2 toxin (T-2) and HT-2 toxin (HT-2), fumonisin B1 and B2 (FB1 and FB2, respectively), enniatins (ENN A, ENN A1, ENN B and ENN B1) and beauvericin (BEA). The validated method was successfully applied to 84 gluten-free pasta samples collected from several local markets of Campania region (Italy) during September to November 2020 to monitor the occurrence of mycotoxins and to assess the exposure to these food contaminants. A significant number of samples (95%) showed mycotoxin contamination, being Fusarium mycotoxins (FB1, ZON and DON) the most commonly detected ones. Regarding the risk assessment, the higher exposures were obtained for NIV, DON and FB1 for children and teenagers age group which can be explained due to their lower body weight.
21695959	[Late diagnosis of celiac disease in a child with cystic fibrosis].	Cystic fibrosis is frequent monogenic disorder inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and has a severe course and prognosis. Crucial for the patient's life are the nature and extent of lung injury, as well as the digestive system, especially the pancreas and liver. Since the late 1960's. appeared describing a combination of celiac disease and cystic fibrosis. Many authors believe their associated diseases. Cited the case of late diagnosis of celiac disease in patient with cystic fibrosis, diagnosed as late, which delayed the appointment of adequate therapy, severe violations of nutritional status and physical development of the child, the current weighting of the underlying disease.
36943204	Sorghum (Sorghum vulgare): an ancient grain, a novel choice for a healthy gluten-free diet.	Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease related to gluten consumption. To date, the only effective therapy that can reverse symptoms and prevent complications is the gluten-free diet (GFD), which is challenging to maintain and has potential health risks. Identifying foods that can help diversify the GFD and that best match the nutritional needs of people with CD may improve the health and quality of life of celiac patients. This review, conducted through a non-systematic search of the available literature, aims to gather the most recent research on nutritional issues in CD and GFD. Moreover, it highlights how sorghum characteristics could provide health benefits to CD patients that counteract the nutritional problems due to CD and the nutritional consequences of GFD acceptance. Sorghum contains a wide variety of bioactive compounds, such as flavones and tannins, that have shown anti-inflammatory activity in preclinical studies. They can also regulate blood sugar levels and lower cholesterol to reduce the effects of common chronic diseases such as metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Because it is gluten-free, its use in making foods for celiac patients is increasing, especially in the United States. In conclusion, sorghum is a fascinating grain with nutritional properties and health benefits for supplementing GFD. However, only one study confirms the short-term safety of sorghum inclusion in the GFD, and further long-term studies with a large sample are needed.
31912484	Small bowel adenocarcinoma: Results from a nationwide prospective ARCAD-NADEGE cohort study of 347 patients.	Small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA) is a rare tumour. We conducted a prospective cohort to describe the prevalence, survival and prognostic factors in unselected SBA patients. The study enrolled patients with all stages of newly diagnosed or recurrent SBA at 74 French centres between January 2009 and December 2012. In total, 347 patients were analysed; the median age was 63 years (range 23-90). The primary tumour was in the duodenum (60.6%), jejunum (20.7%) and ileum (18.7%). The prevalence of predisposing disease was 8.7%, 6.9%, 1.7%, 1.7% and 0.6% for Crohn disease, Lynch syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, celiac disease and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, respectively. At diagnosis, 58.9%, 5.5% and 35.6% of patients had localised and resectable, locally advanced unresectable and metastatic disease, respectively. Crohn disease was significantly associated with younger age, poor differentiation and ileum location, whereas Lynch syndrome with younger age, poor differentiation, early stage and duodenum location. Adjuvant chemotherapy (oxaliplatin-based in 89.9%) was performed in 61.5% of patients with locally resected tumours. With a 54-months median follow-up, the 5-year overall survival (OS) was 87.9%, 78.2% and 55.5% in Stages I, II and III, respectively. The median OS of patients with Stage IV was 12.7 months. In patients with resected tumours, poor differentiation (p = 0.047) and T4 stage (p = 0.001) were associated with a higher risk of death. In conclusion, our study showed that the prognosis of advanced SBA remains poor. Tumour characteristics differed according to predisposing disease. In SBA-resected tumours, the prognostic factors for OS were grade and T stage.
21233715	Plasma citrulline levels in paediatric patients with celiac disease and the effect of a gluten-free diet.	OBJECTIVE: Citrulline is a nonprotein amino acid synthesized in the small intestine. The aim of this study is to explore plasma citrulline levels in children with celiac disease (CD) and monitor the time-related changes of these levels after initiation of a gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: Fasting-plasma citrulline levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography in (i) 23 patients with CD before the institution of GFD, (ii) 20 patients with CD under treatment for more than 2 years responsive to a GFD, (iii) 10 children with gastrointestinal symptoms and normal small bowel biopsy, and (iv) 20 healthy controls. In group A, citrulline levels were also measured after 1, 3, 6, and 12 months on a GFD. RESULTS: Mean plasma citrulline levels were lower in untreated patients with CD (24.5+-4.9) than in patients on a GFD (31.2+-6.7 mumol/l, P<0.001), patients with gastrointestinal symptoms and normal intestinal mucosa (30.3+-4.7 mumol/l, P<0.01), and healthy controls (32.4+-7.5 mumol/l, P<0.001). In untreated patients with CD,an inverse correlation was observed between citrulline concentrations and the severity of villous atrophy (r=-0.67, P<0.01). After 1 month on a GFD, patients had significantly higher levels than before diet (P<0.05) and after 3 months on diet, levels were similar to those observed in the healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma citrulline levels are lower in celiacs reflecting small bowel involvement in this disease. After a short period on GFD, citrulline levels increased rapidly, indicating that citrulline is a sensitive marker of the positive effect of GFD on intestinal repair.
22257477	Video capsule endoscopy in celiac disease: current clinical practice.	OBJECTIVE: A complete examination of the small intestine is possible by video capsule endoscopy (VCE). The aim of this study was to evaluate current indications for performing VCE in celiac disease. METHODS: In all 84 celiac disease patients on a gluten-free diet who had undergone VCE were enrolled at five centers in Europe. The indications, findings and clinical impact of VCE were recorded by a structured questionnaire. VCE was also carried out in 34 consecutive patients with untreated celiac disease (controls) in another center. RESULTS: Out of the 84 patients, 34 had overt symptoms and small intestinal histology compatible with refractory celiac disease. VCE was normal in 9 patients, and 7 had only proximal and one distal atrophy, 14 had intestinal ulcer and 2 an intestinal stricture. VCE was used in the adjustment of immunosuppressive treatment in 9 patients. In the remaining 50 patients, a VCE was performed because of less severe symptoms, 31 of which had an earlier histological recovery. The VCE showed proximal small bowel atrophy in 21 and distal atrophy in 3 patients, and 3 ulcers were seen. In this group the patients received mainly advice with a view to achieving better dietary compliance. Of the 34 newly detected celiac patients, 4 were normal, 27 proximal and 3 had distal small intestinal atrophy in the VCE. CONCLUSIONS: VCE has a definite impact on the management of refractory sprue. In the remaining patients with established celiac disease, the procedure plays a more limited role.
38593924	Nutrition assessment and management in celiac disease.	CeD is the most common immune condition affecting the gastrointestinal tract; it is triggered by gluten and the only available treatment is a strict gluten-free diet (GFD). Therefore, for patients with CeD, adopting a GFD is not a lifestyle choice. The major problem is that a GFD is restrictive, and like all restrictive diets, it has the potential for adverse nutritional outcomes, especially if adopted for a long-term. It is well known that GFD can be nutritionally inadequate and is frequently associated with vitamin and mineral deficiencies; it is, also, associated with excessive sugar and fat intake, particularly when gluten-free substitutes are consumed. Consequently, people with CeD are affected by higher rates of overweight and obesity, and metabolic complications such as fatty liver and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, assessment of nutritional status and diet quality upon diagnosis, and during long-term GFD is key in the management of CeD. This narrative review addresses nutritional considerations in CeD and management of common challenges associated with a gluten-free diet.
38914866	Transcriptomic analysis of intestine following administration of a transglutaminase 2 inhibitor to prevent gluten-induced intestinal damage in celiac disease.	Transglutaminase 2 (TG2) plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of celiac disease (CeD) by deamidating dietary gluten peptides, which facilitates antigenic presentation and a strong anti-gluten T cell response. Here, we elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the efficacy of the TG2 inhibitor ZED1227 by performing transcriptional analysis of duodenal biopsies from individuals with CeD on a long-term gluten-free diet before and after a 6-week gluten challenge combined with 100 mg per day ZED1227 or placebo. At the transcriptome level, orally administered ZED1227 effectively prevented gluten-induced intestinal damage and inflammation, providing molecular-level evidence that TG2 inhibition is an effective strategy for treating CeD. ZED1227 treatment preserved transcriptome signatures associated with mucosal morphology, inflammation, cell differentiation and nutrient absorption to the level of the gluten-free diet group. Nearly half of the gluten-induced gene expression changes in CeD were associated with the epithelial interferon-gamma response. Moreover, data suggest that deamidated gluten-induced adaptive immunity is a sufficient step to set the stage for CeD pathogenesis. Our results, with the limited sample size, also suggest that individuals with CeD might benefit from an HLA-DQ2/HLA-DQ8 stratification based on gene doses to maximally eliminate the interferon-gamma-induced mucosal damage triggered by gluten.
35635630	Impact of Celiac Disease on Dating.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: When seeking a romantic partner, individuals with celiac disease (CD) must navigate challenging social situations. We aimed to investigate dating-related behaviors in adults with CD. METHODS: A total of 11,884 affiliates of the Celiac Disease Center at Columbia University were invited to participate in an online survey. Adults (>= 18 years) with biopsy-diagnosed CD were included. Among the 5,249 who opened the email, 538 fully completed the survey (10.2%). The survey included a CD-specific dating attitudes/behaviors questionnaire, a Social Anxiety Questionnaire (SAQ), a CD-specific quality of life instrument (CD-QOL), and a CD Food Attitudes and Behaviors scale (CD-FAB). RESULTS: Respondents were primarily female (86.8%) and the plurality (24.4%) was in the 23-35 year age range. 44.3% had dated with CD, and among them, 68.4% reported that CD had a major/moderate impact on their dating life. A major/moderate impact was more commonly reported among females (69.3%, p  < 0.001), 23-35-year-olds (77.7%, p = 0.015), those with a household income < $50 K (81.7%, p = 0.019), and those with a lower CD-QOL score (50.5 vs. 73.4, p = 0.002). While on dates, 39.3% were uncomfortable explaining precautions to waiters, 28.2% engaged in riskier eating behaviors, and 7.5% intentionally consumed gluten. 39.0% of all participants were hesitant to kiss their partner because of CD; females more so than males (41.1% vs. 22.7%, p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of participants felt that CD had a major/moderate impact on their dating life. This impact may result in hesitation toward dating and kissing, decreased QOL, greater social anxiety, and less adaptive eating attitudes and behaviors. CD and the need to adhere to a gluten free diet have a major impact on dating and intimacy.
28708086	Celiac Disease Presenting with Peripheral Neuropathy in Children: A Case Report.	Background: Clinically relevant neurological manifestations in children with celiac disease (CD) are unusual, especially when they are considered as signs of the onset of the disease. In this paper, a case of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) as the first manifestation of CD in a 23-month-old child is reported. Case presentation: We describe a case of CD onset with peripheral neuropathy in a 23-month-old Bulgarian boy presenting with a sudden refusal to walk and absence of deep tendon reflexes in both lower limbs. Neurological symptoms were preceded by two months of gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting, abdominal distention, and clear signs of malnutrition and weight loss. When we evaluated the child six months after the onset of the symptoms, clinical and laboratory findings showed clear signs of peripheral neuropathy associated with malnutrition. Serum deamidated gliadin and tissue transglutaminase antibodies were therefore measured. The anti-gliadin levels were more than sixteen times higher than normal and the IgA anti-transglutaminase levels were four times higher than normal. Anti-endomysium antibodies were positive, and human leukocyte antigens (HLA) II typing confirmed a genetic predisposition to CD (DQ2 positive and DQ8 negative). Given the association between the clinical evidence of the disease and the results of the celiac screening tests, a diagnosis of CD was made without biopsy confirmation of the enteropathy. The child began a restricted gluten-free diet that led to complete recovery of the peripheral neuropathy, walking, reflexes, and overall improvement after three months on the diet. Conclusion: Our case underlines the rare but possible associations between CD and peripheral neuropathy in children as an onset symptom, even in the absence of gastrointestinal manifestations, thus suggesting that CD should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy in children. A good knowledge of the extra-intestinal manifestations of CD is essential for the rapid introduction of a gluten-free diet that could be useful for the resolution of the neurological symptoms.
25304452	[Nutritional assessment of gluten-free diet. Is gluten-free diet deficient in some nutrient?].	INTRODUCTION: The gluten-free diet has traditionally been accepted as a healthy diet, but there are articles advocating that it may have some nutritional deficiencies. The current study assesses whether there was any change in the contributions of calories, essential elements, proportion of fatty acids, vitamins, minerals and fiber in children who were diagnosed with celiac diseases, comparing the diet with gluten prior one year after diagnosis with the diet without gluten to the year of diagnosis. The level of clinical or analytical impact that nutritional deficits could have was also assessed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective,descriptive, observational study in which information was collected from a dietary survey, anthropometric and analytical data at pre-diagnosis of celiac disease and following a gluten diet and one year after celiac disease diagnosis, under gluten-free diet. RESULTS: A total of 37 patients meet the study criteria. A decrease in the intake of saturated fatty acids was found, with an increase of monounsaturated fatty acids and an increase in the intake of phosphorus in the diet without gluten. A deficient intake of vitamin D was found in both diets. Clinically, at year of gluten-free diet there was an improvement in weight and size. Analytically, there was an improvement in hemoglobin, ferritin, vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone in plasma. CONCLUSION: The gluten-free diet has minimal deficiencies, similar to those present in the diet with gluten, with an improvement in the lipid profile by increasing the proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids to the detriment of saturated fatty acids.
28232474	No difference in emergency department visits before and after transition for coeliac disease.	
24090940	Liver abnormalities in bowel diseases.	Liver abnormalities are often seen in bowel diseases. Whether these represent aspects of two separate diseases, or if one is causing the other, is not always easy to decide. Extraintestinal manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or coeliac disease are frequently observed. Of these extraintestinal manifestations, hepatic disorders are among the most common. Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and primary biliary cirrhosis are the most frequent hepatic disorders in IBD and coeliac disease, respectively. Genetic studies have lately elucidated the associations between IBD and PSC, but there is still a long way until we have complete understanding of the molecular aetiology and pathophysiology of these conditions. There is no curative treatment available for PSC, besides liver transplantation. Steatosis and cholelithiasis are also common in IBD, as are signs of hepatic injury due to IBD treatment. Less common liver abnormalities include liver abscesses, hepatic thromboembolic events, granulomatous liver disease and hepatic amyloidosis.

25014240	Predictors for Celiac Disease in Adult Cases of Duodenal Intraepithelial Lymphocytosis.	BACKGROUND: Duodenal intraepithelial lymphocytosis (D-IEL) is an early marker for celiac disease (CD). However, the majority of cases are due to non-CD-related conditions. GOALS: To identify the predictors of CD when presented with D-IEL. METHODS: A total of 215 adult patients with D-IEL had undergone prospective and systematic evaluation for CD and other recognized associations.The gold-standard diagnosis of CD was based upon the presence of HLA-DQ2 and/or DQ8, persistence or progression of D-IEL following a gluten challenge, followed by symptomatic improvement on a gluten-free diet.Binary logistic regression models, adjusting for age and sex, were subsequently performed to compare presenting variables between CD and non-CD cases, and to determine their sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). RESULTS: CD was diagnosed in 48 cases (22%) and non-CD in 167 cases (78%). There was no statistical difference in baseline demographics, clinical symptoms (ie, diarrhea, weight loss, abdominal pain), anemia, or hematinics between the CD and non-CD group.Patients with CD, in comparison with non-CD, were significantly more likely to have a positive family history of CD (21% vs. 3.6%, OR 6.73; PPV 62.5%, NPV 81%, specificity 96.4%), positive HLA-DQ status (100% vs. 49.1%; PPV 36.4%, NPV 100%, specificity 50.9%), and presence of endomysial antibody (EMA) (48% vs. 0%; PPV 100%, NPV 87%, specificity 100%); all P<=0.001.A normal tissue transglutaminase antibody (TTG) level was seen in 29.2% CD and 83.2% non-CD cases (OR 0.084, P<0.001; PPV 9.2%). There was no difference in the prevalence of TTG levels 1 to 2xupper limit of normal (ULN) between the groups (29.2% CD vs. 14.4% non-CD; PPV 33% to 38%). However, TTG levels between 3 and 20xULN were significantly more prevalent in the CD group (33.3% vs. 2.4%, PPV 66.6% to 89%), whereas a TTG>20xULN was exclusive to CD (8.3%, P<0.001, PPV 100%). CONCLUSIONS: In the setting of D-IEL, only the presence of a positive EMA or TTG>20xULN at the outset can be used to make an immediate diagnosis of CD. Gastrointestinal symptoms, family history, anemia, or other celiac serology results do not reliably distinguish CD from non-CD without further investigations.
31599434	Celiac disease in the context of airborne allergen-associated chronic vulvo-vaginitis.	We present a woman with a three-year history of severe chronic urticaria and recurrent vulvo-vaginal Candidiasis in the setting of seasonal allergic rhinitis. Her past medical history was significant only for Bell's palsy in her childhood. Her review of systems was otherwise negative (specifically: no history of diarrhea, weight loss, malabsorption, anemia, nor eczema). Extensive testing revealed seasonal sensitivities to outdoor allergens and celiac disease. Repeating the evaluation six months after initiating a wheat-free diet, her vulvo-vaginal symptoms resolved.
23751356	Inadequate nutrient intake in patients with celiac disease: results from a German dietary survey.	BACKGROUND: Currently, the only treatment for celiac disease (CD) is a lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD). Research has been carried out in various countries into the nutritional adequacy of the GFD in terms of macro- and micronutrients, mostly presenting conflicting results. However, no data for Germany are available to date. AIM: To elucidate the nutritional composition of a GFD and to compare it with non-GFD in a representative German non-CD population. METHODS AND PATIENTS: A total of 1,000 patients who were members of the German Celiac Society (DZG) were invited to fill out a prospective 7-day food diary and a questionnaire. Data from 88 patients aged 14-80 years were analyzed and compared to the DACH reference values and to data from the German National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NVS II). RESULTS: No significant difference was observed for the intake of energy and macronutrients in male celiac patients compared to the NVS II. Only the fiber intake of male patients was significantly lower than that of the general population. Female patients, however, showed a significantly higher fat intake, but lower carbohydrate consumption. The average daily micronutrient intake of male and female patients, specifically of vitamin B1, B2, B6, folic acid, magnesium and iron, was significantly lower in celiac patients compared to the NVS II. CONCLUSION: This study reveals inadequate nutrient intake by male and female celiac patients in Germany. Based on our findings, regular (laboratory) monitoring of celiac patients should be recommended.
30021413	Celiac disease in children.	Celiac disease is a common immune-mediated disease, that may present, after gluten ingestion, with various and heterogeneous symptoms that can vary according to patients' age. The diagnostic screening test is serum anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA level. In doubt cases, antiendomysium IgA and the antideamidated gliadin peptides IgG could be useful to confirm the suspicion, before a biopsy will be perform. Since 2012, guidelines have made it possible to avoid the biopsy in symptomatic pediatric patients with high levels of antitransglutaminase IgA, positivity to antiendomysium IgA, and with HLA DQ2 or DQ8. In all other cases duodenal biopsy is still mandatory to confirm the diagnosis. The therapy of celiac disease is a lifelong gluten free diet. In children prognosis of celiac disease is good, without complications. Here we review and discuss the present literature about celiac disease in childhood.
28759621	Identification of novel antibody-reactive detection sites for comprehensive gluten monitoring.	Certain cereals like wheat, rye or barley contain gluten, a protein mixture that can trigger celiac disease (CD). To make gluten-free diets available for affected individuals the gluten content of foodstuff must be monitored. For this purpose, antibody-based assays exist which rely on the recognition of certain linear gluten sequence motifs. Yet, not all CD-active gluten constituents and fragments formed during food processing/fermentation may be covered by those tests. In this study, we therefore assayed the coverage of reportedly CD-active gluten components by currently available detection antibodies and determined the antibody-inducing capacity of wheat gluten constituents in order to provide novel diagnostic targets for comprehensive gluten quantitation. Immunizations of outbred mice with purified gliadins and glutenins were conducted and the linear target recognition profile of the sera was recorded using synthetic peptide arrays that covered the sequence space of gluten constituents present in those preparations. The resulting murine immunorecognition profile of gluten demonstrated that further linear binding sites beyond those recognized by the monoclonal antibodies alpha20, R5 and G12 exist and may be exploitable as diagnostic targets. We conclude that the safety of foodstuffs for CD patients can be further improved by complementing current tests with antibodies directed against additional CD-active gluten components. Currently unrepresented linear gluten detection sites in glutenins and alpha-gliadins suggest sequences QQQYPS, PQQSFP, QPGQGQQG and QQPPFS as novel targets for antibody generation.
25428541	The significance of increased levels of end nitric oxide metabolites in blood serum of children with celiac disease.	OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to determine serum nitric oxide (NO) metabolites and correlate them to gluten-free diet (GFD) compliance, the parameters of morphological and functional condition of the small intestine in patients with celiac disease (CD) in a long-term follow-up. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 35 children (age median 8.0 years) with previously diagnosed CD, among them 15 - on a strict GFD and 20 - on a semistrict GFD. 32 patients (age median 7.5 years) with functional abdominal pain were recruited as controls. Nitrites (NO(2)), nitrates (NO(3)), total content of nitrites and nitrates (NOx) in serum were determined using the Griess reaction. CD patients underwent small intestine morphometry and absorption D-xylose test. RESULTS: Compared to the controls, the CD patients on a strict GFD had no significant differences in NO(2), NO(3), NOx content, while in patients violating GFD these parameters were significantly higher. In comparison with the patients on a strict GFD, the patients on a semistrict GFD had higher median values of NO(3) (p = 0.002) and NOx (p = 0.0000). Serum NOx correlated negatively with the height of villi (p = 0.0001), D-xylose excretion (p = 0.0063), and correlated positively with the depth of crypts (p = 0.0082) and cellular density of villi stroma (p = 0.0067). CONCLUSION: CD patients not keeping to a strict GFD have an increased level of nitric oxide metabolites in serum. NOx content is associated with morphometric parameters of the small intestine that proves the participation of NO in the pathogenesis of histological changes in CD (Tab. 3, Ref. 39).

38892641	Potential Celiac Disease in Children: Health Status on A Long-Term Gluten-Containing Diet.	Potential celiac disease (PCD) is a clinical condition characterised by the presence of a positive CD-specific serology and a normal intestinal architecture. Asymptomatic PCD patients are generally advised to continue on a gluten-containing diet (GCD), but long-term risks of this approach have never been explored. In the present study, we aimed to investigate nutritional and autoimmune complications possibly developing overtime in a cohort of asymptomatic PCD children on a GCD. We compared children's parameters of growth, nutritional status, and autoimmunity between the time of diagnosis and on the occasion of their last medical check, after a long-term gluten-containing diet. Altogether, we collected data from 171 PCD children with a mean follow-up time of 3 years (range 0.35-15.3 years). During follow-up, although patients did not reduce their amount of daily gluten intake, their anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-TG2) antibodies spontaneously and significantly decreased. Most parameters analysed had not changed during follow-up (height centile, ferritin, albumin, cholesterol, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, parathormone, and vitamin D) or even improved significantly (weight and BMI centile, haemoglobin, blood iron, HDL, glycaemia, and HbA1C, p < 0.05), always remaining within the limit of normality. Equally, autoantibodies for other concomitant autoimmune disorders did not increase overtime. Similar results were obtained excluding from analysis patients who had stopped producing anti-TG2 and those with a follow-up time < 3 years. Our pilot study has provided reassuring results regarding the maintenance of a gluten-containing diet in asymptomatic PCD children, even when long-term follow-up was considered.

36806628	Increased Risk of Hospitalization in Celiac Disease With COVID-19 Infection Is Mitigated by Vaccination.	BACKGROUND: We sought to describe clinical characteristics of celiac disease (CD) patients infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and estimate hospitalization risk, intensive care unit (ICU) requirement, mortality, and thrombosis, and the impact of vaccination on these outcomes. METHODS: We performed a single-center, retrospective cohort study comparing biopsy-proven CD patients with a matched sample of non-CD (referent) patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 2020 and January 2022. Matching ensured 2 referent patients for every 1 CD patient by age, sex, ethnicity, and COVID-19 diagnosis date. We also adjusted for general and celiac-specific comorbidity. The primary outcome was hospitalization. Secondary outcomes included ICU requirement, mortality, and thrombosis. We also compared these outcomes between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. RESULTS: We included 330 patients: 110 with CD (mean age 47 years, 83% female) and 220 matched referents. Hospitalization occurred in 27 CD patients (24%) and 25 referent patients (11%) (hazard ratio, 2.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.21-3.65; P = .009). Vaccination was associated with significantly decreased risk of hospitalization (hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.31-0.93; P = .026). Four unvaccinated CD patients and 2 unvaccinated referent patients required ICU. No mortality occurred among CD patients, and 2 referent patients died. No thrombosis occurred in either group. CONCLUSIONS: CD patients with COVID-19 have a higher risk of hospitalization compared with non-CD referents. This risk is mitigated by vaccination in CD patients as it is in non-CD referents. ICU requirement occurred only in unvaccinated CD patients, and no CD patient died. Vaccination against COVID-19 should be strongly recommended in patients with CD as it is for non-CD patients in the general population.
26541666	Massive gastrointestinal pneumatosis in a patient with celiac disease and superior mesenteric artery syndrome.	Pneumatosis intestinalis (PI) is a radiological finding representing the presence of gas in the bowell, independently of the cause or location. We present the case of a 55-year-old man who was admitted presenting two-week history of intense vomiting. The patient was previously diagnosed with superior mesenteric artery syndrome and celiac disease. Plain x-ray and TC showed gastric and intestinal pneumatosis with important retropneumoperitoneum. Due to clinical stability the patient was managed conservatively, with a favorable outcome. 
32011187	Progress in the serology-based diagnosis and management of adult celiac disease.	Introduction: This article provides a comprehensive overview of the development and application of serological tests used routinely in clinical practice for the diagnosis and management of adult celiac disease.Areas covered: We summarize existing scientific literature related to anti-endomyseal, anti-tissue transglutaminase, and anti-deamidated gliadin peptide antibodies and detail the current and potential future applications of these tests in celiac disease.Expert commentary: Current serological tests in celiac disease have some of the best performance characteristics among disease-specific tests. However, in adult celiac disease, current diagnostic algorithms still rely on duodenal biopsies to confirm the diagnosis. A 'biopsy avoidance strategy' has been implemented in pediatric celiac disease. Future high-quality studies will help inform on whether this approach can be implemented into adult gastroenterology services. It is envisaged that the next 5 years will see an increasing reliance on serology in the diagnosis of adult celiac disease.
29847393	The Experience of Living With a Gluten-Free Diet: An Integrative Review.	Celiac disease represents a problem in our society, not only because of its interest in terms of healthcare, but also because of its increasing prevalence in recent years and the impact it has on sufferers and their families. This integrative review investigated current knowledge about the experience of living with a gluten-free diet, as well as social support and the role played by nurses and/or associations in the process. A total of 18 articles were selected. Results revealed greater family support is needed to deal with the day-to-day issues of a gluten-free diet. Furthermore, women diagnosed with celiac disease have more psychological distress than men according to some studies. Sufferers of celiac disease report that more information is needed at all levels (hotel and catering, healthcare, social), which would help generate coping strategies. The few studies retrieved that talk about this topic show that following a gluten-free diet affects the personal, family, emotional, social, and financial dimensions of sufferers of celiac disease. The nurse tends to be the person whom those coping with the illness go to for support, although celiac disease associations are also a fundamental pillar in this support. Policy makers need to adapt health services to the needs of individuals with celiac disease.
34622826	Manipulation of the gut microbiome in gluten-intolerance.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Gluten is a complex mixture of highly immunogenic glutamine- and proline-rich proteins found in some cereals. In celiac disease (CeD), gluten triggers an autoimmune response due to its interaction with the human leukocyte antigen heterodimers that confer the genetic risk. The involvement of gluten in other disorders has also been investigated, but its role beyond CeD is still unclear. Here, we review the most recent evidence of the involvement of gluten in diseases and the opportunities of manipulating the gut microbiota to treat or prevent gluten-related conditions. RECENT FINDINGS: Most of the new studies have been conducted in the context of CeD, where important evidence has been gained on associations between the gut microbiota, genotype, and environmental factors such as breastfeeding and antibiotics. The role of the microbiota has been investigated in several prospective, observational and interventional studies with probiotics, which together showed that the gut microbiota could be targeted to ameliorate and aid in the prevention of CeD development. SUMMARY: Several studies have evidenced how genetic and environmental factors influence the gut microbiome with consequences in CeD. These findings could inspire the development of microbiota modulation strategies to support the prevention or treatment of CeD.
28514243	Celiac Disease Symptom Resolution: Effectiveness of the Gluten-free Diet.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of the gluten-free diet (GFD) on gastrointestinal (GI) and extra-intestinal (EI) symptom resolution and identify predictors for persistence of symptoms in all celiac patients at the University of Chicago. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review from 2002 to 2015. GI symptoms included abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, failure to thrive/weight loss, nausea, reflux, and vomiting. EI symptoms included abnormal liver enzymes, arthralgia/arthritis, dermatitis herpetiformis, alopecia, fatigue, headache, anemia, stomatitis, myalgia, psychiatric disorders, rashes, seizures, neuropathy, short stature, delayed puberty, osteoporosis, and infertility. RESULTS: A total of 554 patients (227 children) with celiac disease (CeD) were included. Abdominal pain, diarrhea and failure to thrive were the most common GI symptoms in children whereas diarrhea, bloating, and abdominal pain were most common in adults. Short stature, fatigue, and headache were the most common EI symptoms in children whereas iron deficiency anemia, fatigue, and headache/psychiatric disorders were most common in adults. Children had significantly higher rates of EI and GI symptom resolution as compared to adults, with greater rates of improvements in GI versus EI symptoms at more than 24 months. Long duration of symptoms, female sex, and non-adherence to a GFD were the most important significant predictors of failure to clinically improve. CONCLUSIONS: On a strict GFD, children report greater rates of both GI and EI symptom resolution as compared to adults with greater rates of improvement in GI over EI symptoms. Early recognition of CeD and close attention to diet adherence may help in symptom resolution.
23906112	Celiac disease: a disease with varied manifestations in adults and adolescents.	OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the characteristics of patients with celiac disease and differences between those who presented during adolescence or adulthood. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the case records of 233 consecutive patients with celiac disease who were diagnosed at 12-18 years or >18 years of age. The diagnosis of celiac disease was made on the basis of the modified European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition criteria. RESULTS: The diagnosis of celiac disease was made after 18 years of age in 153 (65.7%) patients. Median duration of symptoms at the diagnosis was 54 months (range 1 month to 29 years). In all, 103 (44.2%) patients with atypical manifestations were referred by other departments for evaluation. Chronic diarrhea (48.5%), short stature (27.0%) and chronic anemia (9.0%) were the common modes of presentation. Elevated level of aminotransaminase were present in 50 (24.3%) patients. Chronic diarrhea, hypocalcemia and hypoalbuminemia were present in significantly higher number of adult than adolescent patients. In all, 227 (97.4%) patients responded to a 6-month gluten-free diet and six non-responders were non-compliant. CONCLUSIONS: More than 40% of the patients with celiac disease present to clinicians other than gastroenterologists or internists with atypical manifestations. A high index of suspicion is required for diagnosing its variant forms.

30540725	[Anti-transglutaminase antibody in adults with celiac disease and their relation to the presence and duration of gluten-free diet].	IgA anti-transglutaminase 2 (tTG2) antibody is a relevant marker in celiac disease. The utility of IgA anti-tTG2 determination is well established for the diagnosis, however their use in the follow-up of patients with gluten free diet (GFD) it is not fully established. OBJECTIVE: To determine IgA anti-tTG2 antibody levels in adult Paraguayan celiac disease patients and its relation to the presence and duration of the GFD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult celiac disease patients without (n=23) or with (n=49) GFD were included in this observational, descriptive, cross-sectional study with analytical component. IgA anti-tTG2 antibody serum levels were analyzed by ELISA. RESULTS: All (100%) celiac disease patients without GFD had positive anti-tTG2 IgA. Serum levels of IgA anti-tTG2 were significantly elevated in celiac disease patients without GFD compared to levels in patients with GFD. 35% of patients treated with GFD (diet average duration = 5.7 years) had positive (29%) or indeterminate (6%) levels of IgA anti-tTG2. In terms of GFD duration we observed that while the GFD period increased, antibody levels decreased (r=- 0.2963; p=0.0387). CONCLUSION: IgA anti-tTG2 antibody levels correlated inversely with the GFD duration. However, positive levels of these antibodies persisted in some patients, even several years after the onset of GFD.
34375376	Probiotic Use in Celiac Disease: Results from a National Survey.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Patients with celiac disease (CD) commonly use supplements for perceived health benefits despite scant evidence. We aimed to characterize the prevalence and predictors of probiotic use among CD patients. METHODS: We analyzed data from iCureCeliac ; a patient-powered research network questionnaire distributed by the Celiac Disease Foundation. We included adults with self-reported CD who answered questions regarding demographics, diagnosis, symptoms, and treatment. We compared probiotic users versus probiotic non-users and subsequently performed multivariable logistic regression, assessing for independent predictors of probiotic use. RESULTS: 4,909 patients met the criteria for inclusion in the study. Of these, 1,160 (23.6%) responded to a question regarding probiotic use. The mean age of participants was 38.8 years and 82% were female. 381 patients (33%) reported using probiotics. More probiotic users sought nutritional counseling at time of diagnosis (36% vs. 30%, p=0.05) and remained symptomatic despite a gluten-free diet (40% vs. 25%, p <0.001). Probiotic users had lower scores on the pain subscale of the SF36 (63.7+-21.6 vs. 69.5+-22.1, p=0.006). On multivariable analysis, patients diagnosed after age 50 (OR=2.04, 95%CI: 1.37-3.04), and those with persistent symptoms despite a gluten-free diet (OR=1.94, 95%CI: 1.44-2.63) were more likely to use probiotics. CONCLUSION: In this large study of a national CD registry, roughly one-third of CD patients reported using probiotics. Patients diagnosed later in life were more likely to use probiotics and those who remained symptomatic despite a gluten-free diet were twice as likely to take probiotics. Patients may be seeking additional means of treatment for persistent symptoms.
34274255	Antitissue transglutaminase antibodies' normalization after starting a gluten-free diet in a large population of celiac children-a real-life experience.	INTRODUCTION: Few data are available regarding the trend of IgA anti-transglutaminase antibodies (TGA-IgA) in children with celiac disease (CD) on a gluten-free diet (GFD). Our aim is to examine the normalization time of CD serology in a large pediatric population, and its predictors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the normalization time of TGA-IgA and its predictive factors (age, sex, ethnicity, symptoms, associated diabetes/thyroiditis, Marsh stage, TGA-IgA and endomysial antibody levels at diagnosis, diet adherence), in 1024 children diagnosed from 2000 to 2019 in three pediatric Italian centers, on a GFD. RESULTS: TGA-IgA remission was reached in 67,3%, 80,7%, 89,8% and 94,9% after 12, 18, 24 and 36 months from starting a GFD, respectively (median time = 9 months). TGA-IgA >10 upper limit of normal at diagnosis (HR = 0.56), age 7-12 years old (HR = 0.83), poor compliance to diet (HR = 0.69), female sex (HR = 0.82), non-Caucasian ethnicity (HR = 0.75), and comorbidities (HR = 0.72) were independent factors significantly associated with longer time to normalization. CONCLUSIONS: Our population is the largest in the literature, with the majority of patients normalizing CD serology within 24 months from starting a GFD. We suggest a special attention to patients with comorbidities, language barriers or age 7-12 years for a proper management and follow-up.
34510390	"The Gluten-Free Diet and Its Relationship with Metabolic Syndrome: Dietary Friend or Foe?"	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Celiac disease (CD) is a prevalent digestive illness as well as a budding area of research in the field of gastroenterology. While investigations are underway to find new and improved pharmacological therapies for CD, the gluten-free diet (GFD) remains the only option to effectively manage the condition. RECENT FINDINGS: While the GFD is recommended for patients diagnosed with CD and other gluten-related conditions, studies show the number of individuals on the GFD surpasses the projected number of patients with these medical indications (1). The implications of widespread adoption of this dietary approach are still being determined, with many patients believing this diet will improve overall health and cardiovascular risk. This review analyzes the relationship between a GFD and metabolic syndrome in both non-celiac and celiac patients, concluding that although the diet may slightly improve overall cardiac risk factors, weight, and/or insulin resistance, its use in the absence of a gluten-related disorder is controversial.
27186700	Is compliance with gluten-free diet sufficient? Diet composition of celiac patients.	This study was planned to investigate the amount and content of foods consumed by child patients with celiac disease on a long-term gluten-free diet. Children aged 3-18 years who were diagnosed with celiac disease according to ESPGHAN criteria and were compliant to the gluten-free diet for at least one year were included. Age and gender matched healthy children were included as the control group. Food consumption records including the amount and content of the foods consumed for a total of three days were obtained. Once the records had been completed on the food consumption form, quantity analysis was again performed by the same dietician. Energy and other nutritional elements taken in through foodstuffs consumed by the patient and control groups were calculated using the Nutrition Data System for Research Package; these results were shown as mean +- standard deviation (x +-SD) and the values compared. The study consisted of 28 patients with a mean age of 10.3 +- 4.6 and 25 healthy controls with a mean age of 9.5 +- 3.4. Average age at diagnosis in the patient group was 6.7 +- 4.3 and mean duration of gluten-free diet was 4.0 +- 3.3 years. Children with celiac disease on a gluten-free diet had significantly lower daily energy intake levels compared to the healthy controls (p<0.05). The proportional fat consumption was significantly higher in the patient group compared to the controls (p<0.05). Moreover, proportional carbohydrate and protein, vitamin E and vitamin B1, and microelements such as magnesium, phosphorus and zinc consumptions were significantly lower in celiac group with respect to v-control group. Solely determining compliance to the gluten free diet might be inadequate in the follow-up of children with celiac disease, adequacy of the nutritional content in terms of macro and micronutrients of celiac disease patients is also important. 
31581546	Nutritional Status in Spanish Children and Adolescents with Celiac Disease on a Gluten Free Diet Compared to Non-Celiac Disease Controls.	Patients who follow a gluten-free diet (GFD) may be prone to nutritional deficiencies, due to food restriction and consumption of gluten-free products. The aim was to assess nutritional status in celiac children and adolescents on a long-term GFD. A cross-sectional age and gender-matched study in 70 celiac and 67 non-celiac volunteers was conducted, using dietary, anthropometric, biochemical parameters, and assessing bone mineral density and physical activity. Adequacy of vitamin D intake to recommendations was very low, in both groups, and intakes for calcium and magnesium were significantly lower in celiac volunteers. Celiac children and adolescents may have a higher risk of iron and folate deficiencies. Both groups followed a high-lipid, high-protein, low fiber diet. Median vitamin D plasma levels fell below reference values, in celiac and non-celiac participants, and were significantly lower in celiac girls. Other biochemical parameters were within normal ranges. Anthropometry and bone mineral density were similar within groups. With the exception of some slightly lower intakes, children and adolescents following a GFD appear to follow the same trends as healthy individuals on a normal diet. No effect of food restriction or gluten-free product consumption was observed.
25917520	Gut microbiome, gut function, and probiotics: Implications for health.	New insights from a rapidly developing field of research have ushered in a new era of understanding of the complexity of host-microbe interactions within the human body. The paradigm shift from culturing to metagenomics has provided an insight into the complex diversity of the microbial species that we harbor, revealing the fact that we are in fact more microbes than human cells. The largest consortium of these microbes resides in the gut and is called the gut microbiota. This new science has expanded the ability to document shifts in microbial populations to an unparalleled degree. It is now understood that signals from the microbiota provide trophic, nutritional, metabolic, and protective effects for the development and maintenance of the host digestive, immune, and neuroendocrine system. Evidence linking changes in the gut microbiota to gastrointestinal and extraintestinal disorders like irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, diabetes, and celiac disease have begun to emerge recently. Probiotics act through diverse mechanisms positively affecting the composition and/or function of the commensal microbiota and alter host immunological responses. Well-controlled intervention trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analysis provide convincing evidence for the benefit of probiotics in prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal as well as extraintestinal disorders. 
24451308	Celiac disease and overweight in children: an update.	The clinical presentation of celiac disease in children is very variable and differs with age. The prevalence of atypical presentations of celiac disease has increased over the past 2 decades. Several studies in adults and children with celiac disease indicate that obesity/overweight at disease onset is not unusual. In addition, there is a trend towards the development of overweight/obesity in celiac patients who strictly comply with a gluten-free diet. However, the pathogenesis and clinical implications of the coexistence of classic malabsorption (e.g., celiac disease) and overweight/obesity remain unclear. This review investigated the causes and main clinical factors associated with overweight/obesity at the diagnosis of celiac disease and clarified whether gluten withdrawal affects the current trends of the nutritional status of celiac disease patients. 
37764795	The Gluten-Free Diet for Celiac Disease: Critical Insights to Better Understand Clinical Outcomes.	The gluten-free diet (GFD) remains a complex paradigm in managing celiac disease (CeD) in children and adults, and there are many reasons why GFD adherence should be strict to improve outcomes. However, this is a challenging task for patients, since they need to have access to quality healthcare resources that facilitate optimal GFD adherence. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the GFD, tackling coexisting nutritional deficiencies, and dealing with complex situations, such as seronegative CeD or non-responsive CeD, all require the involvement of a multidisciplinary team. The short- and long-term follow-up of CeD patients should preferably be performed by a combined Gastroenterology and Nutrition service with well-defined quality standards and the multidisciplinary involvement of physicians, nurses, dietitians, and psychologists. Nutritional advice and counseling by an experienced dietitian can reduce the costs associated with long-term follow-up of CeD patients. Likewise, psychological interventions may be essential in specific scenarios where implementing and sustaining a lifelong GFD can cause a significant psychological burden for patients. This manuscript aims to provide guidelines to improve clinical practice in the follow-up and monitoring of CeD patients and provide information on the nutritional risks of an ill-advised GFD. Clinicians, biochemists, food technologists, dietitians, and psychologists with a global view of the disease have been involved in its writing.
33743925	Indications, Contraindications, and Considerations for Video Capsule Endoscopy.	Video capsule endoscopy is indicated in a broad range of clinical settings, most commonly in evaluating suspected small bowel bleeding. It is also useful in diagnosing Crohn's disease and monitoring patients with known Crohn's. Video capsule endoscopy has a role in evaluating patients with refractory celiac disease symptoms and in surveying patients with polyposis syndromes. The only absolute contraindication to video capsule endoscopy is luminal gastrointestinal tract obstruction. Despite manufacturer statement, video capsule endoscopy can be used safely in patients with implantable cardiac devices including pacemakers, defibrillators, and ventricular assist devices.
21978547	[Gluten-free diet for children].	Children with celiac disease do not share the same risks as adults, and should have an adapted diet and a prolonged follow-up until adulthood. The following indications seem reasonable: in symptomatic children and adults, gluten free diet during several years in children and for the entire life in adults; in children becoming "silent", without any clinical or biological signs of malnutrition, discussion of coming back to normal diet, under the condition a strict follow-up and restarting gluten free diet at age of 25 and/or in case of pregnancy, to prevent the complications of celiac disease in adulthood; prolonged follow-up for adolescents and young adults returned to a "latent" disease.
26538207	Features and Progression of Potential Celiac Disease in Adults.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Individuals with potential celiac disease have serologic and genetic markers of the disease with little or no damage to the small intestinal mucosa. We performed a prospective study to learn more about disease progression in these people. METHODS: We collected data from 77 adults (59 female; median age, 33 years) diagnosed with potential celiac disease (on the basis of serology and HLA type) at Bologna University in Italy from 2004 through 2013. The subjects had normal or slight inflammation of the small intestinal mucosa. Clinical, laboratory, and histologic parameters were evaluated at diagnosis and during a 3-year follow-up period. RESULTS: Sixty-one patients (46 female; median age, 36 years) showed intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms, whereas the remaining 16 (13 female; median age, 21 years) were completely asymptomatic at diagnosis. All subjects tested positive for immunoglobulin A endomysial antibody and tissue transglutaminase antibody, except for 1 patient with immunoglobulin A deficiency; 95% of patients were carriers of HLA-DQ2. Duodenal biopsies from 26% patients had a Marsh score of 0, and 74% had a Marsh score of 1. A higher proportion of symptomatic patients had autoimmune disorders (36%) and antinuclear antibodies (41%) than asymptomatic patients (5% and 12.5%, respectively), and symptomatic patients were of older age at diagnosis (P < .05). Gluten withdrawal led to significant clinical improvement in all 61 symptomatic patients. The 16 asymptomatic patients continued on gluten-containing diets, and only 1 developed mucosal flattening; levels of anti-endomysial and tissue transglutaminase antibodies fluctuated in 5 of these patients or became undetectable. CONCLUSIONS: In a 3-year study of adults with potential celiac disease, we found most to have symptoms, but these improved on gluten withdrawal. Conversely, we do not recommend a gluten-free diet for asymptomatic adults with potential celiac disease because they do not tend to develop villous atrophy.
23212516	Phase 1 trial of IL-15 trans presentation blockade using humanized Mikbeta1 mAb in patients with T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia.	In the present study, Hu-Mikbeta1, a humanized mAb directed at the shared IL-2/IL-15Rbeta subunit (CD122) was evaluated in patients with T-cell large granular lymphocytic (T-LGL) leukemia. Hu-Mikbeta1 blocked the trans presentation of IL-15 to T cells expressing IL-2/IL-15Rbeta and the common gamma-chain (CD132), but did not block IL-15 action in cells that expressed the heterotrimeric IL-15 receptor in cis. There was no significant toxicity associated with Hu-Mikbeta1 administration in patients with T-LGL leukemia, but no major clinical responses were observed. One patient who had previously received murine Mikbeta1 developed a measurable Ab response to the infused Ab. Nevertheless, the safety profile of this first in-human study of the humanized mAb to IL-2/IL-15Rbeta (CD122) supports its evaluation in disorders such as refractory celiac disease, in which IL-15 and its receptor have been proposed to play a critical role in the pathogenesis and maintenance of disease activity.
22847283	Adolescents with celiac disease: a literature review of the impact developmental tasks have on adherence with a gluten-free diet.	Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease affecting individuals at any time across the developmental lifespan. The only treatment for celiac disease is lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet to prevent future complications and malignancies. The ratio of occurrence between children and adolescents is 1:104. When the phase of adolescence is coalesced with having celiac disease, normal developmental tasks become more challenging, therefore impacting adherence with the gluten-free diet. An abundance of both qualitative and quantitative studies from the Netherlands, Europe, and Canada focusing on adolescents with celiac disease and adherence to the gluten-free diet was found in the literature. Conversely, in the United States, there was a dearth of literature examining adolescents diagnosed with celiac disease, their adherence to a gluten-free diet, and their lived experience of having celiac disease. The relevance to nursing practice and recommendations for future research are discussed in light of these findings.
29782665	Dietitian visits were a safe and cost-effective form of follow-up care for children with celiac disease.	AIM: This study compared follow-up protocols for paediatric celiac disease (CD) led by either paediatricians or dietitians at Swedish university hospitals. METHODS: We followed 363 CD patients under 18 years at the university hospitals in Malmo (n = 140) and Lund (n = 79) between 2011 and 2013 and after they merged to become Skane (n = 144) between 2014 and 2016. Both Lund and Malmo provided regular paediatrician follow-up visits, whereas Skane provided mainly dietitian-led visits. RESULTS: Children at Lund were followed for a mean of 1.0 +- 0.5 visits per year, compared to 0.7 +- 0.6 at Malmo (p < 0.0001) and 0.9 +- 0.6 at Skane (p = 0.11). The ratio of annual paediatrician to dietitian annual visits was 1.4:1.0 at Lund, which was higher than Malmo (0.9:1.0; p = 0.0017) and Skane (0.6:1.0; p < 0.0001). There was no difference in the prevalence of non-compliant patients between the clinics (p = 0.26, Malmo 13.6%, Lund 10.1%, Skane 7.6%). Tissue transglutaminase autoantibody levels reversed equally over time at all three clinics after the subjects started a gluten-free diet (r = -0.55, p < 0.0001). The total mean annual cost per patient was lowest at Malmo and highest at Lund (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Dietary compliance was similar regardless of whether care was provided by a dietitian or paediatrician. Dietitian-led follow-up visits may provide lower long-term costs.
38874216	SELF-REPORTED NON-CELIAC GLUTEN SENSITIVITY IN ITALIAN YOUNG ADULTS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY. A DIETARY FAD?	OBJECTIVES: In different countries, the exact prevalence of people that refer symptoms after gluten ingestion is increasing and the unavailability of reliable laboratory tests to diagnose the condition known as non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) has opened the door to the spread of survey-based studies to hypothesize a prevalence of this condition with highly discordant results. We aim to describe the attitude toward gluten consumption in a large population of young adults in Italy. METHODS: A questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was conducted in thirteen Italian cities to investigate the dietary attitudes of more than 9400 people distributed throughout the country about gluten consumption. Only those referring to gluten-related symptoms with a frequency equal to "always" or "most of the time" were considered self-reported NCGS (SR-NCGS) patients. RESULTS: Five thousand two hundred and thirty-four of 9432 eligible participants (55.5%) fully completed the questionnaire. Excluding those with previous gastrointestinal diagnoses of celiac disease and wheat allergy, we have finally analyzed 4987 questionnaires. Four hundred and eighty-seven participants indicated gluten-related symptoms "always" or "most of the time" (SR-NCGS subjects), while 121 already had a medical diagnosis of NCGS. The minimum prevalence figure of SR-NCGS is 6.4% (95%CI: 6.0-6.9), with a higher prevalence in females (79.9%). The most frequent gluten-related symptoms were bloating, abdominal pain and tiredness. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of people reporting symptoms after gluten ingestion requires that the diagnosis of NCGS should be ascertained with a double-blind controlled study to limit the number of people who improperly approach a gluten-free diet.
23964145	Diagnostic accuracy of a new point-of-care screening assay for celiac disease.	AIM: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of a new point-of-care assay detecting anti-deamidated gliadin peptides in celiac disease (CD) patients. METHODS: One-hundred-and-twelve patients (age range: 1.8-79.2 years old) with clinical symptoms suggestive of CD and/or first-degree relatives (FDR) of CD patients (n = 66), and confirmed CD on a gluten-free diet (GFD) (n = 46), were prospectively enrolled in the study at Gastroenterology outpatient clinics for adult patients and from the Gastroenterology Consultation Ward at the Pediatric Department of the University Hospital of Geneva. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects enrolled. The study received approval from the local ethics committee. The original CD diagnosis had been based on serum-positive IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (QuantaLite , Inova Diagnostics, San Diego, CA, United States) and on biopsy results. Serum samples from all study participants were tested by the new CD lateral flow immunochromatographic assay (CD-LFIA) device, Simtomax  Blood Drop (Augurix SA, BioArk, Monthey, Switzerland) to detect immunoglobulin (Ig)A and IgG antibodies against deamidated gliadin peptides. The diagnostic performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves with 95%CIs. A cut-off of 2 on the Rann colorimetric scale was used to calculate the device's sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: CD-LFIA was highly accurate in detecting untreated celiac patients. In the group of patients with CD symptoms and/or FDR, eight new cases of CD were detected by ELISA and biopsy. All of these new cases were also correctly identified by CD-LFIA. The test yielded four false positive and four false negative results. The false positive results were all within the groups with clinical symptoms suggestive of CD and/or FDR, whereas the false negative results were all within the GFD group. The test yeld a sensitivity of 78.9% (95%CI: 54.4-93.9) and specificity of 95.7% (95%CI: 89.4-98.8), and the area under the curve reached 0.893 (95%CI: 0.798-0.988). The Kappa coefficient, calculated according to the values obtained by two readers from the same device, was of 0.96 (SE: 0.06). When the GFD patients were excluded from the analysis, the area under the curve reached 0.989 (95%CI: 0.971-1.000) and the Kappa coefficient, calculated according to the values obtained by two readers from the same device, became 0.96 (SE: 0.07). Furthermore, using the Rann scale cut-off of 2 without the GFD patients, sensitivity was 100% and specificity was 93.1% (95%CI: 83.3-98.1). CONCLUSION: The new CD-LFIA rapid screening test shows good diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, and may rule out CD in patients with CD-related symptoms.
24471897	Celiac disease and dysfunctional uterine bleeding; the efficiency of gluten free diet.	The aim of this study was to investigate the relation between Celiac disease (CD) and unexplained dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) in celiac women. The celiac patients were selected from women who were referred to celiac department. Controls were selected from those women without any signs of celiac disease and matched with age. Meanwhile, a trained physician was ready to explain the study, and then in case of their allowance, a questionnaire was completed by the physician. 24 % of celiac women reported a past history of at least one menstrual cycle disorder vs 10 % of controls reported these problems (p=0.038) and higher percentage of unexplained DUB has been observed in celiac women. All celiac patients were undertaking gluten free diet for at least 3 months and the celiac patients who reported the history of DUB were again interviewed for any signs of unexplained DUB. From 12 celiac women with DUB, 10 patients reported no more unexplained DUB after getting gluten-free diet (83.3 %). The occurrence of a significant correlation between CD and DUB suggests the possibility of considering CD as one of the potential causes of abnormal uterine bleeding. Therefore, celiac disease must be seriously considered in the screening of patients with reproductive disorders (Tab. 2,Ref. 23).
30897589	Identifying True Celiac Disease and Wheat Allergy in the Era of Fashion Driven Gluten-Free Diets.	BACKGROUND: Diagnosing both celiac disease (CD) and wheat allergy (WA) might be challenging due to the increasingly popular gluten-free diets. OBJECTIVES: This study investigates the value of anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA (tTGIgA) and wheat-specific IgE (WIgE), and identifies clinical and serological features associated with CD and WA. METHOD: Serological markers of autoimmunity and allergy along with medical charts of patients assessed for tTGIgA and WIgE between 2010 and 2016 were evaluated. RESULTS: During the last years, an increasing number of patients have been tested for tTGIgA, while the number of positive results decreased linearly. Among the 2,965 patients included, 128 patients showed at least once a positive tTGIgA. All patients with tTGIgA levels higher than the 12-fold upper normal limit had CD. The ratio of tTGIgA/total IgA did not perform better as a diagnostic test for CD compared to tTGIgA. tTGIgA and anti-nuclear antibodies were significantly associated. WA was only rarely investigated, particularly in adults. However, positive WIgE were found in nearly 50% of the cases. WIgE and tTGIgA values were negatively correlated. CONCLUSIONS: tTGIgA were increasingly tested, while the rate of positive results decreased in recent years, possibly reflecting the impact of current alimentary trends on clinical practice. Associated autoimmune disease was frequently found in CD. High levels of tTGIgA accurately predicted CD diagnosis. WA was rarely investigated and deserves more attention, in particular in children with atopic background. WA does not seem to be associated with CD.
22487575	Celiac disease: Obesity in celiac disease.	
27245762	Evaluation of a Modified Italian European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition Food Frequency Questionnaire for Individuals with Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND: To date, it is unclear whether individuals with celiac disease following a gluten-free (GF) diet for several years have adequate intake of all recommended nutrients. Lack of a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) for individuals with celiac disease could be partly responsible for this still-debated issue. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to evaluate the performance of a modified European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) FFQ in estimating nutrient and food intake in a celiac population. DESIGN: In a cross-sectional study, the dietary habits of individuals with celiac disease were reported using a modified Italian EPIC FFQ and were compared to a 7-day weighed food record as a reference method. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: A total of 200 individuals with histologically confirmed celiac disease were enrolled in the study between October 2012 and August 2014 at the Center for Prevention and Diagnosis of Celiac Disease (Milan, Italy). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Nutrient and food category intake were calculated by 7-day weighed food record using an Italian food database integrated with the nutrient composition of 60 GF foods and the modified EPIC FFQ, in which 24 foods were substituted with GF foods comparable for energy and carbohydrate content. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: An evaluation of the modified FFQ compared to 7-day weighed food record in assessing the reported intake of nutrient and food groups was conducted using Spearman's correlation coefficients and weighted kappa. RESULTS: One hundred individuals completed the study. The Spearman's correlation coefficients of FFQ and 7-day weighed food record ranged from .13 to .73 for nutrients and from .23 to .75 for food groups. A moderate agreement, which was defined as a weighted kappa value of .40 to .60, was obtained for 30% of the analyzed nutrients, and 40% of the nutrients showed values between .30 and .40. The weighted kappa exceeded .40 for 60% of the 15 analyzed food groups. CONCLUSIONS: The modified EPIC FFQ demonstrated moderate congruence with a weighed food record in ranking individuals by dietary intakes, particularly food groups.
22126672	Gluten-free diet and autoimmune thyroiditis in patients with celiac disease. A prospective controlled study.	OBJECTIVE: Early diagnosis and dietary treatment with a gluten-free diet might slow down the progression of associated autoimmune diseases in celiac disease, but the data are contradictory. We investigated the course of autoimmune thyroid diseases in newly diagnosed celiac disease patients before and after gluten-free dietary treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-seven consecutive adults with newly diagnosed celiac disease were investigated at the time of diagnosis and after 1 year on gluten-free diet. Earlier diagnosed and subclinical autoimmune thyroid diseases were recorded and examined. Thyroid gland volume and echogenicity were measured by ultrasound. Autoantibodies against celiac disease and thyroiditis, and thyroid function tests were determined. For comparison, 27 non-celiac controls on normal gluten-containing diet were examined. RESULTS: At the time of diagnosis, the celiac disease patients had more manifest (n = 7) or subclinical (n = 3) thyroid diseases than the controls (10/27 vs. 3/27, p = 0.055). During the follow-up, the thyroid volume decreased significantly in the patients with celiac disease compared with the controls, indicating the progression of thyroid gland atrophy despite the gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: Celiac patients had an increased risk of thyroid autoimmune disorders. A gluten-free diet seemed not to prevent the progression of autoimmune process during a follow-up of 1 year.
31905394	Celiac Disease.	Gluten-related disorders, including celiac disease, wheat allergy, and nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), are increasingly reported worldwide. Celiac disease is caused by an immune-mediated reaction to ingested gluten in genetically susceptible persons. NCGS is largely a diagnosis of exclusion when other causes of symptoms have been ruled out. All patients with celiac disease should be referred to a registered dietitian nutritionist with expertise in celiac disease and a gastroenterologist who specializes in celiac disease and malabsorptive disorders, and they should remain on a strict gluten-free diet indefinitely. This article provides an overview of gluten- and wheat-related disorders.
33767095	Persisting Villous Atrophy and Adherence in Celiac Disease: What Does the Patient Want? What Should a Clinician Advise?	ABSTRACT: Adherence to a gluten-free diet in celiac disease remains challenging. Clinicians may view mucosal healing as crucial. From the patient's perspective, avoidance of an invasive upper endoscopy may be desirable. A fundamental misconception is that noninvasive tools including symptoms, serology, dietary adherence questionnaires, and novel gluten immunogenic peptides may detect ongoing villous atrophy rather than assess adherence. Duodenal biopsies are the only reliable method for assessment of mucosal healing-however, we as clinicians should provide patients with the uncertainties of this approach allowing them to make an informed decision on an individual basis.
28408006	A Novel Patient-Derived Conceptual Model of the Impact of Celiac Disease in Adults: Implications for Patient-Reported Outcome and Health-Related Quality-of-Life Instrument Development.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is a chronic inflammatory condition with wide ranging effects on individual's lives caused by a combination of symptoms and the burden of adhering to a gluten-free diet (GFD). OBJECTIVES: To further understand patients' experience of celiac disease, the impact it has on health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and to develop a conceptual model describing this impact. METHODS: Adults with celiac disease on a GFD reporting symptoms within the previous 3 months were included; patients with refractory celiac disease and confounding medical conditions were excluded. A semistructured discussion guide was developed exploring celiac disease symptoms and impact on patients' HRQOL. An experienced interviewer conducted in-depth interviews. The data set was coded and analyzed using thematic analysis to identify concepts, themes, and the inter-relationships between them. Data saturation was monitored and concepts identified formed the basis of the conceptual model. RESULTS: Twenty-one participants were recruited, and 32 distinct gluten-related symptoms were reported and data saturation was reached. Analysis identified several themes impacting patients' HRQOL: fears and anxiety, day-to-day management of celiac disease, physical functioning, sleep, daily activities, social activities, emotional functioning, and relationships. The conceptual model highlights the main areas of impact and the relationships between concepts. CONCLUSIONS: Both symptoms and maintaining a GFD have a substantial impact on patient functioning and HRQOL in adults with celiac disease. The conceptual model derived from these data may help to design future patient-reported outcomes as well as interventions to improve the quality of life in an individual with celiac disease.
21796607	[Neurological disorders associated with gluten sensitivity].	Gluten sensitivity is a systemic autoimmune disease that occurs in genetically susceptible individuals on ingesting gluten. It can appear at any age, then becoming a permanent condition. It is more frequent in women, as happens with other autoimmune diseases. Celiac disease is the intestinal form and the most important manifestation among a set of gluten-induced autoimmune pathologies that affect different systems. Neurological manifestations of gluten sensitivity, with or without enteropathy, are also frequent, their pathogenesis including an immunological attack on the central and peripheral nervous tissue accompanied by neurodegenerative changes. The clinical manifestations are varied, but the most common syndromes are cerebellar ataxia and peripheral neuropathy. Finally, gluten sensitivity is associated to a varying degree, with other complex diseases and could influence their evolution. The early detection of cases of gluten sensitivity with neurological manifestations and subsequent treatment with the gluten-free diet could provide remarkable benefits to the patients.
31094177	Celiac disease associated with ulcerative colitis.	The article provides clinical observation of a patient who was diagnosed with celiac disease when he was 52 years (Marsh stage IIIB). Following gluten-free diet (GFD) clinical remission and restoration of small intestinal mucosa (SIM) structure occurred, however in 6 years ulcerative colitis developed and an impairment of SIM morphological structure was identified (Marsh stage IIIA). Ulcerative colitis and celiac disease remission is supported by GFD, anti-cytokine therapy (adalimumab) in combination with mesalazine.
21261730	Prevalence and clinical profile of celiac disease in type 1 diabetes mellitus in north India.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: There is scanty data on the occurrence of celiac disease in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus in South Asia. Our aim was to study the prevalence and clinical profile of celiac disease in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus in a tertiary care referral centre in north India. METHODS: Consecutive patients of type 1 diabetes mellitus attending the Endocrine clinic of our institute between January 2002 and December 2008 were screened using anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTGAb), and those positive were subjected to duodenal biopsy. Clinical profile of these patients was recorded. RESULTS: Out of 189 patients of type 1 diabetes mellitus, 21 (11.1%) were diagnosed to have celiac disease on the basis of positive serology (tTGAb) and duodenal histology. The mean age at diagnosis of diabetes was 10.81 +- 7.3 years and that of celiac disease was 13.74 +- 5.71 years, with a difference of 5.18 +- 4.75 years between the two. Only 2/21 patients with celiac disease had been diagnosed before detection of diabetes mellitus. Short stature was the commonest (52.3%) manifestation of celiac disease, followed by anemia (47.3), weight loss (42.8%), diarrhea (28.6%) and abdominal pain (14.2%). After initiating gluten free diet, 14/16 symptomatic patients had reversal of anemia, weight loss and diarrhea. Growth rate velocity improved from 2.3 +- 1.0 cm/year to 5.5 +- 2.4 cm/year in those with short stature. CONCLUSION: Celiac disease is highly prevalent in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (11.1%) and majority of them (90.5%) were diagnosed on screening. Routine screening is required for early diagnosis and combat associated co-morbidities.
24825274	Axonal and demyelinating polyneuropathy associated with celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: The involvement of the peripheral nervous system in children with celiac disease is rare. CASE CHARACTERISTICS: A 15- year- old girl affected by celiac disease, who presented with an acute polyneuropathy after accidental reintroduction of gluten in her diet. OBSERVATION: Neurological examination suggested asymmetric weakness of both legs distally. Anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies were positive. Nerve conduction studies were consistent with a sensory-motor demyelinating peripheral neuropathy. OUTCOME: Symptoms improved spontaneously on a gluten-free diet. MESSAGE: Polyneuropathy may occur as a complication of celiac disease in childhood.

27306936	Clinical Characteristics and the Dietary Response in Celiac Disease Patients Presenting With or Without Anemia.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: It remains unclear as to what are the clinical characteristics associated with the presence of anemia at celiac disease diagnosis, and how these are affected by a gluten-free diet. We investigated these issues in a prospective study. METHODS: Clinical and demographic data, small-bowel mucosal histology, serology, and laboratory parameters, body mass index (BMI), and bone mineral density (BMD) both at diagnosis and after 1 year on a gluten-free diet were investigated in 163 adults with celiac disease. Gastrointestinal symptoms and psychological well-being were evaluated by validated Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale and Psychological General Well-Being questionnaires. All study variables were compared between participants with and without anemia at celiac disease diagnosis. RESULTS: Altogether, 23% of the patients had anemia at diagnosis. Anemic patients were more often women (P=0.001) and had more gastrointestinal symptoms (P=0.004) and were less often screen detected (P=0.009). Further, they had higher celiac antibody values (P=0.007) and a lower total iron (P<0.001), BMI (P=0.003), and density of mucosal gammadelta+ intraepithelial lymphocytes (P=0.033). After 1 year on a gluten-free diet, the anemia group had a lower mucosal villous height-crypt depth ratio (P=0.008) and BMI (P=0.050), and higher antibody values (P=0.012) and densities of CD3 (P=0.008) and alphabeta+ intraepithelial lymphocytes (P=0.022). There was no significant difference between the groups in their bone mineral density, Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale and Psychological General Well-Being. CONCLUSIONS: Celiac patients with anemia had more severe disease than nonanemic patients in terms of the serology and a lower BMI. Further, they evinced a slower histologic response to the dietary treatment. An early diagnosis and careful follow-up are important in these patients.
31422546	The evolution of celiac disease publications: a holistic approach with bibliometric analysis.	BACKGROUND: Despite the increasing number of publications on celiac disease, there is a lack of studies that made a holistic bibliometric evaluation of the studies on this topic. AIMS: The purpose of this study is to analyze the publications about celiac disease by using bibliometric methods and this way to demonstrate the celiac disease-related trends, top effective articles, journals, and international collaborations between the countries and institutions. METHODS: All articles published between 1980 and 2018 on celiac disease were downloaded from Web of Science and analyzed with bibliometric methods. The correlations between economic development and publication productivity of the countries were investigated with Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Linear regression analysis was used to estimate the number of publications and citations. RESULTS: The literature review showed that there were 6545 articles about celiac disease published between the years 1980 and 2018. The top productive country that produced most publications about celiac disease was the Italy. The most prolific journals were the Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition and Scandinavian Journal of Gastroenterology. There was a moderate positive significant correlation between the number of publications and gross domestic product (r = 0.639, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the advanced research on the diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment of celiac disease, the global research level about the disease is low. Therefore, the international collaboration about the disease should not remain at only regional contexts; the exchange of knowledge and common studies especially in developing or underdeveloped countries should be supported in terms of prevalence and clinic studies.
26044312	Alcoholic Cirrhosis Increases Risk for Autoimmune Diseases: A Nationwide Registry-Based Cohort Study.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Alcoholic cirrhosis is associated with hyperactivation and dysregulation of the immune system. In addition to its ability to increase risk for infections, it also may increase the risk for autoimmune diseases. We studied the incidence of autoimmune diseases among patients with alcoholic cirrhosis vs controls in Denmark. METHODS: We collected data from nationwide health care registries to identify and follow up all citizens of Denmark diagnosed with alcoholic cirrhosis from 1977 through 2010. Each patient was matched with 5 random individuals from the population (controls) of the same sex and age. The incidence rates of various autoimmune diseases were compared between patients with cirrhosis and controls and adjusted for the number of hospitalizations in the previous year (a marker for the frequency of clinical examination). RESULTS: Of the 24,679 patients diagnosed with alcoholic cirrhosis, 532 developed an autoimmune disease, yielding an overall increased adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) of 1.36 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-1.50). The strongest associations were with Addison's disease (aIRR, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.04-5.85), inflammatory bowel disease (aIRR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.26-1.92), celiac disease (aIRR, 5.12; 95% CI, 2.58-10.16), pernicious anemia (aIRR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.50-3.68), and psoriasis (aIRR, 4.06; 95% CI, 3.32-4.97). There was no increase in the incidence rate for rheumatoid arthritis (aIRR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.69-1.15); the incidence rate for polymyalgia rheumatica decreased in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis compared with controls (aIRR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.33-0.67). CONCLUSIONS: Based on a nationwide cohort study of patients in Denmark, alcoholic cirrhosis is a risk factor for several autoimmune diseases.
34712034	Determination of gluten immunogenic peptides for the management of the treatment adherence of celiac disease: A systematic review.	BACKGROUND: Gluten is a complex mixture of proteins with immunogenic peptide sequences triggering the autoimmune activity in patients with celiac disease (CeD). Gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) are resistant to gastrointestinal digestion and are then excreted via the stool and urine. Most common detection methods applied in the follow-up visits for CeD patients such as serology tests, dietetic interviews, questionnaires, and duodenal biopsy have been proved to be inefficient, invasive, or inaccurate for evaluating gluten-free diet (GFD) compliance. Determination of excreted GIP in stool and urine has been developed as a non-invasive, direct, and specific test for GFD monitoring. AIM: To summarize published literature about the clinical utility of GIP determination in comparison to the tools employed for GFD monitoring. METHODS: PubMed and Web of Science searches were performed using the keywords "gluten immunogenic peptides" or "gluten immunogenic peptide" and a combination of the previous terms with "feces", "stools", "urine", "celiac disease", "gluten-free diet", and "adherence" to identify relevant clinical studies published in English and Spanish between 2012 to January 2021. Reference lists from the articles were reviewed to identify additional pertinent articles. Published articles and abstracts reporting the clinical use of GIP determination in stool and/or urine for the follow-up of patients with CeD in comparison with other tools in use were included. Case reports, commentaries, reviews, conference papers, letters, and publications that did not focus on the aims of this review were excluded. RESULTS: Total of 15 publications were found that involved the use of GIP determination in stool and/or urine to monitor the adherence to the GFD in comparison to other tools. Studies included both children and adults diagnosed with CeD and healthy volunteers. Overall, these preliminary studies indicated that this novel technique was highly sensitive for the detection of GFD transgressions and therefore could facilitate the follow-up of patients with CeD. Tools identified in this work included the CeD-specific serology, dietetic questionnaires, symptomatology, and the duodenal biopsy. Review of the literature revealed that the rates of GFD adherence may vary between 30%-93% using either stool or urine GIP determination, 49%-96% by the serology, 59%-94% using the dietetic questionnaires, 56%-95% by the reported symptoms and 44%-76% with the duodenal biopsy. In addition, the association between the different methods and histological abnormalities (Marsh II-III) was found to be 33%-100% for GIP determination (stool and urine), 25%-39% for CeD-specific serology, 3%-50% for dietetic questionnaires, and 22%-28% for the symptomatology. CONCLUSION: Excreted GIP detection is the precise approach for determining voluntary or involuntary gluten consumption in CeD patients preventing future complications arising from gluten exposure.
24264227	Oats in the diet of children with celiac disease: preliminary results of a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter Italian study.	A gluten-free diet (GFD) is currently the only available treatment for patients with celiac disease (CD). Several clinical trials have demonstrated that most celiac patients can tolerate a medium-high quantity of oats without any negative clinical effects; however, the inclusion of oats in GFD is still a matter of debate. In this study, Italian children with CD were enrolled in a 15-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial. Participants were randomized in two groups following either A-B treatment (6 months of diet "A", 3 months of standard GFD, 6 months of diet "B"), or B-A treatment (6 months of diet "B", 3 months of standard GFD, 6 months of diet "A"). A and B diets included gluten-free (GF) products (flour, pasta, biscuits, cakes and crisp toasts) with either purified oats or placebo. Clinical data (Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rate Scale [GSRS] score) and intestinal permeability tests (IPT), were measured through the study period. Although the study is still blinded, no significant differences were found in GSRS score or the urinary lactulose/mannitol (L/M) ratio between the two groups after 6 months of treatment. These preliminary results suggest that the addition of non-contaminated oats from selected varieties in the treatment of children with CD does not determine changes in intestinal permeability and gastrointestinal symptoms. 
33426098	Large-Scale Screening in General Population Children for Celiac Disease with a Multiplex Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) Assay.	BACKGROUND: Autoimmunity Screening for Kids (ASK) study was launched to screen general population children for type 1 diabetes (T1D) and celiac disease (CD). METHODS: A total of 23,319 children from general population were screened. A high throughput multiplex electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assay to screen multiautoantibodies in a single well was applied, parallel with a standard radiobinding assay (RBA). All children with any positive autoantibodies in screening were revisited within one month for confirmation and followed every 6 months. RESULTS: Among 23,319 children, 2.6% (606/23,319) of children were tested positive for TGA. Multiplex ECL assay detected more TGA (584/23,319) in the initial screening than RBA (490/23,319, p = 0.004) and was able to detect TGA earlier than RBA in a subset of children by 0.8 to 34.8 months. Prevalence of TGA by either ECL or RBA in children with islet autoantibodies was found significantly higher than overall prevalence in general population screened. CONCLUSIONS: A multiplex ECL assay was more sensitive than standard RBA by identifying more TGA positivity and detecting TGA earlier in general population screening. It also provides a high efficient tool with its unique advantage of multiplexing measurements to screen for multiple autoimmune diseases simultaneously in general population.
31755642	Cost of chronic inflammatory disease: The impact of eosinophilic esophagitis in Nevada.	OBJECTIVES: The cost of treating the rare eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) disease and its impact on patients' quality of life have not been well documented in the literature. This study seeks to fill this gap by comparing the cost of EoE with other well-known inflammatory diseases, including Crohn's disease (CD) and celiac disease (CeD). METHODS: A Mann-Whitney U test and multiple logistic regression were used to examine the cost of EoE in the state of Nevada across all hospital settings and its impact on quality of life compared with CD and CeD. RESULTS: Several factors were associated with the overall cost of EoE in Nevada, including patients' age, sex and region (P < 0.001). EoE was significantly more expensive to treat in the pediatric group ($4001 EoE; $985 CD; $856 CeD), among men ($2532 EoE; $1500 CD; $1724 CeD), among those residing in the southern region of Nevada ($4501 EoE; $2538 CD; $1888 CeD), and among patients seeking medical care from outpatient clinics ($3298 EoE; $741 CD; $1686 CeD) (P < 0.001). Age, sex, region and hospital setting were all associated with having a positive EoE record compared with CeD or CD (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Data from this study indicate that the EoE burden is significantly higher in cost for certain demographics and regions compared with CD and CeD in the state of Nevada, specifically among pediatric and male patients. These differences suggest that clinicians may encounter similar issues when treating EoE.
30469383	The Relationship between Body Composition and a Gluten Free Diet in Children with Celiac Disease.	The primary and proven therapy, in cases of celiac disease (CD), is a rigorous gluten-free diet (GFD). However, there are reports of its negative effects in the form of nutritional deficiencies, obesity, and adverse changes in body composition. The study aimed to assess the impact of a GFD on the body composition of children with CD. In a case-controlled study (n = 41; mean age 10.81 y; SD = 3.96) children with CD, in various stages of treatment, underwent medical assessment. The control group consisted of healthy children and adolescents, strictly matched for gender and age in a 1:1 case-control manner. More than half of the examined children (n = 26) followed a GFD. CD children had significantly higher mean values of the fat free mass (FFM% = 80.68 vs. 76.66, p = 0.015), and total body water (TBW% = 65.22 vs. 60.47, p = 0.012), and lower mean values of the fat mass (FM% = 19.32 vs. 23.34, p = 0.015). Children who were on a GFD presented slightly higher, but not statistically significant, mean values of FM and FFM, than children who did not follow dietary recommendations (FM [kg] = 7.48 vs. 5.24, p = 0.064; FM% = 20.81 vs. 16.73, p = 0.087; FFM [kg] = 28.19 vs. 22.62, p = 0.110). After minimum one year of a GFD, CD children showed significantly higher values of FFM [kg] (p = 0.001), muscle mass (MM) [kg] (p < 0.001), TBW [L] (p < 0.001) and body cell mass (BCM) [kg] (p < 0.001). Furthermore, CD children who were on a GFD presented a significantly higher increase in weight (p = 0.034) and body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.021). The children adhering to a GFD demonstrate a tendency towards higher indices of selected body composition components.
32230847	25-Hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D, and Peripheral Bone Densitometry in Adults with Celiac Disease.	Background: Adults with celiac disease (CeD) show low bone mineral density (BMD) and high fracture risk. CeD guidelines suggest measurements of serum minerals and vitamin D. However, studies on vitamin levels in CeD patients are contradictory. Aim: To investigate in CeD, 25-hydroxy-vitamin D [25(OH)D], 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D [1,25(OH)2D], and related analytes and to evaluate their relationships to peripheral BMD as assessed by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT). Methods: Gluten-free diet (GFD)-treated, and untreated adult CeD patients naive to vitamin D and calcium supplementation underwent measurements of serum 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)2D, parathyroid hormone (PTH), total calcium, phosphate, and of radius BMD by pQCT. Results: Complete data were collected in 105 patients for lab tests and 87 patients for BMD. For lab tests, untreated CeD differed from treated CeD for 22.0% lower serum 25(OH)D (p = 0.023), 42.5% higher serum PTH (p < 0.001), and 13.0% higher serum 1,25(OH)2D (p = 0.029) in the presence of similar serum calcium and phosphorus (p > 0.35). For BMD, untreated CeD differed from treated CeD for lower diaphyseal cortical BMD (1133 and 1157 mg/cm3, p = 0.004) but not for distal BMD (total, trabecular, and subcortical, p > 0.13). Independent correlates of diaphyseal cortical BMD were GFD treatment and body mass index (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Data indicated that, compared to CeD patients on a gluten-free diet, untreated adult CeD patients at diagnosis had lower 25(OH)D, higher PTH, and higher 1,25(OH)2D in the absence of difference in serum calcium and phosphorus. 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D, even below the normal range, were not associated with BMD. Our findings do not support the use of vitamin D supplementation for all CeD adults.
30119098	Contribution of Oral Hygiene and Cosmetics on Contamination of Gluten-free Diet: Do Celiac Customers Need to Worry About?	OBJECTIVES: The only available treatment for celiac disease (CD) is the gluten-free diet. It is unclear whether the presence of gluten in oral hygiene products and cosmetics that are applied on the mouth is a reason of concern for CD patients. The aim of this study was to test the level of gluten contamination in oral hygiene and cosmetic products available in the Italian market. METHODS: A total of 66 products (toothpastes = 37; dental tablets = 2; mouthwashes = 5; lip-balms = 10; lipsticks = 12) labelled gluten-free or with unknown gluten content were randomly collected from different supermarkets and pharmacies. The gluten quantification was determined by the R5 ELISA method approved by EU regulations. RESULTS: Out of 66 oral hygiene and cosmetics, 62 products (94%) were found to be gluten-free (gluten level <20 ppm), while 4 (6%) (toothpastes = 3; lipsticks = 1) showed a gluten level >20 ppm (toothpastes: 20.7, 31.4, and 35 ppm; lipstick: 27.4 ppm). None of the selected products had ingredient derived from wheat, barley, or rye. CONCLUSIONS: Gluten contamination is currently not an issue in a wide array of cosmetic and oral hygiene products that are commonly in the market.
25359556	Biochemical and immunochemical evidences supporting the inclusion of quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) as a gluten-free ingredient.	To date, the only acceptable therapeutic approach for celiac disease (CD) is a strict elimination from the diet of gluten-containing foods, but this diet does not always guarantee an adequate nutritional intake. Pseudocereals are receiving considerable attention as interesting alternatives for the formulation of gluten-free products, and quinoa grains arise as nutritive substitutes of conventional cereals. The aim of this study was the characterization of different quinoa samples corresponding to 11 quinoa varieties, using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS-PAGE) and immunoblotting techniques to assess their suitability for celiac subjects. Some of these varieties were grown in Italy to assess if the reproduction in a new habitat can guarantee the retention of the "safe" protein pattern. None of the quinoa varieties studied presented protein bands with electrophoretic mobility comparable with those of wheat gliadins, the toxic protein for celiac subjects. All the quinoa samples showed a low binding affinity for both specific anti-gliadin antibodies and IgAs from celiac subjects, confirming that quinoa can be considered as a safe ingredient for celiac patients. However, reliable varieties should be previously selected since the immuno cross-reactivity with anti-gliadin antibodies can vary significantly. 
37678180	Population level screening for celiac disease: is now the time?	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: As incidence and prevalence of celiac disease is increasing, subclinical and asymptomatic presentations are more commonly identified through celiac disease screening. However, the United States Preventive Services Task Force released a statement in 2017 maintaining that there is insufficient evidence to recommend general population screening for celiac disease for asymptomatic individuals. This review summarizes the current available evidence on celiac disease screening. RECENT FINDINGS: Literature demonstrates that by limiting screening to individuals with recognized symptoms, celiac disease diagnosis is frequently delayed or missed entirely. Most individuals with screening-identified celiac disease have previously unrecognized symptoms that improve through treatment with a gluten-free diet. Screening-identified individuals also demonstrate signs of impaired nutrition, growth, bone health, and quality of life which improve with treatment. Overall, celiac disease screening is viewed favorably by those identified through celiac disease screening programs. SUMMARY: Individuals with screening-identified celiac disease may still incur complications from untreated disease and receive benefit from treatment with a gluten-free diet. More data is needed to determine the cost effectiveness of different mass screening approaches that incorporate the societal perspective towards screening.
27629850	Celiac Disease and Epilepsy: The Effect of Gluten-Free Diet on Seizure Control.	BACKGROUND: Determining the true prevalence of celiac disease (CD) is difficult because of many atypical symptoms. Although CD primarily affects the gastrointestinal tract, patients may be asymptomatic or have extra intestinal symptoms. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we assessed the prevalence of CD in patients with epilepsy and the effect of a gluten-free diet on seizure control in these patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with epilepsy in Imam Reza and Farabi Hospitals, Kermanshah, Iran, were studied. At first, the patients were screened by means of measuring the immunoglobulin A antiendomysial (IgA) antibodies. In the patients testing positive for IgA antibodies, 2-3 endoscopic small bowel biopsies were taken from the distal duodenum to confirm CD changes. People with CD received a gluten-free diet for 5 months and their seizure activity was recorded. RESULTS: During the study period, we studied 113 patients with epilepsy. Seven patients (6%) were diagnosed with CD. After 5 months of instituting a gluten-free diet, in 6 patients seizures were completely under control and antiepileptic drugs were discontinued. In one case, anticonvulsant drugs were reduced by half and seizures were controlled. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that about 6% of epileptic patients were positive for CD. Institution of a glutenfree diet is useful for seizure control in these patients.
22674144	The immunopathogenesis of celiac disease reveals possible therapies beyond the gluten-free diet.	Celiac disease is a T cell-mediated autoimmune inflammatory disease of the small intestine that is activated by gluten. The diagnosis of celiac disease is challenging as patients display a wide range of symptoms and some are asymptomatic. A lifelong gluten-free diet is the only currently approved treatment of celiac disease. Although the diet is safe and effective, the compliance rates and patient acceptance vary. Furthermore, many patients treated with a gluten-free diet continue to be mildly to severely symptomatic with persistent histological abnormalities, and a small number of patients develop refractory celiac disease. New therapeutic adjuncts and potential alternatives to the gluten-free diet could improve the treatment options for these patients. Advances in understanding the immunopathogenesis of celiac disease have suggested several types of therapeutic strategies that may augment or supplant the gluten-free diet. Some of these strategies attempt to decrease the immunogenicity of gluten-containing grains by manipulating the grain itself or by using oral enzymes to break down immunogenic peptides that normally remain intact during digestion. Other strategies focus on preventing the absorption of these peptides, preventing tissue transglutaminase from rendering gluten peptides more immunogenic, or inhibiting their binding to celiac disease-specific antigen-presenting molecules. Strategies that limit T cell migration to the small intestine or that reestablish mucosal homeostasis and tolerance to gluten antigens are also being explored. Additionally, it is vital to develop new therapeutic options for refractory celiac disease patients. This review highlights therapeutic strategies that may ultimately improve the health and well-being of individuals with celiac disease.
37630710	Body Mass Index during Gluten-Free Diet in Patients with Celiac Disease.	The association of clinical variables with body mass index (BMI) and changes experienced during a gluten-free diet (GFD) in celiac disease (CD) is not well established. In this retrospective cohort study, we aimed to investigate factors aligned with baseline and a follow-up regarding BMI in CD cases diagnosed at the University of Pecs (Hungary). Data were collected regarding gender, age, clinical presentation, histology, serology, extraintestinal manifestations, and BMI upon diagnosis and during follow-up. To compare variables with baseline BMI and BMI changes in short-, intermediate-, and long-term periods, we applied univariate analyses. A total of 192 CD patients were included. Males had significantly higher mean BMI when compared with females at diagnosis (22.9 +- 4.1 vs. 21.4 +- 4.3 kg/m2, p = 0.041) and during follow-up (p = 0.031, p = 0.029, and p = 0.033 for short-, intermediate-, and long-term follow-ups, respectively). Non-classical CD patients experienced higher mean BMI at diagnosis (22.9 +- 4.0 vs. 20.7 +- 4.4 kg/m2, p < 0.001) and following long-term follow-up (24.5 +- 3.2 vs. 22.6 +- 3.4 kg/m2, p = 0.039) than classical patients. In conclusion, although the mean BMI remained in the normal range, it increased significantly during follow-up, even at the short-term follow-up. This change was characteristic for non-classical cases and males on the long-term follow-ups.
29211629	Report of the 5th European expert meeting on rotavirus vaccination (EEROVAC).	The Fifth European Expert Meeting on Rotavirus Vaccination was convened in Utrecht, The Netherlands, in March 2017. The 2-day meeting included invited lectures as well as original oral and poster presentations and brought together experts from 21 countries. Summary findings of the meeting include: Rotavirus vaccination programmes in Europe have resulted in reductions of 60-90% in rotavirus outpatient visits and hospitalizations. Long term trends indicate this impact is sustained over the years. Herd effects, protecting unvaccinated children and neonates too young to be vaccinated have been observed in many European countries. Early evidence now also suggests that rotavirus vaccination may be instrumental in the prevention of celiac disease. Special attention should be given to preterm infants, who may age out of the vaccination window before hospital discharge and to HIV infected children who are at increased risk of severe rotavirus AGE. There is a small but increased risk of IS following rotavirus vaccination and parents should therefore be informed about possible signs and symptoms of IS. New insights in rotavirus genetic susceptibility and interactions with microbiome may open opportunities for interventions to improve protection by vaccination, in particular in LMIC. The development of several novel rotavirus vaccines discussed at the meeting is also promising in this respect.
36165066	"Long-term follow-up and prognosis of celiac hepatitis".	INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease has been associated with abnormal liver function tests at diagnosis that usually resolve with a gluten-free diet (GFD). The aim of this study was to assess the evolution of liver involvement and possible long-term complications in patients on a GFD. METHODS: Retrospective and single-center study, which included all individuals with Celiac disease followed in specialized consultation in a tertiary referral hospital. RESULTS: A total of 162 patients were included, most of them female (77.8%) with a median age of 24 years (IQR, 7-39). Seventy-four (45.7%) patients had abnormal liver function tests at diagnosis. These individuals had higher anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA (tTG-IgA) antibody titers (126 vs. 29 IU/L; P  = 0.003). There were no significant differences in the Marsh classification ( P  = 0.599). During follow-up, most celiac hepatitis patients had normalization of liver function tests and tTG-IgA antibodies. At the last follow-up, all the patients had fibrosis-4 index <2.4 and an aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index score <0.6. Vibration-controlled transient elastography showed values <6.4 kPa in all cases. On the other hand, it was found that 42.9% of the individuals had a controlled attenuation parameter >206.5 db/m. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, liver function tests normalized in the vast majority of celiac hepatitis patients on a GFD, with no progression to chronic liver disease. It should be noted the high number of individuals who present hepatic steatosis during follow-up, which may be related to a diet that tends to be hyperlipidemic and hypercaloric.
35935971	Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte Antigen 4 Haploinsufficiency Presenting As Refractory Celiac-Like Disease: Case Report.	Primary immunodeficiency may present with treatment-refractory enteropathy. We present two patients with celiac/celiac-like disease diagnosed in early childhood and refractory to the gluten-free diet. One patient had features of multi-system autoimmunity, whereas the other had celiac-like disease as an isolated clinical finding. Both patients underwent genetic testing given disease refractoriness and were ultimately diagnosed with cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) haploinsufficiency. They are both now in complete clinical and endoscopic remission on abatacept. CTLA4 haploinsufficiency has incomplete penetrance and significant phenotypic heterogeneity but should be considered in the differential diagnosis of refractory celiac/celiac-like disease, as treatment implications are significant.
32708973	Efficacy of a High-Iron Dietary Intervention in Women with Celiac Disease and Iron Deficiency without Anemia: A Clinical Trial.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: Iron deficiency without anemia (IDWA) is a common finding in celiac disease (CD) and can also persist in case of good compliance and clinical response to a strict gluten-free diet (GFD). This scenario usually presents in CD women of child-bearing age in whom the imbalance between menstrual iron loss and inadequate iron intake from their diet plays the major role. A recommended approach to this condition is yet to be established. This study aimed to compare, in this subset of patients, the efficacy of a dietary approach consisting of an iron-rich diet against the traditional pharmacological oral-replacement therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between February and December 2016, consecutive CD female patients of child-bearing age as referred to our outpatient center with evidence of IDWA (ferritin <15 ng/mL or 15-20 ng/L with transferrin saturation <15%) were enrolled. After the completion of a 7-day weighed food intake recording to assess the usual iron dietary intake, the patients were randomized in two arms to receive a 12-week iron-rich diet (iron intake >20 mg/die) versus oral iron supplementation with ferrous sulfate (FS) (105 mg/day). Blood tests and dietary assessments were repeated at the end of treatment. The degree of compliance and tolerability to the treatments were assessed every month by means of specific questionnaires and symptoms evaluation. RESULTS: A total of 22 women were enrolled and divided in the diet group (n = 10, age 37 +- 8 years) and in the FS group (n = 12, age 38 +- 10 years). The food intake records demonstrated an inadequate daily intake of iron in all the enrolled subjects. At the end of the treatments, ferritin levels were higher in the FS group (8.5 (5) versus 34 (30.8), p = 0.002). Compliance and tolerability were similar in both treatment groups (89% versus 87%, p = ns). CONCLUSIONS: These findings did not support any equivalent efficacy of an iron-rich diet compared to a FS supplementation in non-anemic iron-deficient women affected by CD. However, the diet appeared a well-tolerated approach, and adequate dietary instructions could effectively increase the daily iron consumption, suggesting a role in the long-term management of IDWA, especially in patients who do not tolerate pharmacological supplementation.

28758924	Unusual Onset of Celiac Disease and Addison's Disease in a 12-Year-Old Boy.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder deriving from an aberrant adaptive immune response against gluten-containing grains in genetically predisposed subjects. In a number of patients, CD is associated with one or more other autoimmune diseases. Primary Addison's disease (AD) and CD may co-exist, although this association is relatively uncommon in children. In addition, it is not precisely defined whether a gluten-free diet influences the course of AD. CASE PRESENTATION: A case of CD in a 12-year-old boy presenting as acute adrenal insufficiency is described here. A gluten-free diet had a significant therapeutic role in this case, wherein most of the clinical signs and symptoms of AD disappeared in a few days. In addition, the dosage of cortisol acetate, initially administered to treat the AD, was able to be rapidly reduced. CONCLUSION: This case highlights that CD can be associated with AD in children, and a gluten-free diet seems to positively influence the course of AD.
38380914	Evaluating the Effects of Chronic Oral Exposure to the Food Additive Silicon Dioxide on Oral Tolerance Induction and Food Sensitivities in Mice.	BACKGROUND: The increasing prevalence of food sensitivities has been attributed to changes in gut microenvironment; however, ubiquitous environmental triggers such as inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) used as food additives have not been thoroughly investigated. OBJECTIVES: We explored the impact of the NP-structured food-grade silicon dioxide (fg-SiO2) on intestinal immune response involved in oral tolerance (OT) induction and evaluated the consequences of oral chronic exposure to this food-additive using a mouse model of OT to ovalbumin (OVA) and on gluten immunopathology in mice expressing the celiac disease risk gene, HLA-DQ8. METHODS: Viability, proliferation, and cytokine production of mesenteric lymph node (MLN) cells were evaluated after exposure to fg-SiO2. C57BL/6J mice and a mouse model of OT to OVA were orally exposed to fg-SiO2 or vehicle for 60 d. Fecal lipocalin-2 (Lcn-2), anti-OVA IgG, cytokine production, and immune cell populations were analyzed. Nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice expressing HLA-DQ8 (NOD/DQ8), exposed to fg-SiO2 or vehicle, were immunized with gluten and immunopathology was investigated. RESULTS: MLN cells exposed to fg-SiO2 presented less proliferative T cells and lower secretion of interleukin 10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) by T regulatory and CD45+ CD11b+ CD103+ cells compared to control, two factors mediating OT. Mice given fg-SiO2 exhibited intestinal Lcn-2 level and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) secretion, showing inflammation and less production of IL-10 and TGF-beta. These effects were also observed in OVA-tolerized mice exposed to fg-SiO2, in addition to a breakdown of OT and a lower intestinal frequency of T cells. In NOD/DQ8 mice immunized with gluten, the villus-to-crypt ratio was decreased while the CD3+ intraepithelial lymphocyte counts and the Th1 inflammatory response were aggravated after fg-SiO2 treatment. DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that chronic oral exposure to fg-SiO2 blocked oral tolerance induction to OVA, and worsened gluten-induced immunopathology in NOD/DQ8 mice. The results should prompt investigation on the link between SiO2 exposure and food sensitivities in humans. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP12758.
33156101	Healthcare Resource Utilization and Costs in Celiac Disease: A US Claims Analysis.	INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease (CeD) is a lifelong immune-mediated enteropathy in which dietary gluten triggers an inflammatory reaction in the small intestine. This retrospective cohort study examines healthcare resource utilization (HRU) and costs between patients with CeD and matched controls. METHODS: Patients with CeD (cases) with an endoscopic biopsy and >=2 medical encounters with a CeD diagnosis between January 1, 2010, and October 1, 2015, were identified in the MarketScan databases. The date of the first claim with a CeD diagnosis on or after the endoscopic biopsy was the index date. Cases were matched 1:1 to patients without CeD (controls) on demographic characteristics and Deyo-Charlson Comorbidity Index score. Clinical characteristics, all-cause, and CeD-related HRU and costs (adjusted to 2017 US dollars) were compared between cases and controls during the 12 months before (baseline) and 24 months after (follow-up) the index date. RESULTS: A total of 11,008 cases (mean age 40.6 years, 71.3% women) were matched to 11,008 controls. During the follow-up, a higher proportion of cases had all-cause and CeD-related HRU including inpatient admissions, emergency department visits, gastroenterologist visits, dietician visits, endoscopic biopsies, and gastroenterology imaging (all P <= 0.002). Incremental all-cause and CeD-related costs were in the first ($7,921 and $2,894) and second ($3,777 and $935) year of follow-up, driven by outpatient services costs. DISCUSSION: In this US national claims database analysis, there was evidence of an increase in both all-cause and CeD-related HRU and related costs in patients with CeD compared with matched patients without CeD, suggesting a significant economic burden associated with CeD.
30018339	P31-43, an undigested gliadin peptide, mimics and enhances the innate immune response to viruses and interferes with endocytic trafficking: a role in celiac disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation of the intestinal mucosa due to an immune response to wheat gliadins. Some gliadin peptides are resistant to intestinal digestion (e.g., A-gliadin P31-43) and induce a stress/innate immune response, but the reason why they are dangerous in the intestines of patients with CD is unknown. In the present study, P31-43 activated IFN-alpha, a mediator of the innate immune response in CD, in the intestine of subjects with CD and an enterocyte cell line, CaCo-2. P31-43 cooperated with a viral ligand to activate the TLR7 pathway by interfering with endocytic trafficking. Based on these results, the vesicular pathway regulates the innate/inflammatory response to viral ligands and bioactive dietary peptides. Suggesting that together with viral infections, alimentary proteins able to mimic and potentiate the innate immune response to viruses, can trigger an autoimmune disease such as CD.
26496658	A retrospective evaluation of the association of celiac disease and growth hormone deficiency: more than a casual association?	BACKGROUND: A transient dysfunction of the endocrine growth axis has been reported in celiac disease (CD). This apparent growth hormone deficiency (GHD) generally normalizes with the institution of a gluten-free diet (GFD). However, in few cases, the dysfunction of the GH axis persists despite a good adherence to the GFD. Aims of this study were to investigate pediatric patients with concurrent CD and GHD and to compare them with patients with isolated CD. METHODS: Data regarding CD patients with and without associated GHD were retrospectively collected. Inclusion criteria were availability of anthropometric and laboratory data at baseline and regularly at the reference center up to a 2-year follow-up. In case of poor catch-up growth despite a good adherence to the GFD, endocrinological investigation was carried on. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients with CD were included. Four (7.5%) out of 53 CD patients had a concurrent GHD. In two cases, firstly diagnosed with CD, GHD was suspected because of a poor catch-up growth despite a good adherence to the GFD. In two other cases, firstly diagnosed with GHD, gastrointestinal symptoms revealed the diagnosis of CD. Normalization of height velocity was achieved by GH treatment in all cases. No statistical significant difference between the two groups of patients was found as regard laboratory and histological features of CD. It is to note that 2 out of 4 patients with concomitant CD and GHD had thyroiditis compared to 6% of patients with isolated CD (P=0.004). CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of CD and GHD association was found. CD patients with poor catch-up growth despite a good adherence to the GFD should be carefully investigated for endocrine disorders.
21798136	Celiac disease and celiac crisis in children.	OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of clinical features of Celiac disease (CD) and Celiac crisis in children. STUDY DESIGN: Case series. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Paediatrics Unit, Sheikh Zayed Medical College and Hospital, Rahim Yar Khan, from September 2009 to September 2010. METHODOLOGY: Forty children aged between 4 to 13 years of either gender, presenting with complaints of recurrent diarrhea, abdominal distention, severe emaciation and dehydration were included. The information about breast feeding, weaning diets, age of introduction of wheat diets, onset of diarrhea, characteristics and frequency of stools, growth, vaccination status, symptoms in 1st degree relatives, restriction of Gluten diet in the past and anthropometric measures were recorded. Serological tests against anti-Tissue Transglultaminase (anti-tTG) antibodies were obtained in all cases. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopies were performed and multiple biopsies were taken from distal parts of duodenum. RESULTS: Among the forty children, twenty four (60%) were females and 16 were males (40%). The mean age was 6.35 +- 2.83 years. Thirty five (87.5%) parents were cousins. Breast feeding was not exclusively given and the Gluten containing weaning diets were given as early as 3.5 months of age. Thirty (75%) children presented with typical sign and symptoms of CD. Celiac crisis presented with profuse diarrhea, severe dehydration; abdominal distention; pedal edema, carpopedal spasm due to tetany; wasted muscles; head drop and inability to stand. The serum TtG antibodies in thirty-eight cases (95%) were above the cut off level of 7 u/ml ranging from 35-99 u/ml. The histopathology of specimens from distal duodenum revealed lesions of M3 type in thirteen (32.5%) and M2 type in eighteen cases (45%). All cases recovered and improved on follow-up after strict adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD). CONCLUSION: Majority of children with Celiac disease presented with typical symptom, while Celiac crisis was characterized by severe dehydration, weakness and calcium deficiency signs. Most were the product of consanguineous marriages and were given Gluten-containing weaning foods as early as the 4th month of life.
34736585	Celiac Disease in Children.	Celiac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy triggered by the ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. In patients with suspected celiac disease, measurement of serum IgA antibodies to tissue transglutaminase-2 has a high sensitivity and specificity and is the first screening test that should be ordered. The diagnosis of celiac disease is based on the presence of mucosal damage in small intestinal biopsies in patients having circulating celiac disease-specific antibodies. Celiac disease management includes lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet and continuous long-term follow-up.
24369326	Non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Is it in the gluten or the grain?	Celiac disease is an immune-mediated inflammatory disorder of the small intestine caused by sensitivity to dietary gluten and related proteins in genetically predisposed individuals. Over the past several years, the concept of non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) has gained significant interest from the scientific community and mass media and the number of individuals embracing a gluten-free diet is rapidly growing. This condition is characterized by gastrointestinal or extraintestinal symptoms that respond to gluten withdrawal without evidence for underlying celiac disease or wheat allergy. Symptoms display significant overlap with the irritable bowel syndrome. Many important factors regarding this relatively novel condition remain to be elucidated; no discriminative markers to support a diagnosis of gluten sensitivity have been identified yet and its pathogenesis remains obscure. Here we review the current knowledge on NCGS, and outline potential pathogenic pathways of different gluten related disorders in order to gain clues about the pathophysiology of this novel condition. 
37499866	Celiac Disease: An Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Evidence-Based Practice Guideline.	Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system of genetically susceptible individuals elicits a reaction to gluten causing small intestine damage. If left undiagnosed and untreated, the resulting nutritional malabsorption can lead to anemia, bone disease, growth faltering or other consequences. The condition is lifelong and lacks a cure; the only treatment is lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). This diet is challenging to follow and adversely impacts quality of life; however, it is essential to ensure intestinal recovery and prevent future negative health consequences. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics convened an expert panel complemented by a celiac disease patient advocate to evaluate evidence for six topics including Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT), the GFD, oat consumption, micronutrients, pro-/prebiotics and the low FODMAP (Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides and Polyols) diet. This publication outlines the Academy's Evidence Analysis Library methods used to complete the systematic review and guideline development, and summarizes the recommendations and supporting evidence. The guidelines affirm that all individuals with celiac disease should follow a GFD (1C, Imperative) that may include gluten-free oats in adults (2D, Conditional). Children should follow a nutritionally adequate GFD that supports healthy growth and development (Consensus, Imperative) and does not unnecessarily restrict gluten-free oats (Consensus, Conditional). The guidelines indicate nutritional care should include routine nutritional assessment (Consensus, Imperative) and MNT (Consensus, Imperative). At this time, the guidelines do not support a recommendation for the addition of the low-FODMAP diet (2C, Conditional), prebiotic or probiotic supplementation (2D, Conditional) or micronutrient supplementation (in the absence of nutritional deficiency) (Consensus, Conditional). The 2021 Celiac Disease Evidence-Based Nutrition Guideline will assist Registered Dietitian Nutritionists in providing appropriate evidence-based MNT to support people with celiac disease in achieving and maintaining nutritional health and avoiding adverse celiac disease consequences throughout their lives.
29105146	Effect of the gluten-free diet on cardiovascular risk factors in patients with coeliac disease: A systematic review.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A gluten-free diet (GFD), the mainstay of treatment for celiac disease, is being increasingly adopted by people without this condition. The long-term health effects of this diet, apart from its beneficial effect on enteropathy in celiac disease, are unclear. Concerns exist that the GFD may result in micronutrient deficiencies, increased exposure to toxins such as arsenic, and an increased cardiovascular risk. This systematic review addresses the effect of the GFD on several modifiable cardiovascular risk factors. METHODS: A systematic search of the literature addressing the GFD and blood pressure, glycaemia, body mass index, waist circumference, and serum lipids in patients before and after adoption of a GFD was conducted using the MEDLINE, EMBASE, PSYCInfo, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases. Two authors performed abstract and full text screening, and quality assessment. RESULTS: A total of 5372 articles were identified, from which 27 were included. Lack of control groups in all but one study prevented meta-analysis of results. Overall study quality was low and restricted to patients with celiac disease. Consistent findings across studies included an increase in total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein, fasting glycaemia, and body mass index (while remaining within the healthy weight range). Significant changes in low density lipoprotein, triglycerides, and blood pressure were not consistently reported. CONCLUSIONS: A GFD alters certain cardiovascular risk factors in patients with celiac disease, but the overall effect on cardiovascular risk is unclear. Further studies are warranted.
27849120	Gut microbiota and functional diseases of the gastrointestinal tract.	INTRODUCTION: Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are a common group of chronic gastrointestinal (GI) diseases defined by symptom-based diagnostic criteria, which consider chronic or recurrent symptoms of the GI tract in the absence of other organic or biochemical reasons. Recent evidences have been highlighted the role of gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of the FGIDs. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A critical analysis of the existing literature on the role of gut microbiota in FGIDs was performed by evaluating the differences of composition, functions and role of intestinal flora in FGIDs of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract. Moreover, we focused on recent evidences about gut microbiota and celiac disease (CD), especially in CD patients who are symptomatic despite gluten-free diet (GFD), and who seem to share similar features of FGIDs subjects. In this setting, we conducted an additional PubMed search for guidelines, systematic reviews (SR) and primary studies published after the last search update of the most recent reviews. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Some data suggest that, in a significant percentage of patients, the microbiota plays an important role in the genesis and maintenance of FGIDs. Probiotic supplementation and antibiotic treatment appear to be of therapeutic value, although the clinical data remain controversial. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the exciting and growing research on the role of gut microbiota in FGIDs, our knowledge remains fairly limited. Further studies are needed to measure the diversity, function and resistance to antibiotics of the intestinal microbiota in FGIDs.

24853109	Association of maternal education, early infections, and antibiotic use with celiac disease: a population-based birth cohort study in northeastern Italy.	We conducted a population-based birth cohort study of approximately 203,000 babies born in northeastern Italy (1989-2012) to investigate perinatal variables, early infections leading to hospital admission, and antibiotic use in the first 12 months of life as possible risk factors for celiac disease (CD). Incident CD cases were identified from pathology reports, hospital discharge records, and exemptions from prescription charges for clinical tests. Multivariate Poisson regression models were fitted to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs). A total of 1,227 children had CD; CD was histopathologically confirmed in 866 (71%). Female sex, maternal age, and high maternal educational level were found to be significantly associated with CD. Gastrointestinal infections were strongly associated with a subsequent diagnosis of CD (IRR = 2.04, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.30, 3.22). Antibiotic use was significantly associated with CD onset (IRR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.43), with a dose-response relationship for number of courses (P-trend < 0.01). Cephalosporin use strongly increased the risk of CD (IRR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.18, 1.73). Use of antibiotics (supported by the dose-response relationship) and gastrointestinal infections in the first year of life may facilitate the early onset of CD by altering intestinal microflora and the gut mucosal barrier. Perinatal factors, including cesarean section, had little influence on the risk of childhood CD.

24284619	Bone mass and mineral metabolism alterations in adult celiac disease: pathophysiology and clinical approach.	Osteoporosis affects many patients with celiac disease (CD), representing the consequence of calcium malabsorption and persistent activation of mucosal inflammation. A slight increase of fracture risk is evident in this condition, particularly in those with overt malabsorption and in postmenopausal state. The adoption of a correct gluten-free diet (GFD) improves bone derangement, but is not able to normalize bone mass in all the patients. Biomarkers effective in the prediction of bone response to gluten-free diet are not yet available and the indications of guidelines are still imperfect and debated. In this review, the pathophysiology of bone loss is correlated to clinical aspects, defining an alternative proposal of management for this condition.

28737204	[Celiac disease, non celiac gluten sensitivity and wheat allergy: comparison of 3 different diseases triggered by the same food].	Gluten and other related proteins of the wheat, rye and barley, have antigenic properties that may trigger adverse reactions in susceptible individuals. Celiac disease was the first pathology with clear causal association related to the intake of these proteins. Recently, wheat allergy and non celiac gluten sensitivity have been described. Although, clinical presentation and its relation with protein ingestion may be similar and elicit confusion, their pathogenic mechanism, diagnosis and treatment are quite different. Since the prevalence of these diseases is relatively high as a whole, it is essential that these become familiar to primary care doctors and general pediatricians, thus they will know how to differentiate and face them. The aim of this review is to compare the main aspects of epidemiology, pathofisiology, diagnosis and treatment of these 3 conditions.
21309674	Celiac disease and health-related quality of life.	Celiac disease is a particularly common life-long disorder with a prevalence of approximately 1-2% in Western populations. In recent years the health-related quality of life has become an important issue in this context, and most studies carried out so far have shown diminished quality of life in untreated patients compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, there has generally been a beneficial response to treatment with a gluten-free diet. However, the majority of trials have been carried out among adults with gastrointestinal disease, while in fact several extraintestinal and atypical forms of celiac disease might be even more common than the classical disorder. In addition, only a small proportion of these studies have been conducted among children. This article highlights the studies of health-related quality of life and celiac disease conducted to date. Particular attention is paid to the extraintestinal and atypical forms of the disorder.
22667047	[When gluten-free diet does not cure celiac disease].	Dietary deviations and continuous usage of gluten even in small amounts are the most common causes of poor treatment response for celiac disease. In rare refractory celiac disease symptoms and small bowel mucosal morphological damage do not heal despite a strict diet. In such cases it is important to distinguish between type I and II refractory celiac disease by using small bowel lymphocyte markers and clonality of inflammatory cells. Increased risk of small intestinal lymphoma is especially associated with type II disease, which has a poorer prognosis. Type I is often treated with corticosteroids and azathioprine.
21647651	Cryptogenic chronic hepatitis and its changing guise in adults.	Cryptogenic chronic hepatitis is a disease that is unexplained by conventional clinical, laboratory and histological findings, and it can progress to cirrhosis, develop hepatocellular carcinoma, and require liver transplantation. The goals of this review are to describe the changing phenotype of cryptogenic chronic hepatitis in adults, develop a diagnostic algorithm appropriate to current practice, and suggest treatment options. The frequency of cryptogenic hepatitis is estimated at 5.4%. Cryptogenic cirrhosis is diagnosed in 5-30% of patients with cirrhosis, and it is present in 3-14% of adults awaiting liver transplantation. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease has been implicated in 21-63% of patients, and autoimmune hepatitis is a likely diagnosis in 10-54% of individuals. Viral infections, hereditary liver diseases, celiac disease, and unsuspected alcohol or drug-induced liver injury are recognized infrequently in the current cryptogenic population. Manifestations of the metabolic syndrome heighten the suspicion of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and the absence of hepatic steatosis does not discount this possibility. The diagnostic scoring system of the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group can support the diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis in some patients. Certain genetic mutations may have disease-specificity, and they suggest that some patients may have an independent and uncharacterized disease. Corticosteroid therapy is effective in patients with autoimmune features, and life-style changes and specific therapies for manifestations of the metabolic syndrome are appropriate for all obese patients. The 1- and 5-year survivals after liver transplantation have ranged from 72-85% to 58-73%, respectively.
38542796	Persistent Barriers of the Gluten-Free Basic Food Basket: Availability, Cost, and Nutritional Composition Assessment.	Gluten-related disorders are treated with a gluten-free diet. The "basic food basket" (BFB) consists of a list of basic foods consumed by low-income groups in society, including those lowest-cost versions within each food category. To evaluate the cost, availability, and nutritional quality of the BFB and gluten-free BFB (GF-BFB), foods were photographed, registering their cost, availability, and nutritional characteristics, in high quality and mid-range supermarkets, wholesalers, health shops, and corner shops, matching each regular BFB product with a gluten-free equivalent. Of the 1177 potential products, the selection of lowest-cost foods yielded 55 and 47 products (BFB and GF-BFB, respectively). Breads/cereals and drinks showed the highest differences (279% and 146%, respectively) while meats and sausages showed the lowest ones (18.6%). The GF-BFB cost represents 30.1% of the minimum wage, which covers the cost of 5.2 and 3.3 of the BFB and GF-BFB per month, respectively. Availability ranged between 22.7 and 42.4%. Lower availability was associated with poorer nutritional quality in the GF-BFB, which provides 5% less energy, 26% more fat, and 25% less protein than the BFB. Only 47% of gluten-free products declared their "gluten-free" condition. The results strongly suggest that the GF-BFB must be redesigned to be both gluten-free and nutritionally adequate.
24832676	Gluten-free is not enough--perception and suggestions of celiac consumers.	The present study investigated the perceptions of individuals with celiac disease about gluten-free (GF) products, their consumer behavior and which product is the most desired. A survey was used to collect information. Descriptive analysis, chi2 tests and Multiple Logistic Regressions were conducted. Ninety-one questionnaires were analyzed. Limited variety and availability, the high price of products and the social restrictions imposed by the diet were the factors that caused the most dissatisfaction and difficulty. A total of 71% of the participants confirmed having moderate to high difficulty finding GF products. The logistic regression identified a significant relationship between dissatisfaction, texture and variety (p < 0.05) and between variety and difficulty of finding GF products (p < 0.05). The sensory characteristics were the most important variables considered for actual purchases. Bread was the most desired product. The participants were dissatisfaction with GF products. The desire for bread with better sensory characteristics reinforces the challenge to develop higher quality baking products.
23293929	Latest in vitro and in vivo models of celiac disease.	INTRODUCTION: Currently, the only treatment for celiac disease is a gluten-free diet, and there is an increased desire for alternative therapies. In vitro and in vivo models of celiac disease have been generated in order to better understand the pathogenesis of celiac disease, and this review will discuss these models as well as the testing of alternative therapies using these models. AREAS COVERED: The research discussed describes the different in vitro and in vivo models of celiac disease that currently exist and how they have contributed to our understanding of how gluten can stimulate both innate and adaptive immune responses in celiac patients. We also provide a summary on the alternative therapies that have been tested with these models and discuss whether subsequent clinical trials were done based on these tests done with these models of celiac disease. EXPERT OPINION: Only a few of the alternative therapies that have been tested with animal models have gone on to clinical trials; however, those that did go on to clinical trial have provided promising results from a safety standpoint. Further trials are required to determine if some of these therapies may serve as an effective adjunct to a gluten-free diet to alleviate the adverse affects associated with accidental gluten exposure. A "magic-bullet" approach may not be the answer to celiac disease, but possibly a future cocktail of these different therapeutics may allow celiac patients to consume an unrestricted diet.
33880901	Nutri-epigenetics: the effect of maternal diet and early nutrition on the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.	Autoimmune diseases comprise a wide group of diseases involving a self-response of the immune system against the host. The etiopathogenesis is very complex involving disease-specific factors but also environmental factors, among which the diet. Maternal diet during pregnancy as well as early nutrition recently attracted the interest of the scientists as contributing to the immune programming. In this paper, we reviewed the most recent literature on the effect of maternal diet and early nutrition in modulating the immune system in a selected subset of autoimmune diseases: type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Particularly, we focused our narrative on the role of maternal and perinatal nutrition in the epigenetic mechanisms underlying the auto-immune response. Maternal diet during pregnancy as well as breastfeeding and early nutrition play a big role in many epigenetic mechanisms. Most of the nutrients consumed by the mother and the infant are known exerting epigenetic functions, such as folate, methionine, zinc, vitamins B12 and D, fibers, casein and gliadin, and they were linked to gene expression changes in the immune pathways. Despite the common role of maternal diet, breastfeeding and early nutrition in almost all the autoimmune diseases, each disease seems to have specific diet-driver epigenetic mechanisms that require further investigations. The research in this field is opening new routes to establishing a precision nutrition approach to the auto-immune diseases.
36533746	A short update on new approaches to celiac disease.	Celiac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy of the small intestine, related to gluten intolerance occurring in genetically predisposed patients. Currently, the only available treatment is a lifelong gluten-free diet. However, the total avoidance of gluten is difficult and poses a challenge to patients, nutritionists and treating physicians. For this reason, scientists have developed in recent years new therapeutic approaches complementary to dietary treatment, such as modification of gluten to make gliadin non-toxic, reduction of the inflammatory response with elafin and Lactococcus Lactis, degradation of gluten by endoproteolytic enzymes, and correction of nutritional deficiencies by adding pseudo-cereals to the diet of celiac patients. This literature review focuses on the different treatment strategies for celiac disease previously studied and summarizes the latest advances in this field.
26665005	Management of Nonceliac Gluten Sensitivity by Gastroenterology Specialists: Data from an Italian Survey.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: Nonceliac gluten sensitivity is syndrome characterized by symptoms disappearing after a gluten-free diet. Its existence is still argument of discussion among specialists. Our aim was to evaluate the knowledge about nonceliac gluten sensitivity among gastroenterology specialists. METHODS: During October 2013 a questionnaire was sent through a medical newsletter to Italian gastroenterologists. Twelve questions investigated their knowledge on nonceliac gluten sensitivity, including their diagnostic and therapeutic approach. RESULTS: A total of 212 gastroenterologists filled in the questionnaire. The 98.6% were aware of the existence of a syndrome called "nonceliac gluten sensitivity" and 77% believe in its existence. However, only 56% gave a correct definition of the term. The majority of specialists diagnosed gluten sensitive patients and the number of diagnoses was not statistically different from that of celiac disease. Moreover, a gluten-free diet was prescribed by 64% of the specialists and among them the 73% noted an increase of gluten sensitive patients attending their outpatient services. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that most of the specialists recognize nonceliac gluten sensitivity and prescribe gluten-free diet, although 44% of the specialists are not able to give its correct definition; underlining the necessity of medical education on this topic is needed.
27966106	Retreatment with teriparatide: our experience in three patients with severe secondary osteoporosis.	Teriparatide is a drug for the treatment of osteoporosis which is licensed for use for up to 24 months. There is little experience with retreatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate, in three patients with severe secondary osteoporosis, the response to a second cycle of teriparatide regarding bone mineral density (BMD) and osteocalcin. Case 1 : A 62-year-old woman with multiple vertebral fractures has received corticoids for a long time. After starting teriparatide, her BMD and osteocalcin increased. She then received ibandronate for 3 years but her BMD declined. After a second treatment with teriparatide, her BMD increased again (18%). Case 2 : A 60-year-old woman with severe osteoporosis in lumbar spine (LS) (T-score - 4.5) had received corticoids for a long time and had celiac disease. After starting teriparatide, her BMD improved by 11.7%. She then received zoledronic acid for 15 months, but bone density decreased, so she was retreated with teriparatide. BMD had a slightly higher increase than after the first cycle (12.6%). Case 3 : A 60-year-old woman consulted for osteoporosis (LS T-score - 5.3), several fractures, and hyperthyroidism. She started teriparatide with improvement in BMD (39%). After 24 months, she received ibandronate for 1 year, but as her BMD declined, she was retreated with teriparatide. BMD showed an increase of 15%. The indication of a second cycle of treatment with teriparatide in three patients was effective in increasing BMD. Additional studies are needed to further identify the benefits and safety of retreatment with teriparatide.
28420202	Cereal Consumption among Subjects with Celiac Disease: A Snapshot for Nutritional Considerations.	BACKGROUND: To our knowledge no study has focused on the pattern of cereal-based products (CBP) consumption among people with celiac disease (CD). Our study aimed at evaluating the dietary intake of CBP among patients with CD and comparing it with a control population. METHODS: Eighty-two volunteers with CD and 77 non-CD volunteers enrolled throughout Italy were asked to register their consumption of CBP on specific diaries for three days. RESULTS: CD patients' median three-day intake of biscuits and crackers was higher compared to controls (65.8 g vs. 22.7 g and 44.7 g vs. 10.6 g, p < 0.05 respectively, Mann-Whitney test). A significant difference was observed also comparing the two groups for median three-day bread consumption, with the CD group consuming less bread than controls (109.5 g vs. 150.7 g, p < 0.05, Mann-Whitney test). When assessing regional and gender-related CBP consumption patterns, significantly higher rice consumption was found among CD women from Northern Italy compared to CD women from Central and Southern Italy (p = 0.006 and p = 0.002 respectively, Fisher's exact test). No other significant differences were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide a snapshot of the overall consumption of CBP among Italian subjects with CD. Altogether, these data show that, despite minor differences, dietary consumption of CBP among CD patients is similar to the general population.
28814219	Coeliac disease: review of diagnosis and management.	Coeliac disease is an immune-mediated systemic disease triggered by exposure to gluten, and manifested by small intestinal enteropathy and gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms. Recent guidelines recommend a concerted use of clear definitions of the disease. In Australia, the most recent estimated prevalence is 1.2% in adult men (1:86) and 1.9% in adult women (1:52). Active case finding is appropriate to diagnose coeliac disease in high risk groups. Diagnosis of coeliac disease is important to prevent nutritional deficiency and long term risk of gastrointestinal malignancy. The diagnosis of coeliac disease depends on clinico-pathological correlation: history, presence of antitransglutaminase antibodies, and characteristic histological features on duodenal biopsy (when the patient is on a gluten-containing diet). Human leucocyte antigen class II haplotypes DQ2 or DQ8 are found in nearly all patients with coeliac disease, but are highly prevalent in the general population at large (56% in Australia) and testing can only exclude coeliac disease for individuals with non-permissive haplotypes. Adhering to a gluten free diet allows duodenal mucosal healing and alleviates symptoms. Patients should be followed up with a yearly review of dietary adherence and a health check. Non-coeliac gluten or wheat protein sensitivity is a syndrome characterised by both gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms related to the ingestion of gluten and possibly other wheat proteins in people who do not have coeliac disease or wheat allergy recognised by diagnostic tests.
30597204	Lack of Follow-up of Pediatric Patients With Celiac Disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is often diagnosed in childhood, and the treatment is a lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD).1,2 It may take several years to gain competence in the skills required to follow a GFD successfully. Inadequately treated CD is associated with bone fractures, nutritional deficiencies, and lymphoma.3,4 Healthcare providers are key resources for patients with CD. Consultation with a dietitian with GFD expertise at diagnosis and annual disease-specific follow-up care are recommended.2,5 The primary objective of this study was to evaluate adherence to guidelines for dietitian consultation and follow-up for children with CD. A secondary objective was to identify factors associated with loss to follow-up.
30363819	Recent advances in understanding non-celiac gluten sensitivity.	Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a condition characterized by intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms related to the ingestion of gluten-containing foods in the absence of celiac disease and wheat allergy. The diagnosis is cumbersome and currently confirmed only by gluten withdrawal and double-blind placebo challenge protocols. There is great overlap in symptoms between NCGS and other functional gastrointestinal disorders, making a differential diagnosis difficult. The pathophysiology of NCGS is largely unclear, and there are contrasting data on the trigger of this condition. This review will highlight the state-of-the-art knowledge on NCGS and the key open questions.
29160841	The Overlapping Area of Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity (NCGS) and Wheat-Sensitive Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS): An Update.	Gluten-related disorders have recently been reclassified with an emerging scientific literature supporting the concept of non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). New research has specifically addressed prevalence, immune mechanisms, the recognition of non-immunoglobulin E (non-IgE) wheat allergy and overlap of NCGS with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-type symptoms. This review article will provide clinicians with an update that directly impacts on the management of a subgroup of their IBS patients whose symptoms are triggered by wheat ingestion.
28319607	Reduced Bone Mineral Density in Children With Screening-detected Celiac Disease.	OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to assess whether bone mass and metabolism are impaired in genetically at-risk children with screening-detected celiac disease. METHODS: Included were 71 children with screening-detected celiac disease diagnosed at 10.0 +- 0.7 (mean +- standard deviation) years and 142 matched controls and 30 children with screening-detected celiac disease diagnosed at 3.3 +- 0.4 years of age presently on a gluten-free diet for 6.9 +- 1.1 years and 60 matched controls. All participants were assessed for bone mineral density (BMD) of total body and spine by dual x-ray absorptiometry, serum 25(OH) vitamin D3, parathyroid hormone (PTH), interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-15, interferon gamma, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. RESULTS: At diagnosis, screening-detected celiac disease children as compared to controls had a mean -0.03 g/cm reduced BMD of both total body and spine (P = 0.009 and P = 0.005, respectively), a mean -11.4 nmol/L lower level of 25(OH) vitamin D3 (P < 0.001), and a mean +1.0 pmol/L higher PTH level (P < 0.001). Systemic levels of the cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, and tumor necrosis factor alpha were all increased in screening-detected celiac disease as compared to controls (P < 0.001). No difference in BMD, 25(OH) vitamin D3, PTH, and cytokine levels were detected in children on a gluten-free diet compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: Children with screening-detected celiac disease have reduced BMD, lower levels of vitamin D3, higher levels of PTH, and signs of systemic inflammation compared with controls. These differences were not found in celiac disease children on a gluten-free diet, indicating that children with screening-detected celiac disease benefit from an early diagnosis and treatment.
24253051	Lectin staining shows no evidence of involvement of glycocalyx/mucous layer carbohydrate structures in development of celiac disease.	The presence of unique carbohydrate structures in the glycocalyx/mucous layer of the intestine may be involved in a susceptibility to celiac disease (CD) by serving as attachment sites for bacteria. This host-microbiota interaction may influence the development of CD and possibly other diseases with autoimmune components. We examined duodenal biopsies from a total of 30 children, of which 10 had both celiac disease (CD) and type 1 diabetes (T1D); 10 had CD alone; and 10 were suspected of having gastrointestinal disease, but had normal duodenal histology (non-CD controls). Patients with both CD and T1D were examined before and after remission following a gluten-free diet. We performed lectin histochemistry using peanut agglutinin (PNA) and Ulex europaeus agglutinin (UEA) staining for Gal-beta(1,3)-GalNAc and Fucalpha1-2Gal-R, respectively, of the glycocalyx/mucous layer. The staining was scored based on dissemination of stained structures on a scale from 0 to 3. Evaluation of the scores revealed no difference between biopsies obtained before and after remission in the group of children with both CD and T1D. A comparison of this pre-remission group with the children who had CD alone or the non-CD controls also showed no significant differences. Based on our material, we found no indication that the presence of Gal-beta(1,3)-GalNAc or Fucalpha1-2Gal-R is involved in the susceptibility to CD, or that the disease process affects the expression of these carbohydrates. 
38337623	Study Protocol for a Controlled Trial of Nutrition Education Intervention about Celiac Disease in Primary School: ZELIAKIDE Project.	The only treatment for celiac disease (CD) is a strict and lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD), which must be safe and nutritionally balanced. Avoiding gluten brings difficulties with following the diet and can affect the social life of people with CD. The Zeliakide Project is a nutrition education program aimed at increasing the knowledge of the general population about healthy diets, CD and GFD, and, therefore, to improve the social inclusion and quality of life of people with CD. It is a one-month intervention program, two-armed cluster, non-randomised and controlled trial, conducted among 10-12-year-old children. Pre- and post-intervention evaluation and 1 month follow-up will be carried out to assess the effectiveness of the program. It is based on competencies and their respective learning outcomes. The teaching methodology chosen is a STEAM methodology: inquiry-based learning (IBL). A teaching unit has been created to develop the project, which, in the future, will be useful for the self-application of the program. This study will provide a valid and useful tool to achieve changes in the diet at the school level and will help to promote the social inclusion of people with CD. Moreover, it will enforce the STEAM competences of children.
28112686	Value of IgA tTG in Predicting Mucosal Recovery in Children With Celiac Disease on a Gluten-Free Diet.	OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to determine the rate of mucosal recovery in pediatric patients with celiac disease on a gluten-free diet. We also sought to determine whether immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase (tTG) correlates with mucosal damage at the time of a repeat endoscopy with duodenal biopsy in these patients. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of 103 pediatric patients, younger than 21 years, with a diagnosis of celiac disease defined as Marsh 3 histology, and who underwent a repeat endoscopy with duodenal biopsy at least 12 months after initiating a gluten-free diet. RESULTS: We found that 19% of pediatric patients treated with a gluten-free diet had persistent enteropathy. At the time of the repeat biopsy, tTG was elevated in 43% of cases with persistent enteropathy and 32% of cases in which there was mucosal recovery. Overall the positive predictive value of the autoantibody tTG was 25% and the negative predictive value was 83% in patients on a gluten-free diet for a median of 2.4 years. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly 1 in 5 children with celiac disease in our population had persistent enteropathy despite maintaining a gluten-free diet and immunoglobulin A tTG was not an accurate marker of mucosal recovery. Neither the presence of symptoms nor positive serology were predictive of a patient's histology at the time of repeat biopsy. These findings suggest a revisitation of monitring and management criteria of celiac disease in childhood.
27341511	Nonceliac gluten sensitivity: an approach to diagnosis and management.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Symptoms attributed to gluten consumption are frequently reported evoking the need for differentiating nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) from other gluten-related disorders such as celiac disease and wheat allergy. This review discusses diagnostic criteria and research to date on the pathogenesis and diagnosis of NCGS. RECENT FINDINGS: There is recent evidence to support NCGS as a distinct clinical entity. The symptoms attributed to NCGS are nonspecific, overlapping with those reported in patients with celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome. In contrast to celiac disease and wheat allergy, the diagnosis of NCGS is more challenging because there are no specific clinical biomarkers and because the pathogenesis of NCGS is largely not well understood. The pathogenesis of NCGS may reflect alterations in innate immunity to gluten or other components of wheat, may be linked with autoimmunity, or is a result of a reaction to gluten as a fermentable carbohydrate. SUMMARY: NCGS is a newly characterized and evolving clinical entity that requires ruling out other causes of wheat-related or gluten-related gastrointestinal symptoms, including celiac disease and wheat allergy, coupled with double-blind placebo-controlled crossover challenge with gluten.
21881981	Behcet disease and celiac disease: to screen or not?	
25224082	Gluten content of barium sulfate suspensions used for barium swallows in patients with celiac disease.	PURPOSE: To determine the availability and accuracy of information provided by hospitals, imaging centers, and manufacturers regarding gluten in barium sulfate suspensions. METHODS: A total of 105 facilities were contacted via telephone to determine the gluten content of the contrast media used in those facilities. Manufacturers were contacted and their Web sites reviewed to determine the gluten content of their barium products. RESULTS: Thirty-nine percent of the hospitals and 52% of the imaging centers were not aware of the gluten content of the contrast media they used. Twenty-nine-and-a-half percent of the respondents provided the correct gluten content. The manufacturers noted that 5 products were tested and confirmed gluten free, 1 product was not tested but described as gluten free, 1 product's gluten content depended upon its flavor, and 1 product was reported to contain gluten. DISCUSSION: Clinicians caring for patients with celiac disease or patients who choose to restrict their gluten consumption must ensure that the barium sulfate suspension ingested is gluten free. CONCLUSION: It can be difficult to determine the gluten content of barium sulfate, as a majority of radiology departments and imaging centers did not know whether the product they use is gluten free. Educating staff members and improving product labeling would benefit the quality of care provided to patients with celiac disease.
24152750	Maize prolamins could induce a gluten-like cellular immune response in some celiac disease patients.	Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune-mediated enteropathy triggered by dietary gluten in genetically prone individuals. The current treatment for CD is a strict lifelong gluten-free diet. However, in some CD patients following a strict gluten-free diet, the symptoms do not remit. These cases may be refractory CD or due to gluten contamination; however, the lack of response could be related to other dietary ingredients, such as maize, which is one of the most common alternatives to wheat used in the gluten-free diet. In some CD patients, as a rare event, peptides from maize prolamins could induce a celiac-like immune response by similar or alternative pathogenic mechanisms to those used by wheat gluten peptides. This is supported by several shared features between wheat and maize prolamins and by some experimental results. Given that gluten peptides induce an immune response of the intestinal mucosa both in vivo and in vitro, peptides from maize prolamins could also be tested to determine whether they also induce a cellular immune response. Hypothetically, maize prolamins could be harmful for a very limited subgroup of CD patients, especially those that are non-responsive, and if it is confirmed, they should follow, in addition to a gluten-free, a maize-free diet. 
27672287	Anemia and iron deficiency in gastrointestinal and liver conditions.	Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is associated with a number of pathological gastrointestinal conditions other than inflammatory bowel disease, and also with liver disorders. Different factors such as chronic bleeding, malabsorption and inflammation may contribute to IDA. Although patients with symptoms of anemia are frequently referred to gastroenterologists, the approach to diagnosis and selection of treatment as well as follow-up measures is not standardized and suboptimal. Iron deficiency, even without anemia, can substantially impact physical and cognitive function and reduce quality of life. Therefore, regular iron status assessment and awareness of the clinical consequences of impaired iron status are critical. While the range of options for treatment of IDA is increasing due to the availability of effective and well-tolerated parenteral iron preparations, a comprehensive overview of IDA and its therapy in patients with gastrointestinal conditions is currently lacking. Furthermore, definitions and assessment of iron status lack harmonization and there is a paucity of expert guidelines on this topic. This review summarizes current thinking concerning IDA as a common co-morbidity in specific gastrointestinal and liver disorders, and thus encourages a more unified treatment approach to anemia and iron deficiency, while offering gastroenterologists guidance on treatment options for IDA in everyday clinical practice. 
30868254	[Dermatitis herpetiformis].	Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a genetically determined, gluten sensitive autoimmune bullous dermatosis related to celiac disease in which granular, insoluble aggregates in the papillary dermis of epidermal transglutaminase (TG3), immunoglobulin A (IgA), and fibrinogen are present. Detection of the dermal IgA-TG3 immune complex is the gold standard of diagnosis. DH develops in a subpopulation of patients with gluten sensitive enteropathy, characterized by itching, erythematous, excoriated papules showing characteristic distribution over the knees, elbows and buttocks; vesicles are rarely seen. The primary therapy of DH is a strict, lifelong gluten-free diet, and it may be necessary to temporarily give dapsone in case of severe symptoms.
23164686	Video capsule endoscopy in patients with nonresponsive celiac disease.	GOALS AND BACKGROUND: Discriminating between patients with nonresponsive but otherwise uncomplicated celiac disease (CD) and patients with refractory celiac disease (RCD) and/or lymphoma is difficult, especially as many abnormalities encountered in complicated CD are not within reach of conventional gastroduodenoscopy. We aimed to describe video capsule endoscopy (VCE) findings in patients with CD and persisting or relapsing symptoms despite a gluten-free diet and to identify VCE findings associated with poor prognosis. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 48 VCE studies performed in adult patients with CD because of persisting or relapsing symptoms despite adherence to a gluten-free diet. Patients with either uncomplicated CD or RCD type I were considered to have a good prognosis, whereas patients with either RCD type II or enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma were considered to have a poor prognosis. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify VCE findings independently associated with either good or poor prognosis. RESULTS: Proximal focal erythema (odds ratio, 6.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-38.7; P=0.033) and absence of progression of the capsule to the distal intestine (odds ratio, 16.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-224.9; P=0.035) were independently associated with poor prognosis. Of the 28 patients with none of these 2 features, none died during follow-up, compared with 2 (13.3%) of the 15 patients with one of both features, and 4 (80.0%) of the 5 patients with both the features. CONCLUSIONS: VCE is a minimally invasive endoscopic modality that could be of use in identifying patients with nonresponsive CD who are at risk of poor prognosis.
35282714	Adherence to the Mediterranean diet is linked to reduced psychopathology in female celiac disease patients.	Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic enteropathy, affecting approximately 1% of the population worldwide with a higher prevalence in women. Recent studies demonstrate that CD is associated with an increased prevalence of psychopathology. The present study was undertaken to investigate the relationship between adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (MD) and psychopathological symptoms among CD patients, since the MD is a physical and mental health protective dietary regimen, which can easily be rendered gluten-free. A total of 134 CD patients (28 males and 106 females) were included in the study. Psychopathology was evaluated with the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R), and MD adherence was calculated using the Mediterranean Dietary Serving Score (MDSS). As regards psychopathological symptoms, female patients presented with statistically significant higher depression and anxiety than males. The majority of patients (64.9%) had low adherence to the MD (MDSS <14) with a mean score of 9.44 +- 3.26 and 9.14 +- 3.07 for men and women, respectively, out of a total of 24 points. High MD adherence was observed in 35.7% of the male and 34.9% of the female patients, with a mean score of 16.40 +- 2.63 and 16.35 +- 2.12, respectively. Interestingly, MD adherence was inversely associated with the intensity of several psychopathological symptoms in female patients, which represented the majority of the sample. The results of the study underline the need to encourage CD patients to adapt to a Mediterranean-style GFD.
26048849	Functionality of alternative protein in gluten-free product development.	Celiac disease is an immune-mediated disease triggered in genetically susceptible individuals by ingested gluten from wheat, rye, barley, and other closely related cereal grains. The current treatment for celiac disease is life-long adherence to a strict gluten-exclusion diet. The replacement of gluten presents a significant technological challenge, as it is an essential structure-building protein, which is necessary for formulating high-quality baked goods. A major limitation in the production of gluten-free products is the lack of protein functionality in non-wheat cereals. Additionally, commercial gluten-free mixes usually contain only carbohydrates, which may significantly limit the amount of protein in the diet. In the recent past, various approaches are attempted to incorporate protein-based ingredients and to modify the functional properties for gluten-free product development. This review aims to the highlight functionality of the alternative protein-based ingredients, which can be utilized for gluten-free product development both functionally as well as nutritionally. 
35807762	An Evaluation of Nutritional Status and Problems with Dietary Compliance in Polish Patients with Celiac Disease.	Celiac disease (CD, enteropathy) is a genetic autoimmune disease (abnormal immune response that attacks healthy tissues) associated with gluten intolerance. The aim of this study was to evaluate and monitor the nutritional status of CD patients, explore the problems associated with diet planning and dietary adherence among children and adults, and assess the impact of these factors on the persistence of CD symptoms. This study was carried out as part of the project entitled "A gluten-free diet without obstacles-eating well and healthy" (POWR 03.01.00-00-T153/18), conducted in Lublin Voivodeship. The study involved 87 persons, including 23 children younger than 18. At the beginning of the study and after nine months, all adult participants (older than 18) were subjected to a body composition analysis with the SECA mBCA 515 analyzer. During the project, the participants attended three consultations with a dietician. During each visit, the subjects' body weight, nutritional status and diets were evaluated; their diets were modified, and problems relating to dietary adherence were resolved. The initial body composition analysis revealed a risk of sarcopenic obesity in 30% of adult participants, in particular in women (p = 0.003) older than 45 (p = 0.001). The risk of being underweight was diagnosed in 25% of the subjects, in particular, in women younger than 35 (p = 0.0023) and in participants who had been affected by short stature and underweight in childhood, i.e., before CD diagnosis (p = 0.0024). The analysis demonstrated that patients with gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting) of CD were significantly more likely to avoid even accidental exposure to gluten and were more likely to strictly follow GFD recommendations (1.97; 95CI:1.56-2.12, p = 0.0001) and safety guidelines when preparing meals at home (1.76; 95CI: 1.34-192, p = 0.0023). Parents, in particular, parents of toddlers and preschoolers who are at significantly higher risk of CD, adhered strictly to dietary guidelines and did not allow for any exceptions when preparing meals (1.88; 95CI: 1.53-2.09, p = 0.001). Persons at risk of malnutrition were also far less likely to deliberately choose gluten-containing foods (0.74; 95CI: 0.53-0.91, p = 0.021), in particular, patients with Marsh type 3a and 3b classification (p = 0.01) and persons whose intestinal histology scores did not fully improve after switching to a GFD. An assessment of the effectiveness of diet therapy based on the phase angle revealed that dietary recommendations had a positive impact on patients who had been recently diagnosed with CD. In all age groups, the main problem was accidental exposure to gluten, in particular in foods that were not labeled with the crossed grain symbol. A comparative analysis of CDAT questionnaires revealed that dietary advice on eating out significantly improved adherence to a GFD and reduced the frequency of unintentional gluten exposure in all age groups.
21621350	[Complications of celiac disease].	Numerous complications can occur in celiac disease, nutritional (growth failure in children, malnutrition, vitamin deficiencies), hematologic (anaemia), bone disease (osteoporosis, fracture), gynaecologic (hypo fertility), cardiovascular (coronaropathy, venous thrombosis), neurological (peripheral neuropathy), hepatic (cytolysis, cirrhosis). Celiac disease is associated with an increased risk of autoimmune diseases (type 1 diabetes, thyroiditis), and cancer (upper digestive tract, hepatocellular carcinoma, lymphoma). The main digestive complications are microscopic colitis and refractory sprue, which are resistant to gluten-free diet. It can be associated with a monoclonal proliferation of intraepithelial lymphocytes (type 2 refractory sprue), which may be considered as a cryptic lymphoma and can lead to invasive T lymphoma, which occurs in one celiac patient in 1000. Gluten-free diet protects from the occurrence of most complications and correct the over-mortality related to these complications.
21939908	Nutrition and celiac disease.	Celiac disease affects about 1% of the European and North American population. The classical clinical presentation is with symptoms of malabsorption. Serologic studies demonstrate that most celiac patients present with oligosymptomatic (silent), latent, potential, and extraintestinal forms. The disease is defined as an immune-mediated systemic disorder of genetically disposed individuals (HLA-DQ2/8) induced by the alcohol-soluble fractions of cereals and characterized by gluten-dependent symptoms, celiac-specific antibodies (against tissue transglutaminase 2), and a Marsh 2-3 enteropathy. In the last 60 years, a strict and lifelong gluten-free diet has been demonstrated to be effective and safe, preventing most potential complications of the disease, including autoimmune disease, osteoporosis, infertility, prematurity, and malignancy. Among patients with celiac disease, the toxicity of oats seems to be less than wheat, barley, and rye. The introduction of oats into the diet of patients with celiac disease should increase taste, fiber content, diversity, compliance with the diet, and quality of life. The clinical studies provide limited results in favor of a general harmlessness of oats for celiac disease patients. Patients with celiac disease who consume oats (20-25 g/d for children, 50-70 g/d for adults) need proper follow-up.
33572226	Gluten and Autism Spectrum Disorder.	An expanding body of literature is examining connections between Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and dietary interventions. While a number of specialist diets have been suggested as beneficial in ASD, gluten has received particularly close attention as a potentially exacerbating factor. Reports exist suggesting a beneficial effect of the gluten-free diet (GFD) in ameliorating behavioural and intellectual problems associated with ASD, while epidemiological research has also shown a comorbidity between ASD and coeliac disease. However, both caregivers and clinicians have expressed an uncertainty of the value of people with ASD going gluten-free, and as the GFD otherwise receives considerable public attention a discussion which focuses specifically on the interaction between ASD and gluten is warranted. In this review we discuss the historical context of ASD and gluten-related studies, and expand this to include an overview of epidemiological links, hypotheses of shared pathological mechanisms, and ultimately the evidence around the use and adoption of the GFD in people with ASD.
32716701	Celiac Disease Remission With Tofacitinib: A Case Report.	
24164320	Adipokine profile in celiac patients: differences in comparison with patients suffering from diarrhea-predominant IBS and healthy subjects.	OBJECTIVE. The role of adipokines such as resistin, leptin, and adiponectin could be pivotal in the molecular crosstalk between the inflamed intestine and the surrounding mesenteric adipose tissue. Our aims were to a) evaluate their circulating concentrations in patients with active celiac disease (ACD) and compare them to those in patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-d) and healthy subjects; b) establish the impact of genetic variability in resistin; and c) evaluate whether a 1-year gluten-free diet (GFD) modifies circulating concentrations of resistin, leptin, and adiponectin in celiac patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS. The study included 34 ACD patients, 29 IBS-d patients, and 27 healthy controls. Circulating concentrations of resistin, leptin, adiponectin, IL-6, and IL-8 were evaluated at the time of enrollment. Resistin +299 G/A polymorphism was also analysed. In CD patients, biochemical measurements were repeated after a 1-year GFD. RESULTS. Along with higher IL-6 and IL-8 plasma levels, higher resistin and adiponectin concentrations were found in ACD and IBS-d patients compared with controls (p: 0.0351 and p: 0.0020, respectively). Resistin values proved to be predictable from a linear combination of IL-8 and +299 polymorphism. GFD affected resistin (p: 0.0009), but not leptin and adiponectin concentrations. CONCLUSIONS. Our data suggest that these adipokines are involved in modulating inflammatory processes in both CD and IBS-d patients. Alterations in the adipokine profile as well as the higher prevalence of the resistin +299 G/A SNP A allele compared to controls support the hypothesis that, at least in well-defined cases of IBS, a genetic component may also be supposed.
24720024	[Celiac disease is a common illness that is easy to miss].	
22971656	[Atypical celiac disease--diagnostic difficulties].	UNLABELLED: In predisposed individuals dietary intake of cereal products may lead to the development of food allergy or celiac disease. These diseases may also coexist with each other. In recent years, a change in the clinical picture of celiac disease has been observed and the incidence of atypical forms has increased. The disease is currently either diagnosed late or often remains undiagnosed. The article presents a case of an underweight 11- year old girl with height deficiency and recurrent respiratory infections, as well as chronic rhinitis, occurring from the age of three. On the basis of complex differential diagnosis, sensitization to tree pollens, and to cow's milk protein and gluten were identified. Despite the detection of antibodies specific for celiac disease, such as the antibodies against smooth muscle endomysium (IgAEMA) and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (IgAtTGAb), the histological confirmation of the diagnosis was not obtained. Implementation of the gluten and milk protein-free - elimination diet and the use of antihistamines resulted in clinical improvement and the disappearance of markers of both food sensitization and celiac disease. The second food provocation test was negative for previously detected markers of food sensitization but showed the presence of IgAEMA and IgAtTGAb and the histological features of intestinal mucosa typical for celiac disease. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of food allergy or other chronic diseases which can cause growth disturbance (short stature and/or impaired weight gain ) should not exempt from the obligation of estimating the markers specific for celiac disease.
35572547	NLRX1 Deficiency Alters the Gut Microbiome and Is Further Exacerbated by Adherence to a Gluten-Free Diet.	Patients with gluten sensitivities present with dysbiosis of the gut microbiome that is further exacerbated by a strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). A subtype of patients genetically susceptible to gluten sensitivities are Celiac Disease (CeD) patients, who are carriers of the HLA DR3/DQ2 or HLA DR4/DQ8 haplotypes. Although 85-95% of all CeD patients carry HLA DQ2, up to 25-50% of the world population carry this haplotype with only a minority developing CeD. This suggests that CeD and other gluten sensitivities are mediated by factors beyond genetics. The contribution of innate immune system signaling has been generally understudied in the context of gluten sensitivities. Thus, here we examined the role of NOD-like receptors (NLRs), a subtype of pattern recognition receptors, in maintaining the composition of the gut microbiome in animals maintained on a GFD. Human transcriptomics data revealed significant increases in the gene expression of multiple NLR family members, across functional groups, in patients with active CeD compared to control specimens. However, NLRX1 was uniquely down-regulated during active disease. NLRX1 is a negative regulatory NLR that functions to suppress inflammatory signaling and has been postulate to prevent inflammation-induced dysbiosis. Using Nlrx1-/- mice maintained on either a normal or gluten-free diet, we show that loss of NLRX1 alters the microbiome composition, and a distinctive shift further ensues following adherence to a GFD, including a reciprocal loss of beneficial microbes and increase in opportunistic bacterial populations. Finally, we evaluated the functional impact of an altered gut microbiome by assessing short- and medium-chain fatty acid production. These studies revealed significant differences in a selection of metabolic markers that when paired with 16S rRNA sequencing data could reflect an overall imbalance and loss of immune system homeostasis in the gastrointestinal system.
31837981	Infertility in women with systemic autoimmune diseases.	Infertility consists by definition in" failure to achieve a clinical pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected intercourse" while the term subfertility means a delay to achieve pregnancy. Several factors can contribute to infertility or subfertility in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases. The association of systemic autoimmune conditions with endometriosis, celiac disease and thyroid autoimmunity that are well known causes of infertility and/or subfertility need to be taken in consideration when difficulties in the onset of pregnancy is reported. The majority of the used antirheumatic drugs do not interfere with fertility. However, the use of cyclophosphamide, limited to severe disease, can provoke premature ovarian failure; to preserve fertility a preventive treatment is available. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can cause temporary infertility and corticosteroids are associated to a prolonged time to pregnancy in some rheumatic diseases. Data on the association of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) with infertility are still debated but in general an increased rate of aPL is described patients undergoing medically assisted reproductive techniques. In systemic lupus erythematosus aPL and other autoantibodies (i.e. anti-oocytes) can contribute to the infertility of some patients. Subfertility, rather than infertility, is observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis; the particular physical conditions of these women can also account for this. Physicians should not forget the patients' age, that is mandatory in order to preserve their chance to have children.
22136777	The role of capsule endoscopy in patients with nonresponsive celiac disease.	
29209126	Intestinal parameters of oxidative imbalance in celiac adults with extraintestinal manifestations.	AIM: To evaluate selected intestinal parameters of oxidative stress, and antioxidant capacity in adult celiac disease patients with extraintestinal manifestations. METHODS: The study involved 85 adult patients divided into the following subgroups: (1) patients with newly diagnosed celiac disease (CD) (n = 7); (2) celiac patients not adhering to a gluten-free diet (GFD) (n = 22); (3) patients with CD on the GFD (n = 31); and (4) patients with functional disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, serving as controls (n = 25). Celiac patients presented with non-classic symptoms or extraintestinal manifestations. Standard blood tests including serum antioxidant levels (uric acid, bilirubin, and vitamin D), celiac antibody levels, and histopathological status of duodenal biopsy specimens have been determined. The expression of mRNA for tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), interleukin 10 (IL-10), superoxide dismutase (SOD), heat-shock protein 70 (HSP-70), hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1alpha), and BAX in the duodenal mucosa of patients was analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The mean plasma uric acid level in patients with active CD (newly diagnosed and nonadherent patients) and treated celiac patients was significantly higher than in controls (260.17 +- 53.65 vs 190.8 +- 22.98, P < 0.001, and 261.7 +- 51.79 vs 190.8 +- 22.98, P < 0.001, respectively). The mean bilirubin concentration in active and treated celiac patients was significantly lower than in controls (8.23 +- 5.04 vs 10.48 +- 4.08, P < 0.05 and 8.06 +- 3.31 vs 10.48 +- 4.08, P < 0.05, respectively). The mean plasma vitamin D level was significantly lower in active celiac patients than in treated celiac patients and controls (19.37 +- 9.03 vs 25.15 +- 11.2, P < 0.05 and 19.37 +- 9.03 vs 29.67 +- 5.12, P < 0.001, respectively). The expression of TNF-alpha, IL-10, and HSP-70 mRNAs was significantly elevated in the celiac groups regardless of the diet when compared with controls. Patients on the GFD presented a significantly lower mRNA expression of TNF-alpha and IL-10 than in newly diagnosed and nonadherent patients (P < 0.05). The expression of SOD mRNA was significantly elevated in celiac patients compared with controls (P < 0.05), with a significant difference between treated and untreated patients (P < 0.05). The expression of HIF-1alpha mRNA and BAX mRNA was significantly higher in patients with active CD compared with controls and patients on GFD, while no difference was observed between the latter two groups. CONCLUSION: Increased intestinal expression of HSP-70 despite GFD indicates that GFD only partially reduced oxidative stress. CD patients exhibited an oxidative imbalance and inflammatory response despite GFD. Uric acid may act as an important antioxidant in CD.
35918825	Intravenous route for folate supplementation in a patient with celiac disease treated by pemetrexed-based chemotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer.	INTRODUCTION: Oral folic acid supplementation is essential for patients treated with pemetrexed, to prevent the risk of severe hematologic toxicity. In case of intestinal absorption disorder, no recommendations exist for intravenous folic acid supplementation. CASE REPORT: We describe a 74-year-old patient with multimetastatic non-small-cell lung adenocarcinoma, receiving first-line chemotherapy with carboplatin AUC5, pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 and pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks. The patient presented neglected celiac disease, resulting in malabsorption syndrome with iron and folic acid deficiency. The question was how to administer folic acid supplementation during the pemetrexed-based chemotherapy. MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOMES: Intravenous injection of 200 mg levoleucovorin on day 1 of cycle 1 of pemetrexed-based chemotherapy was administered and well tolerated. During the second cycle, the levoleucovorin perfusion was not renewed by omission. The patient was hospitalized for 7 days because of febrile aplasia. Piperacillin-tazobactam was started, and then switched to amoxicillin-clavulanate plus ciprofloxacin. After this episode of post-chemotherapy febrile aplasia, it was decided to systematically supplement the patient with intravenous levoleucovorin, with blood folate concentration monitoring at each cycle. At 16 months after start of treatment, the patient was in complete remission, indicating that the immune-chemotherapy was effective, with no further febrile neutropenia. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: This case report highlights intravenous levoleucovorin supplementation as an alternative to oral folic acid if needed during pemetrexed-antifolate-based chemotherapy.
22988822	Celiac disease arthropathy and autoimmunity study.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: To evaluate presence of sero-negative spondyloarthritis (SpA) in celiac disease (CD) patients, and whether compliance with a gluten free diet (GFD) improved arthritis manifestations in these patients. METHODS: We undertook a prospective, questionnaire based, cross-sectional cohort study to evaluate the presence or absence of SpA simultaneously in both CD and non-CD cohorts. RESULTS: 356/590 (60.3%) patients with CD participated in this study. 99% had diagnosis confirmed by a diagnostic test (79% small bowel biopsy, 19.8% blood test, 3.9% stool test). Approximately 131 (37%) cases of arthritis were reported in CD patients. Of the 6/356 CD patients with seronegative spondyloarthritides, four had sacroiliitis, two ankylosing spondylitis, and one psoriatic arthritis, compared to one ankylosing spondylitis and five psoriatic arthritis in non-CD. Osteoarthritis (89 vs 59, P = 0.93) was the most common diagnosis reported by respondents. More CD patients with diarrhea (94%) and anemia (81%) improved on GFD, compared to arthritis symptoms (30%). Autoimmune thyroiditis (10.6% vs 0.4%), insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) (2.2% vs 1.7%), systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE) (1.1% vs 0), and psoriasis (12.9% vs 5.5%) occurred more frequently in CD patients. The prevalence of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, Sjogren's syndrome, primary biliary cirrhosis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis was around 1% each. Univariate Logistic regression analysis showed <= high school education (odds ratio [OR] 2.01, P < 0.003), age >= 60 years (OR 4.13, P < 0.001), and osteoporosis (OR 2.78, P < 0.001) to be significantly associated with report of arthritis in CD patients. CONCLUSION: We did not find a high rate of SpA in CD patients. In contrast, increased rates of autoimmune thyroiditis, SLE, IDDM, and psoriasis were seen in CD.
25438612	Decrease in lactobacilli in the intestinal microbiota of celiac children with a gluten-free diet, and selection of potentially probiotic strains.	The intestinal microbiota would be implicated in pathology associated with celiac disease caused by an abnormal immune system reaction against gluten present in cereal grains. The objectives of this work were to detect through basic methods the changes in the composition of the most common genera of bacteria from the intestinal microbiota of symptom-free celiac disease children with a gluten-free diet compared with healthy children from Tucuman and to select lactobacilli (Lb) strains with probiotic potential from the feces of healthy children. Results demonstrated that the feces of celiac children with a gluten-free diet showed significantly lower counts of Lb (P < 0.05) compared with healthy children, while enterobacteria tended to increase in celiac children. On the basis of these results, isolation of some Lb from the feces of healthy children was carried out. Thus, 5 Lb strains were selected because of their high resistance percentages to gastrointestinal tract conditions. In addition, their autoaggregation and hydrophobicity properties were evaluated: Lactobacillus rhamnosus (LC4) showed the highest percentage of autoaggregation while Lactobacillus paracasei (LC9) showed high hydrophobicity. Based on these results, LC4 and LC9 were selected, and their use as potential probiotic strains to improve signs and symptoms associated with celiac disease is discussed. This is the first study performed in Argentina concerning the relationship between intestinal microbiota and celiac disease in celiac children with a gluten-free diet. In addition, the development of a probiotic food addressed towards celiac patients and designed with Lb isolated from the feces of healthy children from our province represents a promising alternative to improve the quality of life of celiac patients. 
21859913	Specific celiac disease antibodies in children on a gluten-free diet.	OBJECTIVE: Celiac disease (CD) is characterized by histologic alterations in small bowel biopsies. Circulating specific CD antibodies at the time of diagnosis and their disappearance after a gluten-free diet support the diagnosis of CD. We aimed to determine the behavior of the CD antibodies immunoglobulin A anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-TG2) and immunoglobulin A endomysium (EMA) in children with CD after starting a gluten-free diet. METHODS: This was a retrospective multicenter study in the Netherlands between 2001 and 2009. Inclusion criteria were all newly diagnosed patients with CD younger than 19 years who had at least 1 anti-TG2 and/or EMA measurement before and after starting a gluten-free diet. Eight different anti-TG2 kits were used with substrates of guinea pig TG2 in 1 (Sigma) and 7 human-recombinant TG2: Varelisa and EliA Celikey Phadia-GmbH; Orgentec Diagnostica-GmbH; Diarect AG; Roboscreen GmbH; Aeskulisa Diagnostics; Binding Site Ltd. EMA was analyzed with indirect immunofluorescence tests. Statistical analyses were performed by using mixed-model repeated measurements and survival analysis. RESULTS: There were 129 children with CD included (mean age: 5.6 years; SD +- 4.2). The mean concentration of anti-TG2 decreased significantly within 3 months after starting a gluten-free diet (P < .0001). The cumulative percentage of children who became negative for EMA after 1/2, 1, 11/2, and 2 years was 31%, 60%, 74%, and 87%, respectively. For anti-TG2, a comparable trend was shown: 35%, 55%, 64%, and 78%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Doctors taking care of children with CD should be aware that the mean concentration of anti-TG2 will show a 74% decrease (95% confidence interval: 69%-79%) after 3 months of gluten-free diet, and ~80% of the children will be sero-negative for EMA and anti-TG2 after 2 years of the diet.
34209932	Transamidation Down-Regulates Intestinal Immunity of Recombinant alpha-Gliadin in HLA-DQ8 Transgenic Mice.	Enzymatic transamidation of gliadins by microbial transglutaminase (mTG) inhibits interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) secretion by intestinal T cell lines in patients with celiac disease (CD). To gain insight into the cellular mechanisms underlying the down-regulatory effects of transamidation, we tested a single recombinant alpha-gliadin (r-gliadin) harbouring two immunodominant peptides, p13 (aa. 120-139) and p23 (aa. 220-239), in HLA-DQ8 transgenic mice, a model of gluten sensitivity. Mice were intranasally immunised with r-gliadin or r-gliadin transamidated by mTG (K-r-gliadin) along with cholera toxin, and the response of mesenteric lymph node cells was analysed by cytokine multiplex assay. An in vitro challenge with r-gliadin was characterised by secretion of specific cytokines featuring both innate immunity and the Th1/Th2/Th17 pattern of the adaptive response. Notably, transamidation specifically down-regulated the Th1 response. Structural studies performed on K-r-gliadin confirmed that specific glutamine residues in p13 and p23, previously found to be deamidated by tissue transglutaminase, were also transamidated by mTG. In silico analysis, simulating p13 and p23 peptide binding to HLA-DQ8 showed that these glutamines, in the form of glutamate, could interact by means of salt bridges with peculiar amino acids of the alpha chain of HLA-DQ8, suggesting that their transamidation may influence the HLA-restricted recognition of these peptides. Thus, the structural findings provided a rationale to explain the down-regulation of the r-gliadin-specific Th1 response following transamidation.
29933630	Cutaneous and Mucosal Manifestations Associated with Celiac Disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated, gluten-induced enteropathy that affects predisposed individuals of all ages. Many patients with CD do not report gastrointestinal symptoms making it difficult to reach an early diagnosis. On the other hand, CD is related to a wide spectrum of extra-intestinal manifestations, with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) being the best characterized. These associated conditions may be the clue to reaching the diagnosis of CD. Over the last few years, there have been multiple reports of the association between CD and several cutaneous manifestations that may improve with a gluten-free diet (GFD). The presence of some of these skin diseases, even in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms, should give rise to an appropriate screening method for CD. The aim of this paper is to describe the different cutaneous manifestations that have been associated with CD and the possible mechanisms involved.
34364399	Gluten in pharmaceutical products: a scoping review.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is one of the most common gluten-related disorders. Although the only effective treatment is a strict gluten-free diet, doubts remain as to whether healthcare professionals take this restriction into consideration when prescribing and dispensing medicines to susceptible patients. This scoping review aimed to find out the current evidence for initiatives that either describe the gluten content of medicines or intend to raise awareness about the risk of prescribing and dispensing gluten-containing medicines in patients with CD and other gluten-related disorders. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted using three search strategies in PubMed/MEDLINE, TripDatabase and Web of Science in April 2021, following the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR). References from included articles were also examined. Two researchers screened the articles and results were classified according to their main characteristics and outcomes, which were grouped according to the PCC (Population, Concept and Context) framework. The initiatives described were classified into three targeted processes related to gluten-containing medicines: prescription, dispensation and both prescription and dispensation. RESULTS: We identified a total of 3146 records. After the elimination of duplicates, 3062 articles remained and ultimately 13 full texts were included in the narrative synthesis. Most studies were conducted in the US, followed by Canada and Australia, which each published one article. Most strategies were focused on increasing health professional's knowledge of gluten-containing/gluten-free medications (n = 8), which were basically based on database development from manufacturer data. A wide variability between countries on provided information and labelling of gluten-containing medicines was found. CONCLUSION: Initiatives regarding the presence of gluten in medicines, including, among others, support for prescribers, the definition of the role of pharmacists, and patients' adherence problems due to incomplete labelling of the medicines, have been continuously developed and adapted to the different needs of patients. However, information is still scarce, and some aspects have not yet been considered, such as effectiveness for the practical use of solutions to support healthcare professionals.
39125392	Knowledge Gaps in Gluten-Free Diet Awareness among Patients and Healthcare Professionals: A Call for Enhanced Nutritional Education.	Diet is the only treatment for celiac disease (CeD), and good adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only way to ensure complete remission and to prevent complications. Limited education about the disease and a GFD is an attributing factor to inadequate adherence. Thus, our aim was to assess the current knowledge about a GFD and the clinical monitoring of adherence to the diet among CeD people and HCPs. Specific questionnaires were designed and distributed to assess the knowledge of CeD people (Q1 questionnaire) (n = 2437) and to analyze the follow-up of the disease from the perspective of patients (Q2 questionnaire) (n = 1294) and HCPs (Q3 questionnaire) (n = 346). Two-thirds of HCPs specialized in pediatric care, while one-third did so in adult care. In CeD people, general questions regarding food classification and cross-contamination are well understood. When patients have doubts, 51.4% reported using the Internet and social networks. Thus, it is crucial that resources like social media are reliable and provide valuable information. Q3 revealed the lack of time to follow up the diet after diagnosis (48% of HCPs allocate < 15 min), the interest in further training, and the need for a professional specialized in diets within the healthcare system. In conclusion, it is essential to enhance nutritional education to increase awareness of a GFD.
37400855	Awareness of celiac disease among the public in Kuwait: a cross-sectional survey.	OBJECTIVE: Health literacy levels among the general population predict better health outcomes and uptake of health services. Inequities in health literacy and uptake of health services are often observed in deprived neighborhoods. There is a paucity of data on literacy regarding celiac disease in Kuwait. Therefore, the present survey aims to address this paucity of data. RESULTS: We conducted a survey of 350 respondents in six governates of Kuwait. Although around 51% of respondents were aware of peanut allergy and gluten sensitivity, less than 15% were aware of celiac disease. More than 40% of respondents reported that a gluten-free diet should be promoted for everyone. Better awareness regarding CD was associated with Kuwaiti nationality, higher education levels and higher age. Among different governates, residents of Al-Asimah reported the highest awareness levels, while the rest of the governates did not differ significantly. While eating behavior did not significantly predict awareness regarding CD.
24444577	Celiac disease: diagnosis and management.	Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. It is triggered by exposure to dietary gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. Gluten is a storage protein in wheat, rye, and barley, which are staples in many American diets. Celiac disease is characterized by chronic inflammation of the small intestinal mucosa, which leads to atrophy of the small intestinal villi and subsequent malabsorption. The condition may develop at any age. Intestinal manifestations include diarrhea and weight loss. Common extraintestinal manifestations include iron deficiency anemia, decreased bone mineral density, and neuropathy. Most cases of celiac disease are diagnosed in persons with extraintestinal manifestations. The presence of dermatitis herpetiformis is pathognomonic for celiac disease. Diagnosis is supported by a positive tissue transglutaminase serologic test but, in general, should be confirmed by a small bowel biopsy showing the characteristic histology associated with celiac disease. The presence of human leukocyte antigen alleles DQ2, DQ8, or both is essential for the development of celiac disease, and can be a useful genetic test in select instances. Treatment of celiac disease is a gluten-free diet. Dietary education should focus on identifying hidden sources of gluten, planning balanced meals, reading labels, food shopping, dining out, and dining during travel. About 5% of patients with celiac disease are refractory to a gluten-free diet. These patients should be referred to a gastroenterologist for reconsideration of the diagnosis or for aggressive treatment of refractory celiac disease, which may involve corticosteroids and immunomodulators. 
29912751	Diagnostic Accuracy of Point of Care Tests for Diagnosing Celiac Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	GOALS: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the overall diagnostic accuracy of point of care tests (POCTs) for diagnosing celiac disease (CD). BACKGROUND: Recently, POCTs for CD have been developed and are commercially available. Studies have reported significant variability in their sensitivity (70% to 100%) and specificity (85% to 100%). STUDY: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE databases, and the Cochrane library through June 2017. Positive reference test was defined as villous atrophy along with positive celiac-specific serology and/or clinical improvement after gluten-free diet. Normal duodenal biopsy was defined as negative reference test. Bivariate random-effect model was used to present the summary estimates of sensitivities and specificities along with 95% confidence regions We assessed methodologic quality using the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies-2 tool. RESULTS: The pooled sensitivity and specificity of all POCTs (based on tTG or DGP or tTG+Anti-gliadin antibodies) for diagnosing CD were 94.0% [95% confidence interval (CI), 89.9-96.5] and 94.4% (95% CI, 90.9-96.5), respectively. The pooled positive and negative likelihood ratios for POCTs were 16.7 and 0.06, respectively. The pooled sensitivity and specificity for IgA-tTG-based POCTs were 90.5% (95% CI, 82.3-95.1) and 94.8% (95% CI, 92.5-96.4), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The pooled sensitivity and specificity of POCTs in diagnosing CD are high. POCTs may be used to screen for CD, especially in areas with limited access to laboratory-based testing. Further research assessing the diagnostic accuracy of individual POCTs and comparing it with other available POCTs is needed.
29413009	Nutritional Consideration in Celiac Disease and Nonceliac Gluten Sensitivity.	Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder due to the inflammatory response to gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. It causes an enteropathy associated with several nutritional complications. Strict compliance to a gluten-free diet (GFD) is the current primary therapy. Nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a condition in which gluten ingestion leads to systemic symptoms but is not associated with small bowel atrophy or abnormal celiac serologies. A GFD heals celiac disease enteropathy and improves symptoms in NCGS. However, a long-term GFD can be associated with nutritional deficiencies and requires monitoring and guidance.
36609792	The effects of probiotics on gastrointestinal symptoms and microbiota in patients with celiac disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis on clinical trials.	Gluten-free diet (GFD) is the most effective method to manage celiac disease (CD). Many patients do not reach the complete symptom alleviation, even by strict GFD. Recent studies have reported inconsistent results regarding the beneficial benefits of taking probiotics. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the effects of probiotics on gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and the possible underlying causes in CD and celiac disease autoimmunity (CDA) patients. Databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science and Google Scholar, were searched for clinical trials published until July 2022 about assessing the effects of probiotics or synbiotics on CD or CDA patients. We collected data on GI symptoms, CD markers, inflammatory and immune responses, adverse events, and gut microbiota. A random effect meta-analysis was used to estimate the pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) and confidence interval (CI). We screened 7234 articles, of which 14 were included in the qualitative analysis and 5 in the quantitative analysis. Probiotics might alleviate GI symptoms, especially in the highly symptomatic patients, and improve immune response in CD and CDA patients. Results of the meta-analysis showed that probiotics increased the abundance of Bifidobacterium (SMD: 0.72, 95%CI (0.13, 1.30) and Lactobacillus (SMD: 0.49, 95%CI (0.18, 0.80) as compared with placebo. Probiotics did not increase the adverse events compared to the placebo. Probiotics might alleviate GI symptoms and immune response and improve dysbiosis in CD and CDA patients. However, high-quality clinical trials are needed to increase the level of evidence. Also, the most suitable combination of probiotics is yet to find.
34877633	Impact of Corona Virus Disease 2019 pandemic on adherence to gluten-free diet in Indian patients with celiac disease.	AIMS: Lockdown and restricted mobility due to the pandemic of corona virus disease  2019 (COVID-19) has severely affected the continuity of healthcare of patients with acute and chronic diseases. We evaluated the impact of COVID-19 on the adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD), symptom control, and quality of life (QOL) in patients with celiac disease (CeD). METHODS: A questionnaire, consisting of both ad-hoc and validated questions, was created after review of literature, group discussions, and expert meetings. Standardized questionnaires namely CeD adherence test (CDAT), celiac symptom index score, and CeD-related QOL were used. The web-based questionnaire was sent to 3130 patients via social media and 452 responses (14.4%) were received. Also, additional 68 patients (not available on any social media application) were interviewed telephonically by a trained dietitian. RESULTS: Overall, 505 patients (females: 318; mean age: 24.1+-14.2 years) were included. While only 6.7% (n = 34) had poor compliance to GFD (CDAT > 17) before COVID-19 pandemic, it almost doubled to 12.6% (n = 64) during the COVID-19 pandemic times (p = 0.02). Furthermore, 4.9% (n = 25) of patients were diagnosed contacting  COVID-19. Interestingly, 73.2% (n = 370) patients preferred online appointment than physical appointment. Most common difficulties faced during lockdown period were high delivery charges for getting gluten-free (GF) food at home (54.4%), increased prices of regular GF food (43.1%), and travelling long distance to arrange GF food (44.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has substantially affected the adherence, symptom control, and QOL in patients with CeD, attributable to unavailability, shortage of money, and heightened cost of GF food. The pandemic has offered an opportunity to practice teleconsultation approach for patients with CeD.
24865778	Prevalence of a gluten-free diet and improvement of clinical symptoms in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.	BACKGROUND: Maintaining a gluten-free diet (GFD) without an underlying diagnosis of celiac disease has enjoyed widespread acceptance in the Unites States. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study using a GFD questionnaire in 1647 patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) participating in the CCFA Partners longitudinal Internet-based cohort. RESULTS: A diagnosis of celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity were reported by 10 (0.6%) and 81 (4.9%) respondents, respectively. Three hundred fourteen (19.1%) participants reported having previously tried a GFD and 135 (8.2%) reported current use of GFD. Overall 65.6% of all patients, who attempted a GFD, described an improvement of their gastrointestinal symptoms and 38.3% reported fewer or less severe IBD flares. In patients currently attempting a GFD, excellent adherence was associated with significant improvement of fatigue (P < 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: In this large group of patients with IBD, a substantial number had attempted a GFD, of whom the majority had some form of improvement in gastrointestinal symptoms. Testing a GFD in clinical practice in patients with significant intestinal symptoms, which are not solely explained by the degree of intestinal inflammation, has the potential to be a safe and highly efficient therapeutic approach. Further prospective studies into mechanisms of gluten sensitivity in IBD are warranted.
21894756	[Hematological disorders in celiac disease].	Gluten-sensitive celiac disease (GSCD) belongs to systemic diseases one of manifestations of which may be various hematological disorders. Some patients with GSCD have blood changes, anemia in particular, which precede clinical symptoms of celiac disease. Anemia can arise as a result of disorders in iron, folic acid and/or vitamin B12 absorption. Celiac disease can be associated with thrombocytosis, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, vein thrombosis, hyposplenism, immunoglobulin A deficiency. Patients with celiac disease have a high risk of lymphoma, especially of T-cell lymphoma associated with enteropathy, B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Aglutenic diet, recovery of structure and function of the small intestine eliminate or attenuate hematological disorders associated with GSCD.
32942892	Celiac disease in adults.	Celiac disease is a lifelong autoimmune disorder that occurs in genetically predisposed people when consuming gluten. Its prevalence is around 1% of the population with about twice higher proportion of women. Celiac disease is one of the most common causes of malabsorption, however, its manifestations can be quite diverse - from completely asymptomatic to fully developed malabsorption syndrome. Extraintestinal manifestations are a common finding in adults. The gold standard of diagnosis is the serological detection of specific antibodies (the serum tissue transglutaminase IgA antibodies) in combination with a typical histological finding from a duodenal biopsy. Causal treatment is a lifelong gluten-free diet. Strict adherence to gluten-free diet will reduce the risk of serious complications (intestinal T-cell lymphoma). In the following case report we present a case of a 58-year-old patient, who have been diagnosed with celiac disease at this age based on non-classical symptoms. Specifically, these were multiple pathological fractures from metabolic bone disease due to malabsorption of calcium and vitamin D and subsequent secondary hyperparathyroidism.
38397615	Celiac Disease: Risks of Cross-Contamination and Strategies for Gluten Removal in Food Environments.	Celiac disease (CD) is the chronic immune-mediated enteropathy of the small bowel, manifesting when exposure to gluten occurs in genetically predisposed individuals. Nowadays, the only treatment considered safe for CD is a gluten-free diet (GFD). However, one of the problems faced by celiac patients is the cross-contamination of gluten-free food when preparing meals, in addition to utensils, surfaces and equipment. This study aimed to evaluate cross-contamination in gluten-free products and strategies for removing gluten from cross-contamination in cooking environments. The selection of papers for this integrative review was carried out by searching different databases. Gluten cross-contamination is a global concern for celiac patients in food environments. Although some practices are positive, such as gluten labeling on processed food in several countries, it is crucial to promote good practices in food services around the world. Only a few studies showed effective results in removing gluten from surfaces and utensils; furthermore, sampling was limited, making it difficult to identify appropriate procedures to reduce cross-contamination. The variation in contamination in different kitchen environments also highlighted that celiac patients must continue paying attention to the methods used to prepare gluten-free food. More research is needed, especially into methods of removing gluten from surfaces and utensils, to ensure food safety for celiac patients in many food environments.
29052687	Association Between Early-Life Antibiotic Use and the Risk of Islet or Celiac Disease Autoimmunity.	Importance: Evidence is lacking regarding the consequences of antibiotic use in early life and the risk of certain autoimmune diseases. Objective: To test the association between early-life antibiotic use and islet or celiac disease (CD) autoimmunity in genetically at-risk children prospectively followed up for type 1 diabetes (T1D) or CD. Design, Setting, and Participants: HLA-genotyped newborns from Finland, Germany, Sweden, and the United States were enrolled in the prospective birth cohort of The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study between November 20, 2004, and July 8, 2010. The dates of analysis were November 20, 2004, to August 31, 2014. Individuals from the general population and those having a first-degree relative with T1D were enrolled if they had 1 of 9 HLA genotypes associated with a risk for T1D. Exposures: Parental reports of the most common antibiotics (cephalosporins, penicillins, and macrolides) used between age 3 months and age 4 years were recorded prospectively. Main Outcomes and Measures: Islet autoimmunity and CD autoimmunity were defined as being positive for islet or tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies at 2 consecutive clinic visits at least 3 months apart. Hazard ratios and 95% CIs calculated from Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess the relationship between antibiotic use in early life before seroconversion and the development of autoimmunity. Results: Participants were 8495 children (49.0% female) and 6558 children (48.7% female) enrolled in the TEDDY study who were tested for islet and tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies, respectively. Exposure to and frequency of use of any antibiotic assessed in this study in early life or before seroconversion did not influence the risk of developing islet autoimmunity or CD autoimmunity. Cumulative use of any antibiotic during the first 4 years of life was not associated with the appearance of any autoantibody (hazard ratio [HR], 0.98; 95% CI, 0.95-1.01), multiple islet autoantibodies (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.95-1.03), or the transglutaminase autoantibody (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.98-1.02). Conclusions and Relevance: The use of the most prescribed antibiotics during the first 4 years of life, regardless of geographic region, was not associated with the development of autoimmunity for T1D or CD. These results suggest that a risk of islet or tissue transglutaminase autoimmunity need not influence the recommendations for clinical use of antibiotics in young children at risk for T1D or CD.
27228639	Vitamin D and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: Myth or Reality?	There is growing interest in the contribution of vitamin D deficiency to autoimmunity. Several studies have shown an association between low levels of vitamin D and autoimmune disorders, including multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, autoimmune thyroid diseases, celiac disease, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Vitamin D receptor ligands can mediate immunosuppressive effects. It has been suggested that low levels of this hormone contribute to the immune activation in lupus and other autoimmune diseases. This review updates and summarizes the literature on the association between vitamin D and SLE, and discusses the various correlations between vitamin D and SLE activity, clinical expressions, serology, and gene polymorphisms of vitamin D receptors.
34231664	SERONEGATIVE CELIAC DISEASE IN BRAZILIAN PATIENTS: A SERIES OF CASES.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease characterized by immune reaction mostly to wheat gluten. The diagnosis is based on clinical, serological and histological findings in patients ingesting gluten. Cases that the clinical profile indicates CD and the autoantibodies are negative bring so a dilemma for the professional, as the risk of missed the diagnosis or a delay at the same. OBJECTIVE: To show the importance of correct diagnosis of cases with seronegative celiac disease (SNCD). METHODS: Ten cases of SNCD Brazilian patients were retrospectively studied (2013 to 2019). Data of clinical complaints, autoantibodies, IgA serum levels, histological findings and HLA-DQ2/DQ-8 were compiled. Dual-X densitometry, delay at diagnosis, previous autoimmune diseases and family history of CD were also checked. RESULTS: All SNCD patients presented clinical symptoms of CD, with confirmed diagnosis by histological findings of the duodenal mucosa and HLA-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8 positivity. All patients had normal IgA levels and negative autoantibodies (IgA-anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysial). Dual-X densitometry detected osteopenia in two women and osteoporosis in two males, all with low levels of vitamin D. Delay diagnostic ranged from 1 to 19 years. Familiar occurrence of CD was reported in 40% of the cases. After one year of gluten-free diet, eight patients refer improve of symptoms, while duodenal biopsies, done in five cases, showed histological improvement. CONCLUSION: Patients who demonstrate the clinical profile of celiac disease with negative serology and normal levels of IgA, especially those who have family members with celiac disease, should be submitted to duodenal biopsies to look for histological findings.
24915870	Internalizing the threat of risk--a qualitative study about adolescents' experience living with screening-detected celiac disease 5 years after diagnosis.	BACKGROUND: Mass screening could identify those with unrecognized celiac disease (CD), but the experience of being detected through screening and living with screening-detected CD should be explored before considering this as acceptable intervention. For this study we invited screening-detected adolescents to describe their experience living with screening-detected CD five years after diagnosis with the aim to explore how their perceptions, practices, and beliefs evolved. METHODS: Adolescents who were diagnosed through a population-based CD screening were invited to write narratives after being diagnosed. Of 153 adolescents who were eventually diagnosed through the screening, 91 wrote narratives one year after diagnosis and 72 five years after diagnosis. A qualitative content analysis resulted in a theme and categories that describe the experience living with screening-detected CD five years after diagnosis. RESULTS: The overall theme--Internalizing the threat of risk--illustrates that being detected through screening and the internalized threat of future health complications have impacted how these adolescents felt about the diagnosis, coped with the gluten-free diet (GFD), and thought about CD screening. This theme is supported by four categories: maintaining an imposed disease identity describes how they continued to define their diagnosis in relation to the screening. They also expressed moving from forced food changes to adapted diet routines by describing habits, routines, coping strategies, and the financial burden of the GFD. They had enduring beliefs of being spared negative consequences, however, even after five years, some doubted they had CD and worried that being detected and eating a GFD might not be beneficial, i.e. continuing to fear it is "all in vain". CONCLUSIONS: There was maintenance and evolution in the perceptions, practices, and beliefs of the adolescents after five years. Some have adjusted to the disease and adapted new habits and coping strategies to deal with the GFD, while others still doubt they have CD or that being detected was beneficial. The transition to adapting to the disease and GFD is ongoing, illustrating the importance of providing ongoing support for those with screening-detected CD as they adjust to this chronic disease and the GFD.
24576676	[Psychological alterations in patients with adult celiac disease].	UNLABELLED: Patients with recently-diagnosed adult celiac disease were evaluated with the Gastrointestinal Symptom rating Scale (GSRS) and Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWBI) to evaluate their psychological alterations, the association between any alterations and gastrointestinal symptoms, and their outcome after starting a gluten-free diet. The patients underwent nutritional assessment and then started a gluten-free diet; they were reassessed 6 months later. Quantitative variables are expressed as the median and 25th-75th percentiles. RESULTS: We included 21 patients, 17 women and 4 mena, with a mean age of 43 years (31-47). The results of histological analysis were compatible with Marsh I lesions in 6 patients, Marsh IIIa in 6 and Marsh IIIb in 9. At baseline, 8 patients showed severe psychological distress, 4 showed moderate distress and 9 showed no distress. The GSRS score was 34 (17-43) and the PGWBI was 64 (48-87), with a significant correlation between the 2 indexes (rho=-.58, P=.006). At 6 months, 3 patients had severe psychological distress, 5 had moderate distress, 9 showed no distress and 4 showed psychological well-being. The GSRS score at 6 months was 13 (8-17) and the PGWBI was 83 (68-95) (P<.05 compared with baseline data for the 3 indicators). The 6 axes of the PGWBI showed significant improvement. At 6 months, no correlation was found between the GSRS and PGWBI. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with celiac disease have psychological alterations whose intensity is related to gastrointestinal symptoms. These symptoms improve after the start of a gluten-free diet.
33346575	The Knowledge About Celiac Disease Among Healthcare Professionals and Patients in Central Europe.	OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease (CD) remains undiagnosed for a long time in many adult and pediatric patients. We assessed the knowledge about CD among healthcare professionals (HCPs) and CD patients in Central Europe (CE). METHODS: HCPs and CD patients from 5 CE countries were asked to complete the web-based questionnaire about CD. The questions were divided into subsections on epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnostics, treatment, and follow-up. Achieved scores of different specialists managing patients with CD were compared and regional differences in patients' knowledge were analyzed. RESULTS: Questionnaire was completed by 1381 HCPs and 2262 CD patients or their caregivers from Croatia, Hungary, Germany, Italy, and Slovenia. Mean score achieved by HCPs was 50.9%, and by CD patients 56.4%. Pediatric gastroenterologists scored the highest (69.4%; P < 0.001). There were significant differences in knowledge of patients from different CE regions with German participants scoring the highest (58.3%). Members of CD societies scored higher compared with nonmembers (mean score 58% vs 53.2%; P < 0.001) and patients diagnosed less than 5 years ago scored higher compared with those diagnosed more than 10 years ago (mean score 57.3% vs 54.6%; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The knowledge about CD among HCPs and CD patients is not satisfactory. Further awareness-raising and learning activities are needed to improve HCPs' knowledge and to minimize the number of unrecognized patients and unnecessary diagnostic delays. Patients should be better informed about their disease to reach higher compliance with the gluten-free diet.
23314670	Exploratory, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study on the effects of Bifidobacterium infantis natren life start strain super strain in active celiac disease.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this exploratory trial was to establish if the probiotic Bifidobacterium natren life start (NLS) strain strain may affect the clinical course and pathophysiological features of patients with untreated celiac disease (CD). Positive findings would be helpful in directing future studies. METHODS: Twenty-two adult patients having 2 positives CD-specific tests were enrolled. Patients were randomized to receive 2 capsules before meals for 3 weeks of either Bifidobacterium infantis natren life start strain super strain (Lifestart 2) (2x10(9) colony-forming units per capsule) (n = 12) or placebo (n = 10), whereas they also consumed at least 12 g of gluten/day. A biopsy at the end of the trial confirmed CD in all cases. The primary outcome was intestinal permeability changes. Secondary endpoints were changes in symptoms and the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale, and in immunologic indicators of inflammation. RESULTS: The abnormal baseline intestinal permeability was not significantly affected by either treatment. In contrast to patients on placebo, those randomized to B. infantis experienced a significant improvement in Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (P = 0.0035 for indigestion; P = 0.0483 for constipation; P = 0.0586 for reflux). Final/baseline IgA tTG and IgA DGP antibody concentration ratios were lower in the B. infantis arm (P = 0.055 for IgA tTG and P = 0.181 for IgA DGP). Final serum macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta increased significantly (P < 0.04) only in patients receiving B. infantis. The administration of B. infantis was safe. CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that B. infantis may alleviate symptoms in untreated CD. The probiotic produced some immunologic changes but did not modify abnormal intestinal permeability. Further studies are necessary to confirm and/or expand these observations.
38142746	Maintaining the gluten-free diet: The key to improve glycemic metrics in youths with type 1 diabetes and celiac disease.	AIMS: Gluten-free diets (GFD) were considered as high glycemic index and/or high content of saturated fats; this could affect keeping good metabolic control in individuals with both type 1 diabetes (T1D) and celiac disease (CD). Our objective was to analyze time in range and other continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) metrics with real-time CGM systems, in youths with T1D and CD, compared to those with T1D only. METHODS: An observational case-control study, comparing youths aged 8-18 years with T1D and CD, with people with T1D only was performed. The degree of maintaining GFD was assessed through anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies and dietary interview, and maintaining Mediterranean diet through the KIDMED questionnaire. RESULTS: 86 youths with T1D and CD, 167 controls with T1D only, were included in the study and the two groups reported similar real-time CGM metrics. Among the first group, 29 % were not completely maintaining GFD and compared to people with T1D only they showed higher hyperglycemia rates (% time above range: 38.72 +- 20.94 vs 34.34 +- 20.94; P = 0.039). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with T1D and CD who maintain GFD presented similar glucose metrics compared to youths with T1D only. Individuals not strictly maintaining GFD presented higher hyperglycemia rates.
35758521	ESPGHAN Position Paper on Management and Follow-up of Children and Adolescents With Celiac Disease.	OBJECTIVES: To gather the current evidence and to offer recommendations for follow-up and management. METHODS: The Special Interest Group on Celiac Diseases of the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition formulated ten questions considered to be essential for follow-up care. A literature search (January 2010-March 2020) was performed in PubMed or Medline. Relevant publications were identified and potentially eligible studies were assessed. Statements and recommendations were developed and discussed by all coauthors. Recommendations were voted upon: joint agreement was set as at least 85%. RESULTS: Publications (n = 2775) were identified and 164 were included. Using evidence or expert opinion, 37 recommendations were formulated on: The need to perform follow-up, its frequency and what should be assessed, how to assess adherence to the gluten-free diet, when to expect catch-up growth, how to treat anemia, how to approach persistent high serum levels of antibodies against tissue-transglutaminase, the indication to perform biopsies, assessment of quality of life, management of children with unclear diagnosis for which a gluten-challenge is indicated, children with associated type 1 diabetes or IgA deficiency, cases of potential celiac disease, which professionals should perform follow-up, how to improve the communication to patients and their parents/caregivers and transition from pediatric to adult health care. CONCLUSIONS: We offer recommendations to improve follow-up of children and adolescents with celiac disease and highlight gaps that should be investigated to further improve management.
32441135	Examining core self-management skills among adolescents with celiac disease.	A strict gluten-free diet is the only treatment for celiac disease, and it is especially challenging among adolescents. Participation in food-related activities and self-managing the chronic health condition involve use of cognitive skills. This cross-sectional study examined how executive functions might be associated with participation in food-related activities. Adolescents aged 12-18 years (N = 65; Mage = 14.67) with celiac were interviewed about participation, and their parents completed an executive function questionnaire. Poorer participation significantly correlated with poorer executive abilities. Identifying executive function profiles may contribute to understanding and advancing resourceful daily functioning and participation in daily food-related activities.
21450558	Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy for pancreatic exocrine insufficiency: when is it indicated, what is the goal and how to do it?	Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency with steatorrhea is a major consequence of pancreatic diseases (e.g. chronic pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, severe acute necrotizing pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer), extrapancreatic diseases like celiac disease and Crohn's disease, and gastrointestinal and pancreatic surgical resections. Recognition of this entity is highly relevant to avoid malnutrition-related morbidity and mortality. Therapy of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency is based on the oral administration of pancreatic enzymes aiming at providing the duodenal lumen with sufficient amount of active lipase at the time of gastric emptying of nutrients. Administration of enzymes in form of enteric-coated minimicrospheres avoids acid-mediated lipase inactivation and ensures gastric emptying of enzymes in parallel with nutrients. Despite that, factors like an acidic intestinal pH and bacterial overgrowth may prevent normalization of fat digestion even in compliant patients. The present article critically reviews current therapeutic approaches to pancreatic exocrine insufficiency.
34431805	Sustained Remission of Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy Associated With Celiac Disease After Immunotherapy and Gluten-Free Diet.	
36262236	Food security of people with celiac disease in the Republic of Moldova through prism of public policies.	Food security is an important lever for the implementation of rights-based legislation, policies, and programs, while being a public health and socio-economic priority. Foodborne illnesses have a major impact on public health, and nutritional interventions are essential therapeutic strategies to combat them. Gluten ingestion has been linked to several clinical disorders, collectively called gluten-related disorders. The most serious of these is celiac disease. The only way to treat celiac disease is to stick to a gluten-free diet for life. Following a strict diet is also the only way to prevent the long-term consequences of the disease. Public policies are essential to ensure the food security of people with gluten-related disorders. The aim of the research is to assess the level of care for people with celiac disease in the Republic of Moldova, in terms of public policies, to ensure a sustainable sector that effectively satisfies the food security of people with disorders associated with gluten consumption. To assess the level of care for people with gluten-related disorders, the working algorithm was taken, with reference to global public policies in support of people with celiac disease, developed and validated by Falcomer et al., Focused on 6 items. The results of the study showed that the Republic of Moldova does not have adequate policy support to ensure food security for people with gluten-related disorders, which poses major challenges and, as a result, may increase the complications of these problems.
24979194	Celiac disease treatment: gluten-free diet and beyond.	The basis for celiac disease (CD) treatment is a strict lifelong gluten-free diet. On the diet, the small intestinal mucosal injury heals and gluten-induced symptoms and signs disappear. The mucosal healing is a prerequisite for sustaining health and is also obtained with a diet containing oats and trace amounts of gluten, industrially purified wheat starch-based gluten-free products. The small intestinal mucosa does not heal in noncompliant people, nor when a patient is inadvertently ingesting gluten. Development of adjunctive or alternative therapies is on its way. There are several novel treatment pipelines within academy and industry. Examples are the ideas of using glutenases as a drug to degrade the ingested gluten, polymers to bind and sequester the gluten to the feces, and also vaccine development for an immunotherapy to induce tolerance towards gluten. Clinical drug trials are to be foreseen in CD, soon also in children. 
26796772	Risks of hospitalization and drug consumption in children and young adults with diagnosed celiac disease and the role of maternal education: a population-based matched birth cohort study.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) may affect healthcare use in children and young adults. Socio-economic factors may act as a confounder or effect modifier. We assessed such hypotheses in a population-based birth cohort of young celiac subjects and references matched by maternal education. METHODS: The cohort included all newborns recorded in the Medical Birth Register of Friuli-Venezia Giulia Region (Italy) between 1989 and 2011. CD incident cases were identified through pathology reports, hospital discharges and copayment exemptions and matched with up to five references by sex, year of birth and maternal education. Cox regression models were used to estimate Hazard Ratios (HRs) for major causes of inpatient diagnosis and drug prescription occurring after diagnosis in CD patients compared to references, stratifying by time of first event and maternal education. RESULTS: We identified 1294 CD cases and 5681 references. CD cases had a higher risk of hospital admission for any cause (HR: 2.34; 95 % CI 2.08-2.63) and for all major ICD9-CM categories except obstetric complications, skin and musculoskeletal diseases, and injuries and poisoning. Prescription of all major ATC drug categories, except dermatologicals and genito-urinary medications, was significantly increased in CD subjects. For most outcomes, HRs were highest in the first year after CD diagnosis but remained significant after five or more years. HRs were similar across different categories of maternal education. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosed CD subjects had a higher risk of hospitalization and medication use compared to the general population, even five or more years after diagnosis, with no effect modification of maternal education.
23495130	High prevalence of vitamin A deficiency and vitamin D deficiency in patients evaluated for liver transplantation.	Deficiencies in vitamins A, D, and E have been linked to night blindness, bone health, and post-liver transplant reperfusion injury. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and predictive factors of fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies in liver transplant candidates. We reviewed the medical records of liver transplant candidates at our center from January 2008 to September 2011. The etiology of cirrhosis, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, Child-Pugh class, body mass index (BMI), and vitamin A, vitamin E, and vitamin 25-OH-D levels were recorded. Patients were excluded for incomplete laboratory data, short gut syndrome, celiac disease, pancreatic insufficiency, or prior liver transplantation. Sixty-three patients were included. The most common etiologies of liver disease were alcohol (n = 23), hepatitis C virus (n = 19), and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (n = 5). Vitamin A and D deficiencies were noted in 69.8% and 81.0%, respectively. Only 3.2% of the patients were vitamin E-deficient. There were no documented cases of night blindness. Twenty-five of the 55 patients with bone density measurements had osteopenia, and 10 had osteoporosis. Four patients had vertebral fractures. There was 1 case of posttransplant reperfusion injury in a patient with vitamin E deficiency. In a multivariate analysis, there were no statistically significant predictors for vitamin D deficiency. The Child-Pugh class [odds ratio (OR) = 6.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.52-30.86, P = 0.01], elevated total bilirubin level (OR = 44.23, 95% CI = 5.02-389.41, P < 0.001), and elevated BMI (OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.00-1.36, P = 0.045) were found to be predictors of vitamin A deficiency. In conclusion, the majority of liver disease patients evaluated for liver transplantation at our center had vitamin A and D deficiencies. The presence or absence of cholestatic liver disease did not predict deficiencies, whereas Child-Pugh class, bilirubin level, and elevated BMI predicted vitamin A deficiency.
23832581	Expression of PARK7 is increased in celiac disease.	Recently, it has been suggested that the gene called Parkinson's disease 7 (PARK7) might be an upstream activator of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha, which plays a major role in sustaining intestinal barrier integrity. Furthermore, PARK7 has been proposed to participate in the Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent regulation of the innate immune system. Our aim was to investigate the involvement of PARK7 in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease (CD). Duodenal biopsy specimens were collected from 19 children with untreated CD, five children with treated CD (maintained on gluten-free diet), and ten children with histologically normal duodenal biopsies. PARK7 mRNA expression and protein level were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot, respectively. Localization of PARK7 was visualized by immunofluorescence staining. Protein level of PARK7 increased in the duodenal mucosa of children with untreated CD compared to children with treated CD or to control biopsies (p <0.03). We detected intensive PARK7 staining in the epithelial cells and lamina propria of the duodenal mucosa of children with untreated CD compared with that in control biopsies. Our finding that mucosal expression of PARK7 is increased suggests that PARK7 is involved in the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal diseases, notably CD. Our results suggest that PARK7 may alter processes mediated by HIF-1alpha and TLR4, which supports a role for PARK7 in the maintenance of epithelial barrier integrity, immune homeostasis, or apoptosis. 
22872764	Five things to know about...celiac disease.	
27363231	Celiac Disease, Wheat Allergy, and Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity: What's the Difference?	
23751551	Influence of malting conditions on sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) as a raw material for fermented beverages.	There has been recently increased interest in sorghum to substitute the gluten containing cereals in the diet of people suffering from celiac disease. The response surface methodology was used to determine the influence of malting parameters (degree of steeping, germination temperature and time) on sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench). Each parameter was varied at three levels. Malting attributes, considered important to produce high quality malt for the production of lactic acid fermented beverages, were analyzed. The optimized conditions were: degree of steeping 41%, germination temperature 27C after 7 days of germination. Under these conditions, the following values of the studied attributes can be obtained: alpha-amylase 139 U/g, beta-amylase 60 U/g, extract 83.8%, free amino nitrogen 117.8 mg/100 g, Kolbach index 26.6%, water-extractable arabinoxylan 0.3 g/L and vitamin B2 114.9 microg/L. Among the tested parameters, the germination time had the highest effect on malting attributes. Although the activity of amylolytic enzymes alpha- and beta-amylase were low, the value of extract was high and comparable to that of barley malt. The obtained results showed that sorghum malt is a promising raw material for the production of lactic acid fermented beverages. 
26208009	Navigating the gluten-free boom.	Gluten-free diets have gained popularity with the public at a rate greater than would be expected based on the prevalence of gluten-related disorders such celiac disease, nonceliac gluten sensitivity, and wheat allergy. This article reviews gluten-related disorders, indications for gluten-free diets, and the possible health benefits of gluten. Despite the health claims for gluten-free eating, no published experimental evidence supports weight-loss with a gluten-free diet or suggests that the general population would benefit from avoiding gluten. 
32333077	A compact SPR biosensor device for the rapid and efficient monitoring of gluten-free diet directly in human urine.	Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic autoimmune disorder induced in genetically susceptible individuals by the ingestion of gluten from wheat, rye, barley, or certain varieties of oats. A careful diet follow-up is necessary to avoid health complications associated with long-term gluten intake by the celiac patients. Small peptides (GIP, gluten immunogenic peptides) derived from gluten digestion, which are excreted in the urine and feces, have emerged as promising biomarkers to monitor gluten intake. We have implemented a simple and sensitive label-free point-of-care (POC) device based on surface plasmon resonance for the direct detection of these biomarkers in urine. The assay employs specific monoclonal antibodies and has been optimized for the detection of the 33-mer alpha2-gliadin, known as the main immunogenic peptide of wheat gluten, and for the detection of GIP. Direct detection in undiluted urine has been accomplished by using biosensing chips containing a robust and stable biorecognition layer, obtained after carefully optimizing the biofunctionalization protocol. Excellent limits of detection have been reached (1.6-4.0 ng mL-1 using mAb G12 and A1, respectively), which ensures the detection of gluten peptides even when the gluten intake is around the maximum tolerable amount in the digestive tract (< 50 mg) for celiac individuals. No sample pretreatment, extraction, or dilution is required, and the analysis takes less than 15 min. The assays have excellent reproducibility' as demonstrated by measuring spiked urine samples containing the same target concentration using different biofunctionalized chips prepared and stored at different periods of time (i.e., CV% of 3.58% and 11.30%, for G12- and A1-based assays, respectively). The assay has been validated with real samples. These features pave the way towards an end-user easy-to-handle biosensor device for the rapid monitoring of gluten-free diet (GFD) and follow-up of the health status in celiac patients.
30087270	Rebuilding the Gut Microbiota Ecosystem.	A microbial ecosystem in which bacteria no longer live in a mutualistic association is called dysbiotic. Gut microbiota dysbiosis is a condition related with the pathogenesis of intestinal illnesses (irritable bowel syndrome, celiac disease, and inflammatory bowel disease) and extra-intestinal illnesses (obesity, metabolic disorder, cardiovascular syndrome, allergy, and asthma). Dysbiosis status has been related to various important pathologies, and many therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring the balance of the intestinal ecosystem have been implemented. These strategies include the administration of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics; phage therapy; fecal transplantation; bacterial consortium transplantation; and a still poorly investigated approach based on predatory bacteria. This review discusses the various aspects of these strategies to counteract intestinal dysbiosis.
32374905	In Celiac Disease Patients the In Vivo Challenge with the Diploid Triticum monococcum Elicits a Reduced Immune Response Compared to Hexaploid Wheat.	SCOPE: Gluten from the diploid wheat Triticum monococcum (TM) has low content of immunostimulatory sequences and a high gastro-intestinal digestibility. Gluten-reactive T cells elicited by diploid and hexaploid (Triticum aestivum-TA) wheat in celiac disease (CD) patients upon a brief oral challenge are analyzed. METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventeen patients with CD (median age 13 years) consumed for 3 days sandwiches made with TM (cultivar Norberto-ID331, N=11), or TA (cultivar Sagittario, N=11) flours, corresponding to 12 gr of gluten/die. Immunostimulatory properties are assessed in blood by measuring the IFN-gamma-secreting T cells by EliSpot and the expression of inflammatory cytokines/receptors (IL-12A, IL-15, IL-18RAP, IFN-gamma) by qPCR. TA mobilizes a remarkable number of gliadin-specific, IFN-gamma-secreting T cells (p<0.05), while no significant cell mobilization is induced by TM (p=ns). Similar results are obtained in response to five immunogenic peptides from alpha-, omega-, and gamma-gliadins, although with a large individual variability. An increased mRNA expression for IL-12A and IFN-gamma is detected in the group eating TA compared to those consuming TM (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Although T. monococcum is a cereal not suitable for the diet of celiacs, this diploid wheat elicits a reduced in vivo T-cell response compared to T. aestivum in celiac patients.
31952665	Concepts and Instruments for Patient-Reported Outcome Assessment in Celiac Disease: Literature Review and Experts' Perspectives.	BACKGROUND: In diseases where there is a large subjective component, such as celiac disease (CD), patient reported-outcomes (PRO) endpoints are highly relevant. However, there is a gap in knowledge about which PRO endpoints and instruments should be used for clinical trials for treatment of celiac disease. OBJECTIVES: To identify patient-centered symptom, impact, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) concepts in CD and relevant PRO instruments, and to gather expert input on concepts and instruments to inform selection of PRO endpoints for use in clinical trials of new CD treatments. METHODS: A targeted literature review was conducted to identify symptom, impact, and HRQoL concepts, including those captured in PROs further reviewed against U.S. Food and Drug Administration standards for development and validation as endpoints. US and European clinicians, payers, and a patient advocate (n = 21) were interviewed to assess the identified concepts' relative importance in measuring treatment benefit and to gauge the value of potential PROs as endpoints for market access/reimbursement. RESULTS: Thirty-four published studies were identified: 27 elucidated patient-centered concepts and 7 detailed the development or validation of PRO instruments. The Celiac Disease Symptom Diary and Celiac Disease Patient Reported Outcome instrument were deemed most appropriate for use as endpoints; however, each had limitations related to conceptual coverage, evidence for measurement properties, and feasibility for use in clinical trials. Experts reported gastrointestinal symptoms as most important to treat, with extra-intestinal symptoms burdensome from the patient perspective as well. Payers emphasized measuring both frequency and severity of symptoms and targeting patients nonresponsive to the gluten-free diet for treatment. CONCLUSIONS: With emerging treatment options for CD, further work is needed to operationalize PRO symptom endpoints that are meaningful to patients, valued by payers, and acceptable to regulators in demonstrating efficacy.
36251239	Novel Drug Therapeutics in Celiac Disease: A Pipeline Review.	Celiac disease (CeD) is a chronic, autoimmune systemic disorder triggered by the ingestion of gluten, a protein found in foods such as wheat, rye, and barley. The only effective treatment for CeD is complete removal of gluten from the diet. A strict gluten-free diet (GFD) results in symptomatic, serologic, and histologic remission in most patients. However, GFD may fail to induce clinical or histologic improvement and some patients may alternatively have difficulty strictly adhering to the GFD for other reasons. Despite this, there are currently no FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of CeD. The complex pathogenic process of CeD is becoming increasingly studied and better understood, enabling the identification of various targets for future therapies. Mechanisms under evaluation include probiotics, digestion of peptides, gluten sensitization, tight junction modulation, deamidation, and immune targets. Multiple investigational drugs are in the pipeline, and several drug candidates have entered late-phase clinical trials. Indeed, current and future studies are needed to target specific etiological mechanisms and provide an alternative to GFD alone. This review provides a broad overview of the various investigative treatment approaches for CeD, summarizing the latest progress in the pipeline.
36839296	Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet and Ultra-Processed Foods Consumption in a Group of Italian Patients with Celiac Disease.	Evidence on the consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPF) in adults with celiac disease (CD) and its impact on Mediterranean Diet (MD) adherence is still limited. Our aim was to determine UPF consumption and its relationship with MD adherence in a group of adults, according to the presence of CD. This case-control study included 103 adults with CD and 312 without CD. UPF intake was assessed using the NOVA Food Frequency Questionnaire (NFFQ), while MD adherence was assessed using the Medi-Lite score. UPF represented 14.5% of the diet of participants with CD (246 g/day) and came mainly from cereals-based products (29%) and sweets (24.2%). UPF consumption did not differ with the presence of CD, but participants with CD had significantly (p < 0.05) higher consumption of precooked pasta and pre-packaged breads. Participants with CD also reported a significantly lower MD adherence than participants without CD (9.4 vs. 10.4), with higher intake of meat and dairy products, and lower consumption of vegetables and fish. An inverse trend was found between UPF consumption and MD adherence in adults with CD, although not statistically significant. These findings highlight the importance of improving nutrition education for subjects with CD, which should not only focus on gluten exclusion.
38864796	AGA Clinical Practice Update on Management of Iron Deficiency Anemia: Expert Review.	DESCRIPTION: In this Clinical Practice Update (CPU), we will Best Practice Advice (BPA) guidance on the appropriate management of iron deficiency anemia. METHODS: This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership, and underwent internal peer review by the CPUC and external peer review through standard procedures of Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology. These Best Practice Advice (BPA) statements were drawn from a review of the published literature and from expert opinion. Since systematic reviews were not performed, these BPA statements do not carry formal ratings regarding the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: No single formulation of oral iron has any advantages over any other. Ferrous sulfate is preferred as the least expensive iron formulation. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Give oral iron once a day at most. Every-other-day iron dosing may be better tolerated for some patients with similar or equal rates of iron absorption as daily dosing. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Add vitamin C to oral iron supplementation to improve absorption. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Intravenous iron should be used if the patient does not tolerate oral iron, ferritin levels do not improve with a trial of oral iron, or the patient has a condition in which oral iron is not likely to be absorbed. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Intravenous iron formulations that can replace iron deficits with 1 or 2 infusions are preferred over those that require more than 2 infusions. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: All intravenous iron formulations have similar risks; true anaphylaxis is very rare. The vast majority of reactions to intravenous iron are complement activation-related pseudo-allergy (infusion reactions) and should be treated as such. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Intravenous iron therapy should be used in individuals who have undergone bariatric procedures, particularly those that are likely to disrupt normal duodenal iron absorption, and have iron-deficiency anemia with no identifiable source of chronic gastrointestinal blood loss. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: In individuals with inflammatory bowel disease and iron-deficiency anemia, clinicians first should determine whether iron-deficiency anemia is owing to inadequate intake or absorption, or loss of iron, typically from gastrointestinal bleeding. Active inflammation should be treated effectively to enhance iron absorption or reduce iron depletion. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Intravenous iron therapy should be given in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease, iron-deficiency anemia, and active inflammation with compromised absorption. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: In individuals with portal hypertensive gastropathy and iron-deficiency anemia, oral iron supplements initially should be used to replenish iron stores. Intravenous iron therapy should be used in patients with ongoing bleeding who do not respond to oral iron therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: In individuals with portal hypertensive gastropathy and iron-deficiency anemia without another identified source of chronic blood loss, treatment of portal hypertension with nonselective beta-blockers can be considered. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: In individuals with iron-deficiency anemia secondary to gastric antral vascular ectasia who have an inadequate response to iron replacement, consider endoscopic therapy with endoscopic band ligation or thermal methods such as argon plasma coagulation. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 13: In patients with iron-deficiency anemia and celiac disease, ensure adherence to a gluten-free diet to improve iron absorption. Consider oral iron supplementation based on the severity of iron deficiency and patient tolerance, followed by intravenous iron therapy if iron stores do not improve. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 14: Deep enteroscopy performed in patients with iron-deficiency anemia suspected to have small-bowel bleeding angioectasias should be performed with a distal attachment to improve detection and facilitate treatment. Small-bowel angioectasias may be treated with ablative thermal therapies such as argon plasma coagulation or with mechanical methods such as hemostatic clips. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 15: Endoscopic treatment of angioectasias should be accompanied with iron replacement. Medical therapy for small-bowel angioectasias should be reserved for compassionate treatment in refractory cases when iron replacement and endoscopic therapy are ineffective.
32404753	Child and Parent Mental Health Problems in Pediatric Celiac Disease: A Prospective Study.	OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to estimate the levels of mental health problems in children with celiac disease (CD) along with their parents' mental health status, to compare these levels with those of healthy controls and to investigate how these problems are affected by a gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: Our study constituted 50 patients with CD at diagnosis before the initiation of a GFD (age 8.6 +- 3.7 years, group A), 39 patients with CD on a GFD for at least 12 months (age 10.4 +- 3.4 years, group B) and 38 healthy controls (age 7.7 +- 3.8 years, group C), as well as their parents. One of the parents of each child completed the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) and the Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90-R) to evaluate the children's and parents' mental health problems, respectively. Twenty patients in group A were reevaluated at least 12 months after initiation of a GFD (group D). RESULTS: At diagnosis, CD patients had higher scores in the CBCL for internalizing problems than healthy controls (55.7 +- 10.3 vs 47.9 +- 15.4, P = 0.007) and their parents demonstrated increased severity of mental health problems, including anxiety and depression, than the parents of healthy controls (0.72 +- 0.49 vs 0.54 +- 0.58, P = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: CD patients at diagnosis and their parents, had more mental health problems, including anxiety and depression, than healthy controls.
27070331	Gluten sensitivity: fact or fashion statement?	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In recent years, the concern over food sensitivities in general and gluten intolerance in particular has sharply increased. Patients and medical providers are awash in various claims about the potential implications of including or excluding gluten from the diet. RECENT FINDINGS: Three main conditions are described with respect to gluten: wheat allergy, celiac disease, and nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). Wheat allergy is a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction to nongluten proteins within wheat. Celiac disease is an autoimmune reaction to the gluten protein resulting in damage to the small intestine with genetic associations. NCGS is a diagnosis of exclusion and, to date, no biomarkers have been identified for this condition. SUMMARY: When evaluating and treating patients with potential reactions to gluten, it is important to distinguish among wheat allergy, celiac disease, and NCGS. Each condition has distinct dietary and treatment implications.
23218989	The Italian translation of the celiac disease-specific quality of life scale in celiac patients on gluten free diet.	BACKGROUND: A recently devised tool, the celiac disease-specific quality of life scale has been proposed to assess specifically quality of life in celiac patients. AIM: To assess the validity and reliability of the Italian translation of the celiac disease-specific quality of life scale. METHODS: The celiac disease-specific quality of life scale underwent forward/backward translation. Adults patients on gluten free diet by at least one year, consecutively recruited, completed SF36 questionnaire, the Italian version of celiac disease-specific quality of life scale, the health related quality of life question and an abdominal pain scale. The study fulfilled criteria for acceptable psychometric assessment according to the International Quality of Life Assessment project. RESULTS: Two-hundred-thirty celiac patients were recruited after about nine years from diagnosis. Factor analysis indicates that there are some similarities and discrepancies between the English and the Italian questionnaires. Despite this, the Italian celiac disease-specific quality of life scale was able to identify the same four factors characterizing the patients' answers (dysphoria, limitations, health concerns, inadequate treatment). CONCLUSION: The celiac disease-specific quality of life scale is useful for assessing celiac disease-related quality of life. A wide use of the Italian celiac disease-specific quality of life scale may be of help in obtaining comparable data on QOL in different setting and countries.
29094324	A Caucasian American patient with celiac disease diagnosed in Japan and successfully treated with a gluten-free diet.	We report the case of a 33-year-old Caucasian American man diagnosed with celiac disease in Japan. He presented to a community hospital because of chronic watery diarrhea and weight loss for 6 months. The laboratory data showed low serum albumin and serum cholesterol. A colonoscopy was normal. He was referred to our hospital for further work-up. Serum tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin A (IgA) and endomysial antibody were positive. The HLA type was DQ2. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed nodular and mosaic-patterned mucosa from the bulb to the second part of the duodenum. The histopathological findings were consistent with Marsh type 3c of the modified Marsh classification for celiac disease. The patient was instructed to follow a gluten-free diet (GFD). Six months after the initiation of the GFD, his symptom and the levels of serum albumin and cholesterol were improved, and the serum tissue transglutaminase IgA and endomysial antibody became negative. However, EGD showed little improvement. Capsule endoscopy also revealed mosaic-patterned mucosa, nodular mucosa, and scalloping of the folds of the duodenum and proximal small intestine. There was no definite improvement in histopathological findings. Collectively, the GFD was effective in this patient with celiac disease, but it should be maintained to achieve endoscopic and histopathologic healing.
22149581	Gluten sensitivity: problems of an emerging condition separate from celiac disease.	Gluten sensitivity appears to be emerging as a separate condition from celiac disease, yet no clear definition or diagnosis exists. As a result, patients with gluten sensitivity experience delayed diagnosis and continuing symptoms if they consume gluten. This emerging medical problem may involve human genetics, plant genetic modifications, gluten as a food additive, environmental toxins, hormonal influences, intestinal infections and autoimmune diseases. The treatment is similar to that for celiac disease - a gluten-free diet. The use of a gluten-free diet or an elimination diet is encouraged in assisting people to determine whether or not they are gluten sensitive. It is time to not only recognize, but to treat and further research gluten sensitivity, as unconfirmed environmental factors continue to spread this problem further into the general population.
35947766	Risk of obesity during a gluten-free diet in pediatric and adult patients with celiac disease: a systematic review with meta-analysis.	CONTEXT: Obesity is a significant risk factor for many pathological conditions. Whether a gluten-free diet (GFD) is a risk factor for overweight or obesity remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of body mass index (BMI) categories at disease presentation and the variation in BMI category from underweight/normal to overweight/obese and vice versa during a GFD. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched through February 2021 for retrospective, cross-sectional, and prospective studies reporting BMI categories at disease diagnosis and during a GFD. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted by 2 reviewers independently. Disagreements were resolved by consensus; a third reviewer was consulted, if necessary. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane ROBINS-I tool. DATA ANALYSIS: Subgroup analysis based on age (pediatric/adult patients), study design (prospective, cross-sectional, retrospective), and duration of GFD was performed.. Forty-five studies were selected (7959 patients with celiac disease and 20 524 healthy controls). The mean BMI of celiac patients at presentation was significantly lower than that of controls (P < 0.001). During a GFD, the mean BMI increased significantly (mean difference = 1.14 kg/m2 [95%CI, 0.68-1.60 kg/m2]; I2 = 82.8%; P < 0.001), but only 9% of patients (95%CI, 7%-12%; I2 = 80.0%) changed from the underweight/normal BMI category to the overweight/obese category, while 20% (95%CI, 11%-29%; I2 = 85.8%) moved into a lower BMI category. CONCLUSION: Most celiac patients had a normal BMI at presentation, although the mean BMI was significantly lower than that of controls. A GFD does not increase the risk of becoming overweight/obese, especially in children. The quality of several studies was suboptimal, with moderate or high overall risk of bias and heterogeneity.
26506381	The Spectrum of Differences between Childhood and Adulthood Celiac Disease.	An old saying states that ''children are not little adults" and this certainly holds true for celiac disease, as there are many peculiar aspects regarding its epidemiology, diagnosis, clinical presentations, associated diseases, and response to treatment in pediatric compared to adult populations, to such an extent that it merits a description of its own. In fact, contrary to the past when it was thought that celiac disease was a disorder predominantly affecting childhood and characterized by a malabsorption syndrome, nowadays it is well recognized that it affects also adult and elderly people with an impressive variability of clinical presentation. In general, the clinical guidelines for diagnosis recommend starting with specific serologic testing in all suspected subjects, including those suffering from extraintestinal related conditions, and performing upper endoscopy with appropriate biopsy sampling of duodenal mucosa in case of positivity. The latter may be omitted in young patients showing high titers of anti-transglutaminase antibodies. The subsequent management of a celiac patient differs substantially depending on the age at diagnosis and should be based on the important consideration that this is a lifelong condition.
27906802	Antitissue Transglutaminase Normalization Postdiagnosis in Children With Celiac Disease.	OBJECTIVES: Limited pediatric data exist examining the trend and predictors of antitissue transglutaminase (atTG) normalization over time in children with celiac disease (CD). We aimed to evaluate time to normalization of atTG in children after CD diagnosis, and to assess for independent predictors affecting this duration. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was completed in pediatric patients with CD diagnosed from 2007 to 2014 at the Stollery Children's Hospital Celiac Clinic (Edmonton, Alberta, Canada). The clinical predictors assessed for impact on time to atTG normalization were initial atTG, Marsh score at diagnosis, gluten-free diet compliance (GFDC), age at diagnosis, sex, ethnicity, medical comorbidities, and family history of CD. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was completed to assess time to atTG normalization, and Cox regression to assess for independent predictors of this time. RESULTS: A total of 487 patients met inclusion criteria. Approximately 80.5% of patients normalized atTG levels. Median normalization time was 407 days for all patients (95% confidence interval [CI: 361-453]), and 364 days for gluten-free diet compliant patients (95% CI [335-393]). Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) patients took significantly longer to normalize at 1204 days (95% CI [199-2209], P < 0.001). Cox regression demonstrated T1DM (hazard ratio = 0.36 [0.24-0.55], P < 0.001) and higher baseline atTG (hazard ratio = 0.52 [0.43-0.63], P < 0.001) were significant predictors of longer atTG normalization time. GFDC was a significant predictor of earlier normalization (OR = 13.91 [7.86-24.62], P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: GFDC and lower atTG at diagnosis are predictors of earlier normalization. Patients with T1DM are less likely to normalize atTG levels, with longer normalization time. Additional research and education for higher-risk populations are needed.
30105887	The influence of treatment, age at onset, and metabolic control on height in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes-A SWEET collaborative study.	OBJECTIVE: To describe the association between height, demographics, and treatment in youths with type 1 diabetes participating in an international network for pediatric diabetes centers (SWEET). METHODS: Data were collected from 55 centers with documented patients' height. All subjects below 20 years of age, diabetes duration >1 year, and without celiac disease were included. World Health Organization growth charts were used to calculate height and body mass index z-scores. Multiple hierarchic regression models adjusting for known confounders were applied. RESULTS: Data on 22 941 subjects (51.8% male) were analyzed with a median and interquartile range for age 14.8 years (11.2, 17.6), diabetes duration 5.6 years (3.1, 8.9), and height z-score 0.34 (-0.37, 1.03). Children were taller in the youngest age groups: adjusted height z-scores of 0.31 (+-0.06) and 0.39 (+-0.06), respectively; with shorter diabetes duration (<2 years: 0.36 [+-0.06]; 2-<5 years: 0.34 [+-0.06]; >=5 years: 0.21 [+-0.06]) and if they were pump users: 0.35 +- 0.05 vs 0.25 +- 0.05 (>three injections/day and 0.19 +- 0.06 [0-3 injections daily]), respectively. High hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and low to normal weight were associated with a lower height z-score. Trends were identical in all models except for gender. No gender differences were found except in the final height model where females exhibited higher z-score than males. CONCLUSION: For youths treated at centers offering modern diabetes management, major growth disturbances are virtually eliminated. For children with a young age at onset, high HbA1c, injections, and/or non-intensive diabetes, treatment still requires attention in order to attain normal growth.
26878584	Characterization of Antibodies for Grain-Specific Gluten Detection.	Gluten ingestion causes immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergy or celiac disease in sensitive individuals, and a strict gluten-free diet greatly limits food choices. Immunoassays such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are used to quantify gluten to ensure labeling compliance of gluten-free foods. Anti-gluten antibodies may not exhibit equal affinity to gluten from wheat, rye, and barley. Moreover, because wheat gluten is commonly used as a calibrator in ELISA, accurate gluten quantitation from rye and barley contaminated foods may be compromised. Immunoassays utilizing grain-specific antibodies and calibrators may help improve gluten quantitation. In this study, polyclonal antibodies raised against gluten-containing grain-specific peptides were characterized for their immunoreactivity to gluten from different grain sources. Strong immunoreactivity to multiple gluten polypeptides from wheat, rye, and barley was observed in the range 34 to 43 kDa with anti-gliadin, 11 to 15 and 72 to 95 kDa with anti-secalin, and 30 to 43 kDa with anti-hordein peptide antibodies, respectively. Minimal or no cross-reactivity with gluten from other grains was observed among these antibodies. The anti-consensus peptide antibody raised against a repetitive amino acid sequence of proline and glutamine exhibited immunoreactivity to gluten from wheat, rye, barley, and oat. The antibodies exhibited similar immunoreactivity with most of the corresponding grain cultivars by ELISA. The high specificity and minimal cross-reactivity of grain-specific antibodies suggest their potential use in immunoassays for accurate gluten quantitation. 
30701867	Is it necessary to use capsular endoscopy to diagnose celiac disease?	AIM: To clarify the indications for capsular endoscopy (CE) in patients with celiac disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 10 patients with celiac disease (6 women, 4 men) aged 22 to 69 years. The median age was 42.4+-17.5 years. The diagnosis of celiac disease established on the basis of histological examination of the mucous membrane (MM) of the duodenum and detection of antibodies to diaminononane peptide gliadin and to tissue transglutaminase. In three patients celiac disease was diagnosed for the first time, in others - in terms of 3 months to 2 years. CE was performed using a Given Imaging systems (Yokneam, Israel), Olympus (Japan), the obtained data were analyzed using Rapidr  Reade (version 7.0). The results of the endoscopy were compared with the data of 78 patients examined by us, in which the indicators conformed to the normal CE criteria. RESULTS: All patients with celiac disease showed characteristic endoscopic markers of atrophy from the small intestine: scallop, nodularity, decrease in height and number of folds. Paid attention to the mosaic of defeat in the form of &quot;atrophy fields&quot; against a background of slightly modified MM. Erosive-ulcerative lesions of the small intestine were found in 4 patients. CONCLUSION: Indications for the appointment of CE in patients with celiac disease is the lack of response to treatment, which is based on strict adherence to gluten-free diet, the assumption of erosive and ulcerative lesions MM of the small intestine and refractory form of the disease. CE makes it possible to establish the extent of atrophy from the small intestine, which allows you to use it to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment.
35010876	Nutrition in Patients with Lactose Malabsorption, Celiac Disease, and Related Disorders.	Lactose malabsorption (LM), celiac disease (CD), non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are conditions associated with food triggers, improvement after withdrawal, treatment with dietary restriction, and subsequent nutritional detriments. LM occurs when there is incomplete hydrolysis of lactose due to lactase deficiency and frequently produces abdominal symptoms; therefore, it can cause lactose intolerance (LI). A lactose-restricted diet is frequently recommended, although it can potentially lead to nutrient deficiencies. Furthermore, lactose is an essential component of fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) and is subsequently associated with intolerance to these compounds, especially in IBS. LM commonly presents in CD. Nutritional deficits are common in CD and can continue even on a gluten-free diet (GFD). Conditions triggered by gluten are known as gluten-related disorders (GRDs), including CD, wheat allergy, and NCGS. IBS can also be associated with a gluten sensitivity. A GFD is the treatment for CD, GRDs, and gluten sensitive IBS, although compliance with this restricted diet can be difficult. Strict dietary therapies can have a negative effect on quality of life. This review aims to provide an overview of the difficult nutritional elements of these disorders, which are critical for medical providers to recognize when managing these patients.
39052071	Nutritional, antioxidant and biological activity characterization of orange peel flour to produce nutraceutical gluten-free muffins.	Celiac disease - a prevalent food intolerance - requires strict adherence to a lifelong gluten-free (GF) diet as the only effective treatment. However, GF products often lack soluble fibre and have a high glycaemic index. Consequently, there is a pressing need in the food industry to develop GF products with improved nutritional profiles. In this context, the impact of incorporating orange peel flour (OPF) into muffins undergoing sourdough fermentation was examined, focusing on their technological, antioxidant, and nutritional characteristics. The functional properties of OPF were investigated using human colon carcinoma HCT8 cells as a model system. Treatment with OPF extract demonstrated a notable reduction in malignant cell viability and intracellular ROS levels, indicating potent antioxidant capabilities. Western blot analysis revealed significant alterations in key signalling pathways, including increased phosphorylation of NF-kB at serine 536 and reduced intracellular levels of caspase-3, alongside increased phosphorylation of RIPK3 and MLKL, suggesting potential involvement in necroptosis. OPF incorporation in muffins with sourdough increased antioxidant activity, reduced glycaemic index, and affected the volatile profile. Furthermore, based on simulated colonic fermentation, muffins with OPF showed a slight prebiotic effect, supported by the significant increase in bacillus-shaped lactic acid bacteria and Clostridia population. Overall, OPF-enriched muffins demonstrated considerable antioxidant effects and impacts on cell viability, underscoring their potential as functional ingredients in GF products. These findings signify the prospect of OPF enhancing the nutritional profiles and conferring health benefits of GF muffins.
37960188	Celiac Disease Dietary Adherence on the Rural-Urban Continuum.	Poor adherence to a gluten-free diet for those with celiac disease is a well-established risk factor, leading to gastrointestinal symptoms, malabsorption of nutrients, and psychiatric complications. Previous studies have shown that those outside urban areas encounter unique barriers to dietary adherence and are less likely to engage in health management behaviors than those in urban regions. This study aimed to examine the relationship between gluten-free dietary adherence and individual, relationship, and community factors, including the geographic location of residence on the rural-urban continuum, for 253 adults with celiac disease living in the United States. Those with celiac disease residing in urban regions had significantly better dietary adherence than those residing in nonurban areas (p < 0.05). Those living in nonurban communities had, on average, poor enough adherence scores to suggest ongoing intestinal damage from gluten consumption. Geographic location, age, years since diagnosis, and annual income significantly predicted compliance with a gluten-free diet for those with celiac disease, accounting for nearly 20% of the variance. Those living outside urban areas with a lower income, younger age, and more recent diagnosis of celiac disease had the worst dietary adherence, placing them at the most risk for ongoing disease progression and complications.
21704891	Bruton syndrome and celiac disease.	
23166906	Evaluation and management of skeletal health in celiac disease: position statement.	OBJECTIVE: To review the evaluation and management of skeletal health in patients with celiac disease (CD), and to make recommendations on screening, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of low bone mineral density (BMD) in CD patients. METHODS: A multidisciplinary team developed clinically relevant questions for review. An electronic search of the literature was conducted using the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from 1996 to 2010. All original studies, reviews and guidelines, both pediatric and adult, were included. A document summarizing the results of the review and proposed recommendations was prepared and underwent multiple revisions until consensus was reached. RESULTS: At diagnosis, approximately one-third of adult CD patients have osteoporosis, one-third have osteopenia and one-third have normal BMD. Children with CD have low bone mass at diagnosis. Adult and pediatric CD patients are at increased risk of fractures. DISCUSSION: For adults, serum calcium, albumin, 25(OH) vitamin D3, parathyroid hormone and 24 h urine calcium testing should be performed at diagnosis; patients with 'classic' CD and those at risk for osteoporosis should undergo a dual x-ray absorptiometry scan. An abnormal baseline dual x-ray absorptiometry scan should be repeated one to two years after initiation of a gluten-free diet (GFD). For children, BMD should be assessed one year after diagnosis if GFD adherence is not strict. A GFD is the most important treatment for bone loss. Supplemental antiresorptives may be justified in those who remain at high fracture risk (eg, postmenopausal women, older men) after implementation of a GFD. CONCLUSION: Current evidence does not support the screening of all CD patients for low BMD at diagnosis. Follow-up BMD assessment should be performed one to two years after initiation of a GFD.
23689265	Development and validation of a celiac disease quality of life instrument for North American children.	OBJECTIVE: Given the social constraints imposed by a gluten-free diet, it can be hypothesized that children with celiac disease (CD) living in the United States have a reduced health-related quality of life (HRQOL); however, there is no validated CD-specific HRQOL instrument for children living in the United States. The goals of this study were to develop and validate a CD-specific HRQOL instrument for children 8 to 18 years of age with CD and to report HRQOL in these children using both generic- and disease-specific instruments. METHODS: This was a prospective study using focus group methodology to develop a CD-specific HRQOL instrument that was then administered to children 8 to 18 years of age with CD living throughout the United States. Instrument validation methods included construct, convergent, and divergent validities. RESULTS: Two instruments were developed: CD-specific pediatric HRQOL instrument (CDPQOL) 8 to 12 and CDPQOL 13 to 18. A total of 181 children with CD completed the CDPQOL as well as a comparator generic instrument. Exploratory factor analysis restructured the CDPQOL and reduced the total number of items. The CDPQOL showed a moderate agreement with the Psychosocial dimensions of the generic instrument confirming convergent validity and low-to-moderate agreement with the Physical Health Summary dimension of the generic instrument confirming divergent validity. CONCLUSIONS: The CDPQOL, consisting of 13 to 17 questions, is a validated instrument for the measurement of HRQOL in children 8 to 18 years of age with CD living in the United States.
32902326	Teaching Families of Children with Celiac Disease about Gluten-Free Diet Using Distributed Education: a Pilot Study.	Introduction: Treatment of celiac disease is a strict life-long gluten-free diet (GFD). The GFD is complex, and counseling by a dietitian is essential. The number of new referrals for GFD education has increased. We studied the feasibility of GFD teaching using distributed education.Methods: The IWK Health Center in Halifax is the only tertiary-care pediatric hospital in the 3 Maritime provinces with GFD experienced dietitians. Families travel long distances to attend teaching sessions. Families outside the Halifax area were offered to participate in the 2.5-hour education sessions held once a month via live videoconference link at their regional hospitals. All participants were surveyed with a 10-item questionnaire assessing the content and delivery and usefulness of information.Results: Over a 6-month period, 39 families attended the sessions, 21 locally and 18 at distributed sites across the Maritimes. The survey was completed by 26 participants (67%). All participants at both sites strongly agreed or agreed that their setting was good for learning and the information provided was easy to understand. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups on any individual questions in the 2 domains assessed (all P > 0.06).Conclusions: Distributed education on GFD is feasible and as effective as in person education. It affords convenience and savings to families by reducing travel costs.
28677884	Assessing the proposed association between DED and gluten-free diet introduction in celiac children.	A strong association between celiac disease (CD) and dental enamel defects (DEDs) have been extensively reported, however, the nature of this relationship is still unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate DEDs phenotype in CD individuals according to the time they were introduced to a gluten-free diet (GFD). Forty-five CD individuals were examined by a pediatric dentist. DEDs were classified according to the type of affected teeth. CD individuals were classified into two groups (with or without DEDs) and the differences between these groups were tested using chi-square or Fisher s exact tests and t-test to compare differences between means. The Pearson coefficient test was used to evaluate the degree of the correlation between the age of GFD introduction and number of affected teeth. Individuals with MIH were introduced earlier to the GFD (p = 0.038). An association was also observed for molar DED (p = 0.013). In conclusion, our study suggested an association between a specific type of DED and the time that CD individuals were introduced to a GFD.
21378598	Gene expression profiling of duodenal biopsies discriminates celiac disease mucosa from normal mucosa.	Celiac disease (CD) is identified by histopathologic changes in the small intestine which normalize during a gluten-free diet. The histopathologic assessment of duodenal biopsies is usually routine but can be difficult. This study investigated gene expression profiling as a diagnostic tool. A total of 109 genes were selected to reflect alterations in crypt-villi architecture, inflammatory response, and intestinal permeability and were examined for differential expression in normal mucosa compared with CD mucosa in pediatric patients. Biopsies were classified using discriminant analysis of gene expression. Fifty genes were differentially expressed, of which eight (APOC3, CYP3A4, OCLN, MAD2L1, MKI67, CXCL11, IL17A, and CTLA4) discriminated normal mucosa from CD mucosa without classification errors using leave-one-out cross-validation (n = 39) and identified the degree of mucosal damage. Validation using an independent set of biopsies (n = 27) resulted in four discrepant cases. Biopsies from two of these cases showed a patchy distribution of lesions, indicating that discriminant analysis based on single biopsies failed to identify CD mucosa. In the other two cases, serology support class according to discriminant analysis and histologic specimens were judged suboptimal but assessable. Gene expression profiling shows promise as a diagnostic tool and for follow-up of CD, but further evaluation is needed.
29093615	Less common etiologies of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.	Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), an important cause of maldigestion and malabsorption, results from primary pancreatic diseases or secondarily impaired exocrine pancreatic function. Besides cystic fibrosis and chronic pancreatitis, the most common etiologies of EPI, other causes of EPI include unresectable pancreatic cancer, metabolic diseases (diabetes); impaired hormonal stimulation of exocrine pancreatic secretion by cholecystokinin (CCK); celiac or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) due to loss of intestinal brush border proteins; and gastrointestinal surgery (asynchrony between motor and secretory functions, impaired enteropancreatic feedback, and inadequate mixing of pancreatic secretions with food). This paper reviews such conditions that have less straightforward associations with EPI and examines the role of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT). Relevant literature was identified by database searches. Most patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer develop EPI (66%-92%). EPI occurs in patients with type 1 (26%-57%) or type 2 diabetes (20%-36%) and is typically mild to moderate; by definition, all patients with type 3c (pancreatogenic) diabetes have EPI. EPI occurs in untreated celiac disease (4%-80%), but typically resolves on a gluten-free diet. EPI manifests in patients with IBD (14%-74%) and up to 100% of gastrointestinal surgery patients (47%-100%; dependent on surgical site). With the paucity of published studies on PERT use for these conditions, recommendations for or against PERT use remain ambiguous. The authors conclude that there is an urgent need to conduct robust clinical studies to understand the validity and nature of associations between EPI and medical conditions beyond those with proven mechanisms, and examine the potential role for PERT.
25382799	Association between lichen sclerosus and celiac disease: a report of three pediatric cases.	The prevalence of celiac disease (CD) is increasing and may be as high as 1% of the US population. The typical presentation of CD generally includes gastrointestinal symptoms, but more individuals are presenting with extraintestinal manifestations. A wide variety of dermatologic associations have been described with CD, including alopecia, dermatitis herpetiformis, and enamel hypoplasia. In this report we describe three girls with CD who presented with hypopigmented skin lesions and pruritus in the perivaginal and perianal areas, consistent with the diagnosis of lichen sclerosus (LS). All three presented within 1 year to the same practitioner. To our knowledge, this association has not previously been explored in the literature. These cases elucidate a possible relationship between CD and LS. 
32097372	Adherence to Gluten-free Diet in a Celiac Pediatric Population Referred to the General Pediatrician After Remission.	OBJECTIVES: Assessment of adherence to gluten-free diet in celiac disease (CD) is generally recommended. Few data are available about consequences of transition from the referral center to the general pediatrician (GP) once remission is achieved. METHODS: Adherence was assessed in patients referred to the GP for an annual basis follow-up, called back for re-evaluation. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) antitissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) antibodies and the Biagi score (BS) were determined at last follow-up at the referral center (V1), and at re-evaluation (V2). Patients were classified as adherent (BS 3-4, IgA anti-tTG <7 U/mL) and nonadherent (BS 0-2, IgA anti-tTG >=7). Scores of adherence were correlated with personal and clinical data. RESULTS: We evaluated 200 patients. Overall, we found good adherence rates in 94.95% of patients at V1 and 83.5% at V2. IgA anti-tTG were negative in 100% at V1 and 96.97% at V2. BS is 3 to 4 in 94.5% at V1 and 84% at V2. Adherence at V2 was significantly worse than V1 (P < 0.001). No significant associations were found between scores of adherence and sex, symptoms and age at diagnosis, family history of CD, comorbidity, and diagnosis by endoscopy. Age 13 years or older represents a risk factor for lack of compliance at V1 (P = 0.02) and V2 (P = 0.04), and foreign nationality at V2 (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The BS, serology, and a clinical interview, integrated, are reliable tools for assessing pediatric adherence to gluten-free diet. We argue that referring patients to the GP after remission of CD is important, but the process must be improved and recommendations are required.
21617278	Hyperparathyroidism due to auto-immunological malabsorption in an African girl.	Hyperparathyroidism is a rare finding in children. It is a typical sign of vitamin D-deficiency caused by different reasons. It may also be due to calcium wasting syndromes, and it can rarely be induced by adenomas of the parathyroid glands and in parathormone receptor mutations (pseudohyperparathyroidism). A 12-year old Gambian girl living in Hamburg, Germany, was developing abdominal and joint pain. Serum analysis revealed low serum-calcium, significantly elevated parathormone and decreased vitamin D. Immigrant rickets was assumed. Because of abdominal pain and iron deficiency, lambliasis was ruled out. Celiac disease was demonstrated by gliadin and endomysium antibodies as well as by intestinal mucosa biopsy. Despite of a gluten-free diet the joint pains persisted. They were declared by rheumatologists to be caused by a chronic juvenile arthritis (sister disease of celiac disease). However, there were no positive inflammation signals and no clear elevated rheuma-immunology. Follow up: Gluten-free diet and additional treatment with calcium and active vitamin D did not stop increasing parathormone levels, did not stop abdominal and joint pain, and did not stop increment of positive celiac disease antibodies. Assuming compliance problems the patient was then treated with vitamin D injections, which caused decreasing parathormone levels and vanishing joint pain. Celiac disease can cause intestinal rickets with elevated parathomone levels mimicking chronic juvenile arthritis, if gluten-free diet is not strictly performed by compliance problems.
21601206	Combined atherogenic effects of celiac disease and type 1 diabetes mellitus.	OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have shown a high cardiovascular risk in patients with autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Conversely, few data are available about patients with celiac disease (CD). The aim of our study was to assess carotid intima-media thickness (c-IMT), in patients with T1DM, CD or both (T1DM+CD) as compared with age- and sex-matched healthy individuals (H). METHODS: We enrolled 120 patients, 30 with T1DM, 30 with CD, 30 with T1DM+CD and 30 H. Clinical, metabolic and anthropometric data were collected. All T1DM patients were on insulin while all CD patients were on a gluten-free diet. c-IMT was evaluated by high frequency linear digital ultrasound. RESULTS: c-IMT was significantly greater in patients with T1DM+CD than in patients with T1DM or CD (P<0.001 for both), while no difference was found between T1DM and CD. Moreover, c-IMT was greater in CD than in H (P<0.001). Glycemic control and disease duration were similar between T1DM+CD and T1DM. Lipid and anthropometric parameters were similar among groups. Furthermore, in a pooled multivariate analysis, only age and disease type were significantly correlated with c-IMT (P<0.001 for both). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that celiac patients have greater c-IMT as compared with healthy individuals. Thus, non-invasive monitoring of c-IMT in CD might be useful in preventing cardiovascular disease. Moreover, patients with T1DM+CD show more severe subclinical atherosclerosis as compared with those presenting T1DM or CD only, suggesting that the association of these autoimmune diseases might accelerate the atherosclerotic process.
29315154	Characteristics and comorbidities of inpatients without celiac disease on a gluten-free diet.	OBJECTIVES: Despite the increasing popularity of gluten-free diet (GFD), the demographic characteristics and medical features of patients without celiac disease on this diet have not been extensively investigated.We aimed to characterize the medical conditions and demographic backgrounds of hospitalized patients without celiac disease who adhere to a GFD, to further understand their reasons for gluten avoidance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed an observational cohort study on all inpatients at Columbia University Medical Center on a GFD in 2011-2016, excluding those with celiac disease, compared with age-matched and sex-matched inpatients on a regular diet. We determined the odds ratio (OR) of being on a GFD for various comorbidities using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 769 inpatients on a GFD, most (63.6%) did not have celiac disease. Gluten-avoiding patients were more likely to be non-Hispanic Whites [OR: 2.92; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.31-3.70]. They had a lower prevalence of hypertension (OR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.27-0.52) and diabetes (OR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.32-0.75) and higher prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (OR: 1.56; 95% CI: 1.02-2.41), irritable bowel syndrome (OR: 6.16; 95% CI: 2.11-10.23), hyperthyroidism (OR: 2.73; 95% CI: 1.22-6.10), hypothyroidism (OR: 2.06; 95% CI: 1.39-3.06), lupus (OR: 2.87; 95% CI: 1.13-7.29), and autism spectrum disorder (OR: 23.42; 95% CI: 5.29-103.73). CONCLUSION: Nonceliac gluten-avoiding patients have higher prevalences of inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, thyroid disease, lupus, and autism spectrum disorder, suggesting patients with these disorders have turned to a GFD for perceived benefit, despite a scant evidence basis.
23083983	The irritable bowel syndrome-celiac disease connection.	Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a prevalent functional gastrointestinal disorder that has a significant impact on quality of life and health care resources. Celiac disease (CD), a gluten-sensitive enteropathy, can be mistaken for IBS. This article discusses the connection between IBS and CD and the new concept of nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). NCGS may occur in the presence of a normal or near-normal small bowel biopsy. Some patients with IBS without CD may derive symptomatic benefit from a gluten-free diet. Future research could facilitate a significant impact on the quality of life in this potential subgroup of patients.
24458020	Testing safety of germinated rye sourdough in a celiac disease model based on the adoptive transfer of prolamin-primed memory T cells into lymphopenic mice.	UNLABELLED: The current treatment for celiac disease is strict gluten-free diet. Technical processing may render gluten-containing foods safe for consumption by celiac patients, but so far in vivo safety testing can only be performed on patients. We modified a celiac disease mouse model to test antigenicity and inflammatory effects of germinated rye sourdough, a food product characterized by extensive prolamin hydrolysis. Lymphopenic Rag1-/- or nude mice were injected with splenic CD4+CD62L-CD44high-memory T cells from gliadin- or secalin-immunized wild-type donor mice. We found that: 1) Rag1-/- recipients challenged with wheat or rye gluten lost more body weight and developed more severe histological duodenitis than mice on gluten-free diet. This correlated with increased secretion of IFNgamma, IL-2, and IL-17 by secalin-restimulated splenocytes. 2) In vitro gluten testing using competitive R5 ELISA demonstrated extensive degradation of the gluten R5 epitope in germinated rye sourdough. 3) However, in nude recipients challenged with germinated rye sourdough (vs. native rye sourdough), serum anti-secalin IgG/CD4+ T helper 1-associated IgG2c titers were only reduced, but not eliminated. In addition, there were no reductions in body weight loss, histological duodenitis, or T cell cytokine secretion in Rag1-/- recipients challenged accordingly. IN CONCLUSION: 1) prolamin-primed CD4+CD62L-CD44high-memory T cells induce gluten-sensitive enteropathy in Rag1-/- mice. 2) Hydrolysis of secalins in germinated rye sourdough remains incomplete. Secalin peptides retain B and T cell stimulatory capacity and remain harmful to the intestinal mucosa in this celiac disease model. 3) Current antibody-based prolamin detection methods may fail to detect antigenic gluten fragments in processed cereal food products.
30545212	Gluten-free diet in non-celiac patients: beliefs, truths, advantages and disadvantages.	A gluten-free diet is the safest treatment for the treatment of patient with celiac disease (CD) and other gluten-related disorders. However, in the last years, gluten-free diet is one of the most popular diet followed by the general population and by patients affected from others clinical conditions, such as non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), autism, neurological, psychiatric and rheumatologic diseases and for improving sports practice. This review highlights some questions about the appropriateness of following this trend answering to some questions such as how safe are the current gluten-free products, what are the benefits and side effects of gluten-free diet and what are clinical conditions that might benefit from gluten avoidance.
23923139	Food labeling: gluten-free labeling of foods. Final rule.	The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is issuing a final rule to define the term "gluten-free'' for voluntary use in the labeling of foods. The final rule defines the term "gluten-free'' to mean that the food bearing the claim does not contain an ingredient that is a gluten-containing grain (e.g., spelt wheat); an ingredient that is derived from a gluten-containing grain and that has not been processed to remove gluten (e.g., wheat flour); or an ingredient that is derived from a gluten-containing grain and that has been processed to remove gluten (e.g., wheat starch), if the use of that ingredient results in the presence of 20 parts per million (ppm) or more gluten in the food (i.e., 20 milligrams (mg) or more gluten per kilogram (kg) of food); or inherently does not contain gluten; and that any unavoidable presence of gluten in the food is below 20 ppm gluten (i.e., below 20 mg gluten per kg of food). A food that bears the claim "no gluten,'' "free of gluten,'' or "without gluten'' in its labeling and fails to meet the requirements for a "gluten-free'' claim will be deemed to be misbranded. In addition, a food whose labeling includes the term "wheat'' in the ingredient list or in a separate "Contains wheat'' statement as required by a section of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) and also bears the claim "gluten-free'' will be deemed to be misbranded unless its labeling also bears additional language clarifying that the wheat has been processed to allow the food to meet FDA requirements for a "gluten-free'' claim. Establishing a definition of the term "gluten-free'' and uniform conditions for its use in food labeling will help ensure that individuals with celiac disease are not misled and are provided with truthful and accurate information with respect to foods so labeled. We are issuing the final rule under the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 (FALCPA).
28679156	Is Blood Transfusion Linked to Celiac Disease? A Nationwide Cohort Study.	The vast majority of patients with celiac disease (CD) have disease-specific antibodies. If such antibodies-or other blood-borne factors that cause CD-are transmissible, it might be reflected by a higher risk of CD in individuals who receive blood from donors with incipient CD. In a retrospective nationwide cohort study of 1,058,289 individuals in Sweden who received a blood transfusion between 1968 and 2012, we examined the risk of transmission of CD (defined as having villous atrophy on small intestinal biopsy) using Cox regression. We also examined whether there were clusters of CD patients who received blood transfusions from the same donor independent of the known donor CD status. Overall, 9,455 patients who had undergone transfusions (0.9%) received a blood transfusion from a donor who had been diagnosed with CD. Of these, 14 developed CD, which corresponds to a hazard ratio of 1.0 (95% confidence interval: 0.9, 1.2) compared with recipients of transfusions from unaffected donors. There were no cases of CD among persons who received plasma or platelet units from donors with CD. We found no evidence of CD clustering among recipients of blood from individual donors (P for trend = 0.28). Our results suggest that CD is not transmitted through blood transfusions.
29560673	An unusual cause of severe, persistent diarrhoea.	We present two cases of patients with severe persistent diarrhoea, in whom duodenal biopsies revealed villous atrophy that could be attributed to the use of olmesartan. The differential diagnosis of villous atrophy without serological markers of celiac disease should include drugs as possible cause, with olmesartan as a recently discovered culprit. Gastroenterologist should be aware of this entity.
24079778	Evaluation of visual and taste preferences of some gluten-free commercial products in a group of celiac children.	The purpose of this study was to investigate the visual and taste liking of three commercial gluten-free (GF) foods in a group of celiac children. Thirty celiac children, with diagnosis of celiac disease from more than 2 years, were recruited and 28 (21 females and 7 males, mean age 8.7 years) completed the study. Subjects performed individually six sensory tests, two for each product in different days separated by a week. In the test day, children had to evaluate the liking of the same type of product but of different four brands, before and after tasting them with a 5-point facial rating scale. Overall, the results showed that the majority of children appreciated more the appearance than the taste of all the GF products analysed. The present study provides the first and useful indications on the hedonic perceptions of celiac children about some commercial GF products.
22385112	Repertoire of gluten peptides active in celiac disease patients: perspectives for translational therapeutic applications.	Celiac disease is a common and lifelong food intolerance, affecting approximately 1% of the population. Because of a mechanism not completely understood, the ingestion of wheat gluten, and of homologue proteins of barley and rye, induces in genetically predisposed individuals pronounced inflammatory reactions mainly at the site of small intestine. Gluten, the triggering factor, is a complex protein mixture highly resistant to the gastrointestinal enzymatic proteolysis, and this results in the presence of large, and potentially immunogenic, peptides at the intestinal mucosa surface. During the last decade, several studies have defined gluten peptides able to stimulate adaptive T cells, of either CD4 or CD8 phenotype, and to activate innate (non T) immune cells. This review examines the complete repertoire of gluten peptides recognized by celiac T cells and discusses the several translational implications that the identification of these epitopes opens.
34065154	Health-Related Quality of Life and Experiences of Brazilian Celiac Individuals over the Course of the Sars-Cov-2 Pandemic.	Since the end of 2019, the world has been facing an unpredicted COVID-19 pandemic with consequences for the economy, environment, society, and health. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk of death, bringing unbearable psychological pressure upon people worldwide. For celiac patients, the pandemic may represent an additional burden concerning the inherent aspects of celiac disease (CD) that compromise these individuals' quality of life (QoL). Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate Brazilian celiac patients' QoL during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by its outbreak and rapid spread and subsequent restrictive measures in addition to the dietary restrictions and other burdens caused by CD. This country-wide cross-sectional study was conducted using a self-administered instrument previously validated in Brazilian-Portuguese to investigate the QoL of individuals with CD. Data collected through the online self-administration of the Brazilian version of the celiac disease quality of life questionnaire (CDQ) comprised 674 CD individuals' responses. Although pandemics have historically posed a challenge for Brazilian population, this period was not associated with a negative impact on Brazilian CD individuals' QoL. During the pandemic, the QoL of Brazilian's with CD was more affected by gastrointestinal aspects than emotions and social aspects and worries. Gender, age, marital status, having (or not) children, occupation, and a positive test for COVID-19 did not affect CD individuals' QoL. However, the study revealed a larger burden and diminished QoL for individuals not following a gluten-free diet and those using antidepressants. Additional research is necessary to verify how the length of the pandemic will affect celiac individuals and then compare those outcomes compare to the COVID-19 period and after.
27401607	Celiac disease diagnosis still significantly delayed - Doctor's but not patients' delay responsive for the increased total delay in women.	BACKGROUND: There is insufficient data on diagnostic delay and associated factors in celiac disease (CeD) as well as on its potential impact on the course of disease. METHODS: Specifically taking its two components - patients' and doctors' delay - into account, we performed a large systematic patient survey study among unselected CeD patients in Switzerland. RESULTS: We found a mean/median total diagnostic delay of 87/24 months (IQR 5-96), with a range from 0 up to 780 months and roughly equal fractions of patients' and doctors' delay. Both mean/median total (93.1/24 vs. 60.2/12, p<0.001) and doctors' (41.8/3 vs. 23.9/2, p<0.001) diagnostic delay were significantly higher in female vs. male patients, whereas patients' delay was similar, regardless of preceding irritable bowel syndrome diagnosis. Patients with a diagnostic delay shorter than 2 years were significantly less often in need of steroids and/or immunosuppressants, substitution for any nutritional deficiency but more often free of symptoms 6 and 12 months after diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: There is a substantial diagnostic delay in CeD, which is associated with a worse clinical outcome and significantly longer in female patients. This increased diagnostic delay in women is due to doctors' but not patients' delay and cannot be explained by antecedent IBS prior to establishing the CeD diagnosis.
23246645	Prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome-type symptoms in patients with celiac disease: a meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with celiac disease (CD) often report symptoms compatible with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, the prevalence of these symptoms in patients with CD and their relation to adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) have not been assessed systematically. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and EMBASE Classic (through July 2012) to identify cross-sectional surveys or case-control studies reporting prevalence of IBS-type symptoms in adult patients (>= 16 years old) with established CD. The number of individuals with symptoms meeting criteria for IBS was extracted for each study, according to case or control status and adherence to a GFD. Pooled prevalence and odds ratios (ORs), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were calculated. We analyzed data from 7 studies with 3383 participants. RESULTS: The pooled prevalence of IBS-type symptoms in all patients with CD was 38.0% (95% CI, 27.0%-50.0%). The pooled OR for IBS-type symptoms was higher in patients with CD than in controls (5.60; 95% CI, 3.23-9.70). In patients who were nonadherent with a GFD, the pooled OR for IBS-type symptoms, compared with those who were strictly adherent, was 2.69 (95% CI, 0.75-9.56). There was also a trend toward a higher OR for IBS-type symptoms among patients who did not adhere to the GFD, compared with controls (12.42; 95% CI, 6.84-11.75), compared with that observed for adherent CD patients vs controls (4.28; 95% CI, 1.56-11.75). CONCLUSIONS: IBS-type symptoms occur frequently in patients with CD and are more common than among controls. Adherence to a GFD might be associated with a reduction in symptoms.
35839368	Celiac Disease: Common Questions and Answers.	Celiac disease is an immune-mediated, multisystem disorder that affects genetically susceptible individuals who are exposed to gluten-containing grains such as wheat, barley, and rye. The condition can develop at any age. Celiac disease presents with a variety of manifestations such as diarrhea, weight loss, abdominal pain, bloating, malabsorption, and failure to thrive. Most adult patients will present with nonclassic symptoms, including less specific gastrointestinal symptoms or extraintestinal manifestations such as anemia, osteoporosis, transaminitis, and recurrent miscarriage. Immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase serologic testing is the recommended initial screening for all age groups. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with small bowel biopsy is recommended to confirm the diagnosis in most patients, including those with a negative serologic test for whom clinical suspicion of celiac disease persists. Biopsies may be avoided in children with high immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase (i.e., 10 times the upper limit of normal or more) and a positive test for immunoglobulin A endomysial antibodies in a second serum sample. Genetic testing for human leukocyte antigen alleles DQ2 or DQ8 may be performed in select cases. A gluten-free diet for life is the primary treatment, and patients may benefit from support groups and education on common and hidden sources of gluten, gluten-free substitutes, food labeling, balanced meal planning, dining out, dining during travel, and avoiding cross-contamination. Patients with celiac disease who do not respond to a gluten-free diet should have the accuracy of the diagnosis confirmed, have their diet reassessed, and be evaluated for coexisting conditions. Patients with refractory celiac disease should be treated by a gastroenterologist.
32762724	An updated overview of spectrum of gluten-related disorders: clinical and diagnostic aspects.	The incidence of gluten-related disorders (GRDs) continues to increase and its global prevalence is estimated at approximately 5% of the population. Celiac disease (CD), dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), gluten ataxia (GA), wheat allergy (WA), and non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) are the five major GRDs that present with a wide range of clinical manifestations. The diagnosis of GRDs can be challenging because the typical and atypical clinical manifestations of the GRDs overlap. In this review, the current definitions of gluten-related disorders, focusing on their clinical features, diagnostic and therapeutic approaches are presented. We concluded that GRDs are usually diagnosed using a combination of clinical features, serological tests, and histopathological findings. Treatment usually involves dietary modification.
23337171	Antibody titers against food antigens decrease upon a gluten-free diet, but are not useful for the follow-up of (refractory) celiac disease.	
39030381	Assessment of salivary microbiota profile as a potential diagnostic tool for pediatric celiac disease.	The association between oral dysbiosis and celiac disease (CD) remains poorly understood, as does the impact of CD-associated dysbiosis on disease development or exacerbation. This study aims to investigate alterations in salivary microbial composition among children with CD. In this cross-sectional study, saliva samples from 12 children with active CD (A-CD group), 14 children with CD on a gluten-free diet (GFD), and 10 healthy control (HC) children were analyzed using DNA sequencing targeting the 16S ribosomal RNA. Both patients in A-CD and GFD groups showed a significant increase (p = 0.0001) in the Bacteroidetes phylum, while the Actinobacteria phylum showed a significant decrease (p = 0.0001). Notably, the Rothia genus and R.aeria also demonstrated a significant decrease (p = 0.0001) within the both CD groups as compare to HC. Additionally, the control group displayed a significant increase (p = 0.006) in R.mucilaginosa species compared to both CD patient groups. Distinct bacterial strains were abundant in the saliva of patients with active CD, indicating a unique composition of the salivary microbiome in individuals with CD. These findings suggest that our approach to assessing salivary microbiota changes may contribute to developing noninvasive methods for diagnosing and treating CD.
26840467	INCREASED TISSUE TRANSGLUTAMINASE LEVELS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY IN ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY AMONG PATIENTS WITH CELIAC DISEASE.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is an autoimmune systemic disorder in genetically predisposed individuals precipitated by gluten ingestion. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to determine asymptomatic spike-and-wave findings on electroencephalography in children with celiac disease. METHODS: A total of 175 children with the diagnosis of celiac disease (study group) and 99 age- and sex-matched healthy children as controls (control group) were included in the study. In order to determine the effects of gluten free diet on laboratory and electroencephalography findings, the celiac group is further subdivided into two as newly-diagnosed and formerly-diagnosed patients. Medical histories of all children and laboratory findings were all recorded and neurologic statuses were evaluated. All patients underwent a sleep and awake electroencephalography. RESULTS: Among 175 celiac disease patients included in the study, 43 were newly diagnosed while 132 were formerly-diagnosed patients. In electroencephalography evaluation of patients the epileptiform activity was determined in 4 (9.3%) of newly diagnosed and in 2 (1.5%) of formerly diagnosed patients; on the other hand the epileptiform activity was present in only 1 (1.0%) of control cases. There was a statistically significant difference between groups in regards to the presence of epileptiform activity in electroencephalography. Pearson correlation analysis revealed that epileptiform activity in both sleep and awake electroencephalography were positively correlated with tissue transglutaminase levels (P=0.014 and P=0.019, respectively). CONCLUSION: We have determined an increased epileptiform activity frequency among newly-diagnosed celiac disease patients compared with formerly-diagnosed celiac disease patients and control cases. Moreover the tissue transglutaminase levels were also correlated with the presence of epileptiform activity in electroencephalography. Among newly diagnosed celiac disease patients, clinicians should be aware of this association and be alert about any neurological symptoms.
26381211	Experimental hookworm infection and escalating gluten challenges are associated with increased microbial richness in celiac subjects.	The intestinal microbiota plays a critical role in the development of the immune system. Recent investigations have highlighted the potential of helminth therapy for treating a range of inflammatory disorders, including celiac disease (CeD); however, the mechanisms by which helminths modulate the immune response of the human host and ameliorate CeD pathology are unknown. In this study, we investigated the potential role of alterations in the human gut microbiota in helminth-mediated suppression of an inflammatory disease. We assessed the qualitative and quantitative changes in the microbiota of human volunteers with CeD prior to and following infection with human hookworms, and following challenge with escalating doses of dietary gluten. Experimental hookworm infection of the trial subjects resulted in maintenance of the composition of the intestinal flora, even after a moderate gluten challenge. Notably, we observed a significant increase in microbial species richness over the course of the trial, which could represent a potential mechanism by which hookworms can regulate gluten-induced inflammation and maintain intestinal immune homeostasis. 
35216089	Inflammation Is Present, Persistent and More Sensitive to Proinflammatory Triggers in Celiac Disease Enterocytes.	Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by a genetic predisposition to an abnormal T cell-mediated immune response to the gluten in the diet. Different environmental proinflammatory factors can influence and amplify the T cell-mediated response to gluten. The aim of this manuscript was to study the role of enterocytes in CD intestinal inflammation and their response to different proinflammatory factors, such as gliadin and viruses. Intestinal biopsies from CD patients on a gluten-containing (GCD-CD) or a gluten-free diet (GFD-CD) as well as biopsies from potential CD patients (Pot-CD) before the onset of intestinal lesions and controls (CTR) were used to investigate IL-1beta and IL-6 mRNA levels in situ. Organoids from CD patients were used to test the levels of NF-kappaB, ERK, IL-6, and IL-1beta by Western blot (WB), ELISA, and quantitative PCR. The Toll-like receptor ligand loxoribine (Lox) and gliadin peptide P31-43 were used as proinflammatory stimuli. In CD biopsies inflammation markers IL-1beta and IL-6 were increased in the enterocytes, and also in Pot-CD before the onset of the intestinal lesion and in GFD-CD. The inflammatory markers pNF-kappaB, pERK, IL-1beta, and IL-6 were increased and persistent in CD organoids; these organoids were more sensitive to P31-43 and Lox stimuli compared with CTR organoids. Taken together, these observations point to constitutive inflammation in CD enterocytes, which are more sensitive to inflammatory stimuli such as food components and viruses.

29235012	Implications of Celiac Disease Among Patients Undergoing Gastric Bypass.	INTRODUCTION: Bariatric surgery is generally safe and effective, but co-existing malabsorptive processes may increase the risk of complications or nutritional deficiencies. Bariatric surgery has not been well studied in the setting of pre-existing celiac disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) from January 2002 to December 2015 were retrospectively reviewed for either diagnosis of or serum testing for celiac disease. Identified patients were re-reviewed for adherence to American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) diagnostic criteria. Patient demographics, operative data, and post-operative weight loss and nutritional parameters were collected. RESULTS: Of the > 12,000 patients who underwent bariatric surgery during this study period, there were 342 patients that had abnormal serology or pathology results. Expert review confirmed three patients (0.8%) with celiac disease diagnosed before RYGB procedure. All were female, with an average age of 33 years and a mean BMI of 44.07 kg/m2. At the time of surgery, two of the three patients were following a gluten-free diet. At 6 months follow-up, mean % excess weight loss was 76.5%. The patients following a gluten-free diet preoperatively continued post-operatively. No patients were anemic nor had vitamin B12 or iron deficiencies at 12-month follow-up. Two patients had vitamin D insufficiencies and responded to daily oral supplementation. CONCLUSION: Though many bariatric patients may carry a presumptive diagnosis of celiac disease, a small percentage of these meet AGA diagnostic criteria. RYGB appears safe in this population with comparable weight loss in non-celiac counterparts. Increased attention to vitamin D levels may be warranted post-operatively.
32217152	Real-World Gluten Exposure in Patients With Celiac Disease on Gluten-Free Diets, Determined From Gliadin Immunogenic Peptides in Urine and Fecal Samples.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: It is not clear how often patients who are on gluten-free diets (GFDs) for treatment of celiac disease still are exposed to gluten. We studied levels of gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) in fecal and urine samples, collected over 4 weeks, from patients with celiac disease on a long-term GFD. METHODS: We performed a prospective study of 53 adults with celiac disease who had been on a GFD for more than 2 years (median duration, 8 y; interquartile range, 5-12 y) in Argentina. At baseline, symptoms were assessed by the celiac symptom index questionnaire. Patients collected stool each Friday and Saturday and urine samples each Sunday for 4 weeks. We used a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure GIP in stool and point-of-care tests to measure GIP in urine samples. RESULTS: Overall, 159 of 420 stool and urine samples (37.9%) were positive for GIP; 88.7% of patients had at least 1 fecal or urine sample that was positive for GIP (median, 3 excretions). On weekends (urine samples), 69.8% of patients excreted GIP at least once, compared with 62.3% during weekdays (stool). The number of patients with a sample that was positive for GIP increased over the 4-week study period (urine samples in week 1 vs week 4: P < .05). Patients with symptoms had more weeks in which GIP was detected in stool than patients without symptoms (P < .05). The number of samples that were positive for GIP correlated with titers of deamidated gliadin peptide IgA in patients' blood samples, but not with levels of tissue transglutaminase. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with celiac disease on a long-term GFD still frequently are exposed to gluten. Assays to detect GIP in stool and urine might be used to assist dietitians in assessment of GFD compliance.
31201676	Effect of gluten diet on blood innate immune gene expressions and stool consistency in Spix's Saddleback Tamarin (Leontocebus fuscicollis) raised in captivity.	The callitrichids are non-human primates that feed on insects and plant matter in nature, but in captivity, they are fed mostly an artificial diet containing amounts of gluten, in their toxic forms in items such as wheat, barley and rye. The aim of this research was to estimate the blood beta-defensin and Toll like receptor 5 (TLR5) gene expressions and to analyze the stool consistency (firm, soft, diarrheic) in Leontocebus fuscicollis raised in captivity. Blood samples of animals under gluten-free and gluten diets were collected and their fecal output quality was periodically monitored and classified during the course of the study. Gene expression was evaluated using real-time PCR. The stool consistencies of individuals fed a gluten diet were most frequently soft or diarrheic, while it was mostly normal in individuals fed a gluten-free diet. beta-Defensin expression increased in individuals fed a gluten diet, but decreased after 15 days. Expression normalized between 30 and 45 days on a gluten-free diet. However, expression of the TLR5 gene did not change under a gluten diet. A gluten diet affects stool quality, and brings about an immediate increase in blood beta-defensin expression in the beginning but decreases after 15 days.
22051820	[A national online survey applied to patients with celiac disease in Chile].	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by the ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. Its prevalence in Europe and the USA is 0.5 to 1%. AIM: To analyze epidemiological aspects and degree of compliance with gluten-free diet (GFD) among Chilean individuals with CD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Subjects with confirmed or suspected CD were invited to answer an online survey published on the web at www.fundacionconvivir.cl. The answers were reinforced with a telephone interview. RESULTS: The survey was answered by 1212 subjects (79% females). Median age at diagnosis was 25.8 years (range 1 to 84 years), with a bimodal curve with two peaks at less than 3 years and at 20 to 40 years of age. The diagnosis was made only by serologic markers in 9%, only by intestinal biopsy in 17.5%, and by a combination of both methods in 70%o. Conditions associated with CD were reported by 30% > of subjects and 20% > had relatives with CD. The GFD was strictly adhered to by 70% >, occasionally by 27% > and never by 3% >. Seventy five percent of subjects with a strict adherence to GFD had a favorable clinical response compared with 42% > of those with incomplete or lack of adherence (odds ratio 4.0, 95% > confidence intervals 2.8-5.7p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In 30% of respondents, the diagnosis of CD was not confirmed according to international guidelines that require serology and duodenal biopsy. One third of subjects recognized a poor compliance with GFD. Those with a strict adherence to it had a more favorable clinical course. However, 25% > did not experience a clinical improvement despite a strict GFD, a finding which requires further study.

34767744	Emergence of an adaptive immune paradigm to explain celiac disease: a perspective on new evidence and implications for future interventions and diagnosis.	INTRODUCTION: Recent patient studies have shown that gluten-free diet is less effective in treating celiac disease than previously believed, and additionally patients remain vulnerable to gluten-induced acute symptoms and systemic cytokine release. Safe and effective pharmacological adjuncts to gluten-free diet are in preclinical and clinical development. Clear understanding of the pathogenesis of celiac disease is critical for drug target identification, establishing efficacy endpoints and to develop noninvasive biomarkers suitable to monitor and potentially diagnose celiac disease. AREAS COVERED: The role and clinical effects of CD4+ T cells directed against deamidated gluten in the context of an 'adaptive immune paradigm' are reviewed. Alternative hypotheses of gluten toxicity are discussed and contrasted. In the context of recent patient studies, implications of the adaptive immune paradigm for future strategies to prevent, diagnose, and treat celiac disease are outlined. EXPERT OPINION: Effective therapeutics for celiac disease are likely to be approved and necessitate a variety of new clinical instruments and tests to stratify patient need, monitor remission, and confirm diagnosis in uncertain cases. Sensitive assessments of CD4+ T cells specific for deamidated gluten are likely to play a central role in clinical management, and to facilitate research and pharmaceutical development.
32186586	Health related quality of life in celiac children and adolescents.	INTRODUCTION: The lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD) is the treatment of celiac disease (CD). Being a restrictive diet, it limits daily life and can impact on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Our objective was to assess HRQoL of celiac patients on a GFD, the concordance between patients - caregivers, and to compare the local results with international data. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Patients aged 8-18 years on a GFD for >6months (37 dyads) were evaluated. The "Celiac Disease Dutch Questionnaire" (CDDUX) was applied, which evaluates in two questionnaires (one applied to the child and another one to the caregiver/parent), three areas: i) having CD, ii) communication with others, and iii) the diet. Reliability, dimensionality, and internal consistency were assessed using the Cronbach coefficient. RESULTS: More than 50% of patients and caregivers reported "well/very well" on sub-scales "having CD" and "GFD"; "communication" showed high percentages of "bad/very bad". Although there were no significant differences in HRQoL (global and subscale) perceived by patients and caregivers, there were when analyzing the answers of caregivers, who assigned better scores to boys (p=0.022) and to patients maintaining a non-strict GFD (p=0.049). Concordance between patients and caregivers was 39.2%. DISCUSSION: HRQoL of the assessed celiac children was satisfactory, among the best repor ted in Latin America. "Having CD" and the need for a "GFD" have less influence on HRQoL than "communication" with others about the disease. The concordance found suggests that the caregivers' perception does not necessarily reflect what patients perceive.
25822444	Romanian guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.	In assessing exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), its diverse etiologies and the heterogeneous population affected should be considered. Diagnosing this condition remains a challenge in clinical practice especially for mild-to-moderate EPI, with the support of the time-consuming breath test or the coefficient of fat absorption. The fecal elastase-1 test, less precise for the diagnosis, cannot be useful for assessing treatment efficacy. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) is the mainstay of treatment, whereby enteric-coated mini-microspheres are taken with every meal, in progressive doses based on an individual's weight and clinical symptoms. The main indication for PERT is chronic pancreatitis, in patients who have clinically relevant steatorrhea, abnormal pancreatic function test or abnormal function tests associated with symptoms of malabsorption such as weight loss or meteorism. While enzyme replacement therapy is not recommended in the initial stages of acute pancreatitis, pancreatic exocrine function should be monitored for at least 6-18 months. In the case of unresectable pancreatic cancer, replacement enzyme therapy helps to maintain weight and improve overall quality of life. It is also indicated in patients with celiac disease, who have chronic diarrhea (in spite of gluten-free diet), and in patients with cystic fibrosis with proven EPI. 
38499339	New entity of adult ultra-short coeliac disease: the first international cohort and case-control study.	BACKGROUND: Ultra-short coeliac disease (USCD) is defined as villous atrophy only present in the duodenal bulb (D1) with concurrent positive coeliac serology. We present the first, multicentre, international study of patients with USCD. METHODS: Patients with USCD were identified from 10 tertiary hospitals (6 from Europe, 2 from Asia, 1 from North America and 1 from Australasia) and compared with age-matched and sex-matched patients with conventional coeliac disease. FINDINGS: Patients with USCD (n=137, median age 27 years, IQR 21-43 years; 73% female) were younger than those with conventional coeliac disease (27 vs 38 years, respectively, p<0.001). Immunoglobulin A-tissue transglutaminase (IgA-tTG) titres at index gastroscopy were lower in patients with USCD versus conventional coeliac disease (1.8xupper limit of normal (ULN) (IQR 1.1-5.9) vs 12.6xULN (IQR 3.3-18.3), p<0.001).Patients with USCD had the same number of symptoms overall (median 3 (IQR 2-4) vs 3 (IQR 1-4), p=0.875). Patients with USCD experienced less iron deficiency (41.8% vs 22.4%, p=0.006).Both USCD and conventional coeliac disease had the same intraepithelial lymphocytes immunophenotype staining pattern; positive for CD3 and CD8, but not CD4.At follow-up having commenced a gluten-free diet (GFD) (median of 1181 days IQR: 440-2160 days) both USCD and the age-matched and sex-matched controls experienced a similar reduction in IgA-tTG titres (0.5 ULN (IQR 0.2-1.4) vs 0.7 ULN (IQR 0.2-2.6), p=0.312). 95.7% of patients with USCD reported a clinical improvement in their symptoms. INTERPRETATION: Patients with USCD are younger, have a similar symptomatic burden and benefit from a GFD. This study endorses the recommendation of D1 sampling as part of the endoscopic coeliac disease diagnostic workup.
37191782	Celiac Disease on the Rise in the US Military Population: A 22 Year Retrospective Epidemiologic Study.	INTRODUCTION: We describe celiac disease epidemiology in the US military population. METHODS: This is a population-based study from data collected between 2000 and 2021. Incidence and prevalence rates and descriptive statistics for demographics are presented. RESULTS: Overall, 2248 incident cases of celiac disease were identified. The incidence rate increased from 1.2 to 14.0 per 100,000 person-years and the overall lifetime prevalence increased from 3.1 to 57.4 per 100,000 service members. In gastroenterology clinics, the incidence rate increased from 1.4 to 8.2 per 100,000 person-years, while prevalence increased from 3.3 to 33.4 per 100,000 service members. DISCUSSION: In this study, celiac disease incidence and prevalence increased significantly.
33515069	Adherence to gluten-free diet and follow-up of pediatric celiac disease patients, during childhood and after transition to adult care.	Long-term data on pediatric celiac disease (CD) patients after transition to adult care is scarce. We aimed to evaluate patients' adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD), the normalization of celiac serology and the frequency of follow-up before age 18, and to study changes in adherence and follow-up frequency after transition to adult care. Presenting symptoms, serology and biopsy results, patients' reported GFD adherence, frequency of follow-up visits, and complications before and after 18 years were collected for CD patients diagnosed between 1998 and 2017. Of 441 CD patients diagnosed and followed in childhood, a quarter (108/441) were over 18 y (years) at data collection. Median age at diagnosis 7.1 y (9 months-18 y), at data collection 23 y (18-38 y), disease duration 11.3 y (2-36 y). Below the age of 18 y, most patients 386/436 (88.5%) reported adherence to GFD, and most 372/425 (85.7%) normalized serology. Of the 441 patients, only 3 failed to attend any follow-up visit, and 338/441 (76.6%) attended yearly visits. Over the age 18 y, serology testing was done in 78/108 (72.2%), every 1-3 y in 46/78 (59%). Serology normalized in 61/78 (78.2%). Most adult patients 77/108 (71.5%) never attended a gastroenterology clinic. CD-related complications were rare. Younger age at diagnosis, regular follow-up visits in childhood, resolution of symptoms, and normalization of serology before age 18 were identified as predictors of negative serology after the age of 18 y.Conclusions: Children who have regular follow-up and normalize serology before age 18 years are likely to maintain a GFD and have negative serology as adults. What is Known:   The rate of adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD) is higher among children compared to adults.   Data on long-term follow-up after transition to adult care is scarce. What is New:   Patients diagnosed with CD at a younger age (<12 y), who have yearly follow-up visits, resolution of symptoms, and negative serology in childhood are very likely to maintain GFD and have negative serology as adults.   Even though most patients do not attend GI clinics after transition to adulthood, most adhere to GFD, and complications are rare.
31960667	Quantitative assessment of nutrition and nutritional status of patients with celiac disease aged 13-18	Background: Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease that affects about 1% of the European population and 0.3-1.3% of the world's population. The only method of treatment is introduction of a gluten-free diet. Objective: The aim of the study was to assess the nutrition of adolescents with celiac disease and to assess their nutritional status. Materials and methods: The study group comprised 24 patients with diagnosed celiac disease. The diagnosis was based on biopsy, serological tests and, in some cases, genetic tests. Anthropometric measurements included height, which was respectively 161.9 +-12.43 cm in boys and 163.6 +-9.03 cm in girls, and body weight oscillating between 56.55 +-16.24 kg for boys and 52.62 +-10.92 kg for girls. To assess the way of nutrition used an individually prepared questionnaire including an interview from the last 24 h. The menus were analyzed using the Dieta 5d program. The statistical analysis of the data was made using Statistica 12 program. Results: Gluten-free diet contributes to the occurrence of caloric deficiencies up to 36%. It was found inadequate intake of dietary fiber, for girls 15.45 +-9.84 g and 14.41 +-4.73 g for boys. It has been observed too low intake of ingredients such as calcium (565.65 +-347.41 mg), magnesium (223.41 +-73.84 mg), vitamin D (1.34 +-1.28 mug) and E (5.05 +-2.32 mg) as well as potassium (2848.67 +-1132.07 mg), iron (7.62 +-2.05 mg), zinc (7.11 +-2.41 mg) and thiamine (0.87 +-0.38 mg). The ingredients such as riboflavin, niacin, pyridoxine, cobalamin, and vitamins C and A were consumed in the right amount. Conclusions: Incorrectly used gluten-free diet may contribute to the recurrence of the disease. Chronic inadequate intake of fiber can lead to constipation. A deficiency of many nutrients can result in impaired development of the young organism such as anemia, growth retardation or osteoporosis.
25649738	Increased use of hypnotics in individuals with celiac disease: a nationwide case-control study.	BACKGROUND: Although poor sleep is common in numerous gastrointestinal diseases, data are scarce on the risk of poor sleep in celiac disease. The objective of this study was to estimate the risk of repeated use of hypnotics among individuals with celiac disease as a proxy measure for poor sleep. METHODS: This is a nationwide case-control study including 2933 individuals with celiac disease and 14,571 matched controls from the general Swedish population. Poor sleep was defined as >=2 prescriptions of hypnotics using prospective data from the National Prescribed Drug Register (data capture: July 2005-January 2008). We estimated odds ratios and hazard ratios for poor sleep before and after celiac disease diagnosis respectively. RESULTS: In this study, poor sleep was seen in 129/2933 individuals (4.4%) with celiac disease, as compared with 487/14,571 controls (3.3%) (odds ratio = 1.33; 95% CI = 1.08-1.62). Data restricted to sleep complaints starting >=1 year before celiac disease diagnosis revealed largely unchanged risk estimates (odds ratio = 1.23; 95% CI = 0.88-1.71) as compared with the overall risk (odds ratio 1.33). The risk of poor sleep in celiac disease was essentially not influenced by adjustment for concomitant psychiatric comorbidity (n = 1744, adjusted odds ratio =1.26; 95% CI = 1.02-1.54) or restless legs syndrome (n = 108, adjusted odds ratio = 1.33; 95% CI = 1.08-1.63). Poor sleep was also more common after celiac disease diagnosis as compared with matched controls (hazard ratio = 1.36; 95% CI = 1.30-1.41). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, individuals with celiac disease suffer an increased risk of poor sleep, both before and after diagnosis. Although we cannot rule out that surveillance bias has contributed to our findings, our results are consistent with previous data suggesting that sleep complaints may be a manifestation of celiac disease.
36615729	Circulating Extracellular Vesicles Are Increased in Newly Diagnosed Celiac Disease Patients.	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are a class of circulating entities that are involved in intercellular crosstalk mechanisms, participating in homeostasis maintenance, and diseases. Celiac disease is a gluten-triggered immune-mediated disorder, characterized by the inflammatory insult of the enteric mucosa following local lymphocytic infiltration, resulting in villous atrophy. The goal of this research was the assessment and characterization of circulating EVs in celiac disease patients, as well as in patients already on an adequate gluten-free regimen (GFD). For this purpose, a novel and validated technique based on polychromatic flow cytometry that allowed the identification and enumeration of different EV sub-phenotypes was applied. The analysis evidenced that the total, annexin V+, leukocyte (CD45+), and platelet (CD41a+) EV counts were significantly higher in both newly diagnosed celiac disease patients and patients under GFD compared with the healthy controls. Endothelial-derived (CD31+) and epithelial-derived (EpCAM+) EV counts were significantly lower in subjects under gluten exclusion than in celiac disease patients, although EpCAM+ EVs maintained higher counts than healthy subjects. The numbers of EpCAM+ EVs were a statistically significant predictor of intraepithelial leukocytes (IEL). These data demonstrate that EVs could represent novel and potentially powerful disease-specific biomarkers in the context of celiac disease.
22825365	A randomized, double-blind study of larazotide acetate to prevent the activation of celiac disease during gluten challenge.	OBJECTIVES: In patients with celiac disease, enteropathy is caused by the entry of gluten peptides into the lamina propria of the intestine, in which their immunogenicity is potentiated by tissue transglutaminase (tTG) and T-helper type 1-mediated immune responses are triggered. Tight junction disassembly and paracellular permeability are believed to have an important role in the transport of gluten peptides to the lamina propria. Larazotide acetate is a tight-junction regulator peptide that, in vitro, prevents the opening of intestinal epithelial tight junctions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of larazotide acetate in protecting against gluten-induced intestinal permeability and gastrointestinal symptom severity in patients with celiac disease. METHODS: In this dose-ranging, placebo-controlled study, 86 patients with celiac disease controlled through diet were randomly assigned to larazotide acetate (0.25, 1, 4, or 8 mg) or placebo three times per day with or without gluten challenge (2.4 g/day) for 14 days. The primary efficacy outcome was the urinary lactulose/mannitol (LAMA) fractional excretion ratio. Secondary endpoints included gastrointestinal symptom severity, quality-of-life measures, and antibodies to tTG. RESULTS: LAMA measurements were highly variable in the outpatient setting. The increase in LAMA ratio associated with the gluten challenge was not statistically significantly greater than the increase in the gluten-free control. Among patients receiving the gluten challenge, the difference in the LAMA ratios for the larazotide acetate and placebo groups was not statistically significant. However, larazotide acetate appeared to limit gluten-induced worsening of gastrointestinal symptom severity as measured by the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale at some lower doses but not at the higher dose. Symptoms worsened significantly in the gluten challenge-placebo arm compared with the placebo-placebo arm, suggesting that 2.4 g of gluten per day is sufficient to induce reproducible gluten toxicity. Larazotide acetate was generally well tolerated. No serious adverse events were observed. The most common adverse events were headache and urinary tract infection. CONCLUSIONS: LAMA variability in the outpatient setting precluded accurate assessment of the effect of larazotide acetate on intestinal permeability. However, some lower doses of larazotide acetate appeared to prevent the increase in gastrointestinal symptom severity induced by gluten challenge.
39351055	Advances in understanding and managing celiac disease: Pathophysiology and treatment strategies.	In this editorial, we comment on an article published in the recent issue of the World Journal of Gastroenterology. Celiac disease (CeD) is a disease occurring in genetically susceptible individuals, which is mainly characterized by gluten intolerance in the small intestine and clinical symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and malnutrition. Therefore, patients often need a lifelong gluten-free diet, which greatly affects the quality of life and expenses of patients. The gold standard for diagnosis is intestinal mucosal biopsy, combined with serological and genetic tests. At present, the lack of safe, effective, and satisfactory drugs for CeD is mainly due to the complexity of its pathogenesis, and it is difficult to find a perfect target to solve the multi-level needs of patients. In this editorial, we mainly review the pathological mechanism of CeD and describe the current experimental and improved drugs for various pathological aspects.
24574811	A trichobezoar in a child with undiagnosed celiac disease: a case report.	Celiac disease is a chronic, immune-mediated enteropathy caused by a permanent sensitivity to ingested gluten cereals that develops in genetically susceptible individuals. The classic presentation of celiac disease includes symptoms of malabsorption but has long been associated with cognitive, emotional, and behavioral disorders. We describe an 8-year-old patient with non-scarring alopecia and diagnosed with trichotillomania. Furthermore, she presented with a 3-year history of poor appetite and two or three annual episodes of mushy, fatty stools. Laboratory investigations showed a normal hemoglobin concentration and a low ferritin level. Serologic studies showed an elevated tissue immunoglobulin G anti-tissue transglutaminase level. A duodenal biopsy showed subtotal villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia, and a large gastric trichobezoar was found in the stomach. Immediately after beginning a gluten-free diet, complete relief of trichotillomania and trichophagia was achieved. In this report, we describe a behavioral disorder as a primary phenomenon of celiac disease, irrespective of nutritional status. 
35258261	[Gluten intolerance in infants and children: diagnosis and what recommendations?]	Gluten intolerance in infants and children: what diagnosis and what recommendations? Gluten intolerance or celiac disease is a relatively common pathology that is still underdiagnosed in pediatrics due to its heterogeneous presentation. Apart from the classic form of malabsorption with diarrhea and growth retardation, pathology should be sought in the event of a family history of celiac disease, autoimmunity and in the context of certain syndromes. Other clinical or laboratory signs should also suggest the diagnosis. Any suspicion should lead to assays for total IgA and anti- transglutaminase IgA. If the child is symptomatic or not, the absence of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with biopsies is possible to make the diagnosis after agreement of the family, if the levels of anti-transglutaminase IgA are greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal, and if the anti-endomysium IgA, assayed on a second sample, are also positive. Management is based on a strict gluten-free diet.
32505703	Celiac Disease: A Subtle Clue for a Common Disease.	
26171630	Gluten-free diet or alternative therapy: a survey on what parents of celiac children want.	OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease (CD) is treated by life-long gluten-free diet (GFD). Novel therapies are under development. Willingness of CD children's parents to alternative therapies and GFD impact were evaluated. METHODS: Parents of celiac children on GFD were investigated on need and preference for novel CD therapies, children's enrolment in trials, compliance to and personal judgment on GFD, health status (HS) and quality of life (QoL). RESULTS: About 59.5% surveyed parents expressed the need for alternative therapies with a preference for vaccine-based strategy (39.9%). About 37.7% would accept enrollment in an ad hoc trial, 20.3% would agree to endoscopy during the trial. GFD compliance was 97.4% and well accepted by 93.8%. HS and QoL significantly improved during GFD (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of novel therapies for CD is desirable for over half of parents, with preference for vaccines. Parents frown upon enrolment in new clinical trials and the subsequent need for additional endoscopy.
22097642	Irritable bowel syndrome: aeromedical considerations.	Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a gastrointestinal disorder diagnosed in accordance with the Rome III criteria. The pathophysiology of this illness is not well defined and there are no known structural abnormalities, biomedical markers, nor inflammatory causes to explain the symptoms. There are a number of serious illnesses, such as colon cancer, ulcerative colitis, and celiac disease that mimic IBS. If the Rome III criteria are satisfied and there are no alarm features of more serious illness, an in-depth workup is not necessary. There are numerous treatment regimens for IBS, none of which are curative nor offer universal relief. Some of the treatment regimens, such as antispasmodics and antidiarrheals, are not suitable for aviators because of anticholinergic effects and sedation. The aeromedical disposition decision is always challenging because of the vagaries of this illness. In general, a more liberal policy for pilots in civil aviation would be in order as long as symptoms are not frequent nor severe and not requiring antispasmodics or antidiarrheals while flying. A more conservative policy is in order for military pilots, possibly requiring restriction to multiseat aircraft.
29578652	Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity: How Its Gut Immune Activation and Potential Dietary Management Differ from Celiac Disease.	Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a clinical entity triggered by the ingestion of gluten-containing grains leading to intestinal and/or extraintestinal symptoms that resolve once the gluten-containing foodstuff is eliminated from the diet, and it is diagnosed when celiac disease (CD) and wheat allergy (WA) have been ruled out. The limited knowledge about the pathophysiology of NCGS and the lack of validated biomarkers are still major limitations for clinical studies, making it difficult to differentiate NCGS from other gluten-related disorders (GRD). In the absence of clear-cut diagnostic criteria, NCGS is still mainly a diagnosis of exclusion. Several studies suggest that NCGS is an immune-mediated disease that likely activates an innate immune response. Moreover, it has recently been hypothesized that in addition to gluten, other components of wheat may be responsible for the symptoms observed in individuals without CD. This review aims at discussing available evidence related to the histological and immunological features in the gut mucosa of patients with NCGS and at outlining new dietary opportunities for these patients.
29654912	Antibody Concentrations Decrease 14-Fold in Children With Celiac Disease on a Gluten-Free Diet but Remain High at 3 Months.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease can be identified by a serologic test for IgA against tissue transglutaminase (IgA-TTG) in a large proportion of children. However, the increased concentrations of antibody rarely normalize within the months after children are placed on a gluten-free diet (GFD). Early serologic predictors of sufficient adherence to GFD are required for optimal treatment. METHODS: In a prospective study, we observed the response to a GFD in 345 pediatric patients (67% girls; mean age, 8.4 y) who underwent duodenal biopsy to confirm or refute celiac disease from October 2012 through December 2015. Baseline serum samples were tested centrally for IgA-TTG and IgG against deamidated gliadin. Follow-up serologic analyses of children on a GFD were performed about 3 months later. RESULTS: The geometric mean concentration of IgA-TTG decreased from 72.4-fold to 5.2-fold the upper limit of normal (ULN), or by a factor of 14.0 (95% CI, 12.0-16.4). A substantial response (defined as a larger change than the typical variation in patients not on a GFD) was observed in 80.6% of the children. Only 28.1% of patients had a substantial response in the concentration of IgG against deamidated gliadin. Concentration of IgA-TTG remained above 1-fold the ULN in 83.8% of patients, and above 10-fold the ULN in 26.6% of patients with a substantial response. CONCLUSIONS: Serum concentration of IgA-TTG decreases substantially in most children with celiac disease within 3 months after they are placed on a GFD, but does not normalize in most. This information on changes in antibody concentrations can be used to assess patient response to the diet at short-term follow-up evaluations. Patients with a substantial response to a GFD often still have high antibody levels after 3 months. German Clinical Trials Registry no. DRKS00003854.
29210921	Celiac Disease by the Age of 13 Years Is Not Associated With Probiotics Administration in Infancy.	Probiotics are theoretically promising in primary prevention of celiac disease (CD), but research evidence on the topic is scarce. We used the data and material of a clinical double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial on primary allergy prevention (n = 1223) to investigate in an exploratory study whether administration of a mix of pro- and prebiotics during late pregnancy and first 6 months of life was associated with prevalence of CD during 13-year follow-up. Children who fulfilled diagnostic criteria for CD (n = 11) and subjects with a serum sample available for analyzing CD antibodies (n = 867) were included. CD or elevated tissue transglutaminase IgA antibodies were not associated with probiotics or placebo. Nor were there any associations with the mode of delivery, the duration of exclusive or total breast-feeding, or respiratory infections during the first 2 years of life. Allergic diseases or sensitization by the age of 2 or 5 years were not clearly associated with the development of CD.
26912167	Celiac crisis in adults: a case report and review of the literature focusing in the prevention of refeeding syndrome.	INTRODUCTION: Celiac crisis is a life-threatening complication of celiac disease that is rarely described in adults. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 31-year-old man with celiac crisis as a first manifestation of celiac disease. The patient presented with severe diarrhea, metabolic acidosis, and electrolyte disturbances accompanied by electrocardiographic alterations. A satisfactory clinical response was obtained after the correction of electrolyte abnormalities, hydration, and nutritional support with a gluten-free diet according to recommendations for patients at high risk of refeeding syndrome. CONCLUSION: Celiac crisis generally occurs in patients with no previous diagnosis of celiac disease. The physician should therefore be aware of this diagnosis and consider celiac crisis in cases of unexplained intense secretory diarrhea, metabolic acidosis and severe electrolyte alterations in adults. The risk of refeeding syndrome should be assessed when a gluten-free diet is introduced and treatment of celiac crisis should include prevention and management of this possible complication.
30769836	Persistent Economic Burden of the Gluten Free Diet.	Gluten free (GF) products have been reported to be more expensive and less available than their gluten containing counterparts. We examined the current U.S. cost and availability of GF products and made comparisons to the marketplace over a decade ago. Cost, determined by price per ounce and availability of a "market basket" of regular and GF products across four venues and five geographic regions was compared using a student's t test. GF products were more expensive (overall 183%), and in all regions and venues (p < 0.001). GF products from mass-market producers were 139% more expensive than the wheat-based version of the same product. Availability of GF products was greatest (66%) in the health food and upscale venues. In contrast to the results of the 2006 study, the cost of GF products has declined from 240% to 183% (adjusted for inflation). The introduction of mass-market production of GF products may have influenced the increase in availability and overall reduction of cost since 2006. The extent to which the cost of GF products impacts dietary adherence and quality of life for those on a GFD warrants exploration.
22476042	Immunoglobulin A deficiency in celiac disease.	GOALS: To determine the prevalence and significance of immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency and partial deficiency in patients with celiac disease (CD). BACKGROUND: Selective IgA deficiency is a common primary immunoglobulin deficiency and has a higher prevalence in patients with CD. The prevalence and significance of IgA deficiency and partial deficiency in patients with CD in the United States has not previously been examined. STUDY: A retrospective, cohort study of 1498 adults and 317 children seen in a University Medical Center was conducted. RESULTS: There were 26 patients (22 adults, 4 children) with CD who were IgA deficient and 11 (9 adults, 2 children) with CD who were partially IgA deficient. The prevalence of IgA deficiency/partial deficiency was similar among adults and children (2.1% and 1.9%, respectively, P=0.99). Among adults, concomitant autoimmune disease was present in 29% of IgA-deficient/partially deficient patients versus 12% of CD patients with normal IgA levels (P=0.0081). All 4 IgA-deficient patients who had persistently positive IgG celiac serologies while adherent to a gluten-free diet and were rebiopsied had a normal repeat biopsy. Both positive tissue transglutaminase IgG and antigliadin IgG were found in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: Selective IgA deficiency/partial deficiency is present in 2% of CD patients at this referral center and is equally prevalent among adults and children. IgA-deficient/partially deficient adults had a higher prevalence of concomitant autoimmune disease than those without IgA deficiency. In patients who are IgA deficient, IgG serologies may be persistently elevated despite histologic recovery.
32583650	[THE INFLUENCE OF GLUTEN ON THE SHARPNESS OF VISION].	INTRODUCTION: An eighty five old male was diagnosed with celiac disease. Six months before the diagnosis he complained of difficulties in his sight. In an optimetrical examination a decline in sharpness of sight was found: Right (R) - 6/19, Left (L) - 6/12. Following a few months of a gluten-free diet his situation improved and the signs of celiac disease disappeared. The sharpness of sight was re-examined and good improvement was found: L - 6/9, R - 6/12. This means that gluten might influence the sharpness of sight.

36049123	Immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in celiac disease.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: SARS-CoV-2 infection and development of the disease COVID-19 is a serious threat to our society. Effective vaccines have now entered the market, but most patient populations were not included in the registration clinical trials. There is evidence that patients with celiac disease (CeD) have reduced effect of vaccines such as the hepatitis B vaccine. Hence, we investigated the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (Chadox1, Comirnaty and Spikevax) in CeD patients and healthy controls. METHODS: CeD patients from a patient registry at Oslo University Hospital were invited to donate serum samples before and after vaccination. We sent out 1537 invitations and received paired samples from 85 individuals. These were compared with similar samples from 238 healthy controls. Sera were analyzed for antibodies to the Spike protein from SARS-CoV2 and the receptor-binding domain. The results where then converted into binding antibody units (BAU)/ml to compare. RESULTS: Prevaccination samples showed that very few patients had been earlier exposed to Sars-CoV2 and the antibody levels were low. Postvaccination analysis showed overlap of antibody levels between CeD and healthy controls. On average, the CeD patient group had 5555.0 BAU/ml (330.1 SD) while the average in healthy controls was 5419 (184.7 SD). CONCLUSION: The humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in CeD patients is similar to that observed in healthy controls.
37895160	Unraveling the Immunopathological Landscape of Celiac Disease: A Comprehensive Review.	Celiac disease (CD) presents a complex interplay of both innate and adaptive immune responses that drive a variety of pathological manifestations. Recent studies highlight the role of immune-mediated pathogenesis, pinpointing the involvement of antibodies against tissue transglutaminases (TG2, TG3, TG6), specific HLA molecules (DQ2/8), and the regulatory role of interleukin-15, among other cellular and molecular pathways. These aspects illuminate the systemic nature of CD, reflecting its wide-reaching impact that extends beyond gastrointestinal symptoms to affect other physiological systems and giving rise to a range of pathological landscapes, including refractory CD (RCD) and, in severe cases, enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma. The existing primary therapeutic strategy, a gluten-free diet (GFD), poses significant challenges, such as low adherence rates, necessitating alternative treatments. Emerging therapies target various stages of the disease pathology, from preventing immunogenic gluten peptide absorption to enhancing intestinal epithelial integrity and modulating the immune response, heralding potential breakthroughs in CD management. As the understanding of CD deepens, novel therapeutic avenues are emerging, paving the way for more effective and sophisticated treatment strategies with the aim of enhancing the quality of life of CD patients. This review aims to delineate the immunopathology of CD and exploring its implications on other systems, its complications and the development of novel treatments.
32345653	Screening and Treatment Outcomes in Adults and Children With Type 1 Diabetes and Asymptomatic Celiac Disease: The CD-DIET Study.	OBJECTIVE: To describe celiac disease (CD) screening rates and glycemic outcomes of a gluten-free diet (GFD) in patients with type 1 diabetes who are asymptomatic for CD. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Asymptomatic patients (8-45 years) were screened for CD. Biopsy-confirmed CD participants were randomized to GFD or gluten-containing diet (GCD) to assess changes in HbA1c and continuous glucose monitoring over 12 months. RESULTS: Adults had higher CD-seropositivity rates than children (6.8% [95% CI 4.9-8.2%, N = 1,298] vs. 4.7% [95% CI 3.4-5.9%, N = 1,089], P = 0.035) with lower rates of prior CD screening (6.9% vs. 44.2%, P < 0.0001). Fifty-one participants were randomized to a GFD (N = 27) or GCD (N = 24). No HbA1c differences were seen between the groups (+0.14%, 1.5 mmol/mol; 95% CI -0.79 to 1.08; P = 0.76), although greater postprandial glucose increases (4-h +1.5 mmol/L; 95% CI 0.4-2.7; P = 0.014) emerged with a GFD. CONCLUSIONS: CD is frequently observed in asymptomatic patients with type 1 diabetes, and clinical vigilance is warranted with initiation of a GFD.
21616111	Upregulation of KIR3DL1 gene expression in intestinal mucosa in active celiac disease.	Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) modulate natural killer (NK) and T-cell function by human leukocyte antigen class I interaction and have been implicated in celiac disease (CD). Qualitative expression of 16 KIR genes was determined in biopsies from 22 CD patients at diagnosis and after >2 years on a gluten-free diet (GFD). Quantitative expression analysis of KIR2DL4, KIR3DL1, KIR3DL3, and KLRC2 (a marker of an NK-reprogrammed T-cell subpopulation augmented in CD) was performed in 35 additional CD biopsy pairs and 14 non-CD control biopsies. No specific KIR expression profile was observed in CD. KIR3DL1 was more frequently expressed in active CD compared with GFD (p = 0.0312) and controls (p = 0.0008), with slightly increased levels in active disease. KLRC2 was overexpressed in active (p = 0.0037) and GFD (p = 0.0469) patients compared with non-CD controls and coexpressed with KIR3DL1. Results suggest the participation of KIR3DL1 overexpression in the overall immune activation seen in CD mucosa, which could be partly explained by the NK-like T-cell subpopulation increase.
28343658	Text Message Intervention (TEACH) Improves Quality of Life and Patient Activation in Celiac Disease: A Randomized Clinical Trial.	OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of the Text Message Educational Automated Compliance Help (TEACH) text message intervention as a pragmatic approach for patient engagement among adolescents with celiac disease (CD) as measured by gluten-free diet (GFD) adherence, patient activation, and quality of life (QOL). STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial with patient recruitment at a pediatric, university-based hospital and through social media; 61 participants ages 12-24 years with CD diagnosed at least 1 year were enrolled. The TEACH intervention cohort received 45 unique text messages over a 3-month study period while the control group received standard of care treatment. Primary outcome measures included objective markers of GFD adherence included serum tissue transglutaminase IgA and deamidated gliadin peptide IgA levels. Secondary patient-reported outcomes collected via online survey included the Celiac Dietary Adherence Test, National Institutes of Health (NIH) Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Global Short Form measure of QOL, Celiac Symptom Index, and Patient Activation Measure. All measures were assessed at enrollment and after the 3-month study period. Statistical analysis performed using the 2-tailed paired Student t test. RESULTS: Among the TEACH intervention group, there was significant improvement comparing enrollment scores with 3-month follow-up scores in patient activation (Patient Activation Measure score 63.1 vs 72.5, P?=?.01) and QOL (NIH PROMIS Global Mental Health 50.8 vs 53.3, P?=?.01 and NIH PROMIS Global Physical Health 50.8 vs 57.7, P?=?.03). There was no statistically significant difference in patient-reported or objectively measured GFD adherence. CONCLUSIONS: TEACH is an effective intervention among patients with CD to improve patient activation and QOL, even among a cohort with GFD adherence at baseline. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02458898.
30322070	Gluten and Functional Abdominal Pain Disorders in Children.	In children, functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are common at all ages. Consumption of certain foods, particularly gluten, is frequently associated with the development and persistence of FGIDs and functional abdominal pain disorders (FAPDs) in adults and children. However, this association is not well defined. Even without a diagnosis of celiac disease (CD), some people avoid gluten or wheat in their diet since it has been shown to trigger mostly gastrointestinal symptoms in certain individuals, especially in children. The incidence of conditions such as non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is increasing, particularly in children. On the other hand, CD is a chronic, autoimmune small intestinal enteropathy with symptoms that can sometimes be mimicked by FAPD. It is still unclear if pediatric patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are more likely to have CD. Abdominal, pain-associated FGID in children with CD does not seem to improve on a gluten-free diet. The threshold for gluten tolerance in patients with NCGS is unknown and varies among subjects. Thus, it is challenging to clearly distinguish between gluten exclusion and improvement of symptoms related solely to functional disorders.
28950706	Efficacy of a point-of-care test based on deamidated gliadin peptides for the detection of celiac disease in pediatric patients.	OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to assess the effectiveness of a point-of-care test (POCT) based on deamidated gliadin peptides (DGP) compared to the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) criteria diagnosis in the early detection of celiac disease (CD) in pediatric patients. METHODS: One hundred children (<= 18 years) with suspected CD were selected, including siblings of celiac children that underwent gastroscopy for other gastrointestinal conditions. Patients with severe disease, following a gluten-free diet (GFD), with gastrointestinal bleeding, coagulopathy and infections in the last month were excluded. All children were evaluated with a POCT that detects immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to DGP and total IgA. The POCT results were compared to CD diagnosis according to current ESPGHAN criteria. This involved the detection of IgA tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies, the results of an intestinal biopsy and genetic testing. RESULTS: The prevalence of CD found in the present study was 48% (95% confidence interval in parenthesis 37.9-58.2%). The results of the POCT were concordant with the CD diagnosis made according to ESPGHAN criteria: 95.8% (85.7-99.4%) sensitivity, 98.1% (89.7-99.7%) specificity, 97.9% (88.7-99.6%) positive predictive value and 96.2% (87.0-99.4%) negative predictive value. Positive and negative likelihood ratios were 49.8 (7.2-347.5) and 0.04 (0.01-0.17), respectively. The POCT showed a 100% diagnostic accuracy in children younger than ten years of age. In total, three discordant results were found. CONCLUSION: Due to the high diagnostic accuracy in the pediatric population, the POCT can be considered as an effective tool for the early diagnosis of CD, especially in patients younger than ten years of age.
22461154	Non responsive celiac disease due to coexisting hereditary fructose intolerance.	Celiac disease is associated with several genetic disorders, but its association with hereditary fructose intolerance is rare. Hereditary fructose intolerance is a rare autosomal recessive disease of fructose metabolism presenting as vomiting after intake of fructose. An association between these two distinct genetic gastrointestinal disorders is important as treatment failure of celiac disease calls for careful evaluation for hereditary fructose intolerance. We report a patient with an association of these two disorders.
25925923	Motility alterations in celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity.	Regulation of gut motility is complex and involves neuromuscular, immune and environmental mechanisms. It is well established that patients with celiac disease (CD) often display gut dysmotility. Studies have shown the presence of disturbed esophageal motility, altered gastric emptying, and dysmotility of the small intestine, gallbladder and colon in untreated CD. Most of these motor abnormalities resolve after a strict gluten-free diet, suggesting that mechanisms related to the inflammatory condition and disease process are responsible for the motor dysfunction. Motility abnormalities are also a hallmark of functional bowel disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), where it has been proposed as underlying mechanism for symptom generation (diarrhea, constipation, bloating). Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a poorly defined entity, mostly self-diagnosed, that presents clinically with IBS symptoms in the absence of specific celiac markers. Patients with NCGS are believed to react symptomatically to wheat components, and some studies have proposed the presence of low-grade inflammation in these patients. There is little information regarding the functional characterization of these patients before and after a gluten-free diet. A study suggested the presence of altered gastrointestinal transit in NCGS patients who also have a high prevalence of nonspecific anti-gliadin antibodies. Results of an ongoing clinical study in NCGS patients with positive anti-gliadin antibodies before and after a gluten-free diet will be discussed. Elucidating the mechanisms for symptom generation in NCGS patients is important to find new therapeutic alternatives to the burden of imposing a strict gluten-free diet in patients who do not have CD.
33321805	Is Gluten the Only Culprit for Non-Celiac Gluten/Wheat Sensitivity?	The gluten-free diet (GFD) has gained increasing popularity in recent years, supported by marketing campaigns, media messages and social networks. Nevertheless, real knowledge of gluten and GF-related implications for health is still poor among the general population. The GFD has also been suggested for non-celiac gluten/wheat sensitivity (NCG/WS), a clinical entity characterized by intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms induced by gluten ingestion in the absence of celiac disease (CD) or wheat allergy (WA). NCG/WS should be regarded as an "umbrella term" including a variety of different conditions where gluten is likely not the only factor responsible for triggering symptoms. Other compounds aside from gluten may be involved in the pathogenesis of NCG/WS. These include fructans, which are part of fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs), amylase trypsin inhibitors (ATIs), wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and glyphosate. The GFD might be an appropriate dietary approach for patients with self-reported gluten/wheat-dependent symptoms. A low-FODMAP diet (LFD) should be the first dietary option for patients referring symptoms more related to FODMAPs than gluten/wheat and the second-line treatment for those with self-reported gluten/wheat-related symptoms not responding to the GFD. A personalized approach, regular follow-up and the help of a skilled dietician are mandatory.
26825336	Association of ADHD and Celiac Disease: What Is the Evidence? A Systematic Review of the Literature.	Objective: This article tries to answer the question whether or not there is evidence for a relationship between celiac disease (CD) and ADHD. A review of the current literature on this topic is provided. Method: PUBMED/MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Google scholar were searched to include all published trials on ADHD and CD (no date limitation, both noncontrolled and controlled trials). In addition, the reference list of included studies was screened to find other relevant articles. Results: Eight studies report a possible association between CD and ADHD; however, the results are inconsistent. Only three out of eight studies report a positive correlation between ADHD and CD. Conclusion: Up till now, there is no conclusive evidence for a relationship between ADHD and CD. Therefore, it is not advised to perform routine screening of CD when assessing ADHD (and vice versa) or to implement gluten-free diet as a standard treatment in ADHD.
21274381	Evaluation of Cladribine treatment in refractory celiac disease type II.	AIM: To evaluate cladribine [2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CdA)] therapy in refractory celiac disease (RCD) II. METHODS: An open-label cohort-study of RCD II patients treated with 2-CdA was performed between 2000 and 2010. Survival rate, enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL) occurrence, clinical course, and histological and immunological response rates were evaluated. RESULTS: Overall, 32 patients were included with a median follow-up of 31 mo. Eighteen patients responded well to 2-CdA. Patients responsive to 2-CdA had a statistically significant increased survival compared to those who were unresponsive. The overall 3- and 5-year survival was 83% in the responder and 63% and 22% in the non-responder group, respectively. The overall 2-year clinical, histological and immunological response rates were 81%, 47% and 41%, respectively. Progression into EATL was reported in 16%, all of these patients died. CONCLUSION: Treatment of RCD II with 2-CdA holds promise, showing excellent clinical and histological response rates, and probably less frequent transition into EATL.
24857202	A second duodenal biopsy is necessary in the follow-up of adult coeliac patients.	INTRODUCTION: Coeliac disease is a chronic enteropathy requiring a close follow-up. However, the best way to follow up coeliac patients has not yet been established. In the last 14 years, we have been offering patients a thorough series of periodical examinations including a histological re-evaluation at 12-18 months. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The notes of all coeliac patients attending our clinic between September 1999 and March 2013 were examined. RESULTS: Data from 317 adult patients were collected. Duodenal biopsy showed a lack of satisfactory histological response in 25/317 patients; endomysial antibodies were still positive in 76, and diet adherence and clinical response were unsatisfactory in 58 and 97, respectively. Correlations of serological data, clinical response, and diet adherence with histological findings were evaluated. Although the P values showed statistically significant differences, sensitivity and specificity were disappointing: 64% and 80% for serological response, 48% and 71% for clinical response, 56% and 85% for diet adherence. CONCLUSIONS: After 12-18 months on a gluten-free diet, 8% of the patients do not present a satisfactory histological response; only some of them could have been identified with a serological and/or clinical re-evaluation. Therefore, a duodenal biopsy seems to be the only tool that could identify patients with unsatisfactory histological response.
38670283	The Economic Iceberg of Celiac Disease: More Than the Cost of Gluten-Free Food.	Celiac disease (CeD) is a chronic autoimmune disorder of global relevance, with the potential for acute and long-term complications. However, the economic burden of CeD is rarely considered and largely thought of as limited to the cost of gluten-free food. Fortunately, recent research has shed light on the various societal costs of CeD across the health care continuum. This article summarizes the current evidence on the economic impacts of CeD, which suggest that the societal economic burden of CeD stretches beyond the cost of gluten-free food. This review provides ample evidence of larger but hidden costs related to excess health care use for complications and comorbidities, as well as reduced productivity. Although significant advances are expected in the management of CeD, their effect on the economic burden of CeD remain uncertain. The aim of this review was to inform stakeholders across society and contribute to improved policies to support patients with CeD.
25756783	The effects of reduced gluten barley diet on humoral and cell-mediated systemic immune responses of gluten-sensitive rhesus macaques.	Celiac disease (CD) affects approximately 1% of the general population while an estimated additional 6% suffers from a recently characterized, rapidly emerging, similar disease, referred to as non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). The only effective treatment of CD and NCGS requires removal of gluten sources from the diet. Since required adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) is difficult to accomplish, efforts to develop alternative treatments have been intensifying in recent years. In this study, the non-human primate model of CD/NCGS, e.g., gluten-sensitive rhesus macaque, was utilized with the objective to evaluate the treatment potential of reduced gluten cereals using a reduced gluten (RG; 1% of normal gluten) barley mutant as a model. Conventional and RG barleys were used for the formulation of experimental chows and fed to gluten-sensitive (GS) and control macaques to determine if RG barley causes a remission of dietary gluten-induced clinical and immune responses in GS macaques. The impacts of the RG barley diet were compared with the impacts of the conventional barley-containing chow and the GFD. Although remission of the anti-gliadin antibody (AGA) serum responses and an improvement of clinical diarrhea were noted after switching the conventional to the RG barley diet, production of inflammatory cytokines, e.g., interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) by peripheral CD4+ T helper lymphocytes, persisted during the RG chow treatment and were partially abolished only upon re-administration of the GFD. It was concluded that the RG barley diet might be used for the partial improvement of gluten-induced disease but its therapeutic value still requires upgrading-by co-administration of additional treatments. 
21646922	From menarche to menopause: the fertile life span of celiac women.	OBJECTIVE: We evaluated menopause-associated disorders and fertile life span in women with celiac disease (CD) under untreated conditions and after long-term treatment with a gluten-free diet. METHODS: The participants were 33 women with CD after menopause (untreated CD group), 25 celiac women consuming a gluten-free diet at least 10 years before menopause (treated CD group), and 45 healthy volunteers (control group). The Menopause Rating Scale questionnaire was used to gather information on menopause-associated disorders. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire was used to acquire information on physical activity. RESULTS: Untreated celiac women had a shorter duration of fertile life span than did the control women because of an older age of menarche and a younger age of menopause (P < 0.01). The scores for hot flushes, muscle/joint problems, and irritability were higher in untreated celiac women than in the control women (higher by 49.4%, 121.4%, and 58.6%, respectively; P < 0.05). In comparison with untreated CD, long-lasting treatment of CD was not associated with a significant difference in the duration of fertile life span, but was only associated with a significant reduction in muscle/joint problems (a reduction of 47.1%; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Late menarche and early menopause causes a shorter fertile period in untreated celiac women compared with control women. A gluten-free diet that started at least 10 years before menopause prolongs the fertile life span of celiac women. The perception of intensity of hot flushes and irritability is more severe in untreated celiac women than in controls. Low physical exercise and/or poorer quality of life frequently reported by untreated celiac women might be the cause of reduced discomfort tolerance, thus increasing the subjective perception of menopausal symptoms.
37614445	Potential determinants of vaccine hesitancy among celiac disease patients: a single cohort analysis.	Introduction: Though researchers and scholars have greatly emphasized addressing the influencing factors of vaccination hesitancy, little attention has been paid to patients with celiac disease. Addressing the variables hampering attitudes might help direct appropriate patient advocacy and doctor-patient communication endeavors to encourage vaccination among celiac disease patients. The present investigation seeks to explore the coverage against vaccine-preventable diseases, vaccination attitudes, and related possible factors among celiac disease patients in the Pakistani setting. Methods: A self-reported online survey was conducted in Islamabad, Pakistan, for celiac disease patients aged 18 and above. The questionnaire was completed by 226 participants, with a response rate of 43.8%. The influencing variables for vaccination hesitancy were examined, and 95% confidence intervals for the crude and adjusted odds ratios were computed. Results: Among the study population, the majority were females, with a ratio of 75.66%. A prominent proportion of 69.03% was observed for influenza vaccination, while 39.82% were unable to recall all of the vaccinations they had previously received. Only 7% of the patients were considered to have a negative attitude toward vaccination, compared to an estimated 76% who were in favor of it. The significantly positive influencing factors observed toward vaccination were being well-educated (graduate, master, or above), possible recurrence of vaccine-preventable diseases with declining vaccination coverage (adjusted OR: 13.36), and increased confidence in vaccines from health care experts compared to electronic media (adjusted OR: 8.41). Contrarily, practicing complementary and alternative medicines (adjusted OR: 5.59), willingness to get vaccinated again in the future (adjusted OR: 15.59), and prior negative perspectives (adjusted OR: 1.01) were the determinants with a significant negative association. Discussion: In conclusion, the outcomes of the current work raise the possibility that health practitioners may be accountable for inappropriately prescribing vaccines to this demographic since 77% of the participants had a favorable attitude toward vaccination. These findings could serve as a springboard for creating targeted immunization efforts to raise vaccination coverage against vaccine-preventive diseases among celiac disease patients.
32751300	Beneficial Effects of a Low-Nickel Diet on Relapsing IBS-Like and Extraintestinal Symptoms of Celiac Patients during a Proper Gluten-Free Diet: Nickel Allergic Contact Mucositis in Suspected Non-Responsive Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: Nickel (Ni)-rich foods can induce allergic contact mucositis (ACM) with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like symptoms in predisposed subjects. Ni ACM has a high prevalence (>30%) in the general population and can be diagnosed by a Ni oral mucosa patch test (omPT). Many celiac disease (CD) patients on a gluten-free diet (GFD) often show a recrudescence of gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms, although serological and histological remission has been achieved. Since a GFD often results in higher loads of ingested alimentary Ni (e.g., corn), we hypothesized that it would lead to a consequent intestinal sensitization to Ni in predisposed subjects. We wanted to (1) study Ni ACM prevalence in still symptomatic CD patients on a GFD and (2) study the effects of a low-Ni diet (LNiD) on their recurrent symptoms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We recruited 102 consecutive CD patients (74 female, 28 male; age range 18-65 years, mean age 42.3 +- 7.4) on a GFD since at least 12 months, in current serological and histological remission (Marsh-Oberhuber type 0-I) who complained of relapsing gastrointestinal and/or extraintestinal symptoms. INCLUSION CRITERIA: presence of at least three gastrointestinal symptoms with a score >=5 on the modified Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) questionnaire. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: IgE-mediated food allergy; history of past or current cancer; inflammatory bowel diseases; infectious diseases including Helicobacter pylori; lactose intolerance. All patients enrolled underwent Ni omPT and followed a LNiD for 3 months. A 24 symptoms questionnaire (GSRS modified according to the Salerno Experts' Criteria, with 15 gastrointestinal and 9 extraintestinal symptoms) was administered at T0 (free diet), T1 (GFD, CD remission), T2 (recurrence of symptoms despite GFD), and T3 (GFD + LNiD) for comparisons. Comparisons were performed using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. RESULTS: Twenty patients (all female, age range 23-65 years, mean age 39.1 +- 2.9) out of 102 (19.6%) were finally included. All 20 patients enrolled (100%) showed positive Ni omPT, confirming an Ni ACM diagnosis. A correct GFD (T0 vs. T1) induced the improvement of 19 out of the total 24 (79.2%) symptoms, and 14 out of 24 (58.3%) were statistically significant (p-value < 0.0083 according to Bonferroni correction). Prolonged GFD (T1 vs. T2) revealed the worsening of 20 out of the total 24 (83.3%) symptoms, and 10 out of 24 (41.7%) were statistically significant. LNiD (T2 vs. T3) determined an improvement of 20 out of the total 24 (83.4%) symptoms, and in 10 out of 24 (41.7%) symptoms the improvement was statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the recrudescence of gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms observed in CD subjects during GFD may be due to the increase in alimentary Ni intake, once gluten contamination and persisting villous atrophy are excluded. Ni overload can induce Ni ACM, which can be diagnosed by a specific Ni omPT. Improvement of symptoms occurs after a proper LNiD. These encouraging data should be confirmed with larger studies.
29076383	Influenza and risk of later celiac disease: a cohort study of 2.6 million people.	OBJECTIVES: Influenza has been linked to autoimmune conditions, but its relationship to subsequent celiac disease (CD) is unknown. Our primary aim was to determine the risk of CD after influenza. A secondary analysis examined the risk of CD following pandemic influenza vaccination. METHODS: This nationwide register-based cohort study included 2,637,746 Norwegians (born between 1967-2013) followed during 2006-2014 with information on influenza diagnosed in primary or non-primary care, pandemic vaccination (Pandemrix), and subsequent CD. Cox regression yielded hazard ratios adjusted (HR) for socio-demographic characteristics and earlier healthcare use. RESULTS: During 13,011,323 person-years of follow-up 7321 individuals were diagnosed with CD (56/100,000 person-years). There were 351,666 individuals diagnosed with influenza, including 82,980 during the 2009-2010 pandemic, and 969,968 individuals were vaccinated. Compared with participants without influenza, who had a CD incidence of 55/100,000 person-years, those diagnosed with seasonal and pandemic influenza had a rate of 68 and 78, per 100,000 person-years, respectively. The HR for CD was 1.29 (95%CI, 1.21-1.38) after seasonal influenza and 1.29 (95%CI, 1.15-1.44) after pandemic influenza; HRs remained significantly increased one year after exposure, when restricted to laboratory-confirmed influenza, and after multivariate adjustments. The reverse association, i.e., risk of influenza after CD, was not significant (HR 1.05; 95%CI, 0.98-1.12). The HR for CD after pandemic vaccination was 1.08 (95%CI, 1.03-1.14). CONCLUSION: A positive association with influenza diagnosis is consistent with the hypothesis that infections may play a role in CD development. We could neither confirm a causal association with pandemic vaccination, nor refute entirely a small excess risk.
28283419	Circulating gluten-specific FOXP3+CD39+ regulatory T cells have impaired suppressive function in patients with celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disorder of the gut triggered by dietary gluten. Although the effector T-cell response in patients with celiac disease has been well characterized, the role of regulatory T (Treg) cells in the loss of tolerance to gluten remains poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: We sought to define whether patients with celiac disease have a dysfunction or lack of gluten-specific forkhead box protein 3 (FOXP3)+ Treg cells. METHODS: Treated patients with celiac disease underwent oral wheat challenge to stimulate recirculation of gluten-specific T cells. Peripheral blood was collected before and after challenge. To comprehensively measure the gluten-specific CD4+ T-cell response, we paired traditional IFN-gamma ELISpot with an assay to detect antigen-specific CD4+ T cells that does not rely on tetramers, antigen-stimulated cytokine production, or proliferation but rather on antigen-induced coexpression of CD25 and OX40 (CD134). RESULTS: Numbers of circulating gluten-specific Treg cells and effector T cells both increased significantly after oral wheat challenge, peaking at day 6. Surprisingly, we found that approximately 80% of the ex vivo circulating gluten-specific CD4+ T cells were FOXP3+CD39+ Treg cells, which reside within the pool of memory CD4+CD25+CD127lowCD45RO+ Treg cells. Although we observed normal suppressive function in peripheral polyclonal Treg cells from patients with celiac disease, after a short in vitro expansion, the gluten-specific FOXP3+CD39+ Treg cells exhibited significantly reduced suppressive function compared with polyclonal Treg cells. CONCLUSION: This study provides the first estimation of FOXP3+CD39+ Treg cell frequency within circulating gluten-specific CD4+ T cells after oral gluten challenge of patients with celiac disease. FOXP3+CD39+ Treg cells comprised a major proportion of all circulating gluten-specific CD4+ T cells but had impaired suppressive function, indicating that Treg cell dysfunction might be a key contributor to disease pathogenesis.
29451364	Prevalence of celiac disease in adult Chinese patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome: A prospective, controlled, cohort study.	OBJECTIVE: Celiac disease is a chronic inflammatory enteropathy with a symptom spectrum similar to that of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It is a common but largely undiagnosed condition in the Western countries. However, it is extremely rare among Chinese individuals, and few studies have investigated its prevalence in China. The aim was to determine the prevalence of celiac disease in patients with IBS who were diagnosed using the Rome III criteria in a single center of northern China. METHODS: This was a single-center, prospective, controlled cohort study performed in Qilu Hospital involving 246 patients with IBS and 246 healthy controls. Blood samples were drawn to assess serum tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin A (tTg-IgA). Patients with a positive or equivocal tTg-IgA (>=15 U/mL) were subjected to probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) and duodenal biopsy to confirm celiac disease. RESULTS: Altogether 12 (4.9%) patients with IBS and two (0.8%) healthy controls were positive or equivocal for serum tTg-IgA. Of these, five patients with IBS underwent pCLE and a targeted biopsy; all were histopathologically found to have celiac disease, although one was eventually diagnosed with lymphoma. After implementation of a gluten-free diet, seven patients serologically positive for IBS showed clinical improvement, thus our study illustrated a minimum prevalence of 2.85% of celiac disease among patients with IBS in our center. CONCLUSIONS: Celiac disease is not rare in Chinese individuals, particularly among those with IBS. Therefore, it should receive higher attention in clinical practice in China.
38166645	Celiac disease symptom profiles and their relationship to gluten-free diet adherence, mental health, and quality of life.	BACKGROUND: A subgroup of adults with celiac disease experience persistent gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms, which vary between individuals and the cause(s) for which are often unclear. METHODS: The present observational study sought to elucidate patterns of persistent symptoms and the relationship between those patterns and gluten-free diet adherence, psychiatric symptoms, and various aspects of quality of life (QOL) in an online sample of adults with celiac disease. U.S. adults with self-reported, biopsy-confirmed celiac disease (N = 523; Mage = 40.3 years; 88% women; 93.5% White) voluntarily completed questionnaires as part of the iCureCeliac  research network: (a) Celiac Symptoms Index (CSI) for physical symptoms and subjective health; (b) Celiac Dietary Adherence Test for gluten-free diet adherence; (c) PROMIS-29, SF-36, and Celiac Disease Quality of Life Survey for psychiatric symptoms and QOL. Symptom profiles were derived using latent profile analysis and profile differences were examined using auxiliary analyses. RESULTS: Latent profile analysis of CSI items determined a four-profile solution fit best. Profiles were characterized by: (1) little to no symptoms and excellent subjective health (37% of sample); (2) infrequent symptoms and good subjective health (33%); (3) occasional symptoms and fair to poor subjective health (24%); (4) frequent to constant symptoms and fair to poor subjective health (6%). Profiles 2 and 3 reported moderate overall symptomology though Profile 2 reported relatively greater extraintestinal symptoms and Profile 3 reported relatively greater gastrointestinal symptoms, physical pain, and worse subjective health. Profiles differed on anxiety and depression symptoms, limitations due to physical and emotional health, social functioning, and sleep, but not clinical characteristics, gluten-free diet adherence, or QOL. Despite Profile 3's moderate symptom burden and low subjective health as reported on the CSI, Profile 3 reported the lowest psychiatric symptoms and highest quality of life on standardized measures. CONCLUSIONS: Adults with celiac disease reported variable patterns of persistent symptoms, symptom severity, and subjective health. Lack of profile differences in gluten-free diet adherence suggests that adjunctive dietary or medical assessment and intervention may be warranted. Lower persistent symptom burden did not necessarily translate to better mental health and QOL, suggesting that behavioral intervention may be helpful even for those with lower celiac symptom burden.
34610833	Activated gut-homing CD8+ T cells for coeliac disease diagnosis on a gluten-free diet.	BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of coeliac disease (CD) in individuals that have started a gluten-free diet (GFD) without an adequate previous diagnostic work-out is a challenge. Several immunological assays such as IFN-gamma ELISPOT have been developed to avoid the need of prolonged gluten challenge to induce the intestinal damage. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of activated gut-homing CD8+ and TCRgammadelta+ T cells in blood after a 3-day gluten challenge and to compare it with the performance of IFN-gamma ELISPOT in a HLA-DQ2.5 subsample. METHODS: A total of 22 CD patients and 48 non-CD subjects, all of them following a GFD, underwent a 3-day 10-g gluten challenge. The percentage of two T cell subsets (CD8+ CD103+ beta7hi CD38+/total CD8+ and TCRgammadelta+ CD103+ beta7hi CD38+/total TCRgammadelta+) in fresh peripheral blood drawn baseline and 6 days after the challenge was determined by flow cytometry. IFN-gamma ELISPOT assays were also performed in HLA-DQ2.5 participants. ROC curve analysis was used to assess the diagnostic performance of the CD8+ T cell response and IFN-gamma ELISPOT. RESULTS: Significant differences between the percentage of the two studied subsets of CD8+ and TCRgammadelta+ cells at days 0 and 6 were found only when considering CD patients (p < 10-3 vs. non-CD subjects). Measuring activated CD8+ T cells provided accurate CD diagnosis with 95% specificity and 97% sensitivity, offering similar results than IFN-gamma ELISPOT. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide a highly accurate blood test for CD diagnosis in patients on a GFD of easy implementation in daily clinical practice.
26265523	Bilateral Femoral Neck Fatigue Fracture due to Osteomalacia Secondary to Celiac Disease: Report of Three Cases.	Bilateral non traumatic femoral neck fatigue fracture is a rare condition usually occurring secondary to medical conditions such as pregnancy, pelvic irradiation, corticosteroid exposure, chronic renal failure and osteomalacia. In this report, we present three young female patients with bilateral femoral neck fracture secondary to osteomalacia. The underlying cause of osteomalacia was Celiac disease in all patients. The patients were treated with closed reduction and internal fixation with cannulated lag screws. They were free of pain and full weight bearing was achieved at three months. There were no complications, avascular necrosis and nonunion during the follow up period. In patients with bone pain, non traumatic fractures and muscle weakness, osteomalacia should be kept in mind and proper diagnostic work-up should be performed to identify the underlying cause of osteomalacia such as celiac disease. 
22752636	Effect of addition of short course of prednisolone to gluten-free diet on mucosal epithelial cell regeneration and apoptosis in celiac disease: a pilot randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Identification of adjuvant treatment is necessary for rapid and effective treatment in patients with celiac disease. In a pilot randomized controlled trial, the effect of prednisolone on enterocyte apoptosis and regeneration in celiac disease was investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-three treatment-naive patients with celiac disease were randomized to either gluten-free diet (GFD, n = 17) or GFD + prednisolone (1 mg/kg for 4 weeks, n = 16). Duodenal biopsies were taken at baseline and at 4 and 8 weeks posttreatment. Six patients with functional dyspepsia were recruited as controls. All these biopsies were stained for markers of intrinsic apoptotic pathway (AIF, H2AX, p53), common apoptotic pathway (CC3, M30), apoptotic inhibitors (XIAP, Bcl2), and epithelial proliferation (Ki-67). Apoptotic (AI) and proliferation indices (PI) were compared. RESULTS: At baseline duodenal biopsies, the end apoptotic products H2AX and M30 were significantly increased. In comparison with those treated with GFD alone, after 4 weeks of GFD + prednisolone treatment, some markers of both intrinsic and common apoptotic pathways showed rapid decline. After prednisolone withdrawal, there was overexpression of H2AX, CC3, and p53 in the latter group. In comparison with those treated with only GFD, patients treated with prednisolone showed suppression of mucosal PI, which started rising again after withdrawal of prednisolone. CONCLUSIONS: Apoptosis takes place in mucosal epithelium in celiac disease. Addition of short course of prednisolone suppresses apoptosis rapidly. However, it also suppresses epithelial regeneration; hence, if used, it should be withdrawn after an initial short course.
26633487	Gliadin-Specific T-Cells Mobilized in the Peripheral Blood of Coeliac Patients by Short Oral Gluten Challenge: Clinical Applications.	Celiac disease (CD) is a common lifelong food intolerance triggered by dietary gluten affecting 1% of the general population. Gliadin-specific T-cell lines and T-cell clones obtained from intestinal biopsies have provided great support in the investigation of immuno-pathogenesis of CD. In the early 2000 a new in vivo, less invasive, approach was established aimed to evaluate the adaptive gliadin-specific T-cell response in peripheral blood of celiac patients on a gluten free diet. In fact, it has been demonstrated that three days of ingestion of wheat-containing food induces the mobilization of memory T lymphocytes reactive against gliadin from gut-associated lymphoid tissue into peripheral blood of CD patients. Such antigen-specific T-cells releasing interferon-gamma can be transiently detected by using the enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays or by flow cytometry tetramer technology. This paper discusses the suitability of this in vivo tool to investigate the repertoire of gluten pathogenic peptides, to support CD diagnosis, and to assess the efficacy of novel therapeutic strategies. A systematic review of all potential applications of short oral gluten challenge is provided. 
27480087	Gluten, Dysbiosis, and Genetics in Celiac Disease: All Are Important.	
31434299	Gluten and FODMAPS-Sense of a Restriction/When Is Restriction Necessary?	Gluten-free diet (GFD) is enjoying increasingly popularity, although gluten-free products are considerably more expensive. GFD is absolutely necessary for patients with celiac disease, as in this case even minor amounts of gluten can lead to the destruction of the intestinal mucosa. In addition, GFD is currently the best therapy to improve clinical symptoms of patients with non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), although the diet may not be as strict as that for patients with celiac disease. Beside gluten, other wheat components such as oligosaccharides and amylase trypsin inhibitors are discussed as triggers of NCGS in this review. An overlap between gastrointestinal symptoms in NCGS and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is described. Patients with NCGS attribute their symptoms to the consumption of gluten, while patients with IBS rarely describe gluten as a trigger. Recently, several studies have demonstrated that the introduction of a low FODMAP (fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides, and polyols) diet reduced gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with IBS and this diet is suggested as the first choice of therapy in IBS. However, a low FODMAP diet also eliminates prebiotica and may negatively influence the gut microbiota. For this reason, the diet should be liberalized after symptom improvement. There is no evidence that a GFD is healthier than the standard diet. In contrast, GFD often is accompanied by nutritional deficiencies, mainly minerals and vitamins. Therefore, GFD and low FODMAP diets are not recommended for healthy subjects. Since wheat contains fructans belonging to FODMAPs), a GFD is not only gluten-free but also has less FODMAPs. Thus, symptom improvement cannot be correctly correlated with the reduction of either one or the other.
25130630	[Celiac disease in adult patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus].	OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of celiac disease in adult patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Influence the new started treatment of celiac disease on glycemic control and body mass index (BMI) of the patients. Prevail the anti-transglutaminase antibody (atTG) positivity one year after commencement of the therapy. METHODS: A retrospective assessment of celiac disease targeted screening in 465 adult T1DM patients at Diabetes Center, 1st Medical Department, University Hospital in Pilsen (80 % of all T1DM patients) from 1. 1. 2007 until 1. 7. 2011. Enterobiopsy was indicated in case of atTG-A (or atTG-G) positivity. In patients with newly started gluten-free diet, HbA1c and BMI within a year after diagnosis of celiac disease were compared to a year period six months after treatment commencement (3-4 visits), atTG was evaluated one year after treatment beginning. Paired T-test was used for statistical evaluation. RESULTS: The prevalence of all forms of celiac disease in the studied group was 10.5 %. Celiac disease diagnosed in childhood was found in 1.1 % patients (5/465). Positivity of atTG was newly observed in 9.5 % (44/465) patients. Three patients with atTG > 300 kIU/l refused the enterobiopsy examination. Celiac disease is highly plausible. The influence of gluten-free diet on BMI and HbA1c could not be evaluated due to the lack of compliance. 22 patients had a potential form of celiac disease (negative histology). Positive enterobiopsy was found in 19 patients (4.1 %). Another 3 patients had to be excluded from the subgroup of 22 patients (newly indicated gluten-free diet) as the HbA1c values and BMI were affected by the primary diagnosis of T1DM. Subgroup characteristics: 9 women and 7 men, mean age 38 +- 12 years, diabetes duration 21 +- 13 years, celiac disease diagnosed 20.7 +- 13 years since first diagnosis of T1DM. No statistically significant change in HbA1c (67 +- 11.4 vs 69 +- 13.9 mmol/mol) was observed in the studied period, however and a significant change of BMI from 25.4 +- 4.2 to 25.9 +- 4.3 (p < 0.01) was found. The atTG positivity prevailed in 47 % (9/19) of patients after one year. CONCLUSION: A total prevalence of the celiac disease in the group of adult T1DM patients was 10.5 %. No significant change in HbA1c occurred following treatment, a significant change of BMI was observed. The atTG positivity prevailed in 47 % of patients after one year.
25988560	Hepatitis B Virus Revaccination With Standard Versus Pre-S Vaccine in Previously Immunized Patients With Celiac Disease.	OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have suggested that hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccines may be less immunogenic in individuals with celiac disease (CD). A pre-S vaccine (Sci-B-Vac) has demonstrated superior immunogenicity compared with standard HBV vaccines in several diseases. We compared the short-term immunogenicity of a pre-S vaccine with a HBV vaccine (Engerix B) for repeat vaccination of seronegative, previously immunized patients with CD. METHODS: Participants were 1 to 18-year-old children with CD who despite standard HBV vaccines in infancy had nonprotective hepatitis B surface antibody (HBs-Ab) concentrations (<=10 mIU/mL). Patients were randomized to receive either Engerix B or pre-S vaccine. HBs-Ab concentrations were measured 1 month after the first dose. For those who had not responded after 1 dose, measurement was repeated after the third dose. RESULTS: Children (n = 82) were analyzed (42 pre-S vaccine and 40 Engerix B). Baseline characteristics were similar for both groups, including gluten-free diet status. Both arms showed high response rates following the first injection: 41 (98%) versus 35 (87%) for pre-S vaccine and Engerix B recipients, respectively (P = 0.08). All other patients responded when measured after dose 3. HBs-Ab concentrations (mIU/mL) were higher in the pre-S vaccine group (median 925, interquartile range [IQR] 424-1000) than the Engerix B group (median 363, IQR 106-996, P = 0.005). Twenty (48%) of the pre-S vaccine recipients were "high responders" (>1000 mIU/mL) versus 10 (25%) in Engerix B recipients (P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Both vaccines elicited adequate booster responses in most previously vaccinated patients with CD with nonprotective HBs-Ab concentrations. Pre-S vaccine administration resulted in higher Hbs-Ab concentrations. Our data suggest that a single dose of either vaccine is sufficient to raise titers to protective levels in most patients with CD.
22060243	Delay to celiac disease diagnosis and its implications for health-related quality of life.	BACKGROUND: To determine how the delay in diagnosing celiac disease (CD) has developed during recent decades and how this affects the burden of disease in terms of health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and also to consider differences with respect to sex and age. METHODS: In collaboration with the Swedish Society for Coeliacs, a questionnaire was sent to 1,560 randomly selected members, divided in equal-sized age- and sex strata, and 1,031 (66%) responded. HRQoL was measured with the EQ-5D descriptive system and was then translated to quality-adjusted life year (QALY) scores. A general population survey was used as comparison. RESULTS: The mean delay to diagnosis from the first symptoms was 9.7 years, and from the first doctor visit it was 5.8 years. The delay has been reduced over time for some age groups, but is still quite long. The mean QALY score during the year prior to initiated treatment was 0.66; it improved after diagnosis and treatment to 0.86, and was then better than that of a general population (0.79). CONCLUSIONS: The delay from first symptoms to CD diagnosis is unacceptably long for many persons. Untreated CD results in poor HRQoL, which improves to the level of the general population if diagnosed and treated. By shortening the diagnostic delay it is possible to reduce this unnecessary burden of disease. Increased awareness of CD as a common health problem is needed, and active case finding should be intensified. Mass screening for CD might be an option in the future.
24938882	Treatment of celiac disease: from gluten-free diet to novel therapies.	Gluten-free diet (GFD) is the cornerstone treatment for celiac disease (CD). This diet excludes the protein gluten a protein forum in in grains such as wheat, barley, rye and triticale. Gluten causes small intestines inflammation in patients with CD and eating a GFD helps these patients in controlling signs and symptoms and prevent complications. Following a GFD may be frustrating, however, it is important to know that plenty of foods are naturally gluten-free and nowadays is relatively easy to find substitutes for gluten-containing foods. Certain grains, such as oats, are generally safe but can be contaminated with wheat during growing and processing stages of production. For this reason, it is generally recommended avoiding oats unless they are specifically labelled gluten-free. Other products that may contain gluten include food additives, such as malt flavouring, modified food starch and some supplement and/or vitamins that use gluten as a binding agent. Cross-contamination occurs when gluten-free foods come into contact with foods that contain gluten. It can happen during the manufacturing process or if the same equipment is used to make a variety of products. Cross-contamination can also occur at home if foods are prepared on common surfaces or with utensils that have not been cleaned after being used to prepare gluten-containing foods (using a toaster for gluten-free and regular bread). Although safe and effective, the GFD is not ideal: it is expensive, of limited nutritional value, and not readily available in many countries. Consequently, a need exists for novel, non-dietary therapies for celiac disease. Advances in understanding the immunopathogenesis of CD have suggested several types of therapeutic strategies alternative to the GFD. Some of these strategies attempt to decrease the immunogenicity of gluten-containing grains by manipulating the grain itself or by using oral enzymes to break down immunogenic peptides that normally remain intact during digestion. Other strategies focus on preventing the absorption of these peptides, preventing tissue transglutaminase from rendering gluten peptides more immunogenic, or inhibiting their binding to CD-specific antigen-presenting molecules. Strategies that limit T cell migration to the small intestine or that re-establish mucosal homeostasis and tolerance to gluten antigens are also being explored.
28374643	The unknown burden and cost of celiac disease in the U.S.	INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease that results from exposure to gluten in genetically susceptible individuals and leads to a range of gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms. Areas covered: In order to evaluate the literature with respect to burden associated with celiac disease in the U.S. and identify any knowledge gaps, we performed a literature review of journal articles published between 2000-2016. We note that celiac disease is a prevalent condition associated with a significant burden of disease through its impact on morbidity, quality of life, as well as through increased costs associated with its diagnosis and management. At the same time, knowledge gaps exist in our understanding of the precise epidemiologic burden in the U.S.; the trade-offs between burden and benefit of a gluten-free diet; and better estimation of the costs of diagnosis, treatment and management.Expert commentary: Additional research is necessary to better understand these gaps to be able to reduce burden of celiac disease, particularly the impact on health-related quality of life and the costs associated with inaccurate or delayed diagnoses and insufficient treatment of disease.
30561389	Growth changes after gluteen free diet in pediatric celiac patients: a literature-review.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is an auto-immune disorder characterized by clinical manifestations that appear in genetically predisposed subjects after gluten ingestion. In the last years, there has been a progressive change in clinical manifestations. Our aim was to evaluate the nutritional status of children with celiac disease at diagnosis and how the gluten-free diet (GFD) influences their growth. METHODS: A search on PubMed/Medline was performed using "celiac disease", "body mass index" and "children" as key words.  Medline, Scopus, PubMed publisher and Google Scholar were searched as well.  We selected clinical studies describing the nutritional status of patients before and after GFD using indicators like height, weight, BMI, skeletal age.  We excluded papers referred to adult population or in which other diseases were related to celiac disease. Also literature-reviews were excluded. RESULTS: From 1999 to 2018, 10 studies were found. Overall, 1383 patients in pediatric age were evaluated for their nutritional status at diagnosis of celiac disease and after a variable period from 1 to 17 years of GFD. Indicators considered were height, weight, BMI and skeletal age. CONCLUSIONS: the nutritional status of celiac patients at diagnosis is variable including an increasing number of overweight and obese. GFD has a beneficial impact on growth changes determining a correction of BMI distribution towards a Gaussian shape.
33919430	Mobile Application for Promoting Gluten-Free Diet Self-Management in Adolescents with Celiac Disease: Proof-of-Concept Study.	Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic disease treated by maintaining and managing a lifelong restrictive gluten-free diet. The purpose of this study was to develop a mobile application, Plan My C-Day, to promote self-management skills among youth with CD during adolescence-a time when decreased adherence often occurs-and examine its usability among adolescents with CD. Plan My C-Day contains three simulations of activities involving eating out and actions to take when preparing for these events. It was developed and pilot tested by 13 adolescents with CD. Application use and user perception data were collected and analyzed. Participants chose 160 actions within the simulations. For over 75% of participants, the time to complete the simulation decreased from the first to the third (last) simulation by an average of 50%. The average reported usability perception was 3.71 on a scale of 1 to 5, with system ease of use and ease of learning obtaining the highest scores. This study demonstrated that the Plan My C-Day mobile application's self-management content, features, and functions operated well and that the simulations were easy to understand and complete. Further development will include the option to add self-created activities and adaptation to different languages and cultures.
23200727	Difficult diagnosis of celiac disease: diagnostic accuracy and utility of chromo-zoom endoscopy.	BACKGROUND: Chromo-zoom endoscopy has been demonstrated to be valuable in assessing the degree of intestinal villous atrophy in patients with suspected celiac disease. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of chromo-zoom endoscopy in patients with difficult diagnosis because of nonconcordant test results and/or the confounding of a gluten-free diet initiated before an appropriate diagnosis of celiac disease and to compare the findings to a recent reference standard, the in vitro gliadin challenge test. DESIGN: Prospective, case-control study. SETTING: Tertiary-care referral hospital. PATIENTS: Patients without celiac disease (negative control group, n = 9), patients with celiac disease (positive control group, n = 41), and patients with difficult diagnosis (n = 27). INTERVENTION: Chromo-endoscopy with indigo carmine and endoscopic zoom-magnification were performed. Duodenal fragments were collected for the in vitro gliadin challenge test. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was used for statistical analyses on accuracy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Diagnostic accuracy of chromo-zoom endoscopy for detection of mucosal abnormalities in patients with difficult diagnosis. RESULTS: Chromo-zoom endoscopy had a high accuracy for celiac disease diagnosis in analyses on negative controls and positive controls (area under roc = 0.99). In the difficult diagnosis group, the accuracy of chromo-zoom endoscopy was lower (area under roc = 0.83), but it increased after exclusion of patients with celiac disease on gluten-free diet (area under roc = 0.88). LIMITATIONS: There was a 4% failure rate in the ability to cultivate biopsies. Also, the study was done at an academic medical center. CONCLUSION: Chromo-zoom endoscopy has high accuracy for cases of difficult diagnosis of celiac disease but only in untreated patients with celiac disease.
36510401	The Investigation of Nutritional Status, Intestinal Permeability, and Quality of Life in People with Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is associated with impaired intestinal epithelial barrier integrity. Its consequences affect the nutritional status and quality of life of patients. This study aimed to determine nutritional status, intestinal permeability, and quality of life in people with celiac disease. It was researched whether patients who are non-compliant to gluten-free diet have higher serum zonulin levels and intestinal permeability. METHODS: The study was completed with 44 celiac patients. Dietary records and a questionnaire were used to evaluate patients' compli ance to the gluten-free diet. Dietary records were analyzed by using a nutrition analysis program. Anthropometric measurements were taken. Body compositions were analyzed to assess the nutritional status of patients. Blood samples were collected and then zonulin levels and total serum proteins were measured to evaluate intestinal permeability. Celiac Disease Questionnaire was used to assess the quality of life scores. RESULTS: Patients were divided into 2 groups considering compliance to the gluten-free diet and it was found that 17 patients were com pliant to the gluten-free diet, and 27 patients were non-compliant to the gluten-free diet. Serum zonulin, zonulin/total protein ratio, and intestinal permeability were higher in non-compliant to the gluten-free diet group (P < .05). There was no significant difference between anthropometric measurements, Celiac Disease Questionnaire scores, daily energy, and nutrient intakes of groups (P > .05). CONCLUSION: The content of a gluten-free diet has a decisive role in the nutritional status and quality of life of celiac patients. Additionally, zonulin levels and intestinal permeability were higher in people with celiac disease who are non-compliant to gluten-free diet.
34959858	Changes in Diet and Anthropometric Parameters in Children and Adolescents with Celiac Disease-One Year of Follow-Up.	Celiac disease (CD) may cause numerous nutrient deficiencies that a proper gluten-free diet (GFD) should compensate for. The study group consists of 40 children, aged 8.43 years (SD 3.5), on average, in whom CD was diagnosed on the basis of clinical symptoms, immunological and histopathological results. The patients' height, weight, diet and biochemical tests were assessed three times: before diagnosis, after six months, and following one year of GFD. After one year, the patients' weight and height increased but nutritional status (body mass index, BMI percentile) did not change significantly. The children's diet before diagnosis was similar to that of the general Polish population: insufficient implementation of the dietary norm for energy, fiber, calcium, iodine, iron as well as folic acid, vitamins D, K, and E was observed. Over the year, the GFD of the children with CD did not change significantly for most of the above nutrients, or the changes were not significant for the overall assessment of the diet. Celiac patients following GFD may have a higher risk of iron, calcium and folate deficiencies. These results confirm the need for personalized nutritional education aimed at excluding gluten from the diet, as well as balancing the diet properly, in patients with CD.
31709662	Exploring undiagnosed celiac disease in women with recurrent reproductive failure: The gluten-free diet could improve reproductive outcomes.	PROBLEM: Which is the prevalence and seroprevalence of celiac disease (CD) in women with recurrent reproductive failure? METHOD OF STUDY: Retrospective study performed in a single infertility clinic from September 2016 to December 2017. A total of 690 women with unexplained history of recurrent miscarriage and/or recurrent implantation failure were consecutively recruited. IgA anti-transglutaminase 2 (TG2) antibody data were collected, as well as IgG anti-TG2 and IgA/IgG anti-deamidated gluten peptide (DGP) data in most cases, and IgG anti-gliadin antibodies occasionally. In selected women, HLA-DQ genotyping was requested. Biopsy was suggested to all women with positive serological results or belonging to CD risk groups. Reproductive outcomes were recorded from women with high suspicion of CD and a control group comprised of 49 women. RESULTS: Anti-TG2-positive women comprised 1% of the sample. An additional 4% was observed considering less-specific antibodies (31 women). Only 39% of sero-positive women accepted duodenal biopsy. HLA and biopsy data discarded CD in 14 sero-positive cases (37%), only one with anti-TG2 antibodies. CD was suggested in 10 sero-positive and three sero-negative women (1.9%). Compared with controls, the live birthrate of the studied women with probable CD was significantly decreased before gluten removal of the diet (P = .015), but significantly increased after that (P = .020). CONCLUSION: One percent CD prevalence should be expected after anti-TG2 serological screening. However, more sensitive approaches should be explored, especially considering the potential beneficial effect of the gluten-free diet on the reproductive outcomes of women with CD.
22181972	Arsenic contents in Spanish infant rice, pureed infant foods, and rice.	UNLABELLED: It seems there is a positive correlation between rice content and arsenic level in foods. This is of extraordinary importance for infants below 1 y of age because their diet is very limited and in some cases is highly dependent on rice-based products; this is particularly true for infants with the celiac disease because they have no other option than consume gluten-free products, such as rice or corn. Arsenic contents were significantly higher (P < 0.001) in gluten-free infant rice (0.057 mg kg-1) than in products with gluten, based on a mixture of cereals (0.024 mg kg-1). Besides, especial precaution must be taken when preparing rice-based products at home, because arsenic content in Spanish rice was high, with levels being above 0.3 mg kg-1 in some cases. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: From the data presented in this manuscript, it seems imperative that legislation on maximum residues of arsenic in food should be available as soon as possible to protect consumers worldwide. Research is needed to identify or breed rice cultivars with low accumulation of arsenic in the grain; otherwise the rice percentage in infant foods should be reduced.
26423749	Celiac disease detection in hypothyroid patients requiring elevated thyroid supplementation: A prospective cohort study.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is associated with hypothyroidism, but the disease prevalence is not thought to be great enough to warrant testing all hypothyroid patients. We hypothesized that hypothyroid patients with concomitant CD would require elevated doses of levothyroxine, and there is a threshold daily dose, above which, hypothyroid patients should be tested for CD. METHODS: Hypothyroid patients presenting to the endoscopy or endocrinology clinics at the University of Vermont Medical Center were included. Patients were categorized by whether or not they required >=125mcg/day of levothyroxine. A serum tissue transglutaminase (tTG) was performed on enrolled patients. Patients with an elevated serum tTG underwent endoscopy with duodenal biopsies. Symptoms were assessed by the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale. RESULTS: Overall, 500 patients were enrolled and 29% (144 patients) required >=125mcg/day of levothyroxine. CD was detected in 9 patients. The prevalence of CD ranged from 1.8% in our entire cohort to 12.5% in patients requiring >=200mcg/day of levothyroxine. Eight patients with CD (89%) required >=125mcg/day of levothyroxine. Patients who required >=125mcg/day of levothyroxine had a significantly increased risk of CD (p<0.001). CD was detected in 5.6% of patients requiring >=125mcg/day of levothyroxine. CONCLUSIONS: Hypothyroid patients requiring elevated daily doses of levothyroxine are more likely to have CD. Hypothyroid patients requiring >=125mcg/day of levothyroxine should undergo serologic testing for CD.
28542044	Anti-transglutaminase 6 Antibody Development in Children With Celiac Disease Correlates With Duration of Gluten Exposure.	OBJECTIVES: Antibodies against transglutaminase 6 (anti-TG6) have been implicated in neurological manifestations in adult patients with genetic gluten intolerance, and it is unclear whether autoimmunity to TG6 develops following prolonged gluten exposure. We measured the anti-TG6 in children with celiac disease (CD) at the diagnosis time to establish a correlation between these autoantibodies and the duration of gluten exposure. We investigated a correlation between anti-TG6 and the presence of neurological disorders. METHODS: Anti-TG6 (IgA/IgG) were measured by ELISA in sera of children with biopsy-proven CD and of children experiencing gastrointestinal disorders. CD patients positive for anti-TG6 were retested after 2 years of gluten-free diet (GFD). RESULTS: We analyzed the sera of 274 CD children and of 121 controls. Anti-TG6 were detected in 68/274 (25%) CD patients and in 19/121 (16%) controls, with significant difference between the 2 groups (P = 0.04). None of the CD patients and of the controls testing positive for anti-TG6 were experiencing neurological disorders. Eleven of 18 (61%) CD patients with other autoimmune diseases were positive for anti-TG6. In CD patients, a significant correlation between the gluten exposure before the CD diagnosis and anti-TG6 concentration was found (P = 0.006 for IgA; P < 0.0001 for IgG). After GFD anti-TG6 concentrations were significantly reduced (P < 0.001). No significant correlation was observed between anti-TG6 and anti-TG2 serum concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-TG6 are more prevalent in children with untreated CD in the absence of overt neurological disorders. The synthesis of the anti-TG6 is related to a longer exposure to gluten before the CD diagnosis, and the autoimmunity against TG6 is gluten dependent and disappeared during GFD.
36535870	Anemia in non-celiac wheat sensitivity: Prevalence and associated clinical and laboratory features.	BACKGROUND: Patients suffering from non-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCWS) frequently report extra-intestinal symptoms, such as anemia. AIMS: We investigated the prevalence and associated clinical features of anemia in NCWS patients. METHODS: Data from 244 NCWS patients, diagnosed by double-blind placebo-controlled wheat challenge, were retrospectively reviewed and compared with 2 control groups (celiac disease (CD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)). Furthermore, 31 NCWS anemic patients were prospectively re-evaluated after at least 12 months on the "strict" wheat-free diet (WFD). RESULTS: Anemia prevalence in NCWS patients was 34.8% (mean hemoglobin 10.4 +- 1.4 g/dl), significantly higher than in IBS (17.4%, P = 0.03), but not in CD ones. The NCWS group, on the whole, had sideropenic-like features with low serum iron and altered iron deposits. Both anemia prevalence and sideropenic-like features were more evident in CD than in NCWS patients, whereas only a few IBS subjects showed such features. Significant differences were found in anemic vs non-anemic NCWS patients as regards to female sex, diagnostic delay, poly/hypermenorrhea, iron deficiency, and higher TSH values. A long-term WFD significantly reduced anemia and improved iron metabolism. CONCLUSION: Microcytic/hypochromic anemia and altered iron metabolism occur frequently in NCWS and can be treated with a long-term strict WFD. NCWS should be included in differential diagnosis of anemic patients with "functional gastrointestinal troubles".
26641741	Variations in U.S. Consumers' Acceptability of Korean Rice Cake, Seolgitteok, with respect to Sensory Attributes and Nonsensory Factors.	Because the Korean rice cake, Seolgitteok, is mainly prepared with rice flour containing no gluten-protein associated with celiac disease, it can be considered for inclusion in a gluten-free diet. However, Western consumers may be unlikely to enjoy the plain flavor and chewy texture of Seolgitteok. This study aimed to determine both sensory and nonsensory factors that might affect U.S. consumers' acceptability of Seolgitteok. A total of 119 U.S. consumers rated 5 Seolgitteok samples, differentiated by descriptive sensory analysis, with respect to hedonic impression and just-about-right aspects of sensory attributes. Nonsensory factors such as demographic profile, innovativeness, social representation, sensation-seeking, and personality traits were also assessed. Addition levels of brown rice flour (0% to 100%) and sugar (5% to 20%) not only enriched flavor, but also lessened chewiness of Seolgitteok, thereby increasing an overall hedonic impression. Moreover, consumer acceptability of Seolgitteok varied with respect to nonsensory factors. Seolgitteok was more appreciated by males, sensation seekers, and individuals constrained by social desirability than by other groups. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that U.S. consumers' acceptability of Seolgitteok varies not only by sensory attributes such as rice flavor, sweetness, and chewiness, but also by nonsensory factors such as gender, sensation-seeking characteristics, and personality traits. 
33781226	Evaluation of malnutrition status and clinical indications in children with celiac disease: a cross-sectional study.	BACKGROUND: Celiac Disease (CD) is an autoimmune systemic disorder triggered by gluten in genetically susceptible individuals, which can lead to chronic malabsorption. Considering the changes in the manifestations of CD, this study aimed to determine anthropometric indices and clinical indications in children with CD. METHODS: This cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate the children with CD who had referred to Imam Reza Celiac Clinic between 2016 and 2019. Totally, 361 children were eligible and their anti-tissue transglutaminase (TGA-IgA) level, weight, height, and Body Mass Index (BMI) were extracted from their records. The anthropometric indices were presented based on the criteria of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO). The prevalent symptoms were assessed, as well. RESULTS: Based on the CDC's criteria, 18.3, 28.8, and 25.8% of the children had short stature, low body weight, and low BMI, respectively. These measures were obtained as 10, 22.4, and 13.9% according to the WHO's categorization respectively. Furthermore, the most common symptoms among the children were abdominal pain (56.5%), skeletal pain (28%), constipation (27.4%), and anemia (23.8%). CONCLUSION: To sum up, the results clearly indicated that growth failure and low height, weight, and BMI were prevalent among the children with CD. Moreover, in addition to gastrointestinal symptoms, a considerable number of patients had skeletal pain and anemia.
38040116	Experiences of Health-Related Stigma and Challenges Faced by Men Living with Celiac Disease: A Qualitative Analysis.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune condition, managed by strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). Dietary choice has gendered connotations, and men with CD may face judgment from others when following a GFD. However, little is known about health-related stigma in men with CD. OBJECTIVES: The study aim was to explore the health-related stigma and challenges faced by men with CD, and the impact of CD on their lives. DESIGN: Qualitative semi-structured online interviews were conducted with men living with CD. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty adults (>=18 years old) identifying as men living in the United Kingdom, with self-reported CD, were recruited using social media and opportunistic sampling. ANALYSES: Participants provided rich, detailed discussions about aspects of their experience of living with CD. Reflexive thematic analysis was used, with a critical-realist lens which enabled researchers to connect men's experiences within wider socio-cultural constructs such as masculinity and social identity. RESULTS: Three themes were identified: (1) CD threatens social inclusion; (2) Others' assumptions about CD and microaggressions have a psychological impact, and (3) Masculine norms, health-related stigma, and power dynamics impact men's health behaviors and everyday experience. Health-related stigma was found to be interconnected with these men's gendered social environment, suggesting that gender may be an important social and structural determinant of dietary, health-related, and health support-seeking behaviors in men diagnosed with CD. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to prior assumptions, health-related stigma affects men with CD of all ages, particularly in social settings. The study unveils the complex interplay of individual beliefs, social norms, and power dynamics, in particular with other men, that affect individual beliefs, and emphasize the performative aspect of food consumption. Internalized stigma and microaggressions impact men's wellbeing. To better support men with CD, health providers, charitable organizations, and the food industry should address the social impact of adherence to a gluten-free diet, in particular perceived threats to social status and inclusion, which may cause concern, influence food choice, and impact dietary adherence.
28350936	Screening for Celiac Disease: US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement.	Importance: Celiac disease is caused by an immune response in persons who are genetically susceptible to dietary gluten, a protein complex found in wheat, rye, and barley. Ingestion of gluten by persons with celiac disease causes immune-mediated inflammatory damage to the small intestine. Objective: To issue a new US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for celiac disease. Evidence Review: The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the accuracy of screening in asymptomatic adults, adolescents, and children; the potential benefits and harms of screening vs not screening and targeted vs universal screening; and the benefits and harms of treatment of screen-detected celiac disease. The USPSTF also reviewed contextual information on the prevalence of celiac disease among patients without obvious symptoms and the natural history of subclinical celiac disease. Findings: The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the accuracy of screening for celiac disease, the potential benefits and harms of screening vs not screening or targeted vs universal screening, and the potential benefits and harms of treatment of screen-detected celiac disease. Conclusions and Recommendation: The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for celiac disease in asymptomatic persons. (I statement).
21301008	Liver transplantation: A new risk factor for intestinal intussusceptions.	BACKGROUND: Intestinal intussusception in adults is associated with chronic inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, abdominal tumors or previous abdominal surgery but most often of unknown origin. AIM: The aim of our study was to evaluate circumstances and identify risk factors for intussusceptions. METHODS: All 65,928 abdominal ultrasound examinations performed at our tertiary medical center between January 2001 and June 2008 were analyzed retrospectively for the diagnosis "intussusception". After identifying individuals with sonographically proven intussusception we analyzed various patients' characteristics including age, gender and underlying disease as well as sonographic findings such as localization of the intussusception, absence or presence of ascites and lymph nodes. RESULTS: We identified 32 cases of intussusceptions [mean age 45 years (range 18 to 88); 18 patients were male]. Twelve patients (38%) had a history of abdominal surgery including 8 patients who had undergone liver transplantation (2 patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis, 1 patient with cystic fibrosis, 1 patient with sarcoidosis, 1 patient with hepatocellular carcinoma and HCV infection, 1 patient with autoimmune hepatitis, 1 patient with Crigler-Najar-syndrome and one patient with echinococcus). A hepaticojejunostomy had been performed in 4 of the patients after liver transplantation. Liver transplanted patients were significantly overrepresented in the intussusceptions group compared with the overall cohort of patients undergoing abdominal ultrasound examination (25% vs. 8%, Chi-Square-test, p = 0.0023). CONCLUSION: In our retrospective study liver transplantation, in particular with hepaticojejunostomy, was identified as a new major risk factor for intestinal intussusceptions
24288026	Problems and challenges to adaptation of gluten free diet by Indian patients with celiac disease.	Celiac disease is emerging in India and has become a public health problem. Almost 6-8 million Indians are estimated to have celiac disease. While there is a large pool of patients with celiac disease in India, until now, only a fraction of them have been diagnosed. With increasing awareness about celiac disease amongst health care providers and the general population, a massive increase in the number of patients with celiac disease is expected now and in the subsequent decade in India. While the number of patients with celiac disease is increasing, the country's preparedness towards the emerging epidemic of this disease is minimal. There are a number of issues, which requires urgent attention. Some of the key issues include increased awareness amongst health care professionals and the general public about the disease and its management, team-based management of patients with celiac disease, proper counseling and supervision of patients, training of dietitians in the management of patients with celiac disease, industrial production of reliable and affordable gluten-free food, and food labeling for gluten contents. 
21920498	Oral ecosystem alterations in celiac children: a follow-up study.	OBJECTIVE: The aims of this work were (1) to assess the oral health status of children with celiac disease (CD) with or without compliance with a gluten-free diet and in non-celiac children in a follow-up study and (2) to identify oral ecosystem changes that could be used as non-invasive monitoring methods for CD patients. STUDY DESIGN: An 18-month follow-up study in children of both genders, who were 4-12 years old during the study period, was performed. Decayed-missing-filled in temporary (dmft) and permanent teeth (DMFT), enamel alterations, oral hygiene, and gingival index were measured. Oral smears were collected by brushing. Flow rate, calcium, phosphate, pH, buffer capacity, fluoride, and Ca/P ratio were measured in saliva. Salivary protein profiles were performed. RESULTS: Most CD patients (80%) presented typical symptoms between 12 and 24 months old. Children with CD had a significantly low frequency of enamel alterations (30%) (p=0.0001). A high percentage of patients (63.15%) reported having had aphthous ulcers at several times. The celiac group showed significantly more polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) in smears (20% PMNs per area, p=0.0459) than the control group (0% PMNs per area) at baseline. In CD children, 90% of the samples that showed PMNs at baseline did not present them after 18 months. However, 10% of the smears of CD patients presented PMNs at the end of this study. Compliance with the gluten-free diet was controlled to detect the maintenance or worsening of signs and symptoms during the medical controls. CONCLUSIONS: The main differences amongst CD children who did or did not comply with a gluten-free diet and control children are the presence of PMNs in oral mucosa and protein salivary patterns; these findings could be considered as markers for CD, in conjunction with other signs and symptoms.
29150741	Prevalence of Micronutrient Deficiency in Patients with Morbid Obesity Before Bariatric Surgery: What About Celiac Disease?	
38396767	Bacteria: Potential Make-or-Break Determinants of Celiac Disease.	Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease triggered by dietary gluten in genetically susceptible individuals that primarily affects the small intestinal mucosa. The sole treatment is a gluten-free diet that places a social and economic burden on patients and fails, in some, to lead to symptomatic or mucosal healing. Thus, an alternative treatment has long been sought after. Clinical studies on celiac disease have shown an association between the presence of certain microbes and disease outcomes. However, the mechanisms that underlie the effects of microbes in celiac disease remain unclear. Recent studies have employed disease models that have provided insights into disease mechanisms possibly mediated by bacteria in celiac disease. Here, we have reviewed the bacteria and related mechanisms identified so far that might protect from or incite the development of celiac disease. Evidence indicates bacteria play a role in celiac disease and it is worth continuing to explore this, particularly since few studies, to the best of our knowledge, have focused on establishing a mechanistic link between bacteria and celiac disease. Uncovering host-microbe interactions and their influence on host responses to gluten may enable the discovery of pathogenic targets and development of new therapeutic or preventive approaches.
33512796	Randomized, Placebo Controlled Trial of Experimental Hookworm Infection for Improving Gluten Tolerance in Celiac Disease.	INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder where intestinal immunopathology arises after gluten consumption. Previous studies suggested that hookworm infection restores gluten tolerance; however, these studies were small (n = 12) and not placebo controlled. METHODS: We undertook a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of hookworm infection in 54 people with celiac disease. The 94-week study involved treatment with either 20 or 40 Necator americanus third-stage larvae (L3-20 or L3-40) or placebo, followed by escalating gluten consumption (50 mg/d for 12 weeks, 1 g intermittent twice weekly for 12 weeks, 2 g/d sustained for 6 weeks, liberal diet for 1 year). RESULTS: Successful study completion rates at week 42 (primary outcome) were similar in each group (placebo: 57%, L3-20: 37%, and L3-40: 44%; P = 0.61), however gluten-related adverse events were significantly reduced in hookworm-treated participants: Median (range) adverse events/participant were as follows: placebo, 4 (1-9); L3-20, 1 (0-9); and L3-40, 0 (0-3) (P = 0.019). Duodenal villous height:crypt depth deteriorated similarly compared with their enrolment values in each group (mean change [95% confidence interval]: placebo, -0.6 [-1.3 to 0.2]; L3-20, -0.5 [-0.8 to 0.2]; and L3-40, -1.1 [-1.8 to 0.4]; P = 0.12). A retrospective analysis revealed that 9 of the 40 L3-treated participants failed to establish hookworm infections. Although week 42 completion rates were similar in hookworm-positive vs hookworm-negative participants (48% vs 44%, P = 0.43), quality of life symptom scores were lower in hookworm-positive participants after intermittent gluten challenge (mean [95% confidence interval]: 38.9 [33.9-44] vs 45.9 [39.2-52.6]). DISCUSSION: Hookworm infection does not restore tolerance to sustained moderate consumption of gluten (2 g/d) but was associated with improved symptom scores after intermittent consumption of lower, intermittent gluten doses.
37341328	Neurologic Manifestations of Gastrointestinal and Nutritional Disorders.	OBJECTIVE: A tie between nutritional or gastrointestinal and neurologic disease has been recognized for centuries. Many gastrointestinal disorders are associated with neurologic disease through nutritional, immune-mediated, or degenerative pathophysiologies. This article reviews neurologic disorders in patients with gastrointestinal disease and gastrointestinal manifestations in their own neurologic patients. LATEST DEVELOPMENTS: Development of new gastric and bariatric surgical procedures and the widespread use of over-the-counter gastric acid-reducing medications continue to create vitamin and nutritional deficiencies despite modern diet and supplementation. Some supplements, such as vitamin A, vitamin B6, and selenium, themselves are now found to cause disease. Recent work has shown extraintestinal and neurologic manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease. Chronic brain damage in liver disease has been recognized, and the opportunity to intervene may exist in the covert beginning stages. The characterization of gluten-related neurologic symptoms and differentiation from those of celiac disease is an evolving body of work. ESSENTIAL POINTS: Gastrointestinal and neurologic diseases related to common immune-mediated, degenerative, or infectious mechanisms are common and can coexist in the same patient. Furthermore, gastrointestinal disease may cause neurologic complications because of nutritional inadequacies, malabsorption, and hepatic dysfunction. In many cases, the complications are treatable but have subtle or protean presentations. Therefore, the consulting neurologist must be current in knowledge of the growing ties between gastrointestinal and neurologic disease.
27763541	Properties of Gluten Intolerance: Gluten Structure, Evolution, Pathogenicity and Detoxification Capabilities.	Theterm gluten intolerance may refer to three types of human disorders: autoimmune celiac disease (CD), allergy to wheat and non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). Gluten is a mixture of prolamin proteins present mostly in wheat, but also in barley, rye and oat. Gluten can be subdivided into three major groups: S-rich, S-poor and high molecular weight proteins. Prolamins within the groups possess similar structures and properties. All gluten proteins are evolutionarily connected and share the same ancestral origin. Gluten proteins are highly resistant to hydrolysis mediated by proteases of the human gastrointestinal tract. It results in emergence of pathogenic peptides, which cause CD and allergy in genetically predisposed people. There is a hierarchy of peptide toxicity and peptide recognition by T cells. Nowadays, there are several ways to detoxify gluten peptides: the most common is gluten-free diet (GFD), which has proved its effectiveness; prevention programs, enzymatic therapy, correction of gluten pathogenicity pathways and genetically modified grains with reduced immunotoxicity. A deep understanding of gluten intolerance underlying mechanisms and detailed knowledge of gluten properties may lead to the emergence of novel effective approaches for treatment of gluten-related disorders.
37246625	Celiac Disease and Disorders of Gut-Brain Interaction: What School Nurses Need to Know.	Abdominal pain and discomfort are common reasons students visit the school health office. Abdominal pain, in children, may be related to gastrointestinal conditions such as celiac disease (CD) or disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBIs). Both CD and DGBIs, formerly known as functional abdominal pain disorders, are both prevalent in the pediatric population. Manifestations, presentation, and management of these disorders overlap and will be reviewed in this article. Due to their chronic nature, school nurses should be aware of both the management and complications associated with CD and DGBIs. Dietary recommendations, including the gluten-free and low-fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPS) diet, will be presented as part of the management of the disorders.
34057009	High disease burden in treated celiac patients - a web-based survey.	BACKGROUND: Strict adherence to a gluten-free diet usually leads to clinical and histological remission in celiac disease. Few studies have investigated the prevalence of persistent symptoms in a celiac population. We aimed to study the impact of gastrointestinal symptoms on general health in a large number of treated celiac patients, and describe the prevalence of persistent gastrointestinal symptoms and investigate associated factors. METHODS: Adults with celiac disease filled out background questions, the Celiac Symptom Index (CSI) and the celiac disease adherence test (CDAT) in a web-based national survey. Participants who reported gastrointestinal symptoms during the previous week also recorded the gastrointestinal symptom rating scale-irritable bowel syndrome version (GSRS-IBS). Statistical analysis included chi-squared test, t-test, correlation, and linear regression. RESULTS: Of 3834 participants (82% women; mean age 47 years), 54% reported gastrointestinal symptoms the previous week, and 30% of these had CSI score >=45, indicative of the relatively poor quality of life (vs. 5% among those without gastrointestinal symptoms). The prevalence of persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (GSRS-IBS >=30) was 40% and the most prominent symptoms were bloating (44%) and pain (37%). Age, sex, symptoms at the time of diagnosis, comorbidity, dietary adherence and CeD-specific health were significantly associated with gastrointestinal symptoms (p < .001). CONCLUSION: In this national cross-sectional study among participants with celiac disease, persistent gastrointestinal symptoms were frequent, and were associated with a high symptom burden and reduced CeD-specific health. Several factors were associated with gastrointestinal symptoms, but more research is needed to find the cause of persistent symptoms in patients with celiac disease.
28858941	Regional and National Variations in Reasons for Gluten Avoidance.	BACKGROUND: Although studies have assessed the prevalence of celiac disease (CD), less is known about the prevalence of gluten avoidance because of nonceliac gluten sensitivity (GS). The avoidance of foods other than gluten is also understudied in these 2 groups. METHODS: Participants visiting a web site for information about a newly developed portable gluten detection device (Nima) were instructed to complete questions about food and gluten avoidance patterns. We assessed the relative proportion of CD and GS across world regions and United States (US) regions and determined the distribution of food avoidance patterns. RESULTS: CD was reported in 6474 respondents and GS in 2597 respondents. Within the United States, the majority of avoiders of gluten reported having CD (69.8%), with the highest ratio of CD to GS in the Northeast (CD: 74.3%; GS: 25.7%) and the lowest in the West (CD: 67.1%; GS: 32.9%) (P<0.0001). Compared with the United States, all other countries had lower proportions of GS, with the lowest in Argentina (CD: 94.7%; GS: 5.3%; P<0.0001). Food avoidances other than gluten were reported by 25% of respondents, with avoidance in all categories more common in GS than CD (P<0.0001). CONCLUSION: There is a significant difference in the relative rates of CD and GS within the United States and worldwide. Food avoidance other than gluten seems to be a more common component of GS than CD. Future research should focus on the causes of these international and US regional differences and the significance of other food avoidances.
25547088	Celiac disease: a disorder emerging from antiquity, its evolving classification and risk, and potential new treatment paradigms.	Celiac disease is a chronic genetically based gluten-sensitive immune-mediated enteropathic process primarily affecting the small intestinal mucosa. The disorder classically presents with diarrhea and weight loss; however, more recently, it has been characterized by subclinical occult or latent disease associated with few or no intestinal symptoms. Diagnosis depends on the detection of typical histopathological biopsy changes followed by a gluten-free diet response. A broad range of clinical disorders may mimic celiac disease, along with a wide range of drugs and other therapeutic agents. Recent and intriguing archeological data, largely from the Gobleki Tepe region of the Fertile Crescent, indicate that celiac disease probably emerged as humans transitioned from hunter-gatherer groups to societies dependent on agriculture to secure a stable food supply. Longitudinal studies per-formed over several decades have suggested that changes in the prevalence of the disease, even apparent epidemic disease, may be due to superimposed or novel environmental factors that may precipitate its appearance. Recent therapeutic approaches are being explored that may supplement, rather than replace, gluten-free diet therapy and permit more nutritional options for future management.
37242236	New Insights and Evidence on "Food Intolerances": Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity and Nickel Allergic Contact Mucositis.	The clinical examination of patients often includes the observation of the existence of a close relationship between the ingestion of certain foods and the appearance of various symptoms. Until now, the occurrence of these events has been loosely defined as food intolerance. Instead, these conditions should be more properly defined as adverse food reactions (AFRs), which can consist of the presentation of a wide variety of symptoms which are commonly identified as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In addition, systemic manifestations such as neurological, dermatological, joint, and respiratory disorders may also occur in affected patients. Although the etiology and pathogenesis of some of them are already known, others, such as non-celiac gluten sensitivity and adverse reactions to nickel-containing foods, are not yet fully defined. The study aimed to evaluate the relationship between the ingestion of some foods and the appearance of some symptoms and clinical improvements and detectable immunohistochemical alterations after a specific exclusion diet. One hundred and six consecutive patients suffering from meteorism, dyspepsia, and nausea following the ingestion of foods containing gluten or nickel were subjected to the GSRS questionnaire which was modified according to the "Salerno experts' criteria". All patients underwent detection of IgA antibodies to tissue transglutaminase, oral mucosal patch tests with gluten and nickel (OMPT), and EGDS, including biopsies. Our data show that GSRS and OMPT, the use of APERIO CS2 software, and the endothelial marker CD34 could be suggested as useful tools in the diagnostic procedure of these new pathologies. Larger, multi-center clinical trials could be helpful in defining these emerging clinical problems.
22570962	Lack of association between seroconversion and catch-up growth in children with celiac disease.	OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between seroconversion and catch-up growth during the first year of a gluten-free diet (GFD) program in children with celiac disease (CD). METHODS: All prepubertal and biopsy-proven children diagnosed with CD between January 1999 and August 2009 were included in a retrospective study (n=55). Growth parameters and celiac antibodies were documented before and after 6 (period 1) and 12 months (period 2) of GFD, respectively. RESULTS: Mean height velocity-standard deviation score (SDS) was significantly higher in period 1 compared with that in period 2 (2.90 +/- 3.20 vs. 0.20 +/- 2.08, p<0.001) irrespective of the serology status, with marginal difference in mean weight-SDS gain (p=0.074). Mean levels of height velocity-SDS and the weight-SDS gain were similar in the seropositive and seronegative groups in both periods of the study. Mean height-SDS and weight-SDS levels after 6 months were higher than those in baseline levels, both in seropositive (-0.47 +/- 0.91 vs. -0.82 +/- 0.82, p<0.001 and -0.59 +/- 1.17 vs. -1.11 +/- 1.33, p<0.001, respectively) and seronegative patients (-1.02 +/- 1.14 vs. -1.50 +/- 1.12, p<0.001 and -1.19 +/- 1.27 vs. -1.45 +/- 1.40, p=0.048, respectively). These growth parameters were higher at the end compared with the beginning of period 2, but only in seropositive patients. CONCLUSIONS: The most remarkable catch-up growth in children with CD can be expected during the first 6 months of GFD, irrespective of the serology status.
22728383	Celiac disease: advances in treatment via gluten modification.	Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune enteropathy that occurs in genetically susceptible individuals carrying the prerequisite genetic markers HLA DQ2 or DQ8. These genetic markers are present in approximately 30% of the population, and the worldwide prevalence of CD is estimated to be approximately 1%-2%. Currently a gluten-free diet is the only treatment for CD, but novel therapies aimed at gluten modification are underway. This review will discuss gluten-based therapies including wheat alternatives and wheat selection, enzymatic alteration of wheat, oral enzyme supplements, and polymeric binders as exciting new therapies for treatment of CD.
29620596	Celiac Disease 30 Years After Diagnosis: Struggling With Gluten-free Adherence or Gaining Gluten Tolerance?	OBJECTIVES: Studies investigating patients with coeliac disease (CD) on very long-term follow-up are limited. We aimed to evaluate the characteristics of patients with CD diagnosed more than 30 years ago. METHODS: Clinical, histologic, genetic, and demographic data of patients with CD diagnosis made before 1985 were collected and their standardised mortality ratio calculated. According to the gluten-free diet (GFD) status, CD patients were divided into 3 groups and a specific questionnaire on GFD awareness and gluten-free products was administered to patients and caregivers. RESULTS: A total of 337 CD patients were included in the study. The standardised mortality ratio was 0.37 (confidence interval 0.10 to 0.94) compared with a matched population. A total of 197 patients were grouped according to GFD compliance, with 35 CD patients reporting chronic voluntary gluten ingestion. No significant differences were found between groups regarding family history of CD, symptoms and histology at diagnosis, autoimmune disorders. Follow-up histology was performed in 63 patients. Twenty patients had normal histology on gluten-containing diet (GCD). Questionnaire scores were lower in patients on GCD. Caregivers scores were not correlated with patients' gluten consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Although poor adherence to GFD is the major predictor of persistence of mucosal lesions at follow-up histology, a proportion of patients did not show a relapse of villous atrophy in spite chronic voluntary gluten ingestion, nor increase in mortality. Moreover, GFD knowledge and adherence could be partly lost during the transition between childhood and adulthood.
29688915	Clinical and Microbiological Effect of a Multispecies Probiotic Supplementation in Celiac Patients With Persistent IBS-type Symptoms: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-controlled, Multicenter Trial.	GOALS: The goals of this study were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a probiotic mixture in patients with celiac disease (CD) with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-type symptoms despite a strict gluten-free diet (GFD). BACKGROUND: About 30% of patients with CD adherent to a GFD suffer from IBS-type symptoms; a possible cause resides in the imbalances of the intestinal microbiota in CD. Probiotics may represent a potential treatment. STUDY: CD patients with IBS-type symptoms entered a prospective, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled study. A 6-week treatment period was preceded by a 2-week run-in and followed by a 6-week follow-up phase. Clinical data were monitored throughout the study by validated questionnaires: IBS Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS); Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS); Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS); and IBS Quality of Life Questionnaire (IBS-QOL). The fecal microbiota were assayed using plate counts and 16S rRNA gene-based analysis. RESULTS: In total, 109 patients were randomized to probiotics (n=54) or placebo (n=55). IBS-SSS and GSRS decreased significantly in probiotics, as compared with placebo [(-15.9%+-14.8% vs. 8.2%+-25.9%; P<0.001) and (-19.8%+-16.6% vs. 12.9%+-31.6%; P<0.001)], respectively. Treatment success was significantly higher in patients receiving probiotics, as compared with placebo (15.3% vs. 3.8%; P<0.04). Presumptive lactic acid bacteria, Staphylococcus and Bifidobacterium, increased in patients receiving probiotic treatment. No adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: A 6-week probiotic treatment is effective in improving the severity of IBS-type symptoms, in CD patients on strict GFD, and is associated with a modification of gut microbiota, characterized by an increase of bifidobacteria.
32558690	The Role of Bile Acids in Chronic Diarrhea.	Bile acids (BAs) are the central signals in enterohepatic communication, and they also integrate microbiota-derived signals into enterohepatic signaling. The tissue distribution and signaling pathways activated by BAs through natural receptors, farsenoid X receptor and G protein-coupled BA receptor 1 (GPBAR1, also known as Takeda G-coupled receptor 5), have led to a greater understanding of the mechanisms and potential therapeutic agents. BA diarrhea is most commonly encountered in ileal resection or disease, in idiopathic disorders (with presentation similar to functional diarrhea or irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea), and in association with malabsorption such as chronic pancreatitis or celiac disease. Diagnosis of BA diarrhea is based on Se-homocholic acid taurine retention, 48-hour fecal BA excretion, or serum 7alphaC4; the latter being a marker of hepatic BA synthesis. BA diarrhea tends to be associated with higher body mass index, increased stool weight and stool fat, and acceleration of colonic transit. Biochemical markers of increased BA synthesis or excretion are available through reference laboratories. Current treatment of BA diarrhea is based on BA sequestrants, and, in the future, it is anticipated that farsenoid X receptor agonists may also be effective. The optimal conditions for an empiric trial with BA sequestrants as a diagnostic test are still unclear. However, such therapeutic trials are widely used in clinical practice. Some national guidelines recommend definitive diagnosis of BA diarrhea over empirical trial.
21787223	Celiac disease: progress towards diagnosis and definition of pathogenic mechanisms.	The current issue of the International Reviews of Immunology is dedicated entirely to Celiac Disease (CD). Recent development of additional biomarkers and diagnostics resulted in a sharp revision of the prevalence of this condition, with a previously unrecognized subclinical occurrence in the adult population. This was paralleled by groundbreaking progress in understanding its molecular pathogenesis: while gluten-derived peptides activate the innate immunity, post-translationally modified gluten elicits an adaptive immunity. These arms amplify each other, resulting in a self- perpetuating autoimmune condition, influenced by disturbances of the gut flora and mucus chemistry. The process evolves dramatically in a subset of patients with vulnerable immune homeostasis (eg. Treg cells) explaining the progressive, aggravating syndrome in the clinically overt version of CD. In depth understanding of the pathogenesis of CD thus creates the premises of developing novel, more accurate animal models that should support a rationale development of new prophylactic and therapeutic interventions.
23010829	Cutaneous hypersensitivity to gluten.	We enrolled 14 female patients (aged 12-60 years) affected by celiac disease (confirmed by duodenal biopsy), presenting dermatologic eczematous lesions involving their face, neck, and overall arms, after application of gluten-containing emollient cream, bath, or face powder, or after contact with foods containing wheat and durum wheat. Five patients resulted positive to patch-by-patch with wheat and durum wheat (mild to moderate positivity) with erythema and vesicles, in correspondence of their sites of application. Utilizing gluten-free cream and bath, and wearing gloves before hand contact with food-containing wheat, in their common life, these patients showed an improvement of their cutaneous lesions and no relapses of dermatitis for a 6-month follow-up period.
35092656	Systematic approach to celiac disease: a comprehensive review for primary providers.	Celiac disease is an immune-mediated illness to gluten exposure in genetically susceptible patients. It is characterized by chronic lymphocytic inflammation of the small bowel leading to villous atrophy and its associated complications. The global prevalence of celiac disease is increasing, due in part to improved screening tests and simplified diagnostic criteria. Novel therapies are being developed and include proteolytic enzymes, sequestering agents, and immunotherapies. A strict gluten-free diet, however, remains the mainstay of treatment. In this comprehensive review, we discuss the epidemiology, definitions, diagnosis, and treatment of celiac disease.
28025773	Bone Mineral Density in Celiac Disease.	OBJECTIVES: To study bone mineral density (BMD) and standard serum biochemical indices among newly diagnosed and already diagnosed cases of Celiac Disease (CD) on gluten free diet for at least one year. METHODS: This hospital based analytic, observational study was done at a tertiary care centre, from April 2013 through June 2014. Thirty six children (20 females) with untreated CD at diagnosis (Group A) and 36 age and sex matched children on gluten-free diet for at least one year (Group B) were studied. Serum measurements of biochemical bone health indices and BMD, assessed by dual X-ray absorptiometry, were obtained. RESULTS: BMD Z-score was significantly low in newly diagnosed celiac patients. Patients on gluten free diet had higher BMD Z-score as compared to newly diagnosed patients (-2.02 vs. -0.65 respectively, p < 0.001). BMD Z-score was high in GI symptom patients as compared to non-GI symptom patients (-0.46+/-0.89 vs. - 0.88 = +/-0.94) in Group B. In female patients BMD Z-score was comparatively low as compared to male patients in both groups but difference was not significant. In Group A the mean serum calcium level was lower than the patients in Group B (8.72 + 0.73 vs. 9.34 + 0.65, p < 0.001). S. calcium levels were not correlated with bone mineral density (BMD) in both groups (P value >0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Children with CD are at risk for reduced BMD. Strict gluten-free diet significantly improves bone mineralization. Early diagnosis and treatment of celiac disease during childhood may protect CD patients from osteoporosis.
38860826	Novel probiotic preparation with in vivo gluten-degrading activity and potential modulatory effects on the gut microbiota.	Gluten possesses unique properties that render it only partially digestible. Consequently, it exerts detrimental effects on a part of the worldwide population who are afflicted with celiac disease (1%) or related disorders (5%), particularly due to the potential for cross-contamination even when adhering to a gluten-free diet (GFD). Finding solutions to break down gluten during digestion has a high nutritional and social impact. Here, a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled in vivo challenge investigated the gluten-degrading activity of a novel probiotic preparation comprising lactobacilli and their cytoplasmic extracts, Bacillus sp., and bacterial protease. In our clinical trial, we collected feces from 70 healthy volunteers at specific time intervals. Probiotic/placebo administration lasted 32 days, followed by 10 days of wash-out. After preliminary GFD to eliminate residual gluten from feces, increasing amounts of gluten (50 mg-10 g) were administered, each one for 4 consecutive days. Compared to placebo, the feces of volunteers fed with probiotics showed much lower amounts of residual gluten, mainly with increased intakes. Probiotics also regulate the intestinal microbial communities, improving the abundance of genera pivotal to maintaining homeostasis. Quantitative PCR confirmed that all probiotics persisted during the intervention, some also during wash-out. Probiotics promoted a fecal metabolome with potential immunomodulating activity, mainly related to derivatives of branched-chain amino acids and short-chain fatty acids. IMPORTANCE: The untapped potential of gluten-degrading bacteria and their application in addressing the recognized limitations of gluten-related disorder management and the ongoing risk of cross-contamination even when people follow a gluten-free diet (GFD) emphasizes the significance of the work. Because gluten, a common protein found in many cereals, must be strictly avoided to stop autoimmune reactions and related health problems, celiac disease and gluten sensitivity present difficult hurdles. However, because of the hidden presence of gluten in many food products and the constant danger of cross-contamination during food preparation and processing, total avoidance is frequently challenging. Our study presents a novel probiotic preparation suitable for people suffering from gluten-related disorders during GFD and for healthy individuals because it enhances gluten digestion and promotes gut microbiota functionality.
23093980	Novel therapeutic/integrative approaches for celiac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis.	Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by the ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. Gluten is a protein component in wheat and other cereals like rye and barley. At present, the only available treatment is a strict gluten-free diet. Recent advances have increased our understanding of the molecular basis for this disorder. Last decade has seen new scientific developments in this disease and led to the formulation of new concepts of pathophysiology that offer possible targets for new treatments or interventions integrative to the gluten-free diet.
25539753	[What's new in internal medicine?].	This article focuses on current trends in various autoimmune diseases of interest for the dermatologist. In the antiphospholipid syndrome, many news: better characterization of the severe disease, involvement of the mTOR pathway in the vasculopathy-induced renal disease, and diversification of the therapeutic approaches: use of mTOR inhibitors and several biologics, new various antiplatelet and anticoagulants. In dermatomyositis, new autoantibodies are better characterized with a good correlation with clinical disease; the results of a large study on genetic predisposition to the disease are available. There are also some therapeutic innovations in systemic sclerosis: benefit of rituximab that seems well tolerated, the results of a large controlled European study about aggressive immunoablative chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cells have just been published, intralesional stem cells injections in the fingers of sclerodactylic patients. Finally, news in celiac disease that is constantly increasing and whose mild forms often have cutaneous manifestations, leading to diagnosis. 
37204091	Liver disorders and celiac disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic autoimmune enteropathy triggered by gluten intake. Celiac hepatitis is the most common hepatic manifestation of CD, it usually responds to a gluten-free diet (GFD) and is sometimes the only manifestation in paucisymptomatic CD. Through this descriptive observational study, we determined the prevalence of liver abnormalities upon diagnosis of CD. A total of 140 patients were included. The prevalence of alterations in liver markers at diagnosis of CD was 47%. In 2.9% of patients, liver abnormalities were the only manifestation at diagnosis. A higher prevalence of liver alterations was found in those patients who presented a more severe histological alteration (MARSH 3c).
24524430	Follow-up of pediatric celiac disease: value of antibodies in predicting mucosal healing, a prospective cohort study.	BACKGROUND: In diagnosing celiac disease (CD), serological tests are highly valuable. However, their role in following up children with CD after prescription of a gluten-free diet is unclear. This study aimed to compare the performance of antibody tests in predicting small-intestinal mucosal status in diagnosis vs. follow-up of pediatric CD. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study at a tertiary-care center. 148 children underwent esophohagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsies either for symptoms +- positive CD antibodies (group A; n = 95) or following up CD diagnosed >= 1 year before study enrollment (group B; n = 53). Using biopsy (Marsh >= 2) as the criterion standard, areas under ROC curves (AUCs) and likelihood-ratios were calculated to estimate the performance of antibody tests against tissue transglutaminase (TG2), deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP) and endomysium (EMA). RESULTS: AUCs were higher when tests were used for CD diagnosis vs. follow-up: 1 vs. 0.86 (P = 0.100) for TG2-IgA, 0.85 vs. 0.74 (P = 0.421) for TG2-IgG, 0.97 vs. 0.61 (P = 0.004) for DPG-IgA, and 0.99 vs. 0.88 (P = 0.053) for DPG-IgG, respectively. Empirical power was 85% for the DPG-IgA comparison, and on average 33% (range 13-43) for the non-significant comparisons. Among group B children, 88.7% showed mucosal healing (median 2.2 years after primary diagnosis). Only the negative likelihood-ratio of EMA was low enough (0.097) to effectively rule out persistent mucosal injury. However, out of 12 EMA-positive children with mucosal healing, 9 subsequently turned EMA-negative. CONCLUSIONS: Among the CD antibodies examined, negative EMA most reliably predict mucosal healing. In general, however, antibody tests, especially DPG-IgA, are of limited value in predicting the mucosal status in the early years post-diagnosis but may be sufficient after a longer period of time.
28223206	Accumulation of Heavy Metals in People on a Gluten-Free Diet.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Specific foods such as fish and rice have high concentrations of metals such as arsenic, mercury, lead, cadmium, and cobalt. Many gluten-free diets (GFDs) include these foods, so we evaluated whether a GFD was associated with increased metal bioaccumulation. METHODS: We performed a population-based, cross-sectional study using data collected from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), from 2009 through 2012, collecting information on the diagnosis of celiac disease and adherence to a GFD. We tested NHANES blood samples to identify individuals with undiagnosed celiac disease, using assays for immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase followed by a confirmatory test for endomysial antibody. Among a total of 11,354 NHANES participants, celiac disease was diagnosed in 55 participants, based on test results or a reported clinical diagnosis. We collected NHANES survey data on blood levels of lead, mercury, and cadmium from subjects who were on a GFD (n = 115) and participants who were not on a GFD (n = 11,239). Levels of total arsenic in urine samples were available from 3901 subjects not following a GFD and 32 individuals following a GFD. NHANES participants were asked questions about fish and shellfish consumption. We performed multivariate logistic regression analyses to associate gluten-related conditions with blood concentrations of mercury, cadmium, and lead and urine concentration of total arsenic, adjusting for demographic characteristics, as well as for rice consumption or seafood intake. Geometric means were reported for urinary concentrations of total arsenic and blood concentrations of mercury, cadmium, and lead for demographic groups and subjects with gluten-related conditions (subjects without celiac disease who avoid gluten). RESULTS: Persons following a GFD had significantly increased total blood mercury levels (1.37 mcg/L) compared with persons not on a GFD (0.93 mcg/L) (P = .008), as well as increased blood levels of lead (1.42 vs 1.13 mcg/L; P = .007) and cadmium (0.42 vs 0.34 mcg/L; P = .03). Urine samples from subjects on a GFD had higher concentrations of total arsenic (15.15 mcg/L) than urine samples from subjects not on a GFD (8.38 mcg/L) (P = .002). After controlling for demographic characteristics, levels of all heavy metals remained significantly higher in persons following a GFD, compared with those not following a GFD. After exclusion of persons with celiac disease, people without celiac disease on a GFD (n = 101) had significantly increased blood concentrations of total mercury (1.40 mcg/L) than persons without celiac disease and not on a GFD (n = 10,890) (0.93 mcg/L; P = .02) and higher blood concentrations of lead (1.44 vs 1.13 mcg/L; P = .01) and higher urine concentrations of total arsenic (14.69 mcg/L [n = 3632] vs 8.32 mcg/L [n = 28]; P = .01). Blood samples from persons without celiac disease avoiding gluten had higher levels of cadmium (0.42 mcg/L) than persons without celiac disease and not following a GFD (0.34 mcg/L), but this difference was not significant (P = .06). CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of data collected from NHANES, persons on a GFD had significantly higher urine levels of total arsenic and blood levels of mercury, lead, and cadmium than persons not avoiding gluten. Studies are needed to determine the long-term effects of accumulation of these elements in persons on a GFD.
36382765	Celiac disease and bone.	Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by small intestinal inflammation triggered by gluten ingestion in genetically-predisposed individuals. A frequent extra-intestinal manifestation of CD is metabolic bone disease which contributes to an increased risk of fracture. The mechanisms underlying bone disease in CD remain incompletely understood, but multiple processes have been proposed including (1) malabsorption of calcium and vitamin D leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism and increased skeletal resorption, (2) pro-inflammatory cytokines altering the osteoprotegerin and receptor activator of nuclear kappa-B ligand ratio favoring osteoclastogenesis, (3) hypogonadism, and (4) low weight and malnutrition. Most studies show reduced bone mineral density in patients with CD. Bone microarchitecture is also deteriorated leading to reduced whole bone stiffness. Many, but not all investigations, have shown an increased risk of fracture associated with CD. The main stay of therapy for CD is maintaining a gluten-free diet. Improvement in bone mineral density with adherence to a gluten-free diet has been well-established. Bone mineral density remains lower, however, compared to controls and increased fracture risk can persist. There is no consensus on the timing of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry for bone mineral density assessment in patients with CD. Routine screening for CD in patients with osteoporosis is not recommended. Little data are available on the use or efficacy of prescription osteoporosis therapeutics in patients with CD. Studies are needed to develop standardized guidelines for screening and treatment of metabolic bone disease in patients with CD to identify those who may need early intervention with prescription osteoporosis therapy.
28841165	A Research Communication Brief: Gluten Analysis in Beef Samples Collected Using a Rigorous, Nationally Representative Sampling Protocol Confirms That Grain-Finished Beef Is Naturally Gluten-Free.	Knowing whether or not a food contains gluten is vital for the growing number of individuals with celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Questions have recently been raised about whether beef from conventionally-raised, grain-finished cattle may contain gluten. To date, basic principles of ruminant digestion have been cited in support of the prevailing expert opinion that beef is inherently gluten-free. For this study, gluten analysis was conducted in beef samples collected using a rigorous nationally representative sampling protocol to determine whether gluten was present. The findings of our research uphold the understanding of the principles of gluten digestion in beef cattle and corroborate recommendations that recognize beef as a naturally gluten-free food.
24980880	Patient perception of treatment burden is high in celiac disease compared with other common conditions.	OBJECTIVES: The only treatment for celiac disease (CD) is life-long adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). Noncompliance is associated with signs and symptoms of CD, yet long-term adherence rates are poor. It is not known how the burden of the GFD compares with other medical treatments, and there are limited data on the socioeconomic factors influencing treatment adherence. In this study, we compared treatment burden and health state in CD compared with other chronic illnesses and evaluated the relationship between treatment burden and adherence. METHODS: Survey was mailed to participants with CD, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), congestive heart failure, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. Surveys included demographic information and visual analog scales measuring treatment burden, importance of treatment, disease-specific health status, and overall health status. RESULTS: We collected surveys from 341 celiac and 368 non-celiac participants. Celiac participants reported high treatment burden, greater than participants with GERD or HTN and comparable to ESRD. Conversely, patients with CD reported the highest health state of all groups. Factors associated with high treatment burden in CD included poor adherence, concern regarding food cost, eating outside the home, higher income, lack of college education, and time limitations in preparing food. Poor adherence in CD was associated with increased symptoms, income, and low perceived importance of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Participants with CD have high treatment burden but also excellent overall health status in comparison with other chronic medical conditions. The significant burden of dietary therapy for CD argues for the need for safe adjuvant treatment, as well as interventions designed to lower the perceived burden of the GFD.
26454460	Multiplex liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for the detection of wheat, oat, barley and rye prolamins towards the assessment of gluten-free product safety.	Celiac patients should feel confident in the safety of foods labelled or expected to be gluten-free. In this context, a targeted proteomic approach based on liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) technique was proposed to assess the presence of celiotoxic cereals, namely wheat, oats, barley and rye, in raw and processed food products. To this aim, unique marker peptides were properly selected in order to distinguish between the different cereal types. A revised cocktail solution based on reducing and denaturing agents was exploited for prolamin extraction from raw and processed food; in addition, defatting with hexane was carried out for sample clean-up, allowing to largely reduce problems related to matrix effect. Method validation on fortified rice flour showed good analytical performance in terms of sensitivity (limits of detection in the 2-18 mg kg(-1) range). However, poor trueness was calculated for self-made incurred bread (between 3 and 30% depending on the peptide), probably due to baking processes, which reduce gluten extractability. Thus, it is evident that in the case of processed foods further insights into sample treatment efficiency and reference materials for protein calibration are required to obtain accurate gluten determination. Finally, the developed method was applied for the analysis of market food products, offering the possibility to discriminate among cereals, with good agreement with labelled ingredients for gluten-containing foodstuffs.
26201175	Gluten-Related Disorders: Celiac Disease, Gluten Allergy, Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity.	Gluten is a protein complex found in the endosperm portion of wheat, rye, and barley. "Gluten-related disorder" is a term used to describe conditions related to ingestion of gluten-containing foods. Gluten has been implicated as the cause of a variety of gastrointestinal (GI) and extraintestinal symptoms. These symptoms are often non-specific and variable, making it difficult for the primary care provider to diagnose the cause and develop a management plan. Recently, gluten-related disorders have received much attention in the popular press, and the sale of gluten-free foods has become a multi-billion dollar business. It is important for pediatric primary care providers to understand the potential role of gluten in GI health and symptomatology so appropriate screening, diagnostic testing, and management can be provided.
24290593	Pathologic bone alterations in celiac disease: etiology, epidemiology, and treatment.	Low bone mineral density (BMD), osteopenia, and osteoporosis are frequent complications of celiac disease (CD). The etiology of pathologic bone alterations in CD is multifactorial; however, two main mechanisms are involved: intestinal malabsorption and chronic inflammation. A strict gluten-free diet (GFD) is thought to be the only effective treatment for CD; but treating bone complications related to CD remains complex. The objective of this review is to elucidate the bones problems related to CD and to increase awareness of osteoporosis development, considered as a sign of atypical CD presentation. Currently, a question of whether GFD alone is an effective treatment to correct the bone alterations in patients with CD is under debate. This review presents factors contributing to pathologic bone derangement, recent research on the epidemiology of low BMD, osteoporosis, and fractures, and the treatment of bone problems in patients with CD. The roles of calcium and transport mechanisms are additionally presented. 
22671523	Effect of HPMC on the quality of wheat-free bread made from carob germ flour-starch mixtures.	UNLABELLED: Carob germ proteins have been shown to have functional properties similar to wheat gluten enabling formulation and production of yeast leavened gluten-free baked goods from a true dough rather than a stiff batter. The purpose of this research was to optimize the production of wheat-free bread containing carob germ flour, corn starch, NaCl, sucrose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), and H2O. A key criterion was to formulate viscoelastic dough similar to wheat dough. To that end, response surface methodology (RSM) was used to determine optimal levels of carob germ flour, H2O, and HPMC. Components varied as follows: 4.94%-15.05% for carob germ flour, 0.05%-3.75% HPMC, and 65.25%-83.75% H2O (percents are on a flour basis, where carob germ flour in combination with maize starch equals 100%). Sucrose, NaCl, and yeast were held constant at 2%. Bread parameters evaluated were specific volume and crumb hardness, where the largest specific volume and the lowest value for crumb hardness were considered most desirable. The optimum formula as determined by RSM consisted of 7% carob germ flour, 93% maize starch, 2% HPMC, and 80% H2O with predicted crumb hardness of ~200 g of force and a specific volume of ~3.5 cm3/g. When proof time was optimized, a specific volume of ~5.6 ml/g and crumb hardness value of ~156 g of force was observed. Carob germ flour may be used as an alternative to wheat flour in formulating viscoelastic dough and high quality gluten-free bread. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Celiac disease affects approximately 1% of the world's population. Sufferers of the disease must consume a gluten-free diet. Currently, gluten-free baked products are made from batters and lack the ability to be made from dough based systems which limits the overall processability and product variety. This research is aimed at the utilization of carob germ protein and its ability to form dough to produce an optimal gluten-free bread formulation. This will help to alleviate problems in processability and product variety associated with gluten-free baked goods.
25769411	The Science, Evidence, and Practice of Dietary Interventions in Irritable Bowel Syndrome.	Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a highly prevalent disorder that is characterized by symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, and/or diarrhea. The diagnosis can be made using Rome III criteria or published guidelines after taking a thoughtful history, excluding warning signs, and performing a careful physical examination. Limited testing (ie, complete blood count and C-reactive protein level) may be useful in appropriate patients. A number of pharmacologic options are available, although many patients fail to respond to pharmacologic therapy. Although several IBS diets frequently are recommended, data supporting their use are limited. This article provides a rationale as to why specific diets might improve IBS symptoms and evaluates published trials.

21063208	Antibodies against deamidated gliadin peptides in early-stage celiac disease.	BACKGROUND AND GOALS: The widely used serum endomysial (EmA) and transglutaminase 2 (TG2-ab) antibodies predict forthcoming villous damage and celiac disease when the small-bowel mucosa structure is still normal. However, these autoantibodies may remain negative in this early stage of the disease. We hypothesized that the antibodies against deamidated gliadin peptides (DGP-AGA) might appear before the other antibodies and would thus be useful in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with early-stage celiac disease. STUDY: Serum DGP-AGA, TG2-ab, and EmA were measured at baseline and after 1 year on a gluten-free diet in 42 adults proven to have early-stage celiac disease despite normal small-bowel mucosal morphology (Marsh I-II), and in 20 celiac subjects evincing villous atrophy (Marsh III). Thirty-nine subjects with no signs of celiac disease served as nonceliac controls. RESULTS: Sensitivity to detect early-stage celiac disease was 79% for DGP-AGA, 64% for TG2-ab, and 81% for EmA. Specificities were 95%, 100%, and 100%, respectively. The corresponding efficiencies of the tests were 89% for DGP-AGA, 81% for TG2-ab, and 91% for EmA. All 3 antibodies were significantly decreased on a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the sensitivity of DGP-AGA was superior to TG2-ab and comparable to EmA in celiac patients having early-stage celiac disease with normal villous morphology. On the basis of these results, DGP-AGA would seem to offer a promising new method for case-finding and follow-up in this entity.
28829342	Zero, One, or Two Endoscopies to Diagnose and Monitor Pediatric Celiac Disease? The Jury Is Still Out.	
34108093	Clinical features and psychological impact of celiac disease at diagnosis.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: We aimed to describe the socio-demographic, behavioral and clinical profiles of adult patients with newly diagnosed celiac disease (CeD) and their possible association with QoL and psychological symptoms. METHODS: Adults newly diagnosed with CeD and residents in the Veneto region were included. Their sociodemographic characteristics, clinical presentation, mode of diagnosis, duration of symptoms before diagnosis and comorbidities were recorded. All patients completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaires. RESULTS: Between 2016 and 2019, 110 CeD patients (81% females, mean age 37.5) were recruited. At diagnosis, patients were categorized into classical (n = 56), nonclassical CeD (n = 49) and asymptomatic (n = 5) groups. Patients with classical presentation had a lower QoL than nonclassical patients, who were found to be more depressed. We observed a diagnosis delay of more than 7 months in more than 60% of patients with both classical and nonclassical presentations and we found that a longer duration of GI symptoms decreased the self-reported SF36 scores in the physical health (p = 0.002), social functioning (p = 0.03) and general health (p = 0.009) domains. Women had an overall lower self-perceived QoL. CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic presentation at CeD diagnosis, diagnostic delay and sex may affect QoL and psychological disorders.
29858750	A Comprehensive Review of Celiac Disease/Gluten-Sensitive Enteropathies.	Celiac disease is a complex immune-mediated gluten-sensitive enteropathy with protean clinical manifestations. It is manifest in genetically predisposed individuals who ingest gluten in varying amounts. In broad terms, it is thought to affect 1% of the population in the USA. More specifically, the prevalence increases drastically from 1:133 in patients not-at-risk, to 1:56 in symptomatic patients, to 1:39 in patients with a second-degree relative with the diagnosis, and to 1:22 in patients with a first-degree relative with the diagnosis. It may be associated with several immune-mediated phenomena, autoimmune diseases, and complicated by vitamin and other trace element deficiencies, bone disease, and malignancy. Our understanding of celiac disease has evolved rapidly over the past two decades. This has led to several lines of enquiry on the condition and potential treatment options. More recently, several entities including gluten intolerance, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, and seronegative celiac disease have been described. These conditions are distinct from allergies or intolerance to wheat or wheat products. There are challenges in defining some of these entities since a large number of patients self-report these conditions. The absence of confirmatory diagnostic tests poses an added dilemma in distinguishing these entities. The differences in spectrum of symptoms and highlights of the variability between the pediatric and adult populations have been studied in some detail. The role of screening for celiac disease is examined in both the general population and "at risk" populations. Diagnostic strategies including the best available serologic testing, utility of HLA haplotypes DQ2 and DQ8 which are seen in over 90% of patients with celiac disease as compared with approximately 40% of the general population, and endoscopic evaluation are also reviewed. Comprehensive nutritional management after diagnosis is key to sustained health in patients with celiac disease. Simple algorithms for care based on a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach are proposed. Refractory and non-responsive celiac diseases in the setting of a gluten-free diet are examined as are novel non-dietary therapies. Finally, the association of other disease states including psychiatric illness, infertility, lymphoproliferative malignancy, and mortality is explored with special attention paid to autoimmune and atopic disease.
34298190	Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders and Associated Health Impairment in Individuals with Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Individuals with celiac disease (CD) can experience persisting gastrointestinal symptoms despite adhering to a gluten-free diet (GFD). This may be due to functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), although there is little data on its prevalence and associated factors. METHODS: An online health questionnaire was completed by adult members of Celiac UK in October 2018. The survey included validated questions on Rome IV FGIDs, nongastrointestinal somatic symptoms, anxiety, depression, quality of life, health care use, GFD duration, and its adherence using the celiac dietary adherence test score (with a value <= 13 indicating optimal adherence). The prevalence of FGIDs and associated health impairment in the celiac cohort was compared against an age- and sex-matched population-based control group. RESULTS: Of the 863 individuals with CD (73% female; mean age, 61 years), all were taking a GFD for at least 1 year, with 96% declaring that they have been on the diet for 2 or more years (2-4 years, 20%; >=5 years, 76%). The adherence to a GFD was deemed optimal in 61% (n = 523), with the remaining 39% (n = 340) nonadherent. Those adhering to a GFD fulfilled criteria for a FGID in approximately one-half of cases, although this was significantly lower than nonadherent subjects (51% vs 75%; odds ratio [OR], 2.0; P < .001). However, the prevalence of FGIDs in GFD-adherent subjects was significantly higher than in matched population-based controls (35%; OR, 2.0; P < .001). This was accounted for by functional bowel (46% vs 31%; OR, 1.9; P < .0001) and anorectal disorders (14.5% vs 9.3%; OR, 1.7; P = .02) but not functional esophageal (7.6% vs 6.1%; P = .36) or gastroduodenal disorders (8.7% vs 7.4%; P = .47). Finally, GFD-adherent subjects with FGIDs were significantly more likely than their counterparts without FGIDs to have abnormal levels of anxiety (5% vs 2%; OR, 2.8; P = .04), depression (7% vs 2%; OR, 3.6; P = .01), somatization (31% vs 8%; OR, 5.1; P < .0001), and reduced quality of life (P < .0001). CONCLUSION: One in 2 people with CD, despite having been on a GFD for a number of years and demonstrating optimal adherence, have ongoing symptoms compatible with a Rome IV FGID. This is 2-fold the odds of FGIDs seen in age- and sex-matched controls. The presence of FGIDs is associated with significant health impairment, including psychological comorbidity. Addressing disorders of gut-brain interaction might improve outcomes in this specific group of patients.
36585541	Children With Celiac Disease Consume Specific Food Additives More Frequently Compared to Children Without Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND: Gluten-free foods often contain food additives to improve palatability, but the long-term effects on the human gastrointestinal tract are not well known. AIMS: This study aimed to quantify frequency of food additive exposure in children with and without celiac disease (CD). METHODS: Children with and without CD were enrolled and demographic data and three-day diet records were obtained. Foods were classified as gluten-free products (GFP) and "processed food", and were evaluated for presence of select food additives: polysorbate 80, carboxymethylcellulose, xanthan gum, guar gum, soy lecithin, titanium dioxide, carrageenan, maltodextrin, and aluminosilicates. The frequency of exposure was described. RESULTS: Twenty-eight participants were included in final analysis. Children with CD had a higher number of daily exposures to xanthan gum (5.3 +- 3.1 vs 2.3 +- 2.4; p = 0.009), but similar exposures to the other additives. GFP contributed 29% of total calories in the GF diet. Both groups had similar intake of processed foods. Comparing GFP and gluten-containing processed foods, 68% vs. 25% contained at least one food additive of interest (p < 0.0001); in the celiac group, those with higher consumption of GFP tended to have a higher frequency of exposure to food additives (p = 0.09). CONCLUSION: A gluten-free diet and consumption of GFP may contribute to differences in food additive intake; quantifying food additive exposures and their effect on humans requires further study.
38617446	Effect of Aspergillus niger prolyl endopeptidase in patients with celiac disease on a long-term gluten-free diet.	BACKGROUND: The gluten-free diet (GFD) has limitations, and there is intense research in the development of adjuvant therapies. AIM: To examine the effects of orally administered Aspergillus niger prolyl endopeptidase protease (AN-PEP) on inadvertent gluten exposure and symptom prevention in adult celiac disease (CeD) patients following their usual GFD. METHODS: This was an exploratory, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled CeD patients on a long-term GFD. After a 4-wk run-in period, patients were randomized to 4 wk of two AN-PEP capsules (GliadinX; AVI Research, LLC, United States) at each of three meals per day or placebo. Outcome endpoints were: (1) Average weekly stool gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) between the run-in and end of treatments and between AN-PEP and placebo; (2) celiac symptom index (CSI); (3) CeD-specific serology; and (4) quality of life. Stool samples were collected for GIP testing by ELISA every Tuesday and Friday during run-ins and treatments. RESULTS: Forty patients were randomized for the intention-to-treat analysis, and three were excluded from the per-protocol assessment. Overall, 628/640 (98.1%) stool samples were collected. GIP was undetectable (< 0.08 mug/g) in 65.6% of samples, and no differences between treatment arms were detected. Only 0.5% of samples had GIP concentrations sufficiently high (> 0.32 mug/g) to potentially cause mucosal damage. Median GIP concentration in the AN-PEP arm was 44.7% lower than in the run-in period. One-third of patients exhibiting GIP > 0.08 mug/g during run-in had lower or undetectable GIP after AN-PEP treatment. Compared with the run- in period, the proportion of symptomatic patients (CSI > 38) in the AN-PEP arm was significantly lower (P < 0.03). AN-PEP did not result in changes in specific serologies. CONCLUSION: This exploratory study conducted in a real-life setting revealed high adherence to the GFD. The AN-PEP treatment did not significantly reduce the overall GIP stool concentration. However, given the observation of a significantly lower prevalence of patients with severe symptoms in the AN-PEP arm, further clinical research is warranted.
26831462	Prospects of Developing Medicinal Therapeutic Strategies and Pharmaceutical Design for Effective Gluten Intolerance Treatment.	Gluten intolerance is an umbrella term for gluten-related disorders manifested in health decline as a result of the gluten ingestion. The spectrum of gluten-related disorders includes three major groups: autoimmune (mainly, Celiac Disease, CD, also known as Celiac Sprue, dermatitis herpetiformis, or gluten-sensitive ataxia), allergic (wheat allergy, WA), and non-autoimmune non-allergic (non-celiac gluten sensitivity, NCGS, or gluten sensitivity, GS). Pathogenesis and diagnostics of CD and WA are well established in contrast to NCGS, pathogenicity of which is still poorly understood and its symptoms are frequently misdiagnosed since most of the NCGS cases are currently identified via the process of CD and WA exclusion. By now, the only one proven effective way for CD treatment is gluten-free diet (GFD). However, such an increasingly gaining popularity diet is apparently unsuitable for NCGS treatment because in this case gluten does not always arise as the major or exclusive culprit of gastrointestinal disorder. Furthermore, it is some physicians' opinion that GFD can be deficient in fiber and in other vitamins and minerals. In many cases, GFD is commercially inaccessible for the most needy, whereas strict adherence to the diet is complicated by the presence of small amounts of the gluten components in some foods and even medicines. In this regard, a number of research groups and pharmaceutical companies are extensively developing alternative medicinal approaches to GFD for effective gluten intolerance treatment. This review summarizes our understanding of gluten-related disorders, possible mechanisms of gluten intolerance activation and advantages of gluten intolerance medicinal treatment using novel drug candidates obtained with a proper pharmaceutical design.
28281276	Duodenal mucosa FOXP3 expression in different etiologies of lymphocytic duodenosis.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: In celiac disease there is an increase of lymphocytes expressing FOXP3 in the intestinal mucosa associated with varying degrees of villous atrophy. Our aim was to evaluate FOXP3 expression in duodenal mucosa with lymphocytic enteritis according to aetiology and correlation with lymphocytes T-gammadelta. METHODS: We compared three adult patient groups suffering lymphocytic enteritis: celiacs following a gluten-free diet (n=12), first-degree relatives of celiac patients with genetic risks (n=14) and patients with functional dyspepsia (n=14), along with a control group not suffering from duodenal enteritis (n=16). The population of duodenal lymphocytes was analysed by immunohistochemistry assays for CD3+ characterisation and FOXP3 expression. Quantification of lymphocytes T-gammadelta in duodenal mucosa was performed by flow cytometry in fresh tissue samples. RESULTS: Presence of lymphocytes T-gammadelta was significantly higher in the group of celiac individuals compared to the group of relatives of these individuals (37.44 vs 5,52: p<0.0001) and the group with functional dyspepsia (37.44 vs 11.76: p=0.008). FOXP3 expression was also significantly higher in the celiac group than in the groups of relatives (18.85 vs 6.31; p=0.001) and functional dyspepsia patients (18.85 vs 7.61; p=0.023). The proportion of lymphocytes T-gammadelta and FOXP3- expressing lymphocytes was similar in the control group to that in the relatives or functional dyspepsia groups. CONCLUSIONS: Lymphocytic enteritis associated to celiac disease shows an increase of FOXP3 expression and lymphocytes T-gammadelta that is not detected in other etiologies of enteritis.
36330715	Gluten-free wafer formulation: Development, characterisation and addition of flavourings with antioxidant capacity.	The incidence of celiac disease is increasing, therefore the demand for gluten-free products that also satisfy the nutritional requirements of celiac individuals is rising. Thus, the objective of the present work was to develop a gluten-free nutritionally balanced wafer formulation with a high content of antioxidants. First, the animal fat used in the traditional formulation was successfully replaced by high oleic sunflower. Second, the antioxidant content of several flavourings (cinnamon/honey/anise/vanilla) was measured and their addition to a gluten-free wafer formulation was evaluated. Third, multivariate statistical tools were used to select the formulation that properly mimicked the characteristics of a gluten-containing wafer. According to the results, anise and cinnamon were the most suitable flavourings to prepare gluten-free wafers, and the sensory analysis concluded that these formulations were highly acceptable (means>6.7 on the hedonic scale). Finally, the storage time analysis indicated that the texture of the gluten-free wafers was more susceptible to water absorption than gluten-containing wafers. Besides, cinnamon wafers presented a higher bioaccessible antioxidant capacity than anise wafers (43.5 +- 0.1 mg Trolox/g and 18.8 +- 0.9 mg Trolox/g respectively) (p < 0.05), which remained stable for four months. This indicates that during its shelf life, the product could be consumed with its beneficial effects intact.
38205645	The association of gluten-free diet with thyroid autoimmunity in patients with celiac disease: a meta-analysis.	Background: Thyroid autoimmunity is an immune response to thyroid antigens that causes varying degrees of thyroid dysfunction. The sole effective treatment for Celiac Disease (CD) is a gluten-free diet (GFD). However, the association between GFD and thyroid autoimmunity in patients with CD has not been confirmed. Methods: A comprehensive search of several databases, involving PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Medline, and Cochrane databases, was conducted to identify studies that primarily addressed the effects of GFD on thyroid autoimmunity in CD subjects. The meta-analysis involved studies that compared the risk of ATPO and ATG antibody positivity in CD patients with GFD, the risk of developing AITD, and the risk of developing thyroid dysfunction. Fixed-effects models or random-effects models were used to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Results: A total of 10 observational studies met the inclusion criteria and included 6423 subjects. The results indicated that GFD is positively associated with thyroid autoimmunity in the children subgroup of CD patients (OR = 1.61, 95%CI 1.06-2.43, P = 0.02). However, there was no significant difference in thyroid autoimmunity between the group adhering to GFD and the control group in the total CD population. Conclusion: The results seem to indicate that subjects with a more pronounced autoimmunity (such as to have an early onset of CD) appear to have a greater risk of thyroid autoimmunity.
27452636	Salivary and fecal microbiota and metabolome of celiac children under gluten-free diet.	Celiac disease (CD) is an inflammatory autoimmune disorder resulting from the combination of genetic predisposition and gluten ingestion. A life-long gluten free diet (GFD) is the only therapeutic approach. Dysbiosis, which can precede the CD pathogenesis and/or persist when subjects are on GFD, is reviewed and discussed. Salivary microbiota and metabolome differed between healthy and celiac children treated under GFD (T-CD) for at least two years. The type of GFD (African- vs Italian-style) modified the microbiota and metabolome of Saharawi T-CD children. Different studies showed bacterial dysbiosis at duodenal and/or fecal level of patients with active untreated CD (U-CD) and T-CD compared to healthy subjects. The ratio of protective anti-inflammatory bacteria such as Lactobacillus-Bifidobacterium to potentially harmful Bacteroides-Enterobacteriaceae was the lowest in U-CD and T-CD children. In agreement with dysbiosis, serum, fecal and urinary metabolome from U-CD and T-CD patients showed altered levels of free amino acids and volatile organic compounds. However, consensus across studies defining specific bacteria and metabolites in U-CD or T-CD patients is still lacking. Future research efforts are required to determine the relationships between CD and oral and intestinal microbiotas to improve the composition of GFD for restoring the gut dysbiosis as a preventative or therapeutic approach for CD.
24278174	A celiac cellular phenotype, with altered LPP sub-cellular distribution, is inducible in controls by the toxic gliadin peptide P31-43.	Celiac disease (CD) is a frequent inflammatory intestinal disease, with a genetic background, caused by gliadin-containing food. Undigested gliadin peptides P31-43 and P57-68 induce innate and adaptive T cell-mediated immune responses, respectively. Alterations in the cell shape and actin cytoskeleton are present in celiac enterocytes, and gliadin peptides induce actin rearrangements in both the CD mucosa and cell lines. Cell shape is maintained by the actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesions, sites of membrane attachment to the extracellular matrix. The locus of the human Lipoma Preferred Partner (LPP) gene was identified as strongly associated with CD using genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The LPP protein plays an important role in focal adhesion architecture and acts as a transcription factor in the nucleus. In this study, we examined the hypothesis that a constitutive alteration of the cell shape and the cytoskeleton, involving LPP, occurs in a cell compartment far from the main inflammation site in CD fibroblasts from skin explants. We analyzed the cell shape, actin organization, focal adhesion number, focal adhesion proteins, LPP sub-cellular distribution and adhesion to fibronectin of fibroblasts obtained from CD patients on a Gluten-Free Diet (GFD) and controls, without and with treatment with A-gliadin peptide P31-43. We observed a "CD cellular phenotype" in these fibroblasts, characterized by an altered cell shape and actin organization, increased number of focal adhesions, and altered intracellular LPP protein distribution. The treatment of controls fibroblasts with gliadin peptide P31-43 mimics the CD cellular phenotype regarding the cell shape, adhesion capacity, focal adhesion number and LPP sub-cellular distribution, suggesting a close association between these alterations and CD pathogenesis. 
36904257	Evaluation of a Single Determination of Gluten Immunogenic Peptides in Urine from Unaware Celiac Patients to Monitor Gluten-Free Diet Adherence.	INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Usually, adherence to the gluten-free diet (GFD) in celiac patients is indirectly assessed through serological analysis, questionnaires, or invasive methods such as intestinal biopsy. The detection of gluten immunogenic peptides in urine (urinary gluten immunogenic peptides-uGIP) is a novel technique that directly evaluates the ingestion of gluten. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of uGIP in the follow-up of celiac disease (CD). METHODS: From April 2019 to February 2020, CD patients reporting complete adherence to the GFD were prospectively enrolled but were unaware of the reason for the tests. Urinary GIP, the celiac dietary adherence test (CDAT), symptomatic visual analog scales (VAS), and tissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTGA) titres were evaluated. Duodenal histology and capsule endoscopy (CE) were performed when indicated. RESULTS: A total of 280 patients were enrolled. Thirty-two (11.4%) had a positive uGIP test (uGIP+). uGIP+ patients did not show significant differences in demographic parameters, CDAT, or VAS scores. The tTGA+ titre was not related to the positivity of uGIP (14.4% vs. 10.9% in patients with tTGA+ and tTGA-). Regarding histology, 66.7% of the GIP+ patients had atrophy compared to 32.7% of the GIP patients (p-value 0.01). However, the presence of atrophy did not correlate with tTGA. Mucosal atrophy was detected in 29 (47.5%) out of 61 patients by CE. With this method, no noticeable dependence on uGIP results (24 GIP- vs. 5 GIP+) was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The single uGIP test was positive in 11% of CD cases referring a correct GFD adherence. Furthermore, uGIP results significantly correlated with the duodenal biopsy, formerly considered the gold standard for assessing CD activity.
32887325	Probiotics, Prebiotics and Other Dietary Supplements for Gut Microbiota Modulation in Celiac Disease Patients.	To date, the only available treatment for celiac disease (CD) patients is a life-lasting gluten-free diet (GFD). Lack of adherence to the GFD leads to a significant risk of adverse health consequences. Food cross-contamination, nutritional imbalances, and persistent gastrointestinal symptoms are the main concerns related to GFD. Moreover, despite rigid compliance to GFD, patients struggle in achieving a full restoring of the gut microbiota, which plays a role in the nutritive compounds processing, and absorption. Pivotal studies on the supplementation of GFD with probiotics, such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacilli, reported a potential to restore gut microbiota composition and to pre-digest gluten in the intestinal lumen, reducing the inflammation associated with gluten intake, the intestinal permeability, and the cytokine and antibody production. These findings could explain an improvement in symptoms and quality of life in patients treated with GFD and probiotics. On the other hand, the inclusion of prebiotics in GFD could also be easy to administer and cost-effective as an adjunctive treatment for CD, having the power to stimulate the growth of potentially health-promoting bacteria strains. However, evidence regarding the use of prebiotics and probiotics in patients with CD is still insufficient to justify their use in clinical practice.
34237639	High consumption of Nickel-containing foods and IBS-like disorders: late events in a gluten-free diet.	As reported in the recent literature, Nickel has become an important part of our daily life since the last decades. We can find it in skincare products, occupational exposures and foods. Only recently, research has started to show a link between Nickel and many health disorders, including adverse reactions to food containing nickel. Nowadays, the relationship between nickel-containing foods and well-being is becoming a topic of growing interest in clinical practice and will play an even larger role in the future. The use of foods with a high nickel content, largely present in a gluten free diet, could explain the lack of clinical remission in celiac patients and dispel a diagnosis of refractory celiac disease.
20877349	Prevention measures and exploratory pharmacological treatments of celiac disease.	Increasing prevalence, protean clinical manifestations, and lack of pharmacological therapy make celiac disease (CD) a complex and highly relevant illness in gastroenterology. This chronic inflammatory disorder of the small intestine is caused by the ingestion of gluten containing cereals in genetically susceptible individuals, leading to a variety of gastrointestinal (GI) and non-GI manifestations. Awareness among physicians is growing due to accessible and highly accurate diagnostic and screening methods. Recent evidence suggests a possible rising incidence of CD. Environmental factors such as early life gluten exposure, intestinal infections, short duration of breast-feeding, and changes in intestinal microbiota have been proposed to have a role in CD pathogenesis. Thus, prevention approaches to diminish the rising prevalence of CD are currently being evaluated. Still, the cornerstone treatment of CD remains a strict gluten-free diet. This nutritional regime is demanding, and non-adherence is common because of social isolation, financial issues, or restriction of food diversity. Allowing patients to occasionally consume small amounts of gluten would greatly improve their quality of life. Owing to recent advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of CD, different targets have been identified and have motivated the development of several experimental therapeutic strategies. The main goal of this review is to discuss the mechanisms that can be exploited therapeutically to prevent or delay CD, disease associations and its complications. Current treatments for complications of CD, including refractory CD and malignancy, are beyond the scope of this review.
22516148	Increased prevalence of transglutaminase 6 antibodies in sera from schizophrenia patients.	Gluten can cause extraintestinal manifestations with or without gastrointestinal symptoms and elevated antitissue transglutaminase 2 (tTG2) autoantibodies. Organ-specific gluten reaction involves immune response toward other transglutaminase (TG) isoforms including tTG3 (expressed in the skin, leading to dermatitis herpetiformis) and tTG6 (expressed in the brain, causing gluten ataxia). This analysis focuses on tTG6 antibodies, which have never been studied before in schizophrenia (SZ) and its relationships to tTG2 and to antigliadin antibodies. We previously showed an increased prevalence of tTG2 antibodies in gluten sensitive SZ patients compared with healthy controls (HC) that was not paralleled by an increased prevalence of antiendomysial antibody. To elucidate this discrepancy, we examined those tTG2 positive SZ patients for the presence of tTG6 antibody. We also searched for tTG6 antibodies in our sample of antigliadin (AGA) positive and AGA and tTG2 negative SZ patients. Seventy-four tTG2 positive SZ patients were compared with 148 age and gender-matched HC. Of the 74 tTG2 positive SZ patients, 16 were positive for tTG6 IgA for a prevalence of 22%. Only 4 HC were positive for tTG6 IgA for a prevalence of 2.7%. Among the AGA positive SZ patients, the prevalence of tTG6 IgA was 21.3% while 13.1% of the AGA and tTG2 negative SZ patients were positive for tTG6 IgA. The HC had a prevalence of 6%. Our results indicate a higher prevalence of tTG6 antibodies in SZ that may represent a biomarker useful to identify SZ patients who would benefit from a gluten-free diet.
23609613	ACG clinical guidelines: diagnosis and management of celiac disease.	This guideline presents recommendations for the diagnosis and management of patients with celiac disease. Celiac disease is an immune-based reaction to dietary gluten (storage protein for wheat, barley, and rye) that primarily affects the small intestine in those with a genetic predisposition and resolves with exclusion of gluten from the diet. There has been a substantial increase in the prevalence of celiac disease over the last 50 years and an increase in the rate of diagnosis in the last 10 years. Celiac disease can present with many symptoms, including typical gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., diarrhea, steatorrhea, weight loss, bloating, flatulence, abdominal pain) and also non-gastrointestinal abnormalities (e.g., abnormal liver function tests, iron deficiency anemia, bone disease, skin disorders, and many other protean manifestations). Indeed, many individuals with celiac disease may have no symptoms at all. Celiac disease is usually detected by serologic testing of celiac-specific antibodies. The diagnosis is confirmed by duodenal mucosal biopsies. Both serology and biopsy should be performed on a gluten-containing diet. The treatment for celiac disease is primarily a gluten-free diet (GFD), which requires significant patient education, motivation, and follow-up. Non-responsive celiac disease occurs frequently, particularly in those diagnosed in adulthood. Persistent or recurring symptoms should lead to a review of the patient's original diagnosis to exclude alternative diagnoses, a review of the GFD to ensure there is no obvious gluten contamination, and serologic testing to confirm adherence with the GFD. In addition, evaluation for disorders associated with celiac disease that could cause persistent symptoms, such as microscopic colitis, pancreatic exocrine dysfunction, and complications of celiac disease, such as enteropathy-associated lymphoma or refractory celiac disease, should be entertained. Newer therapeutic modalities are being studied in clinical trials, but are not yet approved for use in practice. Given the incomplete response of many patients to a GFD-free diet as well as the difficulty of adherence to the GFD over the long term, development of new effective therapies for symptom control and reversal of inflammation and organ damage are needed. The prevalence of celiac disease is increasing worldwide and many patients with celiac disease remain undiagnosed, highlighting the need for improved strategies in the future for the optimal detection of patients.
35652406	Dietary Management of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus with Celiac Disease.	Celiac disease is diagnosed more commonly with type 1 diabetes, and the most problematic aspect for a child with type 1 diabetes and celiac disease is that most GFD foods have a high glycemic index, while low glycemic index foods are recommended for type 1 diabetes mellitus. As a result, dietary controls become more difficult. Diet management could improve the elevated HbA1c levels. The aim of this review is to illustrate the clinical features and diagnostic considerations, as well as current knowledge of common pathogenic features such as genetics, environmental risk factors, and the gut microbiome of type 1 diabtes and celiac disease. Also, the importance of diet management on glycemic control and growth rate in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and celiac disease has been discussed. PubMed and Google Scholar databases were searched. Reports published from the years 1969 to 2021 focused on the role of type 1 diabetes mellitus and celiac disease, and examined the types of diet on glycemic control, growth rate, and quality of life. Only a few studies on the effects of a carbohydrate count gluten-free diet on glycemic control, growth rate, and quality of life in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and celiac disease have been conducted. There have been few studies showing that dietary intervention helps to achieve and maintain normal blood glucose and blood pressure levels, a healthy lipid profile, and a healthy body weight. Studies stated that a low-carbohydrate diet had the greatest effect on improving glycemic control and insulin parameters.
39385073	The prevalence of obesity and underweight in celiac patients at the time of diagnosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of obesity, overweight, and underweight in celiac disease (CD) at diagnosis before starting the Gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science until July 2024 to find the cross-sectional and longitudinal studies that measured the body mass index (BMI) in CD patients at diagnosis. The risk of bias assessment was conducted using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment scale. Meta-regression analyses were applied to understand whether weight status is associated with CD. RESULTS: A total of 23 studies involving 15,299 CD patients and 815,167 healthy individuals were included in this study. In newly diagnosed CD patients, pooled estimates of the prevalence of obesity, overweight, and underweight before GFD were 11.78%, 18.42%, and 11.04%, respectively. The prevalence of overweight and obesity in newly diagnosed CD patients increased from 22.15% in 2003-2009 to 32.51% in 2016-2021. Meta-regression analyses indicated that the CD patients with higher BMI had a higher mean age (p = 0.001), and female gender had a marginally significant (p = 0.055) association with higher BMI. Only a few CD patients were underweight at the time of diagnosis, and more patients were overweight/obese. CONCLUSIONS: our meta-analysis demonstrated that only a few CD patients were underweight at the time of diagnosis, and almost 37% were overweight or obese. Meta-regression showed a significant association between higher BMI and higher mean age and female gender. A delay or failure for diagnosis of CD is more common in overweight/obese patients, resulting in more progression of the disease and counteracting any advantages of diagnosis.
29760697	Hookworm Secreted Extracellular Vesicles Interact With Host Cells and Prevent Inducible Colitis in Mice.	Gastrointestinal (GI) parasites, hookworms in particular, have evolved to cause minimal harm to their hosts, allowing them to establish chronic infections. This is mediated by creating an immunoregulatory environment. Indeed, hookworms are such potent suppressors of inflammation that they have been used in clinical trials to treat inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and celiac disease. Since the recent description of helminths (worms) secreting extracellular vesicles (EVs), exosome-like EVs from different helminths have been characterized and their salient roles in parasite-host interactions have been highlighted. Here, we analyze EVs from the rodent parasite Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, which has been used as a model for human hookworm infection. N. brasiliensis EVs (Nb-EVs) are actively internalized by mouse gut organoids, indicating a role in driving parasitism. We used proteomics and RNA-Seq to profile the molecular composition of Nb-EVs. We identified 81 proteins, including proteins frequently present in exosomes (like tetraspanin, enolase, 14-3-3 protein, and heat shock proteins), and 27 sperm-coating protein-like extracellular proteins. RNA-Seq analysis revealed 52 miRNA species, many of which putatively map to mouse genes involved in regulation of inflammation. To determine whether GI nematode EVs had immunomodulatory properties, we assessed their potential to suppress GI inflammation in a mouse model of inducible chemical colitis. EVs from N. brasiliensis but not those from the whipworm Trichuris muris or control vesicles from grapes protected against colitic inflammation in the gut of mice that received a single intraperitoneal injection of EVs. Key cytokines associated with colitic pathology (IL-6, IL-1beta, IFNgamma, and IL-17a) were significantly suppressed in colon tissues from EV-treated mice. By contrast, high levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were detected in Nb-EV-treated mice. Proteins and miRNAs contained within helminth EVs hold great potential application in development of drugs to treat helminth infections as well as chronic non-infectious diseases resulting from a dysregulated immune system, such as IBD.
34168104	Multiple allelic associations from genes involved in energy metabolism were identified in celiac disease.	Energy metabolism is a critical factor that influences disease pathogenesis. Recent high-throughput genomic studies have enabled us to look into disease biology with greater details. Celiac disease (CD) is an inflammatory autoimmune disease where ~60 non-HLA genes were identified which in conjunction with HLA genes explain ~55% of the disease heritability. In this study we aimed to identify susceptibility energy metabolism genes and investigate their role in CD. We re-analysed published Immunochip genotyping data, which were originally analysed for CD association studies in north Indian and Dutch population. 269 energy metabolism genes were tested. Meta-analysis was done for the identified SNPs. To validate the functional implications of identified markers and/or genes, in silico functional annotation was performed. Six SNPs were identified in north Indians, of which three markers from two loci were replicated in Dutch. rs2071592 (PMeta=5.01e-75) and rs2251824 (PMeta=1.87e-14) from ATP6V1G2-NFKBIL1-DDX39B locus and rs4947331 (PMeta= 9.85e-13) from NEU1 locus were found significantly associated. Identified genes are key regulators of cellular energy metabolism and associated with several immune mediated diseases. In silico functional annotation showed significant biological relevance of these novel markers and genes. FDI approved therapeutics against ATP6V1G2 and NEU1 are currently in use to treat chronic and inflammatory diseases. This study identified two pathogenic loci, originally involved in energy metabolism. Extensive investigation showed their synergistic role in CD pathogenesis by promoting immune mediated enteric inflammation. Proposed CD pathogenesis model in this study needs to be tested through tissue-on-chip and in vivo methods to ensure its translational application.
30368309	Celiac Disease in the Pediatric Population.	Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder in which the lining of the gastrointestinal tract is damaged by an immune-mediated response to gluten proteins (Allen, 2015). It is a polygenetic disease that only appears in genetically susceptible individuals (Newton & Singer, 2012). It is a worldwide concern, with North America having a high prevalence rate (Liu et al., 2017). Celiac disease can present in a spectrum of manifestations, making it difficult to identify and diagnosis (Reilly & Green, 2012). High-risk populations include those with a positive family history as well as individuals with other autoimmune disorders (Newton & Singer, 2012). Screening and diagnosis are completed with a blood test followed by a biopsy of the small intestinal lining (Zevit & Shamir, 2014). Currently, the only treatment for celiac disease is a strict, gluten-free diet. Further research is warranted in areas of environmental risk factors and treatments (Allen, 2015; Newton & Singer, 2012).
22401783	Rituximab: an effective treatment for rheumatologic and digestive symptoms of celiac disease?	
24440147	Diagnosis and classification of celiac disease and gluten sensitivity.	Celiac disease is a complex disorder, the development of which is controlled by a combination of genetic (HLA alleles) and environmental (gluten ingestion) factors. New diagnostic guidelines developed by ESPGHAN emphasize the crucial role of serological tests in the diagnostic process of symptomatic subjects, and of the detection of HLA DQ2/DQ8 alleles in defining a diagnosis in asymptomatic subjects belonging to at-risk groups. The serological diagnosis of CD is based on the detection of class IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) and anti-endomysial antibodies. In patients with IgA deficiency, anti-tTG or anti-deamidated gliadin peptide antibody assays of the IgG class are used. When anti-tTG antibody levels are very high, antibody specificity is absolute and CD can be diagnosed without performing a duodenum biopsy. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity is a gluten reaction in which both allergic and autoimmune mechanisms have been ruled out. Diagnostic criteria include the presence of symptoms similar to those of celiac or allergic patients; negative allergological tests and absence of anti-tTG and EMA antibodies; normal duodenal histology; evidence of disappearance of the symptoms with a gluten-free diet; relapse of the symptoms when gluten is reintroduced. 
26077485	Unrecognized Celiac Disease in Children Presenting for Rheumatology Evaluation.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Current clinical guidelines do not consider patients with rheumatic conditions to be at high risk for celiac disease (CD) despite numerous reported associations between the two in adults and children. The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of CD among patients presenting for pediatric rheumatology evaluation. METHODS: A total of 2125 patients presenting for initial evaluation by the Division of Pediatric Rheumatology at the Hospital for Special Surgery between June 2006 and December 2013 were screened for CD as a part of the standard initial serologic evaluation. The charts of these patients were evaluated retrospectively at the end of this period. RESULTS: 36 patients (30 girls, 6 boys, mean age 9.4 +- 4.3 years, range 2-16 years) received a diagnosis of CD after serologic testing and evaluation by pediatric gastroenterology. Eight additional patients with known diagnoses of CD presented during this time period. The total prevalence of CD over this 6.5-year period was 2.0%. The most common presenting complaints among patients diagnosed with CD were myalgias, arthralgias, and rash. Less frequently, patients reported gastrointestinal complaints including abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea. All patients reported improvement or complete resolution of their musculoskeletal symptoms after initiation of a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified 36 new cases of CD among children presenting for rheumatology evaluation, for an overall prevalence rate of 2.0%. The majority of patients who ultimately received a diagnosis of CD presented with extraintestinal manifestations. These results underscore the importance of screening children presenting for rheumatology evaluation for CD.
32854216	Diet, Perceived Intestinal Well-Being and Compositions of Fecal Microbiota and Short Chain Fatty Acids in Oat-Using Subjects with Celiac Disease or Gluten Sensitivity.	A gluten-free diet may result in high fat and low fiber intake and thus lead to unbalanced microbiota. This study characterized fecal microbiota profiles by 16S MiSeq sequencing among oat-using healthy adult subjects (n = 14) or adult subjects with celiac disease (CeD) (n = 19) or non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) (n = 10). Selected microbial metabolites, self-reported 4d food diaries and perceived gut symptoms were compared. Subjects with NCGS experienced the highest amount of gut symptoms and received more energy from fat and less from carbohydrates than healthy and CeD subjects. Oat consumption resulted in reaching the lower limit of the recommended fiber intake. Frequent consumption of gluten-free pure oats did not result in microbiota dysbiosis in subjects with CeD or NCGS. Thus, the high number of gut symptoms in NCGS subjects was not linked to the microbiota. The proportion of fecal acetate was higher in healthy when compared to NCGS subjects, which may be linked to a higher abundance of Bifidobacterium in the control group compared to NCGS and CeD subjects. Propionate, butyrate and ammonia production and beta-glucuronidase activity were comparable among the study groups. The results suggest that pure oats have great potential as the basis of a gluten-free diet and warrant further studies in minor microbiota disorders.
26003394	Transition of gastroenterological patients from paediatric to adult care: A position statement by the Italian Societies of Gastroenterology.	In 2013, four Italian Gastroenterological Societies (the Italian Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, the Italian Society of Hospital Gastroenterologists and Endoscopists, the Italian Society of Endoscopy, and the Italian Society of Gastroenterology) formed a joint panel of experts with the aim of preparing an official statement on transition medicine in Gastroenterology. The transition of adolescents from paediatric to adult care is a crucial moment in managing chronic diseases such as celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, liver disease and liver transplantation. Improved medical treatment and availability of new drugs and surgical techniques have improved the prognosis of many paediatric disorders, prolonging survival, thus making the transition to adulthood possible and necessary. An inappropriate transition or the incomplete transmission of data from the paediatrician to the adult Gastroenterologist can dramatically decrease compliance to treatment and prognosis of a young patient, particularly in the case of severe disorders. For these reasons, the Italian gastroenterological societies decided to develop an official shared transition protocol. The resulting document discusses the factors influencing the transition process and highlights the main points to accomplish to optimize compliance and prognosis of gastroenterological patients during the difficult transition from childhood to adolescence and adulthood. 
31710883	Paroxismal non-kinesigenic dyskinesia and hemidystonia associated with silent celiac disease.	Paroxismal non-kinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD) is a rare movement disorder manifesting as choreatic/dystonic movements, usually lasting from minutes to up to 4 h, with perserved consciousness during attacks. Primary PNKD are idiopathic or genetic disorders while secondary PNKD are associated with various neurologic and medical conditions. We present a case with PNKD and right sided hemidystonia in association with celiac disease, responsive to gluten-free diet, not previously reported in available literature. In conclusion, diagnostic tests for celiac disease should be a part of etiological investigations in patients with otherwise unexplained movement disorders including PKND. Gluten free diet could produce a favorable clinical response in those patients.
29426626	Antituberculosis Treatment in a Patient with Celiac Disease.	
33291590	Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity in the Context of Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders.	Gluten-free diets are increasingly chosen in the Western world, even in the absence of a diagnosis of celiac disease. Around 10% of people worldwide self-report gluten-related complaints, including intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms. In most cases, these subjects would be labeled as patients suffering from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) who place themselves on a gluten-free diet even in the absence of celiac disease. In some instances, patients report a clear benefit by avoiding gluten from their diet and/or symptom worsening upon gluten reintroduction. This clinical entity has been termed non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). The symptoms referred by these patients are both intestinal and extra-intestinal, suggesting that similarly to functional gastrointestinal disorders, NCGS is a disorder of gut-brain interaction. It remains unclear if gluten is the only wheat component involved in NCGS. The mechanisms underlying symptom generation in NCGS remain to be fully clarified, although in the past few years, the research has significantly moved forward with new data linking NCGS to changes in gut motility, permeability and innate immunity. The diagnosis is largely based on the self-reported reaction to gluten by the patient, as there are no available biomarkers, and confirmatory double-blind challenge protocols are unfeasible in daily clinical practice. Some studies suggest that a small proportion of patients with IBS have an intolerance to gluten. However, the benefits of gluten-free or low-gluten diets in non-celiac disease-related conditions are limited, and the long-term consequences of this practice may include nutritional and gut microbiota unbalance. Here, we summarize the role of gluten in the clinical features, pathophysiology, and management of NCGS and disorders of gut-brain interaction.
27918311	Determinants of Patient Satisfaction in Celiac Disease Care.	BACKGROUND AND GOALS: There are little data examining patient satisfaction with celiac disease (CD) care. We sought to assess how satisfied patients are with their CD care, and to determine the influencing factors. STUDY: We distributed an online questionnaire to adults receiving programmatic updates from a CD referral center, querying aspects of CD care and using disease-specific validated instruments to measure quality of life and dietary adherence. The univariable and multivariable analyses were performed using satisfaction as a binary outcome comparing grouped "satisfied" and "very satisfied" respondents to "neutral," "dissatisfied," and "very dissatisfied" respondents. RESULTS: Three hundred eighty-seven (22%) individuals completed the survey, and 229 met the inclusion criteria of biopsy-proven CD. Seventy-nine individuals (34.5%) reported being "very satisfied" with their CD care, 82 (35.8%) "satisfied," 46 (20.1%) "neutral," 14 (6.1%) "dissatisfied," and 8 (3.5%) "very dissatisfied." On multivariable analysis, reporting that physicians spend ample time managing CD needs (P=0.013), and having CD-antibody levels checked yearly (P=0.003), were positive predictors of patient satisfaction. Factors that were not correlated with patient satisfaction included symptom severity (P=0.268), quality of life (P=0.13), and following with a CD specialist (P=0.139). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients we surveyed were satisfied with their CD care. We found that patients report higher satisfaction when they feel physicians spend time caring for their CD needs and when they receive annual CD-antibody testing. On the basis of our study, these factors are more important than disease severity, seeing a CD specialist, and quality of life in determining patient satisfaction with CD care.
22484746	Lane-Hamilton syndrome: association or coincidence.	The combination of idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis (IPH) and celiac disease (CD) is rare. The clinical importance of this association is that a significant improvement can be obtained with gluten free diet not only in intestinal but also in pulmonary symptoms. A four and half-years old girl was admitted with complaints of cough, difficulty in breathing and paleness. She had intermittent episodes of abdominal pain and diarrhea. She had dyspnea and tachycardia, and oxygen saturation 88%. The patient was diagnosed with CD and concomitant IPH. With gluten-free diet and corticosteroid treatment, both intestinal and pulmonary symptoms were controlled.
28462603	Gluten-related disorders: certainties, questions and doubts.	In the last decade, the ingestion of gluten, a heterogeneous complex of proteins present in wheat, rice, barley and probably in oats, has been associated with clinical disorders, such as celiac disease, wheat allergy and recently to non-celiac gluten sensitivity or wheat intolerance syndrome. Gluten-related disorders, which are becoming epidemiologically relevant with an estimated global prevalence of about 5%, require the exclusion of gluten from the diet. For the past 5 years, an important shift in the availability of gluten-free products, together with increased consumption in the general population, has been recorded and is estimated to be about 12-25%. Many people follow a self-prescribed gluten-free diet, despite the fact that the majority have not first been previously excluded, or confirmed, as having gluten disorders. They rely on claims that a gluten-free diet improves general health. In this review, we provide an overview of the clinical disorders related to gluten or wheat ingestion, pointing out the current certainties, open questions, possible answers and several doubts in the management of these conditions. KEY MESSAGE Incidence of gluten-related disorders is increased in the last decade and self-diagnosis is frequent with inappropriate starting of a gluten-free diet. Gluten and wheat are considered as the most important triggers to coeliac disease, wheat allergy and non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Pediatricians, allergologist and gastroenterologist are involved in the management of these conditions and appropriate diagnostic protocols are required.
39125309	Gluten-Free Diet Adherence Tools for Individuals with Celiac Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Tools Compared to Laboratory Tests.	This systematic review aimed to find the tool that best predicts celiac individuals' adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). The Transparent Reporting of Multivariable Prediction Models for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD-SRMA) guideline was used for the construction and collection of data from eight scientific databases (PubMed, EMBASE, LILACS, Web of Science, LIVIVO, SCOPUS, Google Scholar, and Proquest) on 16 November 2023. The inclusion criteria were studies involving individuals with celiac disease (CD) who were over 18 years old and on a GFD for at least six months, using a questionnaire to predict adherence to a GFD, and comparing it with laboratory tests (serological tests, gluten immunogenic peptide-GIP, or biopsy). Review articles, book chapters, and studies without sufficient data were excluded. The Checklist for Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modeling Studies (CHARMS) was used for data collection from the selected primary studies, and their risk of bias and quality was assessed using the Prediction Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST). The association between the GFD adherence determined by the tool and laboratory test was assessed using the phi contingency coefficient. The studies included in this review used four different tools to evaluate GFD adherence: BIAGI score, Coeliac Dietary Adherence Test (CDAT), self-report questions, and interviews. The comparison method most often used was biopsy (n = 19; 59.3%), followed by serology (n = 14; 43.7%) and gluten immunogenic peptides (GIPs) (n = 4; 12.5%). There were no significant differences between the interview, self-report, and BIAGI tools used to evaluate GFD adherence. These tools were better associated with GFD adherence than the CDAT. Considering their cost, application time, and prediction capacity, the self-report and BIAGI were the preferred tools for evaluating GFD adherence.
33722583	TAK-101 Nanoparticles Induce Gluten-Specific Tolerance in Celiac Disease: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: In celiac disease (CeD), gluten induces immune activation, leading to enteropathy. TAK-101, gluten protein (gliadin) encapsulated in negatively charged poly(dl-lactide-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles, is designed to induce gluten-specific tolerance. METHODS: TAK-101 was evaluated in phase 1 dose escalation safety and phase 2a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies. Primary endpoints included pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of TAK-101 (phase 1) and change from baseline in circulating gliadin-specific interferon-gamma-producing cells at day 6 of gluten challenge, in patients with CeD (phase 2a). Secondary endpoints in the phase 2a study included changes from baseline in enteropathy (villus height to crypt depth ratio [Vh:Cd]), and frequency of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes and peripheral gut-homing T cells. RESULTS: In phase 2a, 33 randomized patients completed the 14-day gluten challenge. TAK-101 induced an 88% reduction in change from baseline in interferon-gamma spot-forming units vs placebo (2.01 vs 17.58, P = .006). Vh:Cd deteriorated in the placebo group (-0.63, P = .002), but not in the TAK-101 group (-0.18, P = .110), although the intergroup change from baseline was not significant (P = .08). Intraepithelial lymphocyte numbers remained equal. TAK-101 reduced changes in circulating alpha4beta7+CD4+ (0.26 vs 1.05, P = .032), alphaEbeta7+CD8+ (0.69 vs 3.64, P = .003), and gammadelta (0.15 vs 1.59, P = .010) effector memory T cells. TAK-101 (up to 8 mg/kg) induced no clinically meaningful changes in vital signs or routine clinical laboratory evaluations. No serious adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: TAK-101 was well tolerated and prevented gluten-induced immune activation in CeD. The findings from the present clinical trial suggest that antigen-specific tolerance was induced and represent a novel approach translatable to other immune-mediated diseases. ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT03486990 and NCT03738475.
32218420	Fecal gluten immunogenic peptides as indicators of dietary compliance in celiac patients.	BACKGROUND: It is important to have methods for evaluating dietary compliance in patients with celiac disease (CD). Determination of fecal gluten immunogenic peptides (GIPs) was recently proposed as a method of detecting gluten intake. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether determination of GIPs can be used as an indicator of compliance with a gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: Twenty-five persons with CD on a gluten-free diet for at least one year were enrolled in the study. Compliance with the diet was assessed by the Biagi questionnaire, evaluation of symptoms and assay of IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (IgA anti-tTG). GIPs were determined by iVYLISA GIP-S test (Biomedal S.L., Seville, Spain) on an automated Chorus analyzer (DIESSE Diagnostica Senese, Siena, Italy), after extraction of fecal samples by the method developed by DIESSE. RESULTS: Four patients tested positive for GIPs (GIP+), two of whom complied strictly with the gluten-free diet according to the Biagi questionnaire. None of the four GIP-positive patients manifested symptoms. IgA anti-tTG was significantly higher in GIP+ than in GIP- subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Assay of fecal GIPs identified more patients who were not complying with the diet than the Biagi questionnaire or evaluation of symptoms. The anti-tTG and GIP results agreed perfectly; however, since anti-tTG antibodies remain high for longer and are not a completely reliable marker of GFD intake, detection of fecal GIPs offers a direct, objective, quantitative assessment of exposure, even occasional, to gluten and could be used to check dietary compliance.
29039796	Development and Validation of the Celiac Disease-Children's Activities Report (CD-Chart) for Promoting Self-Management among Children and Adolescents.	Adherence to a restrictive gluten-free diet is the only known treatment for celiac disease (CD). Children and adolescents with CD encounter challenges while managing the diet in daily activities. Understanding their participation characteristics is lacking. The aim was to describe the development and validation process of the Celiac Disease-Children's Activities Report (CD-Chart). The final CD-Chart includes nine food-related activities that are measured by six core dimensions: frequency, preference, preparation, involvement, help, and self-determination. Participants were 126 children (8-11 years) and adolescents (12-18 years) with CD, and 30 healthy matched controls. Factor analysis was performed and psychometric properties were measured. Content and face validity was established and the CD-Chart showed adequate internal consistency as measured by the preference dimension (alpha = 0.81). Factor analysis revealed two distinct factors, social environment and close family environment. Construct validity demonstrated that the group with CD required significantly more pre-preparation for food-related activities than controls, (t(38) = 76.25, p < 0.001) and further differences as well as similarities were found between groups. Primary results indicate that the CD-Chart may serve as a practical tool for acquiring information about participation characteristics in food-related activities, strengths and challenges of children and adolescents with CD, to promote self-management, diet adherence, and well-being.
30779970	Fibre-enriched buckwheat pasta modifies blood glucose response compared to corn pasta in individuals with type 1 diabetes and celiac disease: Acute randomized controlled trial.	AIM: People with type 1 diabetes and celiac disease (T1D&CD) have high blood glucose variability. Processed gluten-free foods have shown to induce a worse metabolic profile whereas naturally gluten-free foods may represent healthier options. On the other hand, dietary fibre has shown to reduce postprandial glycemic excursions in individuals with diabetes. Thus, we evaluated the acute effect of fibre-enriched buckwheat (FBP) and corn pasta (CP) on postprandial blood glucose response (PP-BGR). METHODS: Ten adult patients with T1D&CD consumed two meals with the same amount of carbohydrate while differing only for pasta type (FBP or CP) preceded by the same insulin bolus. Participants utilized continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and data over 6 h after meal were analyzed. RESULTS: PP-BGR differed between the two meals, being significantly lower in the first period (0-3 h) after the CP than the FBP meal (iAUC: -38 +- 158 vs. 305 +- 209 mmol/L   180 min, p = 0.040), whereas significantly higher in the second period (3-6 h) after the CP than the FBP meal (iAUC: 432 +- 153 vs. 308 +- 252 mmol/L   180 min, p = 0.030). Overall, a less variable postprandial profile was observed after FBP than CP consumption. CONCLUSIONS: In individuals with T1D&CD, the acute consumption of FBP induces significant differences in PP-BGR compared with CP that may be clinically relevant.
33200613	Villous atrophy persistence in celiac disease despite following a gluten-free diet must be clarified.	We read with great interest the article recently published in REED by Shadegi et al. Villous atrophy (VA) persists in 35 % and 23.7 % of celiac disease (CD) patients for six and 24 months, respectively, after following a gluten-free diet (GFD). The authors think that the time following a GFD must be longer than two years in some patients to achieve mucosal healing and we agree with this. Our experience comes from a short series of ten females and three males with CD, diagnosed at an average age of 36 years (15-72) based on serology (anti-TG2 > 10 IU/ml or anti-Em positive) and a duodenal biopsy showing VA. All cases followed a GFD, according to the anamnesis and underwent a second duodenal biopsy and anti-TG2 determination after 42 (10-202) months. Immunogenic peptides of gluten (IPG) in feces were determined in four patients.
27457377	Type 1 and type 2 diabetes in celiac disease: prevalence and effect on clinical and histological presentation.	BACKGROUND: Association between celiac disease and type 1 diabetes in adults is still somewhat unclear, and that between celiac disease and type 2 diabetes even less known. We studied these issues in a large cohort of adult celiac disease patients. METHODS: The prevalence of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in 1358 celiac patients was compared with the population-based values. Furthermore, patients with celiac disease and concomitant type 1 or type 2 diabetes and those with celiac disease only underwent comparisons of clinical and histological features and adherence to gluten-free diet. RESULTS: The prevalence of type 1 diabetes (men/women) was 8.0 % /1.8 % in celiac patients and 0.7 % /0.3 % in the population, and that of type 2 diabetes 4.3 % /2.5 % and 4.4 % /3.0 %, respectively. Celiac patients with concomitant type 1 diabetes were younger (45 years vs 65 years and 52 years, P < 0.001) and more often screen-detected (43 % vs 13 % and 14 %, P < 0.001), had less other gastrointestinal diseases (8 % vs 40 % and 25 %, P = 0.028), more thyroidal diseases (18 % vs 16 % and 13 %, P = 0.043) and lower dietary adherence (71 % vs 95 % and 96 %, P < 0.001) compared with celiac patients with concomitant type 2 diabetes and patients with celiac disease only. Patients with concomitant type 2 diabetes had more hypercholesterolemia than the other groups (8 % vs 6 % and 4 %, P = 0.024), and both diabetes groups more hypertension (47 % and 31 % vs 15 %, P < 0.001) and coronary artery disease (29 % and 18 % vs 3 %, P < 0.001) than the patients with celiac disease only. CONCLUSIONS: Type 1 diabetes was markedly overrepresented in celiac disease, especially in men, whereas the prevalence of type 2 diabetes was comparable with the population. Concomitant type 1 or type 2 diabetes predisposes celiac patients to severe co-morbidities and type 1 diabetes also to poor dietary adherence.
24566442	Estimated levels of gluten incidentally present in a Canadian gluten-free diet.	Avoiding exposure to gluten is currently the only effective treatment for celiac disease. However, the evidence suggests that for most affected individuals, exposure to less than 10 mg/day is unlikely to cause histological changes to the intestinal mucosa. The daily diet of people with celiac disease does not rely solely on gluten-free pre-packaged foods, but also on naturally gluten-free grains (e.g., rice, buckwheat, ...) and foods with grain-derived ingredients (i.e., flour and starches) used for cooking and baking at home. The objective of this study was to estimate the level of incidental gluten potentially present in gluten-free diets from a Canadian perspective. We have conducted gluten exposure estimations from grain-containing foods and foods with grain-derived ingredients, taking into consideration the various rates of food consumption by different sex and age groups. These estimates have concluded that if gluten was present at levels not exceeding 20 ppm, exposure to gluten would remain below 10 mg per day for all age groups studied. However, in reality the level of gluten found in naturally gluten-free ingredients is not static and there may be some concerns related to the flours made from naturally gluten-free cereal grains. It was found that those containing a higher level of fiber and that are frequently used to prepare daily foods by individuals with celiac disease could be a concern. For this category of products, only the flours and starches labelled "gluten-free" should be used for home-made preparations. 
21990301	Celiac disease diagnosis and management: a 46-year-old woman with anemia.	Celiac disease is one of the most prevalent autoimmune gastrointestinal disorders, but as the case of Ms J illustrates, diagnosis is often delayed or missed. Based on serologic studies, the prevalence of celiac disease in many populations is estimated to be approximately 1% and has been increasing steadily over the last 50 years. Evaluation for celiac disease is generally straightforward and uses commonly available serologic tests; however, the signs and symptoms of celiac disease are nonspecific and highly heterogeneous, making diagnosis difficult. Although celiac disease is often considered a mild disorder treatable with simple dietary changes, in reality celiac disease imparts considerable risks, including reduced bone mineral density, impaired quality of life, and increased overall mortality. In addition, a gluten-free diet is highly burdensome and can profoundly affect patients and their families. For these reasons, care of individuals with celiac disease requires prompt diagnosis and ongoing multidisciplinary management.
25925920	Celiac disease and the gluten-free diet: consequences and recommendations for improvement.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic small intestinal immune-mediated enteropathy precipitated by exposure to dietary gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. CD-related enteropathy leads to multiple nutritional deficiencies involving macro- and micronutrients. Currently, medical nutrition therapy consisting of the gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only accepted treatment for CD. KEY MESSAGES: The GFD is the cornerstone of treatment for CD. Prior published studies have concluded that maintenance of the GFD results in improvement of the majority of nutritional deficiencies. In the past, counseling for CD focused mainly on the elimination of gluten in the diet. However, the GFD is not without its inadequacies; compliance to the GFD may result in certain deficiencies such as fiber, B vitamins, iron, and trace minerals. Paucity of fortified gluten-free foods may be responsible for certain deficiencies which develop on the GFD. Weight gain and obesity have been added to the list of nutritional consequences while on the GFD and have been partially attributed to hypercaloric content of commercially available gluten-free foods. Follow-up of patients diagnosed with CD after starting the GFD has been reported to be irregular and, hence, less than ideal. CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring of the nutritional status using blood tests and use of appropriate gluten-free supplementation are integral components in the management of CD. The ideal GFD should be nutrient-dense with naturally gluten-free foods, balanced with macro- and micronutrients, reasonably priced, and easily accessible. Rotation of the pseudo-cereals provides a good source of complex carbohydrates, protein, fiber, fatty acids, vitamins and minerals. Fortification/enrichment of commonly consumed gluten-free commercial grain products should be encouraged. Dietitians specializing in CD play a critical role in the education and maintenance of the GFD for patients with CD.

34504037	IgA Nephropathy as the Initial Presentation of Celiac Disease in an Adolescent.	Immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy (Berger's disease) is the most common glomerulonephritis worldwide. The disease typically is chronic and lifelong and eventually progresses to impaired renal function in a substantial proportion of cases. It has been known for some time that there is a correlation between IgA nephropathy and celiac disease, but until now it has remained unclear whether treatment of the underlying celiac disease has any meaningful impact on the progression of the renal disease. Therefore, until now, screening for celiac disease in patients presenting with IgA nephropathy has not been universally recommended in the absence of suggestive gastrointestinal symptoms. This report describes a case of IgA nephropathy in an adolescent boy that turned out to be the initial presentation of celiac disease. More importantly, it documents the complete laboratory normalization of his renal anomalies at 5-year follow-up after treatment of his celiac disease with implementation of a gluten-free diet. This case highlights the importance of awareness that suspected IgA nephropathy, even in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms, should prompt screening for underlying celiac disease as a potential, and possibly treatable, cause.
29633011	Gluten-free-rendered products contribute to imbalanced diets in children and adolescents with celiac disease.	PURPOSE: As well as adhering to the safe limit for gluten intake, a suitable gluten-free (GF) diet must also be nutritionally balanced. However, malnutrition has been observed in the population with celiac disease (CD). This is even more important in the case of children and adolescents, whose GF diet must also ensure their proper growth. The aim of the present study was to assess the diet quality of children and adolescents with CD to attain optimal nutritional status, determining the most relevant factors that affect a balanced diet. METHODS: Eighty-three children and adolescents with CD (9.2 +- 3.8 years) took part in the study. Height, weight and body composition were measured. An analysis of energy consumption and of the macronutrient distribution of their diet was carried out. Adherence to Mediterranean diet by KIDMED index was analyzed, and energy and nutrients intake. RESULTS: The diet of participants was not balanced, containing more fat and less carbohydrate than recommended. Most children and adolescents revealed adequate body mass index and suitable body fat percentage. Two-thirds of them showed moderate or poor KIDMED index, the case of girls being remarkable. When the GF diet, containing GF-rendered foodstuffs, was compared to a similar type of diet but substituting GF products with their analogs containing gluten, important nutritional differences were revealed. CONCLUSIONS: Even though celiac children and adolescents' diet is unhealthy due to its inappropriate dietary pattern, following a diet based on GF products raises extra difficulty in complying with the nutritional recommendations.
25586081	Idiopathic pulmonary haemosiderosis with celiac disease (Lane-Hamilton syndrome) in an adult - a case report.	Idiopathic pulmonary haemosiderosis (IPH) is a rare disorder of unknown cause characterised by haemoptysis, diffuse alveolar infiltrates and iron-deficiency anaemia. IPH predominantly affects children; it is rare in adults, in whom it usually manifests before 30 years. In adults, course is protracted with a better prognosis, in contrast to children. Even rarer is the Lane-Hamilton syndrome, a condition in which IPH is associated with celiac disease. Only 15 cases of Lane-Hamilton syndrome affecting adults are reported in literature. Treatment of IPH is based on anecdotal case reports and case series because of its rare occurrence. High-dose steroids reportedly reduce morbidity and mortality and delays or stops disease progression; more effectively in adults than children. In Lane-Hamilton syndrome, a gluten-free diet for the celiac disease in addition to steroids for IPH, is the mainstay of therapy. The optimal treatment duration of steroid therapy is not known but anecdotally a more prolonged course results in improved outcome. We report a case of a young woman who presented with exertional dyspnoea, intermittent haemoptysis, severe anaemia and lung infiltrates but no gastrointestinal complaints. After extensive work-up, she was diagnosed with Lane-Hamilton syndrome based on a diagnosis of IPH made from lung biopsy and concomitant celiac disease because of positive anti-gliadin antibody and endomyosial antibody and jejunal biopsy. She was treated with sustained low-dose steroid therapy for a year and a gluten-free diet with resolution of her symptoms, anaemia and lung infiltrates. At 4 years of follow-up, she remains stable, without recurrence. 
27869798	Gluten-induced symptoms in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome are associated with increased myosin light chain kinase activity and claudin-15 expression.	The mechanisms underlying diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) are poorly understood, but increased intestinal permeability is thought to contribute to symptoms. A recent clinical trial of gluten-free diet (GFD) demonstrated symptomatic improvement, relative to gluten-containing diet (GCD), which was associated with reduced intestinal permeability in non-celiac disease IBS-D patients. The aim of this study was to characterize intestinal epithelial tight junction composition in IBS-D before and after dietary gluten challenge. Biopsies from 27 IBS-D patients (13 GFD and 14 GCD) were examined by H&E staining and semiquantitative immunohistochemistry for phosphorylated myosin II regulatory light chain (MLC), MLC kinase, claudin-2, claudin-8 and claudin-15. Diet-induced changes were assessed and correlated with urinary mannitol excretion (after oral administration). In the small intestine, epithelial MLC phosphorylation was increased or decreased by GCD or GFD, respectively, and this correlated with increased intestinal permeability (P<0.03). Colonocyte expression of the paracellular Na+ channel claudin-15 was also markedly augmented following GCD challenge (P<0.05). Conversely, colonic claudin-2 expression correlated with reduced intestinal permeability (P<0.03). Claudin-8 expression was not affected by dietary challenge. These data show that alterations in MLC phosphorylation and claudin-15 and claudin-2 expression are associated with gluten-induced symptomatology and intestinal permeability changes in IBS-D. The results provide new insight into IBS-D mechanisms and can explain permeability responses to gluten challenge in these patients.
20717130	Celiac disease and obesity: need for nutritional follow-up after diagnosis.	More than 20 years of serological approach to diagnosis of celiac disease (CD) has deeply changed the classical clinical presentation of the disease, and some reports indicate that CD and obesity can coexist in both childhood and adolescence. We reviewed clinical records of 149 children with CD followed in our institution between 1991 and 2007, considering weight, height and body mass index (BMI), both at diagnosis and after at least 12 months of gluten-free diet (GFD). In all, 11% of patients had BMI z-score >+1 and 3% were obese (z-score >+2) at presentation. In our population, there was a significant (P=0.008) increase in BMI z-score after GFD and the percentage of overweight (z-score >+1) subjects almost doubled (11 vs 21%, P=0.03). Our data suggest the need for a careful follow-up of nutritional status after diagnosis of CD, especially addressing those who are already overweight at presentation.
24185592	Improving the stability and activity of oral therapeutic enzymes-recent advances and perspectives.	Exogenous, orally-administered enzymes are currently in clinical use or under development for the treatment of pathologies, such as celiac disease and phenylketonuria. However, the administration of therapeutic enzymes via the oral route remains challenging due to potential inactivation of these fragile macromolecular entities in the harsh environment of the gastrointestinal tract. Enzymes are particularly sensitive because both proteolysis and unfolding can lead to their inactivation. Current efforts to overcome these shortcomings involve the application of gastro-resistant delivery systems and the modification of enzyme structures by polymer conjugation or protein engineering. This perspective manuscript reviews and critically discusses recent progress in the oral delivery of therapeutic enzymes, whose substrate is localized in the gastrointestinal tract. 
39125372	Compliance and Attitudes towards the Gluten-Free Diet in Celiac Patients in Italy: What Has Changed after a Decade?	This study aims were (i) to describe Italian celiac patients who agreed to participate in the latest web survey and their attitudes toward the GF diet (compliance, perceived limitations, and worries) and (ii) to compare the answers given by the 2011 and 2022 responders. The self-administered questionnaire was distributed through the Italian Coeliac Association channels (link on social media, websites, and newsletters) to all of the celiac patients willing to participate in 2011 and 2022 (2427 and 3529 responders who answered the same questions, respectively). Descriptive analyses and the Pearson's chi-squared test were performed. The responders were 1 to 84 years old and mainly female. The prevalence of adherent patients in 2022 was 91%, with the highest value (94%) in children (<=10 years old) and adolescents (15-17 years old). Overall, young adults were the most worried group. About a decade after the first survey, we observed a decreasing prevalence of transgression events (-5%) and (at least) occasional temptation (-17%), a decreasing prevalence of health-related and general worries, but an increasing prevalence of social life withdrawal. In conclusion, it is important to periodically monitor celiac patients' compliance and attitudes towards the gluten-free diet. As also highlighted in international guidelines, a reorganization of the diagnosis/follow-up visits, including an expert dietary consultation, is needed.
38842717	Evaluation of Hearing Functions in Children with Celiac Disease and the Effect of Gluten-free Diet on these Functions.	OBJECTIVE: The present study aims to investigate the potential impact of celiac disease (CD) on hearing functions and assess the effect of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on this condition. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 55 children with CD (110 ears) and 25 healthy controls (50 ears) matched for age and gender. The CD group was divided into adherent (n = 31) and nonadherent (n = 24) to GFD. Participants underwent tympanometry and pure tone audiometry assessments covering frequencies from 500 to 4000 Hz. RESULTS: Patients with CD showed significantly higher air and bone conduction hearing averages compared to the control group at frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz for air conduction, and at 500 Hz for bone conduction (P < 0.05). Celiac patients, those who fully adhered to GFD, had notably higher air conduction hearing averages at 500, 2000, and 4000 Hz compared to healthy controls (P < 0.05). However, there was no difference in bone conduction hearing averages between the two groups. In contrast, celiac patients who did not comply with GFD had statistically significantly higher air and bone conduction hearing averages than the control group (P < 0.05), at frequencies of 500, 1000, and 4000 Hz for air conduction, and at 500 and 1000 Hz for bone conduction (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that nonadherence to GFD may elevate the risk of hearing loss in children with CD. As a result, it is recommended to conduct hearing screenings for children with CD and underscore the importance of complying with GFD to mitigate further detrimental effects on hearing functions.
32692806	Negative predictive value of the repeated absence of gluten immunogenic peptides in the urine of treated celiac patients in predicting mucosal healing: new proposals for follow-up in celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: The treatment of celiac disease (CD) is a lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD). The current methods for monitoring GFD conformance, such as a dietary questionnaire or serology tests, may be inaccurate in detecting dietary transgressions, and duodenal biopsies are invasive, expensive, and not a routine monitoring technique. OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to determine the clinical usefulness of urine gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) as a biomarker monitoring GFD adherence in celiac patients and to evaluate the concordance of the results with the degree of mucosal damage. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted involving 22 de novo CD patients, 77 celiac patients consuming a GFD, and 13 nonceliac subjects. On 3 d of the week, urine samples were collected and the GIP concentrations were tested. Simultaneously, anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies, questionnaire results, clinical manifestations, and histological findings were analyzed. RESULTS: Approximately 24% (18 of 76) of the celiac patients consuming a GFD exhibited Marsh II-III mucosal damage. Among this population, 94% (17 of 18) had detectable urine GIP; however, between 60% and 80% were asymptomatic and exhibited negative serology and appropriate GFD adherence based on the questionnaire. In contrast, 97% (31 of 32) of the celiac patients without duodenal damage had no detectable GIP. These results demonstrated the high sensitivity (94%) and negative predictive value (97%) of GIP measurements in relation to duodenal biopsy findings. In the de novo CD-diagnosed cohort, 82% (18 of 22) of patients had measurable amounts of GIP in the urine. CONCLUSIONS: Determining GIP concentrations in several urine samples may be an especially convenient approach to assess recent gluten exposure in celiac patients and appears to accurately predict the absence of histological lesions. The introduction of GIP testing as an assessment technique for GFD adherence may help in ascertaining dietary compliance and to target the most suitable intervention during follow-up.
31611125	Familial Celiac Disease Remission as a Result of a Full Donor Immunologic Recovery After Sibling Cord Blood Transplantation for Chronic Granulomatous Disease: A Case Report.	We present a case report of a boy diagnosed with both chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) and familial celiac disease (CD) who underwent cord blood transplantation from a partially matched sibling donor. The presentation of CD resembled Crohn-like enteropathy, which is a canonical manifestation of CGD. Nearly 1 year post-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), a gluten-containing diet was reintroduced, and no reappearance of clinical, serologic, or histologic markers of CD was observed. The relatively high incidence of rare genetic diseases in pediatric patients suggests the need for additional caution in the interpretation of symptoms mimicking already known hallmarks of more common conditions. In addition, the presented data confirm the previous rare observations that allogeneic HSCT leads to durable induction of gluten tolerance in patients with CD, which can warrant its use in patients with refractory subtypes of CD.
26557006	Role of oats in celiac disease.	A gluten-free diet is currently the only effective means of treating individuals with celiac disease. Such a diet enables celiac patients to control their symptoms and avoid various complications associated with this condition. However, while the quality of gluten-free foods has significantly improved during recent decades, maintenance of a gluten-free diet does not necessarily ensure adequate nutritional intake. Because oats are an important source of proteins, lipids, vitamins, minerals, and fibre, their inclusion in a gluten-free diet might improve the nutritional status of a celiac patient. Although oats are included in the list of gluten-free ingredients specified in European regulations, their safety when consumed by celiac patients remains debatable. Some studies claim that pure oats are safe for most celiac people, and contamination with other cereal sources is the main problem facing people with this disease. However, it is necessary to consider that oats include many varieties, containing various amino acid sequences and showing different immunoreactivities associated with toxic prolamins. As a result, several studies have shown that the immunogenicity of oats varies depending on the cultivar consumed. Thus, it is essential to thoroughly study the variety of oats used in a food ingredient before including it in a gluten-free diet. 
28644353	Extraintestinal Manifestations of Celiac Disease: Effectiveness of the Gluten-Free Diet.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the gluten-free diet (GFD) on extraintestinal symptoms in pediatric and adult celiac populations at the University of Chicago. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of the University of Chicago Celiac Center clinic charts from January 2002 to October 2014. Demographics, serologic testing, intestinal biopsies, and extraintestinal symptoms at presentation, 12, 24, and >24 months were recorded. Extraintestinal symptoms included abnormal liver enzymes, arthralgia/arthritis, dermatitis herpetiformis, alopecia, fatigue, headache, anemia, stomatitis, myalgias, psychiatric disorders, rashes, seizures, neuropathy, short stature, delayed puberty, osteoporosis, and infertility. RESULTS: A total of 737 patients with biopsy-confirmed celiac disease or skin biopsy-confirmed dermatitis herpetiformis were included. Patients lost to follow-up, or with insufficient data were excluded leaving 328 patients (157 pediatrics younger than 18 years). For pediatrics, the female to male ratio was 2:1 and the mean age at diagnosis was 8.9 years. For adults, 4:1 and 40.6 years old. Extraintestinal symptom rates were similar in children (60%) and adults (62%). Short stature (33%), fatigue (28%), and headache (20%) were most common in children. Iron deficiency anemia (48%), fatigue (37%), and headache/psychiatric disorders (24%) were common in adults. Children had faster/higher rates of symptom resolution compared with adults. Twenty-eight percent of children with unresolved short stature on a GFD were found to have other comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: Children and adults with celiac disease have similar rates of extraintestinal manifestations. In children short stature, fatigue, and headache were most common, whereas anemia, fatigue, and headache/psychiatric disorders were most common in adults. Children on a strict GFD showed faster and higher rates of symptom resolution as compared to adults. Unresponsive children with short stature must be assessed for comorbidities.
38453268	A Low-Protein, Plant-Dominant Gluten-Free Diet for Immunoglobulin A Nephropathy and Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis.	Immunoglobulin A nephropathy is the most common glomerulonephritis syndrome in the world, yet there is currently no cure. While blood pressure control, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition, and immunosuppression may slow disease progression, low-protein diets, defined as a daily dietary protein intake of 0.6 to 0.8 g/kg body weight, may also decrease immune complex deposition and disease severity, as evidenced in animal models. The link between secondary immunoglobulin A nephropathy and celiac disease has also led to the rise of gluten-free diets and zinc supplementation as potential lifestyle modifications to help manage common immunoglobulin A nephropathy symptoms such as proteinuria and hematuria. In addition, case reports and prospective studies suggest that patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, which manifests as steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome may also benefit from a gluten-free diet. We highlight the example of a gluten-free, plant-dominant low-protein diet (a different type of low-protein diet that addresses both protein quantity and quality) for patients with immunoglobulin A nephropathy or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.
33999573	The effect of gluten on skin and hair: a systematic review.	Non-celiac gluten sensitivity is often clinically indistinguishable from celiac disease, and patients show improvement or resolution of their symptoms with a gluten-free diet. In contrast to celiac disease, the effects of gluten on the skin and hair in the context of non-celiac gluten sensitivity are not as clear. This review aims to describe the impact of gluten on the skin and hair in patients with non-celiac gluten sensitivity and those without a definitive celiac disease diagnosis. A literature search was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) reporting guidelines for systematic reviews. Forty-two publications met inclusion criteria with five studies describing the skin manifestations of non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Trials identifying the impact of a gluten-free diet on skin disease, as well as dermatologic conditions and their associations with antigliadin antibodies were also identified. Dermatologic manifestations in patients with non-celiac gluten sensitivity vary and may be non-specific. It may be appropriate for some of these patients with skin manifestations to trial a gluten-free diet. Dermatologic conditions that may respond positively to a gluten-free diet include psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, vitiligo, and palmoplantar pustulosis, while linear IgA disease does not appear to improve with this dietary change.
37473709	The emerging paradigm of Unconventional T cells as a novel therapeutic target for celiac disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is an organ-specific autoimmune disorder that occurs in genetically predisposed individuals when exposed to exogenous dietary gluten. This exposure to wheat gluten and related proteins from rye and barley triggers an immune response which leads to the development of enteropathy associated with symptoms of bloating, diarrhea, or malabsorption. The sole current treatment is to follow a gluten-free diet for the rest of one's life. Intestinal barriers are enriched with Unconventional T cells such as iNKT, MAIT, and gammadelta T cells, which lack or express only a limited range of rearranged antigen receptors. Unconventional T cells play a crucial role in regulating mucosal barrier function and microbial colonization. Unconventional T cell populations are widely represented in diseased conditions, where changes in disease activity related to iNKT and MAIT cell reduction, as well as gammadelta T cell expansion, are demonstrated. In this review, we discuss the role and potential employment of Unconventional T cells as a therapeutic target in the pathophysiology of celiac disease.
30711203	Celiac Disease in Asia.	Celiac disease, once thought to be very uncommon in Asia, is now emerging in many Asian countries. Although the absolute number of patients with celiac disease at present is not very high, this number is expected to increase markedly over the next few years/decades owing to increasing awareness. It is now that the medical community across the Asia should define the extent of the problem and prepare to handle the impending epidemic of celiac disease in Asia.
34495279	The role of probiotics in the immune response and intestinal microbiota of children with celiac disease: a systematic review.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate changes in peripheral immunological response (decrease in blood proinflammatory cytokines) and fecal microbiota (especially Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes) after administration of probiotics in children with celiac disease on a gluten-free diet. DATA SOURCE: The databases MEDLINE, LILACS, Springer and SciELO were used for this review, with the descriptors "celiac disease AND probiotics". At the end of the search, 168 articles were retrieved, four of which were included in the final qualitative synthesis, having as inclusion criteria randomized clinical trials and pediatric population (1-19 years) and, as exclusion criteria, interventions other than probiotics, studies with patients with other diseases associated with celiac disease, or patients who did not meet the diagnostic criteria. All elected studies were published until September 2020, without language restriction, with patients receiving strains of Bifidobacterium breve or B. longum and on a gluten-free diet. DATA SYNTHESIS: The studies show that the administration of probiotics along with a gluten-free diet, can approximate the fecal microbiota of celiac patients to typical conditions of healthy individuals, by restoring the abundance of some microbial communities that characterize the typical physiological condition. In addition, the administration of probiotics can reduce serum proinflammatory cytokines (mainly TNF-alpha). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the positive correlation between probiotics and fecal microbiota/serological markers in pediatric patients with celiac disease, we emphasize the need for future multicentric studies that should include a larger number of patients and a longer follow up period.
33418957	Influence of Ultra-Processed Foods Consumption on Redox Status and Inflammatory Signaling in Young Celiac Patients.	The current study was designed to assess the influence of consumption of ultra-processed (UPF) on oxidative/antioxidant balance and evoked inflammatory signaling in young patients with celiac disease (CD). The study included 85 children. The celiac group (n = 53) included children with CD with a long (>18 months, n = 17) or recent (<18 months, n = 36) adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). The control group (n = 32) included healthy children with a significantly higher consumption of UPF compared to the control group, both expressed as kcal/day (p = 0.043) and as percentage of daily energy intake (p = 0.023). Among children with CD, the group with the lowest consumption of UPF (below the 50% of daily energy intake) had a greater Mediterranean diet (MD) adherence and higher moderate physical activity levels. In addition, CD children with the lowest consumption of UPF had healthier redox (lower soluble superoxide dismutase-1 and 15-F2t-isoprostanes) and inflammatory profiles (lower macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha) compared to the group with the highest consumption of UPF (all, p < 0.05) regardless of the time on a GFD. These findings highlight the importance of a correct monitoring of the GFD. An unbalanced GFD with high consumption of UPF and an unhealthy pattern with less physical activity and worse adherence to MD results in a worse inflammatory profile, which could act as a parallel pathway that could have important consequences on the pathophysiology of the disease.
36300634	Liver abnormalities in celiac disease and response to gluten free diet: A systematic review and meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: Liver involvement in celiac disease (CeD) is known but its various etiologies and the effect of gluten free diet (GFD) on it is understudied. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Medline and Embase databases from date of inception to March 7, 2022, to look for studies reporting on CeD and liver abnormalities. Pooled proportion of CeD patients with deranged transaminases, etiologies of various other liver diseases with CeD and the response to GFD were estimated. Subgroup analyses based on the age group, geographic distribution and duration of GFD were also carried out. RESULTS: Total 42 studies (8976 patients) reported hyper-transaminasemia in patients with celiac disease. The pooled proportion of patients with elevated transaminases was 21.42% (95% CI: 17.02-26.59, I2  = 94%) overall, with similar prevalence among adults (21.20%) and children (21.51%). The commonest etiology was celiac hepatitis at 49.23% (95% CI: 30.09-68.59, I2  = 87%). Compliance with GFD was noted in 90.27%. The proportion of CeD patients with liver abnormalities who showed response to GFD was 86.39% (95% CI: 80.04-90.95, I2  = 74%) overall. CONCLUSION: Liver involvement was noted in 21.42% of CeD patients. Celiac hepatitis was reported in nearly half of them. Good compliance and response were noted with GFD.
28891139	Helicobacter pylori infection in children.	Helicobacter pylori infection in children differs from that in adults, from the point of view of epidemiology, host response, clinical features, related diseases, and diagnosis, as well as treatment strategies. The prevalence of H. pylori infection, in both children and adults, is decreasing in the Western World as well as in some developing countries, which contrasts with the increase in childhood asthma and allergic diseases. Recurrent abdominal pain is not specific during H. pylori infection in children. The role of H. pylori infection and failure to thrive, children's growth, type I diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and celiac disease remains controversial. The main initial diagnosis is based on upper digestive endoscopy with biopsy-based methods. Nodular gastritis may be a pathognomonic endoscopic finding of childhood H. pylori infection. The infection eradication control is based on validated noninvasive tests. The main cause of treatment failure of H. pylori infection is its clarithromycin resistance. We recommend standard antibiotic susceptibility testing of H. pylori in pediatric patients prior to the initiation of eradication therapy. H. pylori treatment in children should be based on an evaluation of the rate of eradication in the local population, a systematic use of a treatment adapted to the susceptibility profile and a treatment compliance greater than 90%. The last meta-analysis in children did not show an advantage for sequential therapy when compared to a 14-day triple therapy. Finally, the high rate of antibiotic resistance responsible for therapy failure in recent years justifies the necessity of a novel vaccine to prevent H. pylori infection in children.
30445688	A Retrospective Study on Dietary FODMAP Intake in Celiac Patients Following a Gluten-Free Diet.	Our aim was to evaluate the intake of foods containing fermentable oligo/di/mono-saccharides and polyols (FODMAP) as a possible factor that induces gastrointestinal symptoms in treated celiac disease (CD) patients. We collected seven-day weighed food records for 104 CD patients and 91 healthy volunteers. All evaluated food items were from sources with high and low content of FODMAP, which were divided into cereals and sweets, sweeteners and soft drinks, fruits, dried fruits, and vegetables. Nutrient intake was calculated using the food database of the European Institute of Oncology. The symptoms reported were assessed by a Rome IV Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) diagnostic questionnaire and by specific questions for the evaluation of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). The 12% of CD patients met IBS symptoms criteria as opposed to 6% of controls (p = 0.09) and 27% of patients reported FGIDs symptoms vs. 22% of healthy controls (p = 0.42). The intake by CD patients was significantly higher than healthy volunteers for: sweeteners and sugars with low content of FODMAP (p = 0.0007), fruits, dried fruits, and vegetables high in FODMAP (p = 0.003) and low in FODMAP (p = 0.04) when compared to controls. CD patients had a lower intake of cereals and sweets with a high content of FODMAP (p = 0.00001). Healthy volunteers consumed significantly higher alcoholic beverages and fats high in FODMAP (both p < 0.044). The mean daily intake of other food categories did not differ between both groups. Even though CD patients had a low intake of gluten-free cereals high in FODMAP, they still consumed a significant amount of fruits and vegetables high in FODMAP. The clinical effect of a concomitant gluten-free diet and low-FODMAP diet should be prospectively evaluated as a supportive therapy in CD patients.
26603931	Refractory celiac disease.	Refractory celiac disease (RCD) affects patients who have failed to heal after 6-12 months of a strict gluten-free diet (GFD) and when other causes of symptoms (including malignancy) have been ruled out. It may also occur in patients who previously had responded to a long-term GFD. RCD may be categorized as RCD1 (normal immunophenotype) and RCD2 (aberrant immunophenotype). RCD1 usually responds to a continued GFD, nutritional support, and therapeutic agents such as corticosteroids. In contrast, clinical response in RCD2 is incomplete and prognosis is often poor. RCD (particularly RCD2) is associated with serious complications, such as ulcerative jejunitis and enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL). Strict clinical and laboratory criteria should be used to diagnose RCD and specialized tests for aberrancy and clonality should be interpreted in the context of their sensitivity and specificity. Adequate nutritional support and anti-inflammatory treatment may even allow patients with RCD2 to attain a clinical remission. 
21970944	Vitamin D and K status influences bone mineral density and bone accrual in children and adolescents with celiac disease.	BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Children with celiac disease (CD) are at risk for decreased bone mineral density (BMD) because of fat-soluble vitamin malabsorption, inflammation and/or under-nutrition. The study objective was to determine the interrelationships between vitamin K/D status and lifestyle variables on BMD in children and adolescents with CD at diagnosis and after 1 year on the gluten-free diet (GFD). SUBJECTS/METHODS: Children and adolescents aged 3-17 years with biopsy proven CD at diagnosis and after 1 year on the GFD were studied. BMD was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Relevant variables included: anthropometrics, vitamin D/K status, diet, physical activity and sunlight exposure. RESULTS: Whole-body and lumbar-spine BMD-z scores were low (< or = -1) at diagnosis (10-20%) and after 1 year (30-32%) in the children, independent of symptoms. Whole-body BMD-z scores (-0.55+-0.7 versus 0.72+-1.5) and serum levels of 25(OH) vitamin D (90.3+-24.8 versus 70.5+-19.8 nmol/l) were significantly lower in older children (>10 years) when compared with younger children (< or =10 years) (P<0.001). Forty-three percent had suboptimal vitamin D status (25(OH)-vitamin D <75 nmol/l) at diagnosis; resolving in nearly half after 1 year on the GFD. Twenty-five percent had suboptimal vitamin K status at diagnosis; all resolved after 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: Children and adolescents with CD are at risk for suboptimal bone health at time of diagnosis and after 1 year on GFD; likely due in part to suboptimal vitamin D/K status. Therapeutic strategies aimed at optimizing vitamin K/D intake may contribute to improved BMD in children with CD.
34481955	Patients' Risk Tolerance for Non-Dietary Therapies in Celiac Disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder mediated by an immune response to dietary gluten that affects the small intestine and leads to inflammation, malabsorption, and systemic consequences.1 The only established therapy is strict adherence to a gluten-free diet.2,3 Recently there has been growth in the development of novel non-dietary therapies for patients with CD,4 which are driven by dissatisfaction with the burden of the gluten-free diet.5,6.
35796297	Elevated interleukin-17A levels despite reduced microRNA-326 gene expression in celiac disease patients under gluten-free diet.	Introduction: The microRNA-326 (miR-326) gene, by targeting ETS Proto-Oncogene 1 (ETS1), regulates the differentiation and interleukin-17A production of T helper 17 (Th17) cells. Celiac disease (CD) is an intestinal autoimmune disorder, in which the cascade of Th17 cells plays an important role in its pathogenicity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression changes of miR-326 and its two target genes ETS1 and IL-17A in celiac disease patients under a gluten-free diet (GFD). We expected the expression of miR-326 and IL-17A gene to decrease, and the expression of the ETS1 gene to increase, following the adherence to GFD. Methods: Peripheral blood samples of 40 CD patients under GFD (for more than 1 year) and 40 healthy individuals were collected. RNA was extracted, cDNA was synthesized and the miR-326, ETS1 and IL-17A gene expressions were evaluated by the quantitative polymerase real-time qPCR method. P-value   0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Although miR-326 mRNA expression was significantly lower in CD patients (P = 0.001), no significant difference was observed in ETS1 mRNA level between the two groups (P = 0.54), but IL-17A was significantly overexpressed in CD patients (P=0.002). No significant correlation was observed between the expression of the studied genes and the patients' symptoms and Marsh classification. Conclusion:Adherence to the GFD for one to two years did not have the expected effect on the expression of genes in this panel. The most important finding that contradicted our hypothesis was the observation of high IL-17A levels in CD patients despite dieting, which may be related to the protective effect of this cytokine on intestinal tight junctions, which needs to be confirmed in further studies.
26309349	Iron deficiency anemia in celiac disease.	Iron is an important micronutrient that may be depleted in celiac disease. Iron deficiency and anemia may complicate well-established celiac disease, but may also be the presenting clinical feature in the absence of diarrhea or weight loss. If iron deficiency anemia occurs, it should be thoroughly evaluated, even if celiac disease has been defined since other superimposed causes of iron deficiency anemia may be present. Most often, impaired duodenal mucosal uptake of iron is evident since surface absorptive area in the duodenum is reduced, in large part, because celiac disease is an immune-mediated disorder largely focused in the proximal small intestinal mucosa. Some studies have also suggested that blood loss may occur in celiac disease, sometimes from superimposed small intestinal disorders, including ulceration or neoplastic diseases, particularly lymphoma. In addition, other associated gastric or colonic disorders may be responsible for blood loss. Rarely, an immune-mediated hemolytic disorder with increased urine iron loss may occur that may respond to a gluten-free diet. Reduced expression of different regulatory proteins critical in iron uptake has also been defined in the presence and absence of anemia. Finally, other rare causes of microcytic anemia may occur in celiac disease, including a sideroblastic form of anemia reported to have responded to a gluten-free diet. 
28755266	Latiglutenase Improves Symptoms in Seropositive Celiac Disease Patients While on a Gluten-Free Diet.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Celiac disease (CD) is a widespread condition triggered by dietary gluten and treated with a lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD); however, inadvertent exposure to gluten can result in episodic symptoms. A previous trial of latiglutenase (clinicaltrials.gov; NCT01917630), an orally administered mixture of two recombinant gluten-specific proteases, was undertaken in symptomatic subjects with persistent injury. The primary endpoint for histologic improvement was not met, presumably due to a trial effect. In this post hoc analysis, we investigated the efficacy of latiglutenase for reducing symptoms in subgroups of the study participants based on their seropositivity. METHODS: The study involved symptomatic CD patients following a GFD for at least one year prior to randomization. Patients were treated for 12 weeks with latiglutenase or placebo. Of 398 completed patients, 173 (43%) were seropositive at baseline. Symptoms were recorded daily, and weekly symptom scores were compiled. p values were calculated by analysis of covariance. RESULTS: A statistically significant, dose-dependent reduction was detected in the severity and frequency of symptoms in seropositive but not seronegative patients. The severity of abdominal pain and bloating was reduced by 58 and 44%, respectively, in the cohort receiving the highest latiglutenase dose (900 mg, n = 14) relative to placebo (n = 54). Symptom improvement increased from week 6 to week 12. There was also a trend toward greater symptom improvement with greater baseline symptom severity. CONCLUSIONS: Seropositive CD patients show symptomatic improvement from latiglutenase taken with meals and would benefit from the availability of this treatment.
22539236	Type 1 diabetes and celiac disease in adults: glycemic control and diabetic complications.	The prevalence of celiac disease (CD) in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is 4.5 %. Objective of the study is to investigate (1) the course of glycemic control at CD diagnosis and after the initiation of a gluten-free diet (GFD) in T1DM patients; (2) the prevalence of diabetic complications in T1DM patients with adult onset of CD. In 20 hospitals in the Netherlands, we identified T1DM patients diagnosed with CD at adult age. We retrospectively collected glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels before CD diagnosis, at CD diagnosis, and the most recent HbA1c levels as well as the presence of nephropathy and retinopathy. The control group consisted of patients with T1DM and negative CD serology matched for age, gender, T1DM duration, and HbA1c levels. Thirty-one patients were eligible with a median duration of T1DM and CD of 27 years (IQR 14-37) and 3 years (IQR 1-8), respectively. The matched control group consisted of 46 patients. HbA1c levels at the moment of CD diagnosis were 7.5 % (IQR 7.1-8) [58 mmol/mol] and at the most recent visit 7.4 % (IQR 6.9-7.9, P = 0.15) [57 mmol/mol] indicating no difference. Prevalence of retinopathy was lower in T1DM + CD group compared with controls, (38.7 vs 67.4 %, P < 0.05), whereas no difference in the prevalence of nephropathy was found between the groups (P = 0.09). In conclusion, T1DM + CD patients have less retinopathy compared to T1DM patients without CD. A GFD possibly favorable affects the development of vascular complications in T1DM patients.
24201240	Long-term consumption of oats in adult celiac disease patients.	Many celiac disease patients tolerate oats, but limited data are available on its long-term consumption. This was evaluated in the present study, focusing on small-bowel mucosal histology and gastrointestinal symptoms in celiac adults maintaining a strict gluten-free diet with or without oats. Altogether 106 long-term treated celiac adults were enrolled for this cross-sectional follow-up study. Daily consumption of oats and fiber was assessed, and small-bowel mucosal morphology and densities of CD3+, alphabeta+ and gammasigma+ intraepithelial lymphocytes determined. Gastrointestinal symptoms were assessed by a validated Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale questionnaire. Seventy (66%) out of the 106 treated celiac disease patients had consumed a median of 20 g of oats (range 1-100 g) per day for up to eight years; all consumed oat products bought from general stores. Daily intake and long-term consumption of oats did not result in small-bowel mucosal villous damage, inflammation, or gastrointestinal symptoms. Oat-consumers had a significantly higher daily intake of fiber than those who did not use oats. Two thirds of celiac disease patients preferred to use oats in their daily diet. Even long-term ingestion of oats had no harmful effects. 
33346700	Circulating PV-1 as a marker of celiac disease-associated liver injury.	Aim: To investigate the role of endothelial PV-1 in patients with untreated celiac disease (CD)-associated liver injury. Materials & methods: PV-1 and PV-1 mRNA were measured in intestinal biopsies from untreated CD patients with elevated or normal alanine transaminase levels, controls, patients with inflammatory bowel disease and patients with toxic liver injury. Circulating PV-1 levels were also evaluated. Results: Circulating PV-1 levels were significantly increased in the serum of patients with CD-associated liver injury and reverted to normal following a gluten-free diet. Mucosal PV-1 and PV-1 mRNA were no different in patients with CD-associated liver injury. Conclusion: Serum but not mucosal PV-1 represents a marker of gluten-dependent liver injury and response to a gluten-free diet in patients with untreated CD.

38670279	Past, Present, and Future of Noninvasive Tests to Assess Gluten Exposure, Celiac Disease Activity, and End-Organ Damage.	Although many biomarkers have been proposed, and several are in widespread clinical use, there is no single readout or combination of readouts that correlates tightly with gluten exposure, disease activity, or end-organ damage in treated patients with celiac disease. Challenges to developing and evaluating better biomarkers include significant interindividual variability-related to immune amplification of gluten exposure and how effects of immune activation are manifest. Furthermore, the current "gold standard" for assessment of end-organ damage, small intestinal biopsy, is itself highly imperfect, such that a marker that is a better reflection of the "ground truth" may indeed appear to perform poorly. The goal of this review was to analyze past and present efforts to establish robust noninvasive tools for monitoring treated patients with celiac disease and to highlight emerging tools that may prove to be useful in clinical practice.

28350935	Screening for Celiac Disease: Evidence Report and Systematic Review for the US Preventive Services Task Force.	Importance: Silent or subclinical celiac disease may result in potentially avoidable adverse health consequences. Objective: To review the evidence on benefits and harms of screening for celiac disease in asymptomatic adults, adolescents, and children 3 years and older for the US Preventive Services Task Force. Data Sources: Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, searched to June 14, 2016. Study Selection: Randomized clinical trials and cohort or case-control studies on clinical benefits and harms of screening vs no screening for celiac disease or treatment vs no treatment for screen-detected celiac disease; studies on diagnostic accuracy of serologic tests for celiac disease. Data Extraction and Synthesis: One investigator abstracted data, a second checked data for accuracy, and 2 investigators independently assessed study quality using predefined criteria. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cancer incidence, gastrointestinal outcomes, psychological outcomes, child growth outcomes, health outcomes resulting from nutritional deficiencies, quality of life, mortality, and harms of screening. No meta-analytic pooling was done. Results: One systematic review and 3 primary studies met inclusion criteria. No trials of screening for celiac disease were identified. One recent, good-quality systematic review of 56 original studies and 12 previous systematic reviews (sample sizes of primary studies ranging from 62 to more than 12 000 participants) found IgA tissue transglutaminase was associated with high accuracy (sensitivity and specificity both >90%) for diagnosing celiac disease. IgA endomysial antibodies tests were associated with high specificity. Only 2 studies of serologic tests for celiac disease involving 62 and 158 patients were conducted in asymptomatic populations and reported lower sensitivity (57% and 71%). One fair-quality, small (n = 40) Finnish treatment trial of asymptomatic adults with screen-detected celiac disease based on positive serologic findings found initiation of a gluten-free diet associated with small improvement in gastrointestinal symptoms compared with no gluten-free diet (difference less than 1 point on a scale of 1 to 7) at 1 year, with no differences on most measures of quality of life. No withdrawals due to adverse events occurred during the trial; no other harms were reported. No studies were identified that addressed the other outcomes. Conclusions and Relevance: Although some evidence was found regarding diagnostic accuracy of tests for celiac disease, little or no evidence was identified to inform most of the key questions related to benefits and harms of screening for celiac disease in asymptomatic individuals. More research is needed to understand the effectiveness of screening and treatment for celiac disease, accuracy of screening tests in asymptomatic persons, and optimal screening strategies.
24752841	Generation of food-grade recombinant Lactobacillus casei delivering Myxococcus xanthus prolyl endopeptidase.	Prolyl endopeptidases (PEP) (EC 3.4.21.26), a family of serine proteases with the ability to hydrolyze the peptide bond on the carboxyl side of an internal proline residue, are able to degrade immunotoxic peptides responsible for celiac disease (CD), such as a 33-residue gluten peptide (33-mer). Oral administration of PEP has been suggested as a potential therapeutic approach for CD, although delivery of the enzyme to the small intestine requires intrinsic gastric stability or advanced formulation technologies. We have engineered two food-grade Lactobacillus casei strains to deliver PEP in an in vitro model of small intestine environment. One strain secretes PEP into the extracellular medium, whereas the other retains PEP in the intracellular environment. The strain that secretes PEP into the extracellular medium is the most effective to degrade the 33-mer and is resistant to simulated gastrointestinal stress. Our results suggest that in the future, after more studies and clinical trials, an engineered food-grade Lactobacillus strain may be useful as a vector for in situ production of PEP in the upper small intestine of CD patients. 
25690004	Microvascular Complications in Childhood-Onset Type 1 Diabetes and Celiac Disease: A Multicenter Longitudinal Analysis of 56,514 Patients From the German-Austrian DPV Database.	OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether celiac disease (CD) associated with type 1 diabetes increases the risk of microvascular complications. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients (n = 56,514) aged >10 years with diabetes duration <20 years from 392 centers in Germany and Austria were assigned to one of three categories (n): no CD (50,933), biopsy-confirmed CD (812), or suspected CD (4,769; clinical diagnosis or positive antibodies). The confirmed and suspected groups were combined and analyzed for retinopathy or nephropathy. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to adjust for potential confounders (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c], age at diabetes onset, sex, smoking, dyslipidemia, and hypertension). RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that retinopathy and nephropathy occurred earlier in the presence versus absence of CD: retinopathy at age 26.7 years (95% CI 23.7-30.2) in 25% of patients with CD vs. age 33.7 years (33.2-34.4) in 25% without CD and microalbuminuria at age 32.8 years (29.7-42.5) vs. 42.4 years (41.4-43.3). The adjusted risk for both retinopathy (hazard ratio 1.263 [95% CI 1.078-1.481]) and nephropathy (1.359 [1.228-1.504]) was higher in patients with diabetes and CD versus those without CD. Cox regression revealed CD as an independent risk factor for microvascular complications after adjustment for confounders. CONCLUSIONS: CD is an independent risk factor for retinopathy and nephropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes. Our study therefore supports the recommendation for regular serologic testing for CD, even in the absence of clinical CD. Further prospective studies are required to investigate whether a gluten-free diet might reduce the risk of microvascular disorders in patients with diabetes and CD.
23619107	Cyclosporine-associated thrombotic microangiopathy and thrombocytopenia-associated multiple organ failure: a case successfully treated with therapeutic plasma exchange.	INTRODUCTION: Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is characterized by microvascular thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Previous studies have shown that cyclosporine (CsA) is associated with TMA but the number of reported cases is very limited. We describe a 13-year-old girl with CsA-associated TMA and thrombocytopenia-associated multiple organ failure (TAMOF). CASE REPORT: The patient was diagnosed with polyglandular deficiency syndrome and had a history of celiac disease, autoimmune thyroiditis, and diabetes mellitus type I. CsA was started 7 months before her admission to our pediatric intensive care unit for persistent diarrhea associated with celiac disease. At the time of her admission to our pediatric intensive care unit, she was thrombocytopenic and anemic with multiple organ failure. Laboratory and clinical findings were consistent with TMA and TAMOF. CsA was discontinued and therapeutic plasma exchange was performed daily for 5 days. The patient improved clinically, laboratory findings normalized, and TMA and multiple organ failure dissolved. CONCLUSION: This case report indicates that therapeutic plasma exchange may be effective in the treatment of CsA-associated TMA and TAMOF, especially in the presence of systemic findings.
27767940	Children With Celiac Disease: Health-Related Quality of Life and Leisure Participation.	OBJECTIVE: We compared health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) perceptions of children with celiac disease (CD) with those of their parents to determine whether their leisure participation differs from that of children without CD and whether relationships exist between leisure participation and HRQOL. METHOD: Children with CD and their parents completed a disease-specific HRQOL self-report questionnaire, the Celiac Disease DUX. These children and matched controls without CD completed the Children's Leisure Assessment Scale (CLASS). RESULTS: Parents perceived HRQOL significantly more negatively than did children. No significant group differences were found in leisure participation. However, specific CLASS food-related activities and HRQOL significantly correlated. CONCLUSION: Hearing the child's voice in addition to the parents' is important in determining the HRQOL of children with a chronic condition. Findings contribute to understanding of CD in the context of participation and well-being and can lead to development of occupational performance-based assessments and interventions for children with CD.
39125299	Importance of an Ongoing Nutritional Counselling Intervention on Eating Habits of Newly Diagnosed Children with Celiac Disease.	A strict lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD) is the current treatment for the management of celiac disease (CD). Several studies have demonstrated that without proper dietary assessment, this diet leads to nutritional deficiencies and/or imbalances. The present study aimed to improve the dietary habits of newly diagnosed children with CD through ongoing and face-to-face dietary counseling. Forty-three participants were followed during the first year after CD diagnosis. Dietary data were collected at diagnosis (Vt0), after 3 months on a GFD (Vt3), and after 1 year following a GFD (Vt12). Participants completed a 3-day 24-h food recall, a food frequency questionnaire, and the KIDMED index. After each data collection, participants received dietary assessment and nutritional education. Participants consumed more plant-origin foods after the intervention, with most of them reaching the daily recommendations. Fresh food intake increased and that of ultra-processed foods decreased. Compliance with the Mediterranean diet also improved. Personalized dietary assessment and ongoing follow-up improved the dietary patterns of children recently diagnosed with CD, highlighting the importance of dietitian involvement in the management of CD.
23314669	Celiac disease in a child with ulcerative colitis: a possible genetic association.	Celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease are both immune-mediated enteropathies. It is rare for both celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease to occur together in an individual patient. This association has been reported in adults, however, very rarely in children. Here, we report an unusual case of an 8-year-old child with a history of anemia and failure to thrive who presented with bloody diarrhea. His evaluation showed anemia, elevated inflammatory markers, and positive celiac antibodies. Endoscopic evaluation revealed partial duodenal villous atrophy and pancolitis. He was diagnosed with celiac disease and UC and responded well to a gluten-free diet and steroid/mesalamine therapy. The patient's genetic testing revealed markers showing susceptibility for both celiac disease and UC. It is important to be aware of this association as both conditions can present with similar clinical features, however, require different therapeutic approaches.
36771334	Gluten-Free Diet and Metabolic Syndrome: Could Be a Not Benevolent Encounter?	Celiac disease is a rising disorder and is becoming frequently diagnosed in recent years. To date, the only available treatment is the gluten-free diet (GFD). The role of gluten on components of metabolic syndrome and on related inflammatory response is still unclear due to controversial results. In recent years, scientific focus on this topic has been growing up, in particular regarding the role of the GFD on glycometabolic parameters and diabetes. In addition, studies on the remaining components showed discordant results, which was likely due to heterogeneous and large celiac disease populations and to the lack of prospective studies. Furthermore, knowledge about the role of the GFD on inflammatory cytokines and the relationship among vitamin D and celiac disease, metabolic syndrome (MS) and GFD is needed. In this narrative review, we provided evidence regarding the role of the GFD on glycometabolic parameters, cholesterol, triglycerides, waist circumference, blood pressure and inflammatory cascade, also evaluating the role of vitamin D, trying to summarize whether this nutritional pattern may be a value-added for subjects with dysmetabolic conditions. Finally, due to the limited findings and very low-certainty evidence, predominantly based on observational studies, the real effects of a GFD on different components of MS, however, are unclear; nevertheless, an improvement in HDL levels has been reported, although data on glycemic levels are discordant.
32898005	Acute Pancreatitis in Celiac Disease: Has the Inpatient Prevalence Changed and Is It Associated With Worse Outcomes?	OBJECTIVES: Studies suggest that adults diagnosed with celiac disease (CD) are at higher risk of developing acute pancreatitis (AP). The aim of this study is to explore the relationship between CD and AP in terms of inpatient prevalence, mortality, morbidity, and resource utilization in the past decade. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2007-2016). The primary outcome was the occurrence of AP in CD patients. Secondary outcomes were the trend in AP cases in CD patients, and mortality, morbidity, length of stay, and total hospital charges and costs. RESULTS: Of 337,201 CD patients identified, 7372 also had AP. The mean age was 53 years, 71% were women. The inpatient prevalence of AP in CD was 2.2% versus 1.2% in non-CD cohort (P < 0.01). Patients with CD displayed increased odds of having AP (adjusted odds ratio, 1.92; P < 0.01). Patients with AP and CD displayed lower odds of morbidity and mortality than non-CD patients with AP. CONCLUSIONS: The inpatient prevalence of AP is higher in CD patients, and increased from 2007 to 2016. Patients with CD and AP displayed lower morbidity and mortality, which may suggest that they have a less severe form of AP or lower baseline comorbidity.
28169607	The Gluten-Free Diet: Can Oats and Wheat Starch Be Part of It?	Objective and Conclusion: Uncertainty still exists about the use of oats and wheat starch as part of a gluten-free diet in patients with celiac disease (CD). This review should help to clarify the issues at hand. Whereas uncontaminated (from gluten/gliadin) oats and oats from cultivars not containing celiac-activating sequences of proline and glutamine can be used without risk of intestinal damage, wheat starch should not be used, unless it is free of gluten-that is, deglutinized-because even small amounts of gluten over time are able to induce small intestinal mucosal damage.

33524131	Impact of a Gluten-Free Diet on Quality of Life and Health Perception in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes and Asymptomatic Celiac Disease.	CONTEXT: Celiac disease (CD) is a common comorbidity seen in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and is frequently asymptomatic. As chronic conditions requiring significant lifestyle changes, there are limited reports assessing changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) during transition to a gluten-free diet (GFD) in patients with T1D who are asymptomatic for CD. OBJECTIVE: This work aims to prospectively assess HRQoL and health perception in children and adults with T1D and asymptomatic CD after random assignment to GFD vs usual diet. METHODS: Patients with T1D aged 8 to 45 years without CD symptoms were serologically screened for CD, with positive results confirmed with intestinal biopsy. Participants were randomly assigned in an open-label fashion to a GFD or gluten-containing diet (GCD) for 12 months. Generic and diabetes-specific HRQoL and self-perceived wellness (SPW) were assessed longitudinally. RESULTS: A total of 2387 T1D patients were serologically screened. CD was biopsy-confirmed in 82 patients and 51 participants were randomly assigned to a GFD (N = 27) or GCD (N = 24). Excellent adherence to the assigned diets was observed. Overall, no changes in generic (P = .73) or diabetes-specific HRQoL (P = .30), or SPW (P = .41) were observed between groups over 12 months. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and gastrointestinal symptoms were consistent predictors of HRQoL and SPW. CONCLUSION: HRQoL and SPW were not significantly affected by the adoption of a GFD over 12 months, but worsened with symptom onset and increased HbA1c. Our findings indicate that transition to a GFD can be made successfully in this population without adversely affecting quality of life.
25403367	Altered duodenal microbiota composition in celiac disease patients suffering from persistent symptoms on a long-term gluten-free diet.	OBJECTIVES: A significant fraction of celiac disease patients suffer from persistent symptoms despite a long-term gluten-free diet (GFD) and normalized small bowel mucosa. The commonly suggested reasons, such as inadvertent gluten-intake or presence of other gastrointestinal disease, do not explain the symptoms in all these patients. Recently, alterations in intestinal microbiota have been associated with autoimmune disorders, including celiac disease. This led us to test a hypothesis that abnormal intestinal microbiota may be associated with persisting gastrointestinal symptoms in treated celiac disease patients. METHODS: Duodenal microbiota was analyzed in 18 GFD-treated patients suffering from persistent symptoms and 18 treated patients without symptoms by 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. The celiac disease patients had been following a strict GFD for several years and had restored small bowel mucosa and negative celiac autoantibodies. Their symptoms on GFD were assessed with Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale. RESULTS: The results of several clustering methods showed that the treated celiac disease patients with persistent symptoms were colonized by different duodenal microbiota in comparison with patients without symptoms. The treated patients with persistent symptoms had a higher relative abundance of Proteobacteria (P=0.04) and a lower abundance of Bacteroidetes (P=0.01) and Firmicutes (P=0.05). Moreover, their microbial richness was reduced. The results indicated intestinal dysbiosis in patients with persistent symptoms even while adhering to a strict GFD. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that dysbiosis of microbiota is associated with persistent gastrointestinal symptoms in treated celiac disease patients and open new possibilities to treat this subgroup of patients.
21826768	Differences of small intestinal bacteria populations in adults and children with/without celiac disease: effect of age, gluten diet, and disease.	BACKGROUND: Scientific evidence has revealed microecological changes in the intestinal tract of celiac infants. The objective of this work is the study of bacterial differences in the upper small intestine in both adults (healthy, untreated celiac disease [CD], and CD treated with a gluten-free diet) and children (healthy and untreated CD). METHODS: Intestinal bacterial communities were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing of DNA extracted from duodenal biopsies. RESULTS: Analysis of the sequences from adults and children showed that this niche was colonized by bacteria affiliated mainly with three phyla: Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. In total, 89 different genera were identified in adults and 46 in children. Bacterial richness was significantly lower in the children than in the adults. A global principal component analysis of the bacterial communities of both healthy and untreated CD patient groups (including both children and adults) revealed a strong effect of age in principal component 1--clustering all adults and children separately--and a possible effect of the disease in adults with untreated patients clustering separately. CONCLUSIONS: There are bacterial differences in the upper small intestine between untreated children CD patients and untreated CD adults due to age. There are bacterial differences in the upper small bacteria microbiota between treated and untreated CD adults due to treatment with a gluten-free diet.
36235823	The Update of the Italian Food Composition Database of Gluten-Free Products and Its Application in Food-Based Dietary Guidelines Menus.	Complete food composition databases (FCDBs) on gluten-free (GF) foods are needed to assess the nutrient intakes of celiac disease patients. The aim of the present work was to update the previously developed version of the Italian GF-FCDB and to apply it to a theoretical GF diet. The updated GF-FCDB includes the composition of 108 GF cereal-based foods, as sold, in terms of energy and macro- and micro-nutrients, imputed using food label information combined with the standard recipe approach. Three scenarios (i.e., refined, mixed, and wholegrain cereals) of the weekly guideline menu for the general Italian population were analyzed for energy and nutrient content in a theoretical dietary assessment using traditional gluten-containing (GC) foods and the corresponding GF substitutes. All GF menus were higher than the corresponding GC menus in polyunsaturated fatty acids, linoleic acid, and vitamin E. Zinc was lower in GF than in GC menus only in the wholegrain-cereal scenario. Thanks to the application of the updated GF-FCDB including a comprehensive list of micronutrients, we observed that it is possible for celiac disease patients to meet nutrient requirements by simply substituting GC with GF cereal-based products following recommendations for the general population.
23877215	[A case of celiac disease].	Celiac disease is a chronic absorptive disorder of the small intestine caused by gluten. The prevalence rate of celiac disease is 1% in Western countries. But, it is rare in Asian countries, and there is no celiac disease reported in Korea. Here, we report a case of celiac disease. An 36-years-old woman complained non-specific abdominal pain and diarrhea. She had anemia and was taking medication for osteoporosis. Colonoscopy showed no abnormality except shallow ulcer at the terminal ileum. Gastroduodenoscopy showed micronodularity at the duodenum 2nd and 3rd portion. Capsule endoscopy and enteroscopy showed villous atrophy and blunting of villi from the duodenum. Small intestinal pathology showed villous atrophy with lymphocyte infiltration. After gluten free diet, diarrhea, abdominal pain, anemia and osteoporosis were improved. And, she felt well-being sensation. This is a first case of celiac disease in Korea.
31779758	A Case of Polyautoimmunity: Celiac Hepatitis, Grave's Disease and Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia.	Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder with high incidence of multi organ involvement; especially, gastrointestinal manifestations and an increased risk of malignancies. Here we report a case of CD with celiac hepatitis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) and Grave's disease (GD) with their complications. Polyautoimmunity requires comprehensive analysis. While CD and GD were previously diagnosed, AIHA and cirrhosis were diagnosed during admission upon extensive work-up. Similarly, other autoimmune etiologies, such as autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), and/or primary biliary cholangitis were ruled out. All three diseases were treated afresh with strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) and carbimazole along with addition of medications for cirrhosis complicated by ascites. This was a rare case where non-adherence to a GFD led to such severe adverse events. A case of celiac hepatitis presenting with such a wide array of signs and symptoms has rarely been reported in the literature and the management of this patient was unique and challenging.
25925936	Vaccination and other antigen-specific immunomodulatory strategies in celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) results from an alteration in the oral tolerance to dietary gluten. The response to gluten is normally tightly regulated and involves the secretion of TGF-beta and IL-10 from different subtypes of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Interestingly, in addition to proinflammatory cytokines, the inflamed CD mucosa also contains high levels of T cell-derived IL-10 compared with treated CD patients or normal donors. Furthermore, most studies describe an increase in the number of Foxp3+ Tregs in the small intestinal mucosa in CD patients compared to controls. This paradoxical condition suggests that regulatory mechanisms might operate to counterbalance the abnormal gliadin-triggered immune activation in untreated mucosa. Indeed, addition of exogenous IL-10 to mucosal cultures from treated CD patients can suppress gliadin-induced T cell activation. Considering the central role of adaptive immunity in CD, the development of strategies to stimulate these mechanisms is a primary goal of efforts to restore gluten tolerance. Key Messages: Different immunomodulatory strategies have been explored. NexVax2, a desensitizing vaccine that uses three dominant gluten peptides administered subcutaneously to induce a tolerogenic response in CD patients, is under development. Alternatively, the potential of substituted, cyclic or dimeric peptide analogues as blockers to prevent HLA from binding to the immunodominant gliadin epitopes has been demonstrated in vitro. In line with these results, we recently found that modified (transamidated) gliadins influenced the immune response in intestinal biopsy samples from CD patients with overt disease by drastically reducing the production of IFN-gamma. Notably, in a mouse model, transamidated gliadins reverted the phenotype of the gliadin-inducible immune response from an inflammatory phenotype to an anti-inflammatory phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: Various approaches are currently under investigation to recover gluten tolerance based on the use of both modified and native antigen molecules. More specific studies are now required to test the efficacy of such strategies for preventing CD.
25864708	Celiac disease 2015 update: new therapies.	Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic, small intestinal, immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by exposure to dietary gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. Currently, lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only available treatment. However, GFD alone is not sufficient to relieve symptoms, control small intestinal inflammation and prevent long-term complications in many patients. The GFD has its challenges including issues related to adherence, lifestyle restrictions and cost. As a result, there is growing interest in and a need for non-dietary therapies to manage this condition. In recent years, different targets in the immune-mediated cascade of CD have been identified in clinical and pre-clinical trials for potential therapies. This review will discuss the latest non-dietary therapies in CD, including endopeptidases, modulators of enterocyte tight junctions and agents involved in gluten tolerization and immunomodulation. We will also discuss the potential implications of approved therapeutics on CD clinical practice. 
21294744	Celiac disease, gluten-free diet, and oats.	Oats in a gluten-free diet increase the diet's nutritional value, but their use remains controversial. Contamination with prolamins of other cereals is frequent, and some clinical and experimental studies support the view that a subgroup of celiac patients may be intolerant to pure oats. Thus, this issue is more complex than previously suggested. In order to produce oats that are safe for all celiac patients, the following topics should be addressed: selection of oat cultivars with low avenin content, research on such recombinant varieties of oats, development of assay methods to detect avenins in oat products, guidelines for the agricultural processing of oats and the manufacture of oat products, as well as guidelines for following up with celiac patients who consume oats.
24667093	[Non-celiac gluten sensitivity: a critical review of current evidence].	Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is an emerging disorder characterized by intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms related to the ingestion of gluten-containing food in non-celiac patients. Its prevalence has been estimated to be six to ten-times higher than that of celiac disease (CD). A gluten-free diet is the most widely recommended therapy, but the causative agent remains unknown and there are no consensus diagnostic criteria. Recent studies on NCGS have included patients with possibly overlooked minor CD and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome without self-reported gluten intolerance, but showing a response to a gluten-free diet. Furthermore, FODMAPs (Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides And Polyols) have recently been postulated as the culprit component for NCGS in wheat, instead of gluten. This review updates evidence on the pathophysiology of NCGS and the efficacy of different dietary interventions in its treatment, stressing the need for proper screening for CD before a diagnosis of NCGS is made. 
23095439	Factors associated with dietary adherence in celiac disease: a nationwide study.	AIMS: Diagnostics and follow-up of celiac disease have gradually shifted from tertiary centers to secondary and primary health care. In order to establish whether this has affected the success of treatment, and to identify predictors for dietary non-adherence, we carried out a study in a nationwide cohort of treated celiac patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 843 biopsy-proven patients, 94 children and 749 adults, were enrolled and interviewed. Adherence to a gluten-free diet was determined by means of an interview and serological testing. RESULTS: Altogether, 88% were on a strict gluten-free diet; the rest had occasional dietary transgressions. Younger age at diagnosis, being currently a teenager, and current symptoms were associated with non-adherence. There was no association between non-adherence and place of diagnosis, gender, disease phenotype or severity of symptoms before diagnosis, presence of comorbidities, family history of celiac disease, smoking, duration of diet, use of oats, self-efficacy for the diet or lack of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Good dietary adherence can be achieved also in patients diagnosed and followed in primary health care. In a country with a high prevalence and good general knowledge of celiac disease, only age at diagnosis and age at present would appear to be major determinants for adherence.
35334866	Compliance with Gluten Free Diet Is Associated with Better Quality of Life in Celiac Disease.	The quality of life (QOL) of patients with celiac disease (CD) can be altered by both symptoms of the disease and by the restrictions of the gluten-free diet (GFD). The objective was to determine the factors associated with better QOL in a large cohort of CD patients. A link to an online survey was sent to the members of the French Association of Gluten Intolerant People (AFDIAG). The French-Celiac Disease Questionnaire (F-CDQ), scoring from 0 to 100, was used to measure the QOL. Other data collected were sociodemographic characteristics, information on CD, purchasing and consumption habits of gluten-free products, and a self-assessment scale (ranging from 0 to 10) to determine the compliance with the GFD. Among the 907 CD patients who returned the questionnaire, 787 were analyzed (638 women (81%); median age: 49 years; 71% with self-assessed GFD compliance > 8). Their median F-CDQ was 73 (range: 59-82). In multivariate analysis, the main factors associated with a better quality of life were the long duration of the GFD, good compliance with the GFD, and the number of follow-up visits. Compliance with and duration of the GFD are associated with a better quality of life in patients with CD. Taking this into consideration would offset its restrictive aspect and improve its adherence.
22324389	Review article: coeliac disease, new approaches to therapy.	BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease is managed by life-long gluten withdrawal from the diet. However, strict adherence to a gluten-free diet is difficult and is not always effective. Novel therapeutic approaches are needed to supplement or even replace the dietary treatment. AIM: To review recent advances in new therapeutic options for coeliac disease. METHODS: A literature search was performed on MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, DDW.org and ClinicalTrials.gov for English articles and abstracts. The search terms used included, but not limited to, 'Celiac disease', 'new', 'novel', 'Advances', 'alternatives' and 'Drug therapy'. The cited articles were selected based on the relevancy to the review objective. RESULTS: Several new therapeutic approaches for coeliac disease are currently under development by targeting its underlying pathogenesis. Alternative therapies range from reproduction of harmless wheat strains to immunomodulatory approaches. Some of these therapies such as enzymatic cleavage of gluten and permeability inhibitors have shown promise in clinical studies. CONCLUSIONS: Gluten-free diet is still the only practical treatment for patients with coeliac disease. Novel strategies provide promise of alternative adjunctive approaches to diet restriction alone for patients with this disorder.
27211234	Gluten free diet and nutrient deficiencies: A review.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: The only available treatment for celiac disease (CD) is lifelong adherence to gluten free (GF)-diet. However, GF-diet may lead to possible nutrient unbalance resulting in improper nutritional quality of diet. The aim of this study is to evaluate the nutritional quality of GF-diet. METHODS: MEDLINE /PubMed and Cochrane Library were electronically searched for articles published between 1990/01/01 and 2015/09/01. RESULTS: GF-diet was found to be poor in alimentary fiber due in particular to the necessary avoidance of several kinds of foods naturally rich in fiber (i.e. grain) and the low content of fiber of GF product that are usually made with starches and/or refined flours. Micronutrients are also found to be poor, in particular Vit. D, Vit. B12 and folate, in addition to some minerals such as iron, zinc, magnesium and calcium. Moreover, an inadequate macronutrient intake was reported related above all to the focus on the avoidance of gluten that often leaving back the importance of nutritional quality of the choice. In particular, it was found a higher content of both saturated and hydrogenated fatty acids and an increase in the glycemic index and glycemic load of the meal. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the GF-diet is necessary in celiac disease treatment and the attention is on gluten avoidance, the evaluation of nutritional quality of the diet must be considered. Moreover, educational strategies based on the relationship between nutrients and food and human health could be developed to optimize the therapeutic approach in celiac patients.
27629576	Plasma Alkylresorcinols Reflect Gluten Intake and Distinguish between Gluten-Rich and Gluten-Poor Diets in a Population at Risk of Metabolic Syndrome.	BACKGROUND: Many patients with celiac disease experience difficulties in adherence to a gluten-free diet. Methods for testing compliance to a gluten-free diet are costly and cumbersome. Thus, a simple biomarker of gluten intake is needed in a clinical setting and will be useful for epidemiologic studies investigating wider effects of gluten intake. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate plasma total alkylresorcinol concentrations as a measure of gluten intake. METHODS: In this randomized, controlled, crossover intervention study in 52 Danish adults with features of the metabolic syndrome, we compared 8 wk of a gluten-rich and gluten-poor diet separated by a washout period of >=6 wk. We measured fasting plasma concentrations of alkylresorcinols to determine if they reflected differences in gluten intake as a secondary outcome of the original study. In addition, we investigated in 118 Danish adults the cross-sectional association between self-reported gluten intake and plasma alkylresorcinols in the same and a similar study at baseline. We used mixed-model ANCOVA for examining treatment effects, a classification tree to determine compliance to the gluten-poor diet, and linear regression models for examining baseline correlation between plasma alkylresorcinol concentrations and gluten intake. RESULTS: Plasma total alkylresorcinols decreased more during the gluten-poor period (geometric mean: -124.8 nmol/L; 95% CI: -156.5, -93.0 nmol/L) than in the gluten-rich period (geometric mean: -31.8 nmol/L; 95% CI: -63.1, -0.4 nmol/L) (P < 0.001). On the basis of the plasma alkylresorcinol profile, we built a classification tree to objectively determine compliance and found an overall participant misclassification error of 3.9%. In the cross-sectional study we found a 5.6% (95% CI: 2.4%, 8.9%) increase in plasma total alkylresorcinols per 1-g increase in reported gluten intake (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: We propose the use of plasma alkylresorcinols to monitor compliance to a gluten-free diet as well as to help investigations into the possible effects of gluten in the wider population. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT017119913 and NCT01731366.
27887897	Nomenclature and diagnosis of gluten-related disorders: A position statement by the Italian Association of Hospital Gastroenterologists and Endoscopists (AIGO).	BACKGROUND: "Gluten-related disorders" is a term that encompasses different diseases induced by the ingestion of gluten-containing food. Because of their incidence the scientific community has been intensively studying them. AIM: To support gastroenterologists with a correct nomenclature and diagnostic approach to gluten-related disorders in adulthood. METHODS: The Italian Association of Hospital Gastroenterologists and Endoscopists (AIGO) commissioned a panel of experts to prepare a position statement clarifying the nomenclature and diagnosis of gluten-related disorders, focusing on those of gastroenterological interest. Each member was assigned a task and levels of evidence/recommendation have been proposed. RESULTS: The panel identified celiac disease, wheat allergy and non-celiac gluten sensitivity as the gluten-related disorders of gastroenterological interest. Celiac disease has an autoimmune nature, wheat allergy is IgE-mediated while the pathogenesis of non-celiac gluten sensitivity is still unknown as is the case of non-IgE mediated allergy. Diagnosis should start with the serological screening for celiac disease and wheat allergy. In case of normal values, the response to a gluten-free diet should be evaluated and a confirmatory blind food challenge carried out. CONCLUSIONS: Gluten-related disorders are clinically heterogeneous. Patients should be carefully managed and specific protocols applied for a correct differential diagnosis in gastroenterological setting.
34914787	Preserved central cholinergic functioning to transcranial magnetic stimulation in de novo patients with celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is now viewed as a systemic disease with multifaceted clinical manifestations. Among the extra-intestinal features, neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms are still a diagnostic challenge, since they can precede or follow the diagnosis of CD. In particular, it is well known that some adults with CD may complain of cognitive symptoms, that improve when the gluten-free diet (GFD) is started, although they may re-appear after incidental gluten intake. Among the neurophysiological techniques, motor evoked potentials (MEPs) to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can non-invasively probe in vivo the excitation state of cortical areas and cortico-spinal conductivity, being also able to unveil preclinical impairment in several neurological and psychiatric disorders, as well as in some systemic diseases affecting the central nervous system (CNS), such as CD. We previously demonstrated an intracortical disinhibition and hyperfacilitation of MEP responses to TMS in newly diagnosed patients. However, no data are available on the central cholinergic functioning indexed by specific TMS measures, such as the short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI), which might represent the neurophysiological correlate of cognitive changes in CD patients, also at the preclinical level. METHODS: Cognitive and depressive symptoms were screened by means of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), respectively, in 15 consecutive de novo CD patients and 15 healthy controls. All patients were on normal diet at the time of the enrolment. Brain computed tomography (CT) was performed in all patients. SAI, recorded at two interstimulus intervals (2 and 8 ms), was assessed as the percentage amplitude ratio between the conditioned and the unconditioned MEP response. Resting motor threshold, MEP amplitude and latency, and central motor conduction time were also measured. RESULTS: The two groups were comparable for age, sex, anthropometric features, and educational level. Brain CT ruled out intracranial calcifications and clear radiological abnormalities in all patients. Scores at MoCA and HDRS were significantly worse in patients than in controls. The comparison of TMS data between the two groups revealed no statistically significant difference for all measures, including SAI at both interstimulus intervals. CONCLUSIONS: Central cholinergic functioning explored by the SAI of the motor cortex resulted to be not affected in these de novo CD patients compared to age-matched healthy controls. Although the statistically significant difference in MoCA, an overt cognitive impairment was not clinically evident in CD patients. Coherently, to date, no study based on TMS or other diagnostic techniques has shown any involvement of the central acetylcholine or the cholinergic fibers within the CNS in CD. This finding might add support to the vascular inflammation hypothesis underlying the so-called "gluten encephalopathy", which seems to be due to an aetiology different from that of the cholinergic dysfunction. Longitudinal studies correlating clinical, TMS, and neuroimaging data, both before and after GFD, are needed.
28502679	The association between semaphorin 3A levels and gluten-free diet in patients with celiac disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is an inflammatory disease affecting the small intestine. We aim to assess serum level and expression of semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) on T regulatory (Treg) cells in CD patients. Twenty-six newly diagnosed celiac patients, 13 celiac patients on a gluten-free diet and 16 healthy controls included in the study. Sema3A protein level in the serum of celiac patients was significantly higher compared to healthy group (7.17+-1.8ng/ml vs. 5.67+-1.5ng/ml, p=0.012). Sema3A expression on Treg cells was statistically lower in celiac patients compared to healthy subjects (p=0.009) and significantly lower in celiac patients compared to celiac patients on gluten free diet (p=0.04). Negative correlation was found between Sema3A on Teg cells and the level of IgA anti-tTG antibodies (r=-0.346, p<0.01) and anti-DGP (r=-0.448, p<0.01). This study suggests involvement of the Sema3A in the pathogenesis of CD.
26019445	Liver involvement in pediatric celiac disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is an intestinal inflammatory disease that manifests in genetically susceptible individuals when exposed to dietary gluten. It is a common chronic disorder, with a prevalence of 1% in Europe and North America. Although the disease primarily affects the gut, the clinical spectrum of CD is remarkably varied, and the disease can affect many extraintestinal organs and systems, including the liver. The hepatic dysfunction presenting in CD ranges from asymptomatic liver enzyme elevations or nonspecific reactive hepatitis (cryptogenic liver disorders), to chronic liver disease. In this article, we review the clinical presentations and possible mechanisms of CD-related liver injury to identify strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders in childhood. 
33315591	ACG Clinical Guideline: Management of Irritable Bowel Syndrome.	Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a highly prevalent, chronic disorder that significantly reduces patients' quality of life. Advances in diagnostic testing and in therapeutic options for patients with IBS led to the development of this first-ever American College of Gastroenterology clinical guideline for the management of IBS using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. Twenty-five clinically important questions were assessed after a comprehensive literature search; 9 questions focused on diagnostic testing; 16 questions focused on therapeutic options. Consensus was obtained using a modified Delphi approach, and based on GRADE methodology, we endorse the following: We suggest that a positive diagnostic strategy as compared to a diagnostic strategy of exclusion be used to improve time to initiating appropriate therapy. We suggest that serologic testing be performed to rule out celiac disease in patients with IBS and diarrhea symptoms. We suggest that fecal calprotectin be checked in patients with suspected IBS and diarrhea symptoms to rule out inflammatory bowel disease. We recommend a limited trial of a low fermentable oligosaccharides, disacchardies, monosaccharides, polyols (FODMAP) diet in patients with IBS to improve global symptoms. We recommend the use of chloride channel activators and guanylate cyclase activators to treat global IBS with constipation symptoms. We recommend the use of rifaximin to treat global IBS with diarrhea symptoms. We suggest that gut-directed psychotherapy be used to treat global IBS symptoms. Additional statements and information regarding diagnostic strategies, specific drugs, doses, and duration of therapy can be found in the guideline.
21744127	Unusual presentation of celiac disease presenting with renal complications.

Most patients in the childhood present with primary gastrointestinal complaints. The authors present here two young girls with renal complaints later diagnosed to have celiac disease.
37071245	Does Gluten Avoidance in Patients with Celiac Disease Increase the Risk of Developing Eating Disorders?	
33259164	Diet-Dependent and Diet-Independent Hemorheological Alterations in Celiac Disease: A Case-Control Study.	INTRODUCTION: Hemorheology is the study of the flow properties of the blood and its elements, which, together with natural anticoagulants, are important determinants of cardiovascular events. This study aimed to assess hemorheological and natural anticoagulant profiles of patients with celiac disease (CeD) comprehensively. METHODS: Our study is a case-control study (registered under ISRCTN49677481) comparing patients with CeD with age- and sex-matched control subjects (1:1). We measured erythrocyte deformability (ED) at high (3-30 Pa) and low shears (0.3-3 Pa), erythrocyte aggregation, whole blood viscosity, plasma viscosity, and natural anticoagulants (protein C, protein S, and antithrombin activity). Adherence to gluten-free diet was estimated through dietary interview and urine gluten immunogenic peptide (urine GIP) detection. RESULTS: After matching, we analyzed the data of 100 study participants. ED at high shears was impaired in CeD (P < 0.05 for all shears, confirmed by random forest analysis) independently of findings on CeD-specific serological assessment and urine GIP detection but slightly dependently on dietary adherence (P = 0.025 for 30 Pa shear). ED at low shears seemed to be impaired only in urine GIP+ CeD patients (P < 0.05 for all comparisons with urine GIP- CeD patients and control subjects). All parameters describing erythrocyte aggregation and whole blood viscosity were shifted toward a prothrombotic direction in patients with CeD with poor dietary adherence compared with those with good dietary adherence. Plasma viscosity and activity of natural anticoagulants did not differ across groups. DISCUSSION: We observed diet-dependent and diet-independent prothrombotic hemorheological alterations in CeD, which can contribute to the elevated cardiovascular risk. The untoward metabolic changes during gluten-free diet, which can further aggravate hemorheological status, may indicate the implementation of prevention strategies.(Equation is included in full-text article.).
35973187	Anemia Etiology and the Response to a Gluten-Free Diet in Untreated Patients With Celiac Disease: A 2-Year Follow-Up.	INTRODUCTION: Anemia and micronutrient deficiencies are common in newly diagnosed patients with celiac disease (CeD). We aim to determine the prevalence and etiology of anemia in a cohort of patients with CeD in the United States and examine the effect of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on the laboratory parameters related to anemia in CeD. METHODS: We analyzed a prospectively collected cohort of adults with biopsy-proven CeD followed in a specialized CeD center between January 2000 and June 2016. We used the level of hemoglobin (Hb) and micronutrients suggested by the World Health Organization to establish the diagnosis of anemia or deficiencies. Demographic data and laboratory parameters related to anemia and micronutrients were recorded at the time of diagnosis and on a GFD. A celiac expert nutritionist or gastroenterologist evaluated all patients. RESULTS: In 572 patients with laboratory evaluation before starting a GFD, approximately 25% presented with anemia at the time of diagnosis of CeD. Iron deficiency was present in 50.8% of the cohort and in 78.8% of the patients with anemia. Within the anemic population, 84.4% of female patients as compared with 58.3% of male patients ( P = 0.02) showed iron deficiency. Folate deficiency (23.2%), vitamin B12 deficiency (11%), and anemia of chronic diseases (7.8%) were also part of both sexes' anemia etiology. Of the initially anemic patients, 81% and 89% normalized their Hb levels within 1 year and 2 years of beginning a GFD, respectively. All patients received appropriate supplementation when needed. DISCUSSION: Approximately 25% of individuals have anemia at CeD diagnosis. The anemia etiology included iron deficiency, vitamin deficiencies, and anemia of chronic diseases. Most of the patients will normalize their Hb levels and the anemia laboratory parameters 1 year after starting a strict GFD.
27446854	A Canadian Study toward Changing Local Practice in the Diagnosis of Pediatric Celiac Disease.	Background. The European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition endorses serological diagnosis (SD) for pediatric celiac disease (CD). The objective of this study was to pilot SD and to prospectively evaluate gastrointestinal permeability and mucosal inflammation at diagnosis and after one year on the gluten-free diet (GFD). We hypothesized that SD would be associated with similar short term outcomes as ED. Method. Children, 3-17 years of age, referred for possible CD were eligible for SD given aTTG level >=200 U/mL, confirmed by repeat aTTG and HLA haplotypes. Gastrointestinal permeability, assessed using sugar probes, and inflammation, assessed using fecal calprotectin (FC), at baseline and after one year on a GFD were compared to patients who had ED. Results. Enrolled SD (n = 40) and ED (n = 48) patients had similar demographics. ED and SD groups were not different in baseline lactulose: mannitol ratio (L : M) (0.049 versus 0.034; p = 0.07), fractional excretion of sucrose (%FES; 0.086 versus 0.092; p = 0.44), or fecal calprotectin (FC; 89.6 versus 51.4; p = 0.05). At follow-up, urine permeability improved and was similar between groups, L : M (0.022 versus 0.025; p = 0.55) and %FES (0.040 versus 0.047; p = 0.87) (p > 0.05). FC improved but remained higher in the SD group (37.1 versus 15.9; p = 0.04). Conclusion. Patients on the GFD showed improved intestinal permeability and mucosal inflammation regardless of diagnostic strategy. This prospective study supports that children diagnosed by SD have resolving mucosal disease early after commencing a GFD. 
25310757	Effects of gluten-free, dairy-free diet on childhood nephrotic syndrome and gut microbiota.	Emerging evidence suggests an association between food sensitivity and gut microbiota in children with nephrotic syndrome. Diminished proteinuria resulted from eliminating cow's milk and the use of an oligoantigenic diet which excluded gluten, especially in patients with immune-related conditions, i.e., celiac disease and nephrotic syndrome. The mechanisms underlying the association of diet, gut microbiota, and dysregulation of the immune system are unknown. Gut microbiota is influenced by a number of factors including diet composition and other environmental epigenetic exposures. The imbalance in gut microbiota may be ameliorated by gluten-free and dairy-free diets. Gluten-free diet increased the number of unhealthy bacteria while reducing bacterial-induced cytokine production of IL-10. Thus, gluten-free diet may influence the composition and immune function of gut microbiota and should be considered a possible environmental factor associated with immune-related disease, including nephrotic syndrome. Furthermore, the imbalance of gut microbiota may be related to the development of cow's milk protein allergy. Investigations are needed to fill the gaps in our knowledge concerning the associations between the gut microbiome, environmental exposures, epigenetics, racial influences, and the propensity for immune dysregulation with its inherent risk to the developing individual. 
27353997	Coexistence of Celiac and Crohn's Disease in a Patient Presenting with Chronic Diarrhea.	Celiac disease (CD) is one of the most common causes of malabsorption. It is an immune-mediated disease manifested by diarrhea, steatorrhea, flatulence, and weight loss, caused by ingestion of gluten containing diets. The disease has typical small intestinal biopsy features of villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and intense inflammation of the mucosal layer. The disease is rarely associated with Crohn's disease (CRD). Studies on the impact of CD on the natural history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have shown that the natural course of CRD is not influenced by coexistent CD. We report a case of 54-year female who presented with diarrhea and weight loss. On initial evaluation, CD was diagnosed, and responded to gluten-free diet (GFD). Later on, she developed joint pains and her diarrhea recurred. Further evaluation revealed coexistence of CRD. The treatment of CRD was also initiated and this led to marked improvement in the symptoms of the patient. 
25070050	Can celiac serology alone be used as a marker of duodenal mucosal recovery in children with celiac disease on a gluten-free diet?	OBJECTIVES: Assessment of treatment response in children with celiac disease (CD) after commencing a strict gluten-free diet (GFD) is generally based on the resolution of clinical features and normalization of serology. Recent adult studies have shown that serologic markers do not correlate with mucosal recovery. We aimed (i) to determine whether anti-tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin (Ig)A (tTG) and anti-deamidated gliadin peptide IgG (DGP) antibodies are sensitive and specific markers of mucosal recovery in children with CD on a GFD for at least 12 months, and (ii) to determine whether a validated dietary questionnaire of compliance can identify patients with mucosal recovery. METHODS: A total of 150 children with biopsy-proven CD were prospectively evaluated with duodenal biopsies at >=12 months on GFD, paired with repeat tTG and DGP serology. The biopsies were reviewed in a blinded manner by two histopathologists and graded by Marsh criteria. A validated questionnaire of dietary compliance was also administered. RESULTS: Of 150 children recruited, 27 (18%) had positive serology, 97 (65%) had negative serology, and 26 (17%) had equivocal serology. Of the 97 children with negative serology, none had Marsh type 3 enteropathy. Of the 27 patients with positive serology, only 6 had Marsh type 3 changes. The sensitivity and specificity of serology as a marker of significant mucosal pathology was 75 and 85%, respectively, with a positive predictive value of 22% but a negative predictive value of 98%. Of the 129 (86%) questionnaires completed, 88% reported good or excellent compliance with a GFD (negative predictive value 97%). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that follow-up using two serological tests in children with CD on a GFD may obviate the need for repeat mucosal biopsy in the majority of patients. A standardized dietary questionnaire may be useful in identifying patients who require further evaluation.
29439526	The Effect of Oligofructose-Enriched Inulin on Faecal Bacterial Counts and Microbiota-Associated Characteristics in Celiac Disease Children Following a Gluten-Free Diet: Results of a Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial.	Celiac disease (CD) is associated with intestinal microbiota alterations. The administration of prebiotics could be a promising method of restoring gut homeostasis in CD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of prolonged oligofructose-enriched inulin (Synergy 1) administration on the characteristics and metabolism of intestinal microbiota in CD children following a gluten-free diet (GFD). Thirty-four paediatric CD patients (mean age 10 years; 62% females) on a GFD were randomized into two experimental groups receiving Synergy 1 (10 g/day) or placebo (maltodextrin; 7 g/day) for 3 months. The quantitative gut microbiota characteristics and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) concentration were analysed. In addition, side effects were monitored. Generally, the administration of Synergy 1 in a GFD did not cause any side effects. After the intervention period, Bifidobacterium count increased significantly (p < 0.05) in the Synergy 1 group. Moreover, an increase in faecal acetate and butyrate levels was observed in the prebiotic group. Consequently, total SCFA levels were 31% higher than at the baseline. The presented trial shows that Synergy 1 applied as a supplement of a GFD had a moderate effect on the qualitative characteristics of faecal microbiota, whereas it stimulated the bacterial metabolite production in CD children.
29181545	Non-celiac gluten sensitivity: people without celiac disease avoiding gluten-is it due to histamine intolerance?	INTRODUCTION: Food intolerance/malabsorption is caused by food ingredients, carbohydrates (mainly lactose and fructose), proteins (gluten), and biogenic amines (histamine) which cause nonspecific gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms. Here we focus on possible etiologic factors of intolerance/malabsorption especially in people with non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) or the so-called people without celiac disease avoiding gluten (PWCDAG) and histamine intolerance. METHODS: Recognizing the recently described symptoms of NCGS (PWCDAG) we review correlations and parallels to histamine intolerance (HIT). RESULTS: We show that intestinal and extra-intestinal NCGS (PWCDAG) symptoms are very similar to those which can be found in histamine intolerance. CONCLUSIONS: After a detailed diagnostic workup for all possible etiologic factors in every patient, a targeted dietary intervention for single or possibly combined intolerance/malabsorption might be more effective than a short-term diet low in fermentable oligo-, di- and monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) or the untargeted uncritical use of gluten-free diets.
32433771	Remission of Pituitary Autoimmunity Induced by Gluten-Free Diet in Patients With Celiac Disease.	CONTEXT: An improvement of some autoimmune diseases associated with celiac disease (CD) has been observed after a gluten-free diet (GFD). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this longitudinal study was to evaluate the effect of a GFD on autoimmune pituitary impairment in patients with CD and potential/subclinical lymphocytic hypophysitis (LYH). DESIGN: Five-year longitudinal observational study. SETTING: Tertiary referral center for immunoendocrinology at the University of Campania "Luigi Vanvitelli". PATIENTS: Ninety-three newly diagnosed LYH patients (high titer of antipituitary antibodies [APA] and normal or subclinically impaired pituitary function) were enrolled from 2000 to 2013 and grouped as follows: group 1, consisting of 43 patients with LYH + CD, and group 2, consisting of 50 patients with isolated LYH only. INTERVENTION: A GFD was started in patients in group 1 after the diagnosis of CD. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: APA titers and pituitary function were evaluated at the beginning of the study and then yearly for 5 years in both groups. Patients progressing to a clinically overt LYH were excluded from the follow-up. RESULTS: Complete remission of LYH (disappearance of APA and recovery of pituitary function in patients with previous subclinical hypopituitarism) occurred in 15 patients in group 1 after a GFD (34%) and spontaneously in only 1 patient in group 2 (2%) (P < .001). Two patients in group 1 and 25 in group 2 progressed to a clinically overt hypopituitarism and dropped out from the study to receive an appropriate replacement therapy. The presence of CD was the only independent predictor of pituitary function recovery (hazard ratio [HR] 0.059, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01-0.54, P = .012). CONCLUSION: In patients with LYH and CD, a GFD may be able to induce remission of subclinical LYH, or prevent the progression to clinical stage of this disease.
20870245	Compliance with the gluten-free diet: the role of locus of control in celiac disease.	OBJECTIVES: To verify whether subjects with celiac disease (CD) have a different locus of control (LoC) compared with healthy subjects, and to evaluate the relationship between LoC and compliance with a prescribed gluten-free diet (GFD) and quality of life (QoL). STUDY DESIGN: We studied 156 subjects on a GFD (mean age, 10 years) and 353 healthy controls (mean age, 12 years). All subjects completed tests on the Nowicki-Strickland Locus of Control Scale; the subjects with CD also completed a questionnaire to measure compliance with dietary treatment and the disease's impact on QoL. RESULTS: There was no difference in LoC values between patients with CD and controls. Subjects with CD with good dietary compliance had a more internal LoC compared with those who were not compliant (P = .01). Patients who reported a satisfactory QoL had a more internal LoC compared with those who reported negative affects on QoL due to CD (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms the usefulness of the LoC concept for identifying those patients who might be at risk for dietary transgression. Given the enhanced, psychological, and social well being that can result from adherence to a GFD, educational and psychological support can help internalize the LoC in those patients at risk for dietary transgression.
27094627	Clinical onset of celiac disease after duodenal switch: a case report.	To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of clinical onset of celiac disease (CD) following duodenal switch surgery. A 61-year-old obese woman developed severe diarrhea soon after bariatric surgery (BS), which was unresponsive to standard medical treatment. After the most common diarrhea etiologies in the immediate postoperative period have been excluded, serological tests were performed. Final diagnosis was determined by anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody positivity. In light of this case report, we propose that CD should be ruled out in any patient presenting with typical or atypical symptoms after BS, regardless of the latency of onset.

38674888	Risk of Gluten Cross-Contamination Due to Food Handling Practices: A Mini-Review.	Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease triggered by the ingestion of gluten in genetically predisposed individuals, affecting 1.4% of the world population. CD induces an inflammatory reaction that compromises small intestine villi, leading to nutrient malabsorption, and gastro and extraintestinal manifestations. Although other treatment approaches are being studied, adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only effective intervention to date. Despite this, about 50% of patients experience persistent inflammation, often associated with unintentional gluten ingestion through contaminated food. There are regulations for labeling gluten-free foods which specify a limit of 20 mg/kg (20 ppm). The risks of gluten cross-contamination above that level are present throughout the whole food production chain, emphasizing the need for caution. This review explores studies that tested different procedures regarding the shared production of gluten-containing and gluten-free food, including the use of shared equipment and utensils. A literature review covering PubMed, Scielo, Web of Science, VHL and Scopus identified five relevant studies. The results indicate that shared environments and equipment may not significantly increase gluten cross-contamination if appropriate protocols are followed. Simultaneous cooking of gluten-containing and gluten-free pizzas in shared ovens has demonstrated a low risk of contamination. In general, shared kitchen utensils and equipment (spoon, ladle, colander, knife, fryer, toaster) in controlled experiments did not lead to significant contamination of samples. On the other hand, cooking gluten-free and gluten-containing pasta in shared water resulted in gluten levels above the established limit of 20 ppm. However, rinsing the pasta under running water for a few seconds was enough to reduce the gluten content of the samples to less than 20 ppm.
22438948	Rapid accumulation of CD14+CD11c+ dendritic cells in gut mucosa of celiac disease after in vivo gluten challenge.	BACKGROUND: Of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) expressing HLA-DQ molecules in the celiac disease (CD) lesion, CD11c(+) dendritic cells (DCs) co-expressing the monocyte marker CD14 are increased, whereas other DC subsets (CD1c(+) or CD103(+)) and CD163(+)CD11c(-) macrophages are all decreased. It is unclear whether these changes result from chronic inflammation or whether they represent early events in the gluten response. We have addressed this in a model of in vivo gluten challenge. METHODS: Treated HLA-DQ2(+) CD patients (n = 12) and HLA-DQ2(+) gluten-sensitive control subjects (n = 12) on a gluten-free diet (GFD) were orally challenged with gluten for three days. Duodenal biopsies obtained before and after gluten challenge were subjected to immunohistochemistry. Single cell digests of duodenal biopsies from healthy controls (n = 4), treated CD (n = 3) and untreated CD (n = 3) patients were analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: In treated CD patients, the gluten challenge increased the density of CD14(+)CD11c(+) DCs, whereas the density of CD103(+)CD11c(+) DCs and CD163(+)CD11c(-) macrophages decreased, and the density of CD1c(+)CD11c(+) DCs remained unchanged. Most CD14(+)CD11c(+) DCs co-expressed CCR2. The density of neutrophils also increased in the challenged mucosa, but in most patients no architectural changes or increase of CD3(+) intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) were found. In control tissue no significant changes were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid accumulation of CD14(+)CD11c(+) DCs is specific to CD and precedes changes in mucosal architecture, indicating that this DC subset may be directly involved in the immunopathology of the disease. The expression of CCR2 and CD14 on the accumulating CD11c(+) DCs indicates that these cells are newly recruited monocytes.

31143330	Non alcoholic fatty liver disease in a young male with celiac disease.	A young emaciated male, known case of celiac disease came with complaints of diarrhea along with 5kgs of weight loss in 3 months' time. He had severe electrolyte abnormalities along with low albumin, low calcium and a high phosphate with deranged liver function test. Ultrasound abdomen had shown fatty liver. Nutrition consult was sought and he was found to have a BMI of 6.8kg/m2. He was started on nutrition support along with supportive therapy, which resulted in weight gain and improvement in his condition.
25072743	Functional and metabolic disorders in celiac disease: new implications for nutritional treatment.	Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic disease causing the inflammation of the proximal small intestine, in genetically predisposed individuals. This is triggered by the consumption of the gluten protein and the side effects of the disease are mitigated by a lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD) treatment. The predominant consequence of CD is malnutrition due to malabsorption (with diarrhea, weight loss, nutritional deficiencies, and altered blood parameters), especially in patients who do not show strict adherence to GFD treatment. Recent evidence shows that, despite a lifelong GFD, some functional disorders persist, such as compromised gallbladder function and motility, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, increased gut permeability, small-intestinal bowel overgrowth, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), lactose intolerance, and milk allergy. These abnormalities may predispose to the occurrence of overweight and obesity even in CD patients. This review focuses on the principal functional and metabolic disorders in both treated and untreated CD, ranging from alterations of the gastrointestinal system to impaired glucose and lipid metabolism and insulin secretion with the aim of providing new implications beyond a GFD, for an ad hoc nutrition treatment in these patients.
26343711	Central America in Transition: From Maize to Wheat Challenges and Opportunities.	The Central American countries: Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama are in transition from a dietary culture based mainly on maize to a wheat-containing diet. Several other changes are occurring, such as a decrease of parasitic and infectious diseases. The environmental changes permit a prediction of an increase of celiac disease and other autoimmune diseases such as type I diabetes and thyroid disease in these genetically heterogeneous countries. At present, celiac disease and gluten-related disorders are considered to be of no relevance at the level of public health in these nations. This review documents the presence of celiac disease in Central America. It draws attention to some of the challenges in planning systematic studies in the region since up until recently celiac disease was unknown. The aim of this review is to disseminate knowledge obtained with preliminary data, to stimulate clinical and basic scientists to study these diseases in Central America and to alert authorities responsible for the planning of education and health, to find possibilities to avoid a rise in these disorders before the epidemics start, as has occurred in the Mediterranean countries. 
26226573	Consistency in polyclonal T-cell responses to gluten between children and adults with celiac disease.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Developing antigen-specific approaches for diagnosis and treatment of celiac disease requires a detailed understanding of the specificity of T cells for gluten. The existing paradigm is that T-cell lines and clones from children differ from those of adults in the hierarchy and diversity of peptide recognition. We aimed to characterize the T-cell response to gluten in children vs adults with celiac disease. METHODS: Forty-one children with biopsy-proven celiac disease (median age, 9 years old; 17 male), who had been on strict gluten-free diets for at least 3 months, were given a 3-day challenge with wheat; blood samples were collected and gluten-specific T cells were measured. We analyzed responses of T cells from these children and from 4 adults with celiac disease to a peptide library and measured T-cell receptor bias. We isolated T-cell clones that recognized dominant peptides and assessed whether gluten peptide recognition was similar between T-cell clones from children and adults. RESULTS: We detected gluten-specific responses by T cells from 30 of the children with celiac disease (73%). T cells from the children recognized the same peptides that were immunogenic to adults with celiac disease; deamidation of peptides increased these responses. Age and time since diagnosis did not affect the magnitude of T-cell responses to dominant peptides. T-cell clones specific for dominant alpha- or omega-gliadin peptides from children with celiac disease had comparable levels of reactivity to wheat, rye, and barley peptides as T-cell clones from adults with celiac disease. The alpha-gliadin-specific T cells from children had biases in T-cell receptor usage similar to those in adults. CONCLUSIONS: T cells from children with celiac disease recognize similar gluten peptides as T cells from adults with celiac disease. The findings indicate that peptide-based diagnostics and therapeutics for adults may also be used for children.
23984606	[Refractory celiac disease].	Refractory celiac disease is characterized by the persistence or recurrence of symptoms connected with enteropathy, presence of specific antibodies in the serum: EMA, tTG2 and DPG, and (or) intestinal villous atrophy despite strict adherence to gluten-free diet for 6 to 12 months. Correct initial diagnosis of celiac disease, exclusion of other causes of the lack of response to gluten-free diet and persistence of villous atrophy are necessary conditions of diagnosis of refractory celiac disease. Options of the treatment, depending on the patient condition are: gluten-free diet, elementary diet, parenteral nutrition, immunosuppression and biological therapy.
37779330	Establishment of New Immunostatistical Equations for Diagnosis and Follow-Up of Gluten-Free Diet in Patients with Celiac Disease.	<b>Background and Objective:</b> Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune condition characterized by immune responses to gluten. The reported prevalence of CD has increased globally due to improved screening and diagnostic techniques, however, there is significant global variation in methods of diagnosis and follow-up. A new immunostatistical equation that determines the values of two types of antibodies using the total IgA test. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> Only 70 blood samples were taken from people who had celiac disease or were suspected of having it, with ages ranging from 5 to 40 years and they were separated into two groups. The first group contained 40 people of both sexes who had previously been diagnosed with celiac disease, while the second group included 30 individuals of both sexes, with ages ranging from 5 to 35 years, who were suspected of having celiac disease due to the appearance of some clinical symptoms. The control group also included 30 blood samples from healthy individuals of both sexes, with ages ranging from 5 to 40 years. Total IgA antibody tTG/IgA and DGP/IgA levels were estimated for all study samples. <b>Results:</b> By using a regression coefficient test the results showed the percentage of the effect of total IgA on tTG/IgA, DGP/IgA amounted to 11 and 25%, respectively, as shown by the value of the coefficient of clarifications (R<sup>2</sup>) in patients with CD. On the other hand, The percentage of the effect of total IgA on tTG/IgA and DGP/IgA amounted to 11, 14%, respectively, as shown by the value of the coefficient of clarifications (R<sup>2</sup>) in patients with suspected CD in p<u><</u>0.05. The results of the study were revealed and through the regression coefficient, four new immunostatistical equations were mathematically derived that give the value of tTG/IgA and DGP/IgA based solely on the total IgA test in the laboratory. <b>Conclusion:</b> By adopting one laboratory test which determines total IgA, the study concluded four new immunostatistical equations that will help academic researchers and attending physicians to diagnose celiac disease in addition to following up on patient's adherence to a gluten-free diet.
23361572	Prior endoscopy in patients with newly diagnosed celiac disease: a missed opportunity?	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is under-diagnosed in the United States, and factors related to the performance of endoscopy may be contributory. AIM: To identify newly diagnosed patients with CD who had undergone a prior esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and examine factors contributing to the missed diagnosis. METHODS: We identified all patients age >= 18 years whose diagnosis of CD was made by endoscopy with biopsy at our institution (n = 316), and searched the medical record for a prior EGD. We compared those patients with a prior EGD to those with without a prior EGD with regard to age at diagnosis and gender, and enumerated the indications for EGD. RESULTS: Of the 316 patients diagnosed by EGD with biopsy at our center, 17 (5 %) had previously undergone EGD. During the prior non-diagnostic EGD, a duodenal biopsy was not performed in 59 % of the patients, and >= 4 specimens (the recommended number) were submitted in only 29 % of the patients. On the diagnostic EGD, >= 4 specimens were submitted in 94 %. The mean age of diagnosis of those with missed/incident CD was 53.1 years, slightly older than those diagnosed with CD on their first EGD (46.8 years, p = 0.11). Both groups were predominantly female (missed/incident CD: 65 vs. 66 %, p = 0.94). CONCLUSIONS: Among 17 CD patients who had previously undergone a non-diagnostic EGD, non-performance of duodenal biopsy during the prior EGD was the dominant feature. Routine performance of duodenal biopsy during EGD for the indications of dyspepsia and reflux may improve CD diagnosis rates.
27481162	Addressing proteolytic efficiency in enzymatic degradation therapy for celiac disease.	Celiac disease is triggered by partially digested gluten proteins. Enzyme therapies that complete protein digestion in vivo could support a gluten-free diet, but the barrier to completeness is high. Current options require enzyme amounts on the same order as the protein meal itself. In this study, we evaluated proteolytic components of the carnivorous pitcher plant (Nepenthes spp.) for use in this context. Remarkably low doses enhance gliadin solubilization rates, and degrade gliadin slurries within the pH and temporal constraints of human gastric digestion. Potencies in excess of 1200:1 (substrate-to-enzyme) are achieved. Digestion generates small peptides through nepenthesin and neprosin, the latter a novel enzyme defining a previously-unknown class of prolyl endoprotease. The digests also exhibit reduced TG2 conversion rates in the immunogenic regions of gliadin, providing a twin mechanism for evading T-cell recognition. When sensitized and dosed with enzyme-treated gliadin, NOD/DQ8 mice did not show intestinal inflammation, when compared to mice challenged with only pepsin-treated gliadin. The low enzyme load needed for effective digestion suggests that gluten detoxification can be achieved in a meal setting, using metered dosing based on meal size. We demonstrate this by showing efficient antigen processing at total substrate-to-enzyme ratios exceeding 12,000:1.
25970665	No Effects of a Short-Term Gluten-free Diet on Performance in Nonceliac Athletes.	PURPOSE: Implementation of gluten-free diets among nonceliac athletes has rapidly increased in recent years because of perceived ergogenic and health benefits. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on exercise performance, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, perceived well-being, intestinal injury, and inflammatory responses in nonceliac athletes. METHODS: Thirteen competitive endurance cyclists (8 males, 5 females) with no positive clinical screening for celiac disease or history of irritable bowel syndrome (mean +- SD; age, 32 +- 7 yr; weight, 71.1 +- 13.4 kg; height, 177.0 +- 11.8 cm, VO2max 59.1 +- 8.0 mL kg-1 min-1) were allocated to a 7-d gluten-containing diet (GCD) or GFD separated by a 10-d washout in a controlled, randomized, double-blind, crossover study. Cyclists ate a GFD alongside either gluten-containing or gluten-free food bars (16 g wheat gluten per day) while habitual training and nutrition behaviors were controlled. During each diet, cyclists completed the Daily Analysis of Life Demand for Athletes (DALDA) and GI questionnaires (postexercise and daily). On day 7, cyclists completed a submaximal steady-state (SS) 45-min ride at 70% Wmax followed by a 15-min time trial (TT). Blood samples were taken preexercise, post-SS, and post-TT to determine intestinal fatty acid binding protein (IFABP) and inflammatory markers (cytokine responses: interleukin [IL] 1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, tumor necrosis factor alpha). Mixed effects logistic regression was used to analyze data. RESULTS: TT performance was not significantly different (P = 0.37) between the GCD (245.4 +- 53.4 kJ) and GFD (245.0 +- 54.6 kJ). GI symptoms during exercise, daily, and DALDA responses were similar for each diet (P > 0.11). There were no significant differences in IFABP (P = 0.69) or cytokine (P > 0.13) responses. CONCLUSIONS: A short-term GFD had no overall effect on performance, GI symptoms, well-being, and a select indicator of intestinal injury or inflammatory markers in nonceliac endurance athletes.
28465308	Long term gluten consumption in adults without celiac disease and risk of coronary heart disease: prospective cohort study.	Objective To examine the association of long term intake of gluten with the development of incident coronary heart disease.Design Prospective cohort study.Setting and participants 64 714 women in the Nurses' Health Study and 45 303 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study without a history of coronary heart disease who completed a 131 item semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire in 1986 that was updated every four years through 2010.Exposure Consumption of gluten, estimated from food frequency questionnaires.Main outcome measure Development of coronary heart disease (fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction).Results During 26 years of follow-up encompassing 2 273 931 person years, 2431 women and 4098 men developed coronary heart disease. Compared with participants in the lowest fifth of gluten intake, who had a coronary heart disease incidence rate of 352 per 100 000 person years, those in the highest fifth had a rate of 277 events per 100 000 person years, leading to an unadjusted rate difference of 75 (95% confidence interval 51 to 98) fewer cases of coronary heart disease per 100 000 person years. After adjustment for known risk factors, participants in the highest fifth of estimated gluten intake had a multivariable hazard ratio for coronary heart disease of 0.95 (95% confidence interval 0.88 to 1.02; P for trend=0.29). After additional adjustment for intake of whole grains (leaving the remaining variance of gluten corresponding to refined grains), the multivariate hazard ratio was 1.00 (0.92 to 1.09; P for trend=0.77). In contrast, after additional adjustment for intake of refined grains (leaving the variance of gluten intake correlating with whole grain intake), estimated gluten consumption was associated with a lower risk of coronary heart disease (multivariate hazard ratio 0.85, 0.77 to 0.93; P for trend=0.002).Conclusion Long term dietary intake of gluten was not associated with risk of coronary heart disease. However, the avoidance of gluten may result in reduced consumption of beneficial whole grains, which may affect cardiovascular risk. The promotion of gluten-free diets among people without celiac disease should not be encouraged.
37432272	Comparison of Clinical, Biochemical and Histological Features between Adult Celiac Patients with High and Low Anti-Transglutaminase IgA Titer at Diagnosis and Follow-Up.	In adults, celiac disease (CD) diagnosis is based on specific serology (anti-transglutaminase IgA-anti-tTG) and duodenal histology. Evidence is raising the possibility of perform CD diagnosis based only on high anti-tTG titer in children. We aimed to evaluate clinical, histological and biochemical differences between adult patients with high tTG IgA titer (HT) and those with low titer (LT) at CD diagnosis and follow-up. This retrospective study included consecutive adult CD patients divided into two groups: HT (anti-tTG > 10 x ULN) and LT (anti-tTG < 10 x ULN). Clinical, biochemical and histological features were compared between groups at CD diagnosis and at follow-up. A total of 291 patients were included (HT: 47.1%; LT: 52.9%). At CD diagnosis, HT patients showed a non 'classical' presentation (p = 0.04), Marsh 3C (p = 0.005), hypoferritinaemia (p = 0.006) and osteopenia/osteoporosis (p = 0.04) more frequently than LT patients. A total of 216 patients (HT: 48.6%; LT: 51.4%) performed a follow-up after a median Gluten-free diet of 14 months; HT patients had persistent antibodies positivity (p = 0.001) more frequently and GI symptoms (p = 0.04) less frequently than LT patients. In conclusion, HT patients presented severe histological damage more frequently at diagnosis, recovering similarly to LT patients after the start of the Gluten-free diet. At follow-up, anti-tTG persisted positive in HT more frequently compared to LT patients, without differences regarding histological recovery and clinical improvement.
24632769	COLOSTRO NONI administration effects on epithelial cells turn-over, inflammatory events and integrity of intestinal mucosa junctional systems.	AIM: In this work we evaluated the possibility for dietary supplement COLOSTRO NONI to be used as preventive and therapeutic agent in various diseases characterized by altered intestinal homeostasis with changes in the composition of the microbiota, alteration of the morphology and functionality, and also inflammation of the epithelium. METHODS: Cellular activity of COLOSTRO NONI has been tested in an in vitro model of intestinal epithelium based on Caco-2 cell line. We tested the ability of COLOSTRO NONI to stimulate cellular turnover evaluating cell growth rate with WST-1 proliferation assay. We also tested the ability of COLOSTRO NONI to increase the gene expression of Interleukin-8 (IL-8) with a Real Time PCR assay. IL-8 is a fundamental chemotactic factor involved in inflammatory phenomena and in the control of tissue homeostasis. RESULTS: COLOSTRO NONI is able to stimulate cell turnover in the proposed in vitro model and demonstrates active in increasing the gene expression of IL-8. Both aspects observed are fundamental for the establishment of mechanisms to repair tissue damage. CONCLUSION: Obtained results indicate that COLOSTRO NONI could find clinical application in treatment of gastrointestinal disorders characterized by impairment of proper intestinal permeability, in inflammatory bowel diseases, in dysenteric diseases, in gastritis and in forms of pathological alteration of the mucous layer as celiac disease and gluten sensitivity.

36142642	Gut Dysbiosis and Fecal Microbiota Transplantation in Autoimmune Diseases.	Gut microbiota dysbiosis has recently been reported in a number of clinical states, including neurological, psychiatric, cardiovascular, metabolic and autoimmune disorders. Yet, it is not completely understood how colonizing microorganisms are implicated in their pathophysiology and molecular pathways. There are a number of suggested mechanisms of how gut microbiota dysbiosis triggers or sustains extraintestinal diseases; however, none of these have been widely accepted as part of the disease pathogenesis. Recent studies have proposed that gut microbiota and its metabolites could play a pivotal role in the modulation of immune system responses and the development of autoimmunity in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis or type 1 diabetes. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a valuable tool for uncovering the role of gut microbiota in the pathological processes. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge about gut microbiota dysbiosis and the potential of FMT in studying the pathogeneses and therapies of autoimmune diseases. Herein, we discuss the extraintestinal autoimmune pathologies with at least one published or ongoing FMT study in human or animal models.
27981314	Severe Alveolar Hemorrhage - What's in it for the Gastroenterologist?	BACKGROUND: Alveolar hemorrhage is a potentially life-threatening condition which is usually managed by the pulmonologist. When considering its etiology, there is a rare association that sets the disease into the hands of the gastroenterologist. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 48 year-old female who was admitted to the intensive care unit for severe anemia and hemoptysis. On imaging, diffuse pulmonary infiltrates suggestive of alveolar hemorrhage were detected and a diagnosis of pulmonary hemosiderosis was made. She received cortisone therapy and hematologic correction of anemia, with slow recovery. In search of an etiology for the pulmonary hemosiderosis, an extensive workup was done, and celiac disease specific serology was found positive. After confirmation of celiac disease by biopsy, a diagnosis of Lane-Hamilton syndrome was established. The patient was recommended a gluten-free diet and at 6 months follow-up, resolution of anemia and pulmonary infiltrates were observed. CONCLUSION: Although the association is rare, celiac disease should be considered in a patient with idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis. In our case, severe anemia and alveolar infiltrates markedly improved with glucocorticoids and gluten-free diet.
29893137	Dietary Intake and Micronutrient Supplementation in Youth with Celiac Disease with and without Type 1 Diabetes.	The study purpose was to describe dietary intake and the factors influencing micronutrient supplements (MS) use in Celiac Disease (CD) +- Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). Three-day food records collected from parents of youth (3-18 years) with CD (n = 14) +- T1D (n = 10) were assessed for macro and micronutrient intake, diet quality (DQ), glycemic index (GI), glycemic load (GL), and food group intake. Focus group methodology and thematic concept analysis were conducted to determine factors influencing adolescent MS use. Mean +- SD age was 11 +- 4.4 (CD) and 13 +- 3.7 (CD + T1D) (P = 0.32). Body mass index was within healthy reference ranges (17.9 +- 2.5 [CD]; 19.3 +- 3.8 [CD + T1D] kg/m2; P = 0.61). The majority of youth with CD +- T1D (>90%) had high intakes of sugar and saturated fat, had high GI and GL, and met food serving recommendations and DQs that were indicative of "needs improvement." With the exception of vitamin D, vitamin E, folate, calcium, and potassium, youth in both groups met the estimated average requirements (EAR) for most micronutrients. MS use corrected suboptimal vitamin D intake; however, vitamin E, folate, calcium, and potassium intake remained below the EAR. Variables influencing adolescent MS use included daily routine, health professional influence, disease management (CD + T1D), and lack of knowledge about the need for MS. Strategies to elicit adolescent MS use varied between parent and adolescents.
22711365	Assessment of sexual maturity in a cohort of adolescents with celiac disease on gluten-free diet.	Delayed sexual maturation is a known complication of celiac disease (CD). There is paucity of data regarding the effect of gluten-free diet (GFD) on sexual maturity in patients with CD in India. We did a cross-sectional observational study to assess the sexual maturity in 30 adolescents with CD on GFD for at least 1 year, and evaluated factors which affect their sexual maturity. Sexual maturation was assessed using Tanner's stages of sexual development. All adolescents had completed 2 years of GFD and 53 % had completed 4 years of GFD. Sexual maturation was delayed in 30 %. Age at initiation of GFD was associated with attaining appropriate sexual maturity (p = 0.048). We conclude that delayed sexual maturation is not uncommon in adolescents with CD and may be corrected by early diagnosis and initiation of GFD.
22138947	Are non-celiac disease gluten-intolerant patients innate immunity responders to gluten?	
22808785	[Nutrition support of patients with celiac disease and deficiency of carbohydrases of the small intestinal mucosa].	The treatment policy of nutritive support for patients with different types of celiac disease is still actual issue. The difficulty of treatment policy implementation associated with villus atrophy, that brings on not only small intestine malabsorption function, but secretory process disorder (particularly, some of intestinal ferments production, including carbohydrases. The work objective is different types of celiac disease (typical, latent, torpid) nutritive correction improvement based on study of small intestine mucous membrane morphofunctional features at different stages of its atrophy, its carbohydrase activity that identifies clinic manifestation features, including nutritional disorders. We suppose, that such phermentopathy correction by means of directional action composites will have a wholesome effect on elimination of different nutritive disorder at celiac disease.
37053375	Factors Associated With Adherence to a Gluten-Free Diet in Celiac Patients Diagnosed in Childhood as Compared to Adulthood.	Past studies have reported differences between pediatric and adult celiac disease patients. We aimed to compare factors associated with adherence to a gluten-free diet between these groups. An anonymous online questionnaire was sent via the Israeli Celiac Association and social networks to celiac patients. The Biagi questionnaire was used to assess dietary adherence. A total of 445 subjects participated. Mean age was 25.7 +- 17.5 years and 71.9% were female. Subjects were divided into six groups according to age at diagnosis: younger than 6 years (134 patients, 30.7%), 6-12 (79 patients, 18.1%), 12-18 (41 patients, 9.4%), 18-30 (81 patients, 18.5%), 30-45 (79 patients, 18.1%), and 45 years and above (23 patients, 5.3%). There were several significant differences between childhood- and adulthood-diagnosed patients. Pediatric patients were less likely to be noncompliant with a gluten-free diet (3.7% vs. 9.4%, p < .001). They were also more frequently followed by a gastroenterologist ( p < .001), a dietitian ( p < .001), and participated in a celiac support group ( p = .002). In logistic regression analyses, longer duration of disease was associated with poor compliance. In conclusion, pediatric-diagnosed celiac patients are more adherent to a gluten-free diet than those diagnosed in adulthood, with better social support and nutritional follow-up possibly contributing.
36040008	[Nutritional problems in celiac patients. Difficulties in achieving an adequate nutritional status].	Introduction: Celiac disease is the most common chronic intestinal disease. It affects approximately 1 % of the world population, affects all age groups and has symptoms both digestive and extra-digestive. The treatment of celiac disease is based on the strict withdrawal of gluten from the diet. This treatment supposes the improvement of symptoms and histology and the reduction of long-term comorbidities. People with celiac disease often follow diets that are far from the theoretical ideal, so they must be supervised and guided to achieve gluten-free diets that are also varied and balanced. In these patients it is important to avoid gluten consumption, but also to achieve an adequate supply of nutrients. However, their health problems, together with the limitations they must introduce in the diet make it more difficult to achieve a correct diet, so the group deserves special nutritional monitoring and surveillance.
29030981	Mesalazine treatment in organotypic culture of celiac patients: Comparative study with gluten free diet.	Given the central role of gluten in the pathogenesis of celiac disease (CD), a strict gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only validated treatment able to restore epithelium integrity and eliminate risks of complications. The risk of gluten contamination and the persistence of inflammation, even in patients strictly adhering to GFD, may render this treatment not always effective claiming the necessity of different new solutions. Oxidative and nitrosative stress have been indicated to play a pathophysiological role in CD. Mesalazine (5-ASA), a drug largely used in inflammatory bowel disease, has potent antinflammatory and antioxidant effects. In fact, mesalazine has been shown to decrease in vitro gluten induced cytokine response and it has been used in vivo in some refractory condition. However, its effect has never compared to that of GFD. The present study aimed to address this issue by comparing the ability of mesalazine and GFD in treating gluten-induced inflammation and oxidative stress. These effects were studied on duodenal mucosa biopsy cultures from newly diagnosed CD patients, treated or not in vitro with mesalazine, and CD biopsy cultures from patients on gluten-free diet for at least one year; and a cohort of controls constituted by healty subjects. On these models, the antioxidant cellular defences, the PPARgamma, NF-kB and NOS2 proteins levels were studied. This study shows that mesalazine is as effective as GFD in reducing oxidative burst and inducing PPARgamma expression; moreover it resulted more effective than GFD in decreasing NF-kB and NOS2 to the levels of controls.
38290622	Celiac disease affects 1% of global population - who will manage all these patients? What are criteria to prioritize along risk for complications?	Celiac disease is a common gastrointestinal condition with an estimated global prevalence of up to 1%. Adequate long-term surveillance of patients is imperative to ensure strict adherence to the treatment with a gluten-free diet and the ensuing clinical and histological recovery. Traditionally this has been accomplished by regular on-site attendance at specialist healthcare facilities, accompanied for most patients by follow-up endoscopic and laboratory tests. However, the rapidly increasing prevalence of celiac disease and the limited healthcare resources challenge the current centralized and non-individualized follow-up strategies. The improved non-invasive surveillance tools and online healthcare services are further changing the landscape of celiac disease management. There is a clear need for more personalized and on-demand follow-up based on early treatment response and patient-related factors associated with long-term prognosis. Additional scientific evidence on the optimal implementation of follow-up for pediatric and adulthood celiac disease is nevertheless called for.
36459294	Role of Serology, Dietary Assessment, and Fecal Gluten Immunogenic Peptides for Predicting Histologic Recovery in Children with Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND: A strict lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD) remains the only treatment of celiac disease (CD). Adherence to gluten-free diet is best reflected by mucosal healing. Noninvasive tools capable of predicting mucosal recovery in CD patients need to be identified. AIMS: To compare the ability of various modalities used to assess compliance to GFD, for predicting persistent mucosal damage in children with CD. METHODS: A prospective, single-center, observational study on children with CD on a GFD was conducted between January 2020 and April 2021. Children with CD on GFD were consecutively enrolled and various modalities used to assess adherence to GFD were compared. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty children (Mean age 12.2 +- 3.6 years, 58% Boys) on GFD (Mean duration 6 +- 3.1 years) were enrolled in the study. Persistent mucosal damage was seen in 88% of the enrolled. Fecal gluten immunogenic peptide (GIP) was positive in 87.8% (129/147). Antibodies to tissue transglutaminase (TGA-IgA) and/or deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP) were positive in 32% (48/150) whereas antibody to synthetic neoepitopes of TGA-IgA was positive in 24.8% (37/149). Non-compliance as assessed by local questionnaire, Biagi score, and dietitian detailed interview were 62.7%, 60%, and 75.3%, respectively. Serology had the highest specificity (83%) and fecal GIP had the highest sensitivity (89%). On logistic regression analysis, only non-compliance by Biagi score predicted poor mucosal recovery. CONCLUSION: Fecal GIP may be sensitive to detect only "one-point dietary transgression." None of the existing modalities used to assess compliance to GFD accurately predict persistent mucosal damage. A subset of patients may develop gluten tolerance.
24253052	Gluten-free diet in children: an approach to a nutritionally adequate and balanced diet.	Gluten-free diet (GFD) is the cornerstone treatment for celiac disease (CD). GFD implies a strict and lifelong elimination from the diet of gluten, the storage protein found in wheat, barley, rye and hybrids of these grains, such as kamut and triticale. The absence of gluten in natural and processed foods, despite being the key aspect of GFD, may lead to nutritional consequences, such as deficits and imbalances. The nutritional adequacy of GFD is particularly important in children, this the age being of maximal energy and nutrient requirements for growth, development and activity. In recent years, attention has focused on the nutritional quality of gluten-free products (GFPs) available in the market. It is well recognized that GFPs are considered of lower quality and poorer nutritional value compared to the gluten-containing counterparts. The present review focuses on the nutritional adequacy of GFD at the pediatric age, with the aim being to increase awareness of the potential complications associated with this diet, to identify strategies in order to avoid them and to promote a healthier diet and lifestyle in children with CD. 
36839352	IgE-Dependent Allergy in Patients with Celiac Disease: A Systematic Review.	In order to answer the question if an IgE-mediated allergy (A-IgE) may occur in subjects with celiac disease (CD), a systematic review was performed of available publications collected in the United States National Institute for Biotechnology Information/National Institutes of Health/National Library of Medicine/PubMed database up to 28 December 2022, with the use of the following keywords "allergy&celiac/coeliac", "sensitization&celiac/coeliac", and "anaphylaxis&celiac/coeliac" compared in the form of a conjunction. In total, the search returned 2013 publications from these keywords in any section of the article. As numerous review articles included the above-mentioned entries in the abstract, we decided to focus on the publications with the entries only in the title (n = 63). After rejecting studies unrelated to the topic, narrative reviews, book chapters, conference abstracts, symposium reports, letters to the editor, or non-English articles, 18 publications (6 observational original studies and 12 case reports describing a total of 15 cases of A-IgE developed after a diagnosis of CD) were included to this review. Our study is the first systematic review on allergy occurrence in CD patients. The analysis indicated that the possibility of a coexistence of A-IgE with any food and inhalant allergens in subjects diagnosed with CD should be considered. A sensitization to wheat was the most frequently described in subjects with CD. The clinical manifestation of A-IgE in CD was similar to that in subjects without CD; e.g., with possible atopic dermatitis, vomiting, urticaria, angioedema, or anaphylactic shock. Screening for allergies in subjects with CD should be considered, especially in those cases where symptoms persist after introducing a gluten-free diet. The elimination of wheat from the diet of patients with CD may lead to a loss of immune tolerance and to the development of sensitization, which may even manifest as anaphylaxis. In conclusion, although there are few studies assessing the occurrence of A-IgE in subjects with CD, they show the possibility of a coexistence of both diseases and the high clinical significance of this phenomenon, which indicates the need for further studies.
21409373	Celiac disease is associated with neurological syndromes.	
29915404	The Global Phenomenon of Self-Reported Wheat Sensitivity.	Celiac disease affects about 1% of the population and is treated with a gluten-free diet. However, the last decade has seen a huge rise in individuals self-reporting wheat sensitivity, and consuming a gluten-free diet, despite not having a doctor-diagnosis of celiac disease. A recent flurry of observational studies from across the globe suggests that approximately 10% of the population is self-reporting wheat sensitivity. They describe a constellation of intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms attributed to ingestion of gluten-based products. This phenomenon poses a significant challenge to clinicians with regards to adequately excluding celiac disease, identifying the culprit agent, understanding the pathophysiology, and providing safe aftercare.
36412507	Assessment of Knowledge of Gluten-Free Diet Amongst Food Handlers in Hospitals.	Purpose: When admitted to the hospital, individuals with celiac disease rely on food handlers for provision of safe, uncontaminated gluten-free meals. We aimed to assess the knowledge of gluten-free diet (GFD) amongst individuals involved in meal preparation for patients.Methods: A questionnaire with 10 demographic and 35 test items to assess knowledge of GFD, including workplace scenarios encountered in meal preparation, was administered to food handlers including cooks, utility workers, dietary technicians, and supervisors in 2 tertiary care, university-affiliated hospitals. A score of >=28 of 35 (>=80%) was considered a "pass".Results: A total of 72 individuals completed the study, mean age 40.3 +- 1.6 years, 75% female. Only 42 (56.8%) scored >=80% and achieved a pass. The average score was 75.9% +- 13.4%, range 25.7%-100%. The supervisors had significantly higher scores (87.9% +- 11.4%) than utility workers (73.0% +- 11.4%; P = 0.01) and cooks (71.7% +- 14.5%; P = 0.01). Cooks had the lowest scores with 80% scoring <80%. Females scored higher than males (77.8% vs. 68.8%; P = 0.02).Conclusions: There are significant differences in GFD knowledge amongst various groups involved in food preparation in hospitals. The gaps identified in knowledge can potentially compromise the safety of patients with celiac disease. Targeted interventions to educate hospital food handlers about GFD are warranted. Registered Dietitians can play an important role in providing this education.
29505551	Dietary Factors and Mucosal Immune Response in Celiac Disease Patients Having Persistent Symptoms Despite a Gluten-free Diet.	GOALS: The aim of this study was to investigate the role of dietary factors, distinct small-bowel mucosal immune cell types, and epithelial integrity in the perpetuation of gastrointestinal symptoms in treated celiac disease patients. BACKGROUND: For unexplained reasons, many celiac disease patients suffer from persistent symptoms, despite a strict gluten-free diet (GFD) and recovered intestinal mucosa. STUDY: We compared clinical and serological data and mucosal recovery in 22 asymptomatic and 25 symptomatic celiac patients on a long-term GFD. The density of CD3 and gammadelta intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), CD25 and FOXP3 regulatory T cells, and CD117 mast cells, and the expression of tight junction proteins claudin-3 and occludin, heat shock protein 60, interleukin 15, and Toll-like receptor 2 and 4 were evaluated in duodenal biopsies. RESULTS: All subjects kept a strict GFD and had negative celiac autoantibodies and recovered mucosal morphology. The asymptomatic patients had higher mean fiber intake (20.2 vs. 15.2 g/d, P=0.028) and density of CD3 IELs (59.3 vs. 45.0 cell/mm, P=0.045) than those with persistent symptoms. There was a similar but nonsignificant trend in gammadelta IELs (17.9 vs. 13.5, P=0.149). There were no differences between the groups in other parameters measured. CONCLUSIONS: Low fiber intake may predispose patients to persistent symptoms in celiac disease. There were no differences between the groups in the markers of innate immunity, epithelial stress or epithelial integrity. A higher number of IELs in asymptomatic subjects may indicate that the association between symptoms and mucosal inflammation is more complicated than previously thought.
23446217	Role of gluten intake at the time of hepatitis B virus vaccination in the immune response of celiac patients.	Some reports have demonstrated an inadequate response to hepatitis B vaccination in patients affected by celiac disease. The aim of our study was to evaluate hepatitis B vaccination response in relation to gluten exposure status in patients with celiac disease. To measure the gluten exposure status at the time of vaccination, we considered three groups: group A (exposed to gluten), including patients vaccinated as 12-year-old adolescents (the celiac disease diagnosis was established after vaccination); group B (not exposed to gluten), including patients vaccinated as 12-year-old adolescents on a gluten-free diet at the time of vaccination; and group C (infants), including patients vaccinated at birth. The response of celiac patients to hepatitis B vaccination was compared to that of healthy subjects, i.e., those in the control group (group D). This study included 163 celiac patients (group A, 57 patients; group B, 46 patients; and group C, 60 patients) and 48 controls (group D). An inadequate response to hepatitis B immunization was present in 43.9% of patients in group A, 34.8% of patients in group B, 58.3% of patients in group C, and 8.3% of patients in group D (group A versus group D, P < 0.001; group B versus group D, P = 0.002; group C versus group D, P = 0.001) (no significant difference for group A versus group B and group A versus group C was evident). Our data suggest that gluten exposure does not influence the response to hepatitis B immunization and that the human leukocyte antigen probably plays the main immunological role in poor responses to hepatitis B-vaccinated celiac patients.
27941958	Adherence to a Gluten-Free Diet in Mexican Subjects with Gluten-Related Disorders: A High Prevalence of Inadvertent Gluten Intake.	BACKGROUND: The rate of compliance with a gluten-free diet in patients with gluten-related disorders is unknown in most Latin American countries. OBJECTIVE: To study the adherence to a gluten-free diet of Mexican individuals with celiac disease and nonceliac gluten sensitivity at the time of their first medical and nutritional consultation at a tertiary referral center. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed. A specific questionnaire was used to gather information on demographics, clinical condition, and self-reported adherence to a gluten-free diet, and to determine strict compliance and intentional or inadvertent gluten consumption. All questionnaires were applied by a nutritionist with expertise in gluten-related disorders. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients with celiac disease and 24 with non-celiac gluten sensitivity were included. Overall, 46 (57.5%) subjects perceived themselves as strictly adherent; however, inadvertent gluten intake was frequent in both celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity patients (39.2 vs. 33.3%; p = 0.2). Intentional consumption was more prevalent in subjects with celiac disease (48.8 vs. 29.1%; p = 0.048) and individuals with non-celiac gluten sensitivity showed better adherence (37.5 vs. 12.5%; p = 0.035). CONCLUSIONS: The importance of a gluten-free diet is underestimated by Mexican patients with celiac disease. The role of a team with expertise in gluten-related disorders is essential to identify inadvertent gluten intake.
24137038	An orthodontic retainer preventing remission in celiac disease.	Celiac disease is a gluten enteropathy that is treated with dietary elimination of gluten. Exposure to nondietary sources of gluten, which are used in the manufacture of products such as plastics, dental equipment, and cosmetics, can also trigger or exacerbate disease. We report the case of a 9-year-old child who presented with nonspecific abdominal discomfort with abnormal serology for celiac disease. She underwent duodenal biopsies that revealed Marsh 3B histopathology. Despite strict dietary elimination of gluten, she continued to be symptomatic and demonstrate positive serum markers for active disease. It was then discovered that the child was exposed to gluten from her orthodontic retainer that contained a plasticized methacrylate polymer. Gluten is a common additive in plastics. She discontinued its use and demonstrated symptom resolution and complete normalization of serology. All possible sources of gluten, including nondietary, must be considered when managing a child with celiac disease. 
23287617	[Association of celiac disease and cerebral venous thrombosis: report of two cases].	UNLABELLED: Thrombosis events may occur in celiac disease. Thrombophilic risk factors have been reported. INTRODUCTION: To report two cases of cerebral venous thrombosis in celiac disease patients and to determine associated thrombophilic factors. Case 1: a 63-year-old woman was admitted for cerebral venous thrombosis. Her past history included celiac disease which was untreated for the last 10 years. Biological data showed moderate hyperhomocysteinemia and positive reaction for antiphospholipid antibodies. Case 2: a 19-year-old girl was hospitalized for seizures and impaired consciousness. MRA demonstrated longitudinal sinus thrombosis with parietal infarction. Biological findings showed: protein S deficiency and positive reaction for antiendomysium and antigliadin antibodies. Gastroesophageal endoscopy with biopsy showed villous atrophy. Both patients improved under anticoagulant treatment. CONCLUSION: The sites of associated venous thrombosis are generally unusual in celiac disease, yet the cerebral localization is only exceptionally reported. It is essential to search for risk factors. Gluten-free diet remains the mainstay treatment for patients with celiac disease.
27071325	Celiac disease and school food service in Piedmont Region: Evaluation of gluten-free meal.	INTRODUCTION: The Law 123/2005 recognizes celiac disease as a social disease and so Ministry of Public Health annually allocates specific resources to Regions for managing gluten-free meals in school canteens. Therefore in 2009 Piedmont Region approved a specific project, in collaboration with Food Hygiene and Nutrition Department (SIAN) of several ASL (Local Health Authority), including ASL TO3 as regional leader, and the "Italian Celiac Association - Piedmont and Valle d'Aosta". This project was intended to facilitate the natural integration of celiac people in social life. A retrospective analysis of data has been carried out to assess the management of gluten- free meal of school food services in Piedmont Region in 2010. Furthermore the intervention efficacy has been evaluated comparing the critical points observed in 2010 and 2012. METHODS: The object of the study includes primary and secondary schools that have provided gluten-free food service in Piedmont Region. These school were examined by SIAN staff. (the examination included the check of hygienic aspects and qualitative assessment of the meal). The data were collected using the same checklist throughout the region. All data were included in the unified regional system ("Reteunitaria"). RESULTS: The results show that 29% of the sampled schools (277) are acceptable in all eight sections (supply, storage, process analysis, equipment check, packaging and transport, distribution of meals, self-control plan and qualitative assessment), whereas 71% are inadequate for at least one of the profiles (60% does not perform the qualitative valuation of service) and in 18% of schools three to seven insufficiencies are observed. Correlations between the number of total insufficiencies and the most critical sections of the check list were performed (with lower scores in "good") such as process analysis, distribution of meals, self-control plan and qualitative assessment. The analysis process has achieved a high score in the field of deficiency for at least 3 parameters. Schools with a good self-control plan have a significant correlation with schools suitable for the analysis process, instead schools appeared insufficient in the process analysis have an increased chance of being insufficient also in the distribution of meals. The schools that provide a transported meal (municipalities highly populated, generally) have many differences in distribution of meals respect schools that prepare food in the school kitchen. In fact, 88% of school that provide a transported meal achieved an appropriate score in distribution of meals section and collected fewer failures in overall assessment than the others. 120 structures are included in the indirect comparison between the checklist's sections with criticisms, during years 2010 and 2012: in 2010 32% of schools were recorded acceptable in all of the eight sections of the checklist and in 2012 this percentage rose to 54%. An improvement can be observed in all areas, but a statistical significant result do not turn out. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Data show that carry on the control activities of production of gluten free meal in school canteens would be appropriate. Actions focused on improving the methods of preparing meal without gluten were recommended, especially in under populated municipalities with school kitchen on site. The constant presence of ASL staff in school has promoted important changes: cultural change and about the management of allergy and food intolerance. An improvement can be observed: a transition from a suspicion about "special diet" management to an appropriate and responsible management of meals for children and young people suffering from this specific condition.
22367335	Multiple duodenal ulcers: an unexpected finding in celiac disease.	
25840666	Triticum monococcum in patients with celiac disease: a phase II open study on safety of prolonged daily administration.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To assess safety of prolonged daily administration of Triticum monococcum (Tm) using clinical, serological and histological criteria. Tm is an ancient wheat suitable for production of palatable baked goods that contains gluten devoid of strongly immunostimulatory epitopes and potentially safe for celiac disease (CD) patients as suggested by in vitro and ex vivo studies. METHODS: Protocol involved 60-day administration of 100 g/day Tm water biscuits to CD patients in remission on gluten-free diet. Symptoms Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale questionnaire (GSRS) and CD-related serology were assessed at time (T) 0, T30 and T60 days, and duodenal biopsy was obtained at T0 and T60. RESULTS: Eight patients (F/M: 6/2, median age 26) were enrolled. One patient was excluded at T0 because of positive serology, and two patients dropped out because of symptoms recurrence. In the five patients completing the study, there was no difference in GSRS score at T0 to T60. All patients had Marsh II lesion at T0, four had Marsh III and one had recurrence of dermatitis herpetiformis at T60. CD-related antibodies converted from negative to positive at T60 in three patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that Tm is toxic for CD patients as judged on histological and serological criteria, but it was well tolerated by the majority of patients, suggesting that Tm is not a safe cereal for celiacs, but that it may be of value for patients with gluten sensitivity or for prevention of CD.
22743287	Whipple disease a century after the initial description: increased recognition of unusual presentations, autoimmune comorbidities, and therapy effects.	Although Whipple disease was described over a century ago, it remains challenging to recognize. To better understand the presentation of Whipple disease, we undertook a clinicopathologic study of our experience since implementation of the Whipple immunohistochemical stain. Twenty-three biopsy specimens from 15 patients were identified, and an association with immunomodulatory conditions was noted. Whipple disease involved the small intestine (19), brain (2), breast (1), and retroperitoneum (1). Whipple disease was suspected by 3 clinicians and by the majority of pathologists (9). Alternative clinical impressions included lymphoma, celiac disease, Crohn vasculitis, sepsis, an inflammatory process, liposarcoma, rheumatoid arthritis, seizure disorder, cerebrovascular accident, xanthoma, and central nervous system neoplasm. The nonspecific nature of the disease presentation likely contributed to the extended period between onset of symptoms and a definitive diagnosis, which ranged from at least 1 year to over 10 years. One patient died of unknown causes, and both patients with detailed follow-up had clinically persistent disease. We also describe Whipple disease with therapy effects, including partial and complete histologic treatment effects. Awareness of the unusual clinicopathologic presentations of Whipple disease is essential for timely diagnosis of this potentially lethal disease.
33651455	Occupational IgE-mediated psyllium allergy in contemporary gluten-free and vegan baking: A case of allergic rhinitis.	Psyllium (from Plantago ovata; ispaghula) is used as a dietary supplement and is supplied in the form of husk, granules, capsules, or powder. Consumers using psyllium-containing laxatives, healthcare workers handling these, and pharmaceutical workers in laxative-manufacturing plants are known to be at risk of sensitization and subsequent rhinitis, asthma, contact urticaria, and even anaphylaxis. To our knowledge, the case we present here is the first of baker's immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated occupational allergy due to psyllium exposure. Our patient, a 24-year-old female baker with no previous allergies, was referred to our clinic with suspected occupational rhinitis. After 1 year of baking with cereal flour or gluten-free flour-mix, she began to suffer from rhino-conjunctival symptoms during workdays. Skin prick tests with agents from the patient's workplace revealed allergies not only to wheat and rye flours but also to psyllium, with a remarkable 10 mm wheal. Subsequently, nasal provocation tests confirmed occupational allergic rhinitis to psyllium. We also found work-related sensitization to buckwheat, which she used in gluten-free baking. Due to the increased prevalence of celiac disease and the popularity of gluten-free and vegan food, psyllium has recently become a common ingredient in baking, used as a substitute for gluten or eggs. Bakers handle allergens such as these in high concentrations and this may lie behind the emergence of respiratory and dermal symptoms. It is essential to consider new or recenlty introduced materials as possible allergens if it is suspected that a baker has work-related respiratory or allergic symptoms.
28065527	Iron deficiency anemia despite effective gluten-free diet in celiac disease: Diagnostic role of small bowel capsule endoscopy.	BACKGROUND & AIM: Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is associated with celiac disease (CD). Although gluten-free diet (GFD) is an efficient treatment for CD, IDA remains an occasional finding during follow-up and correlates to inadequate gluten exclusion. Little is known regarding persistent IDA despite effective GFD. We aimed to evaluate the role of small bowel capsule endoscopy (SBCE) in this setting. METHODS: We prospectively included consecutive patients undergoing GFD for >=24 months with persistent concomitant IDA. Patients were assessed serologically and, if negative, underwent endoscopic evaluation. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients underwent esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGD), colonoscopy and SBCE. Altogether, 11 patients resulted positive. EGD showed mucosal lesions in 7: erosive gastritis (n=3), erosive duodenitis (n=1), active CD (n=3). Colonoscopy showed hemorrhoids in 2. SBCE was positive in 6 cases: erosive jejunitis (n=3, 1 eventually diagnosed as refractory CD, 2 as Crohn's disease), angiodysplasias (n=2), lymphangectasia (n=1). Some overlap was observed between procedures, since in 4 subjects EGD and SBCE produced significant findings. However, in 3 cases SBCE documented severe disease, not found at EGD. Hypoalbuminemia was significantly associated with a positive SBCE outcome (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: SBCE yielded significant findings in 23% of celiacs with persistent IDA despite adequate GFD. These were associated to hypoalbuminemia, indicating their occurrence at more severe stages of the disease.
33198212	Adherence to the Gluten-Free Diet during the Lockdown for COVID-19 Pandemic: A Web-Based Survey of Italian Subjects with Celiac Disease.	We aimed to assess the perceived impact of the lockdown, imposed to control the spreading of COVID-19, on the adherence of Italian celiac disease (CD) subjects to the gluten-free diet by a web-based survey. A total of 1983 responses were analyzed, 1614 (81.4%) by CD adults and 369 (18.6%) by parents/caregivers of CD children/adolescents. The compliance with the GFD was unchanged for 69% of the adults and 70% of the children, and improved for 29% of both. The factors increasing the probability to report stricter compliance were the presence of CD symptoms in the last year before the lockdown (odds ratio (OR) 1.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.46-2.26), a partial usual adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD) (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.2-3.06), and having tried recipes with naturally gluten-free ingredients more than usual (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.28-1.96) for adults; the presence of CD symptoms in the last year (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.21-3.47), still positive CD antibodies (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.14-3.13), and other family members with CD (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.3-3.85) for children/adolescents. Therefore, the lockdown led to a reported improved adherence to the GFD in one-third of the respondents, in particular in those with previous worse disease control, offering the opportunity to avoid sources of contamination/transgression and increase the use of naturally gluten-free products.
23852141	Chronic pancreatitis.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We review selected important clinical observations reported in 2012. RECENT FINDINGS: Celiac disease is a risk factor for pancreatitis. Patients with recurrent acute pancreatitis likely have chronic pancreatitis, do not benefit from pancreatic sphincterotomy, and may not benefit from biliary sphincterotomy. Analysis of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) images with an artificial neural network (ANN) program may improve chronic pancreatitis diagnosis compared with clinical interpretation of images. In a multicenter, randomized controlled trial of chronic pancreatitis patients, 90 000 USP U of pancreatin with meals decreased fat malabsorption compared with placebo. Detection of visceral pain in chronic pancreatitis predicts pain relief from various treatments, but nonvisceral pain due to altered central pain processing may respond to agents such as pregabalin. Predictors of surgical pain relief include onset of symptoms less than 3 years and preoperatively no opioid use and less than five endoscopic procedures. Total pancreatectomy for presumed painful chronic pancreatitis remains controversial. SUMMARY: Celiacs are at risk for pancreatitis. The diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis may be enhanced by ANN analysis of EUS imaging. Treatment of fat malabsorption requires 90,000 USP U of lipase with meals. Relief of pain from organ directed treatment of chronic pancreatitis may depend upon timing of interventions and whether pain is visceral or nonvisceral.
33964267	Cystic Lesions of Celiac Disease.	
22298027	Maize prolamins resistant to peptic-tryptic digestion maintain immune-recognition by IgA from some celiac disease patients.	Maize is used as an alternative to wheat to elaborate food stuffs for celiac patients in a gluten-free diet.However, some maize prolamins (zeins) contain amino acid sequences that resemble the wheat gluten immunodominant peptides and their integrity after gastrointestinal proteolysisis unknown. In this study, the celiac IgA-immunoreactivity to zeins from raw or nixtamalized grains, before and after peptic/tryptic digestion was evaluated and their possible immunogenicity was investigated by in silico methods.IgA from some celiac patients with HLA-DQ2 or DQ8 haplotypes recognized two alpha-zeins even after peptic/ tryptic proteolysis. However, digestion affected zeins after denaturation, reduction, and alkylation, used for identification of prolamins as alpha-zein A20 and A30 by MS/MS sequencing. An in silico analysis indicated that other zeins contain similar sequences, or sequences that may bind even better to the HLA-DQ2/DQ8 molecules compared to the already identified ones. Results concur to indicate that relative abundance of these zeins, along with factors affecting their resistance to proteolysis, may be of paramount clinical relevance, and the use of maize in the formulation and preparation of gluten-free foods must be reevaluated in some cases of celiac disease.
35934174	The impact of gluten-free diet on growth, metabolic control and quality of life in youth with type 1 diabetes and celiac disease: A systematic review.	AIMS: To evaluate the impact of gluten free diet (GFD) on growth, metabolic control and quality of life in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and celiac disease (CD). METHODS: A systematic search was performed including studies published in the last 15 years. PICOS framework was used in the selection process and evidence was assessed using the GRADE system. RESULTS: Overall, studies comparing youth with T1D + CD on GFD to those with T1D only, showed no significant differences in growth parameters, HbA1c, number of episodes of hypoglycemia, total daily insulin doses. Studies assessing the effect of GFD introduction showed stable BMI and HbA1c. Only two studies assessed QoL of life, which was not different between T1D + CD vs T1D only youth, as well as pre- and post-CD diagnosis and introduction of GFD. CONCLUSION: This systematic review, including only studies of moderate-high evidence quality level and reporting data on objectively assessed adherence to GFD, highlights that adherence to GFD in youth with T1D + CD leads to regular growth, stable BMI, without any negative effect on HbA1c and insulin requirements. Although assessed in few studies, lipid profile and QoL improved with the introduction of GFD.
36033766	Current knowledge and "myths" about celiac disease among physicians in the Republic of Kazakhstan: A countrywide cross-sectional study.	Background: Celiac disease (CD) is a common genetically predisposed autoimmune condition affecting the gut and other organs. Disease awareness is one of the key components of early case identification. This study aimed to assess awareness about CD among primary care physicians, who are the front-liners in suspecting the diagnosis, and other medical specialists. Methods and findings: The questionnaire for this survey-based study was created based on the latest international guidelines on CD and included a consent form, 5 general questions (age, gender, etc.), and 10 specific questions concerning CD. Overall, 232 respondents from 13 country provinces (out of 14) and two republican cities were recruited for this study. Of them, 110 (47.4%) were primary care physicians and 122 (52.6%) other medical specialists, including 10 (4.3%) gastroenterologists. A scoring system was used to classify the level of awareness of participants into 3 categories, namely, poor, fair, and good. Analysis of responses revealed poor awareness in 59.4% of physicians, associated with work in republican/province/district/rural/village hospitals (p = 0.004), male gender (p = 0.006), and age of 40-50 years (p = 0.02). The most common "myths" about CD were the following: "symptoms are always obvious in children" or "in adults" (92.5 or 88.4% of respondents, respectively); "genetic mutation HLA DQ2/DQ8 causes the development of CD in all carriers of the mutation" (51.3%); "CD is a disease of children only" (12.5%); and "is triggered by dairy products" (8.6%). Genotyping of HLA DQ genes has been recommended in case of CD suspicion by every third respondent and was advocated as a "golden standard" confirmatory test by every fifth respondent. A quarter of respondents revealed their incorrect treatment strategies: gluten-free diet for 1 month, dairy-free diet, Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy, or responded that did not know how to treat. Overall, 93.5% of respondents expressed intention to learn more about CD, while the rest 6.5% thought that they knew enough, although their knowledge was poor. Conclusion: This study revealed a poor level of awareness among physicians in Kazakhstan and identified common misconceptions about CD, which potentially could lead to incorrect application of diagnostic tests, delay in diagnosis, and inefficient treatment. Development and implementation of educational programs as well as promotion of self-learning would increase awareness and unravel misconceptions.
32054274	Atrophic enteropathy refractory to a gluten-free diet: what should we consider?	Olmesartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist used for the treatment of blood hypertension. Long-term use has been associated with diarrhea and sometimes intestinal involvement may mimic enteropathies such as celiac disease. Clinicians should consider drugs within the differential diagnosis of enteropathies. We report the case of a female who sought medical help for malabsorptive symptoms and was finally diagnosed with olmesartan-associated gastritis and atrophic enteropathy.
27417565	Direct Costs in Patients with Celiac Disease in the USA: A Retrospective Claims Analysis.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CeD) is an autoimmune disease triggered by gluten ingestion. AIM: We assessed total direct costs burden associated with CeD in patients with CeD versus patients without CeD using administrative claims data. METHODS: Patients with CeD (cases) with >=1 occurrences of CeD diagnosis were selected at a randomly chosen date (index date) from the OptumHealth Reporting and Insights database from 01/01/1998 through 03/31/2013. Cases were continuously enrolled throughout baseline (1 year before index date) and study (1 year after index date) periods. Cases were categorized as full remission and partial remission and matched 1:1 based on age, sex, region, index date, company, and employment status. Total all-cause and CeD-related costs were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 12,187 cases were matched with an equal number of controls. Mean total all-cause costs were $12,217 in cases versus $4935 in controls (P < 0.0001). In full remission (N = 10,181 [83.5 %]) and partial remission (N = 2006 [16.5 %]) cases, mean total all-cause direct costs (cases versus controls) were $11,038 versus $4962 and $18,206 versus $4796, respectively. All-cause medical costs ($9839 for all cases, $8723 for full remission cases, $15,499 for partial remission cases) accounted for the majority of all-cause total costs and included outpatient costs ($6675; $6456; and $7785, respectively) and hospitalizations ($2776; $1963; and $6906, respectively). CeD-related medical costs were 13 and 27 % of all-cause medical costs for all cases and partial remission cases, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CeD and partial remission of CeD incurred significantly higher (2.5 and 3.8 times) total all-cause costs compared with matched controls.
28078381	Celiac disease: a clinical review.	Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated inflammatory enteropathy triggered by gluten exposure in genetically susceptible individuals. It has a high prevalence approaching 1% of the US population. A high index of suspicion is warranted to diagnose CD as frequently patients present with extraintestinal or atypical manifestations. CD is diagnosed by a combination of serum serologies and duodenal biopsies. The majority of patients will respond to a lifelong gluten-free diet which is the cornerstone of therapy. Complications such as refractory CD, ulcerative jejunoileitis, enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma and small bowel adenocarcinoma occur in a minority of patients.
29727384	Response to: 'Schizophrenia and celiac disease: which is the role of the gluten-free diet?'	
27261897	Complex Relationships Between Food, Diet, and the Microbiome.	Diet is a risk factor in several medically important disease states, including obesity, celiac disease, and functional gastrointestinal disorders. Modification of diet can prevent, treat, or alleviate some of the symptoms associated with these diseases and improve general health. It is important to provide patients with simple dietary recommendations to increase the probability of successful implementation. These recommendations include increasing vegetable, fruit, and fiber intake, consuming lean protein sources to enhance satiety, avoiding or severely limiting highly processed foods, and reducing portion sizes for overweight and obese patients.
24084055	Vitamin and mineral deficiencies are highly prevalent in newly diagnosed celiac disease patients.	Malabsorption, weight loss and vitamin/mineral-deficiencies characterize classical celiac disease (CD). This study aimed to assess the nutritional and vitamin/mineral status of current "early diagnosed" untreated adult CD-patients in the Netherlands. Newly diagnosed adult CD-patients were included (n = 80, 42.8 +- 15.1 years) and a comparable sample of 24 healthy Dutch subjects was added to compare vitamin concentrations. Nutritional status and serum concentrations of folic acid, vitamin A, B6, B12, and (25-hydroxy) D, zinc, haemoglobin (Hb) and ferritin were determined (before prescribing gluten free diet). Almost all CD-patients (87%) had at least one value below the lower limit of reference. Specifically, for vitamin A, 7.5% of patients showed deficient levels, for vitamin B6 14.5%, folic acid 20%, and vitamin B12 19%. Likewise, zinc deficiency was observed in 67% of the CD-patients, 46% had decreased iron storage, and 32% had anaemia. Overall, 17% were malnourished (>10% undesired weight loss), 22% of the women were underweight (Body Mass Index (BMI) < 18.5), and 29% of the patients were overweight (BMI > 25). Vitamin deficiencies were barely seen in healthy controls, with the exception of vitamin B12. Vitamin/mineral deficiencies were counter-intuitively not associated with a (higher) grade of histological intestinal damage or (impaired) nutritional status. In conclusion, vitamin/mineral deficiencies are still common in newly "early diagnosed" CD-patients, even though the prevalence of obesity at initial diagnosis is rising. Extensive nutritional assessments seem warranted to guide nutritional advices and follow-up in CD treatment.
32843265	Development and effectiveness assessment of a Persian-language smartphone application for celiac patients: A randomized controlled clinical trial.	OBJECTIVES: We aimed to design a Persian-language application for celiac patients and assess its effectiveness on patients` knowledge and adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: In the present randomized controlled clinical trial, 60 patients were randomly assigned to receive education through a smartphone application (n = 30) or conventional clinical education (n = 30). The primary outcomes were assessing knowledge about celiac disease and GFD, and adherence to GFD that were assessed at baseline and three months after interventions. The knowledge and adherence were assessed by a valid author-designed knowledge questionnaire and the validated celiac disease adherence test (CDAT) respectively. RESULTS: The mean disease duration was 4.38 +- 3.27 years. The mean post-intervention score of knowledge about gluten-free foods was significantly higher in the intervention group compared with the placebo group after adjusting for baseline values and characteristics (p-value = 0.03). There was a significant difference in post-intervention CDAT values between the two groups (p-value = 0.01). CONCLUSION: The smartphone application had a significant effect on celiac patients` knowledge about gluten-free foods and adherence to GFD. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The smartphone applications can be designed according to each country's particular circumstances and can be suggested by nutritionists and physicians to use by celiac patients.
34716736	Association of the use of diabetes technology with HbA1c and BMI-SDS in an international cohort of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes: The SWEET project experience.	OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between the use of diabetes technology (insulin pump [CSII], glucose sensor [CGM] or both) and metabolic control (HbA1c) as well as body adiposity (BMI-SDS) over-time in a cohort of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D), that have never used these technologies before. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Four thousand six hundred forty three T1D patients (2-18 years, T1D >=1 year, without celiac disease, no CSII and/or CGM before 2016) participating in the SWEET prospective multicenter diabetes registry, were enrolled. Data were collected at two points (2016; 2019). Metabolic control was assessed by glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and body adiposity by BMI-SDS (WHO). Patients were categorized by treatment modality (multiple daily injections [MDI] or CSII) and the use or not of CGM. Linear regression models, adjusted for age, gender, duration of diabetes and region, were applied to assess differences in HbA1c and BMI-SDS among patient groups. RESULTS: The proportion of patients using MDI with CGM and CSII with CGM significantly increased from 2016 to 2019 (7.2%-25.7%, 7.8%-27.8% respectively; p < 0.001). Linear regression models showed a significantly lower HbA1c in groups that switched from MDI to CSII with or without CGM (p < 0.001), but a higher BMI-SDS (from MDI without CGM to CSII with CGM p < 0.05; from MDI without CGM to CSII without CGM p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Switching from MDI to CSII is significantly associated with improvement in glycemic control but increased BMI-SDS over-time. Diabetes technology may improve glucose control in youths with T1D although further strategies to prevent excess fat accumulation are needed.
30885888	Neurologic Deficits in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Celiac Disease Are Frequent and Linked With Autoimmunity to Transglutaminase 6.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder induced by ingestion of gluten that affects 1% of the population and is characterized by gastrointestinal symptoms, weight loss, and anemia. We evaluated the presence of neurologic deficits and investigated whether the presence of antibodies to Transglutaminase 6 (TG6) increases the risk of neurologic defects in patients with a new diagnosis of celiac disease. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study at a secondary-care gastroenterology center of 100 consecutive patients who received a new diagnosis of celiac disease based on gastroscopy and duodenal biopsy. We collected data on neurologic history, and patients were evaluated in a clinical examination along with magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy of the cerebellum, and measurements of antibodies against TG6 in serum samples. The first 52 patients recruited underwent repeat MR spectroscopy at 1 year after a gluten-free diet (GFD). The primary aim was to establish if detection of antibodies against TG6 can be used to identify patients with celiac disease and neurologic dysfunction. RESULTS: Gait instability was reported in 24% of the patients, persisting sensory symptoms in 12%, and frequent headaches in 42%. Gait ataxia was found in 29% of patients, nystagmus in 11%, and distal sensory loss in 10%. Sixty percent of patients had abnormal results from magnetic resonance imaging, 47% had abnormal results from MR spectroscopy of the cerebellum, and 25% had brain white matter lesions beyond that expected for their age group. Antibodies against TG6 were detected in serum samples from 40% of patients-these patients had significant atrophy of subcortical brain regions compared with patients without TG6 autoantibodies. In patients with abnormal results from MR spectroscopy of the cerebellum, those on the GFD had improvements detected in the repeat MR spectroscopy 1 year later. CONCLUSIONS: In a prospective cohort study of patients with a new diagnosis of celiac disease at a gastroenterology clinic, neurologic deficits were common and 40% had circulating antibodies against TG6. We observed a significant reduction in volume of specific brain regions in patients with TG6 autoantibodies, providing evidence for a link between autoimmunity to TG6 and brain atrophy in patients with celiac disease. There is a need for early diagnosis, increased awareness of the neurologic manifestations among clinicians, and reinforcement of adherence to a strict GFD by patients to avoid permanent neurologic disability.
23221576	The million-dollar question: is "gluten-free" food safe for patients with celiac disease?	
38467384	Biopsy proteome scoring to determine mucosal remodeling in celiac disease.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Histological evaluation of gut biopsies is a cornerstone for diagnosis and management of celiac disease (CeD). Despite its wide use, the method depends on proper biopsy orientation, and it suffers from inter-observer variability. Biopsy proteome measurement reporting on tissue state can be obtained by mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. Here we aimed to transform biopsy proteome data into numerical scores that give observer-independent measures of mucosal remodeling in CeD. METHODS: A pipeline using glass-mounted FFPE sections for MS-based proteome analysis was established. Proteome data was converted to numerical scores using two complementary approaches; a rank-based enrichment score and a score based on machine-learning employing logistic regression. The two scoring approaches were compared to each other and to histology analyzing 18 CeD patients with biopsies collected before and after treatment with gluten-free diet as well as biopsies from CeD patients with varying degree of remission (n = 22). Biopsies from non-CeD individuals (n = 32) were also analyzed. RESULTS: The method yielded reliable proteome scoring of both unstained and H&E-stained glass-mounted sections. The scores of the two approaches are highly correlated reflecting that both approaches pick up proteome changes in the same biological pathways. The proteome scores correlated with villus height to crypt depth ratio. Thus, the method is able to score biopsies with poor orientation. CONCLUSION: Biopsy proteome scores give reliable observer and orientation-independent measures of mucosal remodeling in CeD. The proteomic method can readily be implemented by non-expert laboratories in parallel to histology assessment and easily scaled for clinical trial settings.
22185928	Celiac disease and lamellar ichthyosis. Case study analysis and review of the literature.	We describe a 5-year-old female affected by lamellar ichthyosis, diagnosed in the first month of life, who attended our pediatric clinic for Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia. The evidence of severe osteoporosis with hyperparathyroidism secondary to malabsorption suggested the occurrence of celiac disease. Endoscopy with multiple duodenal biopsies revealed total villous atrophy. The child started a gluten-free diet, supported by oral calcium and vitamin D. After 1-year follow-up, the girl showed complete normalization of bone mineral density. The introduction of the gluten-free diet did not lead to lesion repair, but the child reported significant improvement of her quality of life.
28140462	Physiopathology and Management of Gluten-Induced Celiac Disease.	Proline- and glutamine-rich gluten proteins are one of the major constituents of cereal dietary proteins, which are largely resistant to complete cleavage by the human gastrointestinal (GI) digestive enzymes. Partial digestion of gluten generates approximately 35 amino acids (aa) immunomodulatory peptides which activate T-cell-mediated immune system, followed by immunological inflammation of mucosa leading to the onset of celiac disease (CD). CD is an autoimmune disease associated with HLA-DQ2/DQ8 polymorphism and dysbiosis of gut microbiota. CD is either diagnosed using duodenal mucosal biopsis or serological testing for transglutaminase 2 (TG2) specific antibodies (IgA and IgG). Current therapy for CD management is gluten-free diet, while other therapies like glutenase, probiotics, immunomodulation, jamming of HLA-DQ2, inhibition of TG2, and gluten tolerance aided by gluten tolerizing vaccines are being developed.
30561390	Thyroid and celiac disease in pediatric age: a literature review.	Chronic autoimmune thyroid disease or Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) and Graves-Basedow disease (GD) are the main autoimmune thyroid diseases in pediatric age. Both are characterized by the production of anti-thyroid antibodies, by an infiltration of autoreactive B and T lymphocytes into the thyroid parenchyma and by alterations in thyroid function (hyperthyroidism in GD, normal function or subclinical hypothyroidism in HT with possible evolution towards manifest hypothyroidism). Celiac disease (CD) is a systemic autoimmune disease caused by gluten ingestion in genetically predisposed subjects, its prevalence is around 1% in Western Countries. It presents with a pathognomonic enteropathy, a variety of clinical manifestations, positivity for specific antibodies, positivity for typical haplotypes HLA DQ2/DQ8. The clinical manifestations may vary among four types: typical, atypical, silent and latent. Diagnosis can be made in presence of specific histopathologic findings in duodenal biopsies and antibodies positivity. Celiac disease is associated to various endocrine autoimmunities such as thyropathies, diabetes mellitus type 1, Addison disease, multiendocrine syndromes. The most frequent associated thyropaties are HT and GD. The present review aims to explore the associations between thyropathies and celiac disease in pediatric age.
30453479	Descriptive Study of the Different Tools Used to Evaluate the Adherence to a Gluten-Free Diet in Celiac Disease Patients.	Celiac disease (CD) is a genetically conditioned autoimmune process that appears in susceptible people. It can affect people of any age, and slightly predominates in females. It has a fairly homogenous global distribution, with an average prevalence of 1-2%, the frequency having increased in recent decades. The only effective treatment is a strict and permanent gluten-free diet (GFD), although the level of compliance is poor, at about 50% of cases. To monitor the effectiveness of the GFD, several procedures involving various approaches are employed: (a) Periodic visits by expert Nutritionists; (b) Clinical follow-up; (c) Serological time controls of specific antibodies; (d) Serial endoscopies with collection of duodenal biopsies; (e) Use of structured questionnaires; and (f) Determination of gluten peptides derived from gluten in faeces and/or urine. All of these procedures are useful when applied, alone or in combination, depending on the cases. Some patients will only need to consult to their doctors, while others will require a multidisciplinary approach to assess their compliance with the GFD. In children, normalization of duodenal mucosa was achieved in 95% of cases within two years, while it is more delayed in adults, whose mucosa take longer time (3-5 years) to heal completely.
36631740	Short and long-term follow-up and clinical outcomes in patients with celiac disease in a large private practice setting.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is caused by an immune response to gluten and treatment is adherence to a gluten-free diet. Guidelines from studies in large academic settings recommend registered dietitian (RD) referrals at time of diagnosis and periodic testing for micronutrient deficiencies. There is limited data to guide follow-up parameters in a large, community-based practice. The purpose of this study was to evaluate guideline adherence in this setting. METHODS: This retrospective study conducted in 2019 assessed CD care based on follow-up rates, micronutrient testing, symptoms, and serology results in cohorts with and without RD referrals. Patients in this study were followed at Rockford Gastroenterology Associates (RGA): a large, private GI practice. Patients were included if they had a diagnosis of CD from 1/2014 through 12/2018, based on positive serology and/or duodenal biopsy. Patient data was collected by chart review and analyzed through Microsoft Excel. Fisher's exact and Chi-square tests were used for the statistical analysis and were calculated through the Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) software. RESULTS: 320 patients were initially reviewed and a cohort of 126 patients met inclusion criteria. 69.8% had a RD referral. 65.9% had at least one lab test order for any of the 6 micronutrients. Of 63 patients tested for iron, 11 were iron deficient (8 with RD referral). Of 64 patients tested for vitamin D, 21 were deficient (17 with referral). 80.2% attended at least one follow-up appointment, but 34.9% had only one follow-up visit over a mean follow up duration of 5.82 months. 79 patients had follow-up data for symptoms or serology and were separated into 4 categories (with vs. without RD referral): (1) asymptomatic and negative serology (32% vs. 26%), (2) symptomatic and negative serology (28% vs. 16%), (3) asymptomatic and positive serology (27% vs. 32%), (4) symptomatic and positive serology (13% vs. 26%). Category 1 yielded a fisher exact test value of 2.62 (p = 0.466). CONCLUSIONS: RD referral, micronutrient testing, and close follow-up are important parameters that affect outcomes in patients with CD. Rates for dietitian referral, some micronutrient testing and follow-up visits were higher than 50%, though results from this study were not statistically significant. Further standardization of follow-up testing and monitoring for CD will help minimize discrepancies between community-based and large, academic GI practices.
26153762	Responsive population dynamics and wide seeding into the duodenal lamina propria of transglutaminase-2-specific plasma cells in celiac disease.	A hallmark of celiac disease is autoantibodies to transglutaminase 2 (TG2). By visualizing TG2-specific antibodies by antigen staining of affected gut tissue, we identified TG2-specific plasma cells in the lamina propria as well as antibodies in the subepithelial layer, inside the epithelium, and at the brush border. The frequency of TG2-specific plasma cells were found not to correlate with serum antibody titers, suggesting that antibody production at other sites may contribute to serum antibody levels. Upon commencement of a gluten-free diet, the frequency of TG2-specific plasma cells in the lesion dropped dramatically within 6 months, yet some cells remained. The frequency of TG2-specific plasma cells in the celiac lesion is thus dynamically regulated in response to gluten exposure. Laser microdissection of plasma cell patches, followed by antibody gene sequencing, demonstrated that clonal cells were seeded in distinct areas of the mucosa. This was confirmed by immunoglobulin heavy chain repertoire analysis of plasma cells isolated from individual biopsies of two untreated patients, both for TG2-specific and non-TG2-specific cells. Our results shed new light on the processes underlying the B-cell response in celiac disease, and the approach of staining for antigen-specific antibodies should be applicable to other antibody-mediated diseases. 
33361039	Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth among patients with celiac disease unresponsive to a gluten free diet.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Little is known about the relationship between small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and celiac disease (CeD) in patients who are unresponsive to a gluten-free diet (GFD). This study aimed to determine the SIBO prevalence in patients with CeD who are unresponsive to a GFD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a case-control study from July 2012 to September 2014. We included 32 patients with CeD who were unresponsive to a GFD and 52 healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were obtained from patients' medical records. Antitissue transglutaminase antibody determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was recorded, and lactulose hydrogen breath test (LHBT) was used to detect SIBO in all participants. Microbiological analysis, including jejunal aspirates obtained using upper endoscopy, was performed for only 20 patients with CeD. RESULTS: A total of 10 (31%) of 32 patients with CeD and 4 (7.7%) of 52 controls tested positive for LHBT, with a statistically significant difference (p=0.007). Of 20 cultures, 3 (15%) were positive with no statistically significant correlation between the cultures and LHBT (p=0.05). In a subgroup analysis of children who were 18 years old or younger, 7/24 (29.2%) patients with CeD had a positive LHBT compared with 3/32 (9.4%) controls, but this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.08). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of SIBO was 31% in unresponsive patients with CeD according to LHBT and 15% in the quantitative culture of the jejunal aspirate, which is comparable with the published Western literature.
30201353	Is It a Refractory Celiac Disease?	
32810304	Gluten and skin disease beyond dermatitis herpetiformis: a review.	Gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley, is known to cause an immune reaction in patients with celiac disease (CD) resulting in small bowel villous atrophy and impaired nutrient absorption and cutaneous manifestations in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). It is common that patients associate skin conditions with their diet, and the advantages of a gluten-free diet (GFD) are brought up frequently. Indeed, there is evidence that certain dermatologic conditions can respond to a GFD, especially for those with concomitant CD and DH. In the last decade, new data have become available on the significance of gluten in skin disease. Herein, we review the role of gluten and a GFD on various cutaneous diseases beyond DH.
26604647	Surgery in (pre)malignant celiac disease.	AIM: To report the outcome of surgery in patients with (pre)malignant conditions of celiac disease (CD) and the impact on survival. METHODS: A total of 40 patients with (pre)malignant conditions of CD, ulcerative jejunitis (n = 5) and enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL) (n = 35), who underwent surgery between 2002 and 2013 were retrospectively evaluated. Data on indications, operative procedure, post-operative morbidity and mortality, adjuvant therapy and overall survival (OS) were collected. Eleven patients with EATL who underwent chemotherapy without resection were included as a control group for survival analysis. Patients were followed-up every three months during the first year and at 6-mo intervals thereafter. RESULTS: Mean age at resection was 62 years. The majority of patients (63%) underwent elective laparotomy. Functional stenosis (n = 13) and perforation (n = 12) were the major indications for surgery. In 70% of patients radical resection was performed. Early postoperative complications, mainly due to leakage or sepsis, occurred in 14/40 (35%) of patients. Eight patients required reoperation. More patients who underwent resection in the acute setting (n = 3, 20%) died compared to patients treated in the elective setting. With a median follow-up of 20 mo, seven patients (18%) required reoperation due to long-term complications. Significantly more patients who underwent acute surgery could not be treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients who first underwent surgical resection showed significantly better OS than patients who received chemotherapy without resection. CONCLUSION: Although the complication rate is high, the preferred first step of treatment in (pre)malignant CD consists of local resection as early as possible to improve survival.
22385166	Functional replacements for gluten.	Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated disease triggered in genetically susceptible individuals by ingested gluten from wheat, rye, barley, and other closely related cereal grains. Currently, the only therapy able to normalize the clinical and histological manifestation of the disease is a strict and life-long gluten-free (GF) diet. The replacement of gluten presents a significant technological challenge, as it is an essential structure-building protein, which is necessary for formulating high-quality baked goods. The objective of this paper is to review some basics about CD, its current prevalence, and the recent advances in the preparation of high-quality GF breads using GF flours, starches, hydrocolloids, gums, and novel functional ingredients and technologies.
26790575	The urinary inflammatory profile in gluten free diet-adherent adolescents with type 1 diabetes and celiac disease.	AIMS: Our objective was to characterize urinary cytokine/chemokine excretion in adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and celiac disease (CD) adhering to gluten free diet (GFD) compared to matched T1D patients and healthy control (HC) group from an existing cohort. METHODS: Eighteen T1D+CD+GFD patients aged 10-16years were identified and matched 2:1 for age, sex, diabetes duration and glycated hemoglobin to 36 T1D subjects and 36 HC. T1D+CD+GFD patients were adherent with a GFD. Urine and serum levels of cytokines/chemokines as well as baseline clinical and laboratory variables were assessed. RESULTS: T1D+CD+GFD patients exhibited lower levels of urinary IL-1B, IL-4, IL-5 (p<0.05) and IFN-gamma, IL-8 and G-CSF levels (p<0.07) compared with T1D patients. Urinary biomarker levels between T1D+CD+GFD and HC were mostly similar. In contrast, urinary FGF-2, Flt-3, IL-1B, IL-1RA, IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-15, MIP-1beta, and TNF-beta (p<0.05) were higher in T1D patients compared to HC. Similar levels of inflammatory markers were seen in the serum for all 3 groups. CONCLUSIONS: T1D+CD+GFD patients demonstrated decreased urinary inflammatory cytokine/chemokines compared to T1D and some similar to HC, which is suggestive of a potential modulatory role of treated CD on urinary markers.
38636679	Clinical presentation and spectrum of gluten symptomatology in celiac disease.	Views on the clinical presentation and symptomatology of celiac disease have evolved alongside advances in disease detection and understanding of disease pathogenesis. While historically regarded a pediatric illness characterized by malabsorption, it is now better viewed as an immune illness of gluten-specific T cells with systemic manifestations affecting all ages. Its broad presentation, including frequent extraintestinal manifestations and asymptomatic disease, contributes to suboptimal disease detection. Adverse symptoms greatly impact patient quality of life and can result from chronic gluten exposure in untreated disease or those poorly responsive to the gluten free diet and can also present as acute symptoms after episodic gluten exposure. Functional gastrointestinal disease is a common comorbidity. Biomarkers like interleukin-2 that are highly sensitive and specific for celiac disease highlight a role for gluten-specific T cells in acute gluten symptomatology. A mechanistic understanding of symptoms will inform approaches to better measure and effectively treat them.
21304317	Association of celiac disease and hereditary angioedema due to C1-inhibitor deficiency. Screening patients with hereditary angioedema for celiac disease: is it worth the effort?	OBJECTIVE: Hereditary angioedema due to C1-inhibitor deficiency is a life-threatening condition, which manifests as edematous attacks involving subcutaneous tissues and/or the upper airway/gastrointestinal mucosa. Celiac disease is a gluten-sensitive small intestinal disorder that can lead to severe villous atrophy, malabsorption, and malignancy. Both hereditary angioedema and celiac disease may present with abdominal symptoms. Our aim was to study the occurrence of celiac disease in the hereditary angioedema population, as well as to analyze the clinical course of cases with both diseases. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-eight patients with hereditary angioedema were screened for celiac disease, using serological methods [antiendomysial antibodies-immunoglobulin A (IgA), antiendomysial antibodies-IgG and tissue transglutaminase-IgA, tissue transglutaminase-IgG]. Clinical data of a child with hereditary angioedema and celiac disease diagnosed earlier were added to the dataset to be analyzed. Thus, the total number of patients was 129, comprising 107 adults and 22 pediatric patients. In patients with celiac disease, molecular genetics analysis (human leukocyte antigen-DQA1, human leukocyte antigen-DQB1) was carried out along with the introduction of a gluten-free diet and regular follow-up. RESULTS: Four out of the 22 children were diagnosed with celiac disease in our hereditary angioedema population. The prevalence of celiac disease among our pediatric patients with hereditary angioedema (22 children) was higher than in the general population (18.1 vs. 1.2%). Switching from the wheat starch-containing tranexamic acid product to danazol and introducing a gluten-free diet mitigated abdominal symptoms of hereditary angioedema. CONCLUSION: Similarities between the symptoms of hereditary angioedema and celiac disease may cause difficulties in differential diagnosis, as well as in choosing the appropriate therapy. In our opinion, screening hereditary angioedema patients for celiac disease is warranted if abdominal attacks or neurological symptoms persist despite adequate management. Complement testing is recommended whenever abdominal symptoms persist despite the histological and serological remission of gluten-sensitive enteropathy after the introduction of a gluten-free diet.
36536183	The role of mir-197-3p in regulating the tight junction permeability of celiac disease patients under gluten free diet.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a hereditary immune-mediated disorder, which is along with the enormous production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the reduced level of tight junction proteins. The aim of this study was to determine the expression of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-18, Occludin, miR-122-5p and miR-197-3p genes in duodenal biopsies of treated CD patients in comparison to the controls. METHODS AND RESULTS: Biopsy specimens were taken from the duodenum of 50 treated CD patients (36 (72%) females and 14 (28%) males with mean age of 37.06 +- 7.02 years) and 50 healthy controls (17 (34%) females and 33 (66%) males with mean age of 34.12 +- 4.9). Total RNA was isolated, cDNA was synthesized and mRNA expression of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-18, Occludin, miR-122-5p and miR-197-3p were quantified by relative qPCR using B2M and U6 as internal control genes. All data were evaluated using SPSS (V.21) and GraphPad Prism (V.5). Our results showed that there was no significant difference between patients and controls for intestinal mRNA expression of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-18, Occludin, and miR-122-5p (p > 0.05) and the expression of miR-197-3p was significantly increased in CD patients relative to control subjects (p = 0.049). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that adherence to GFD may have a positive effect on the tight junction (TJ) permeability and in this process, miR-197-3p plays an important role. Increased expression of miR-197-3p with a final protective effect on Occludin expression can be further studied as a complement therapeutic target for Celiac disease.
21780895	Clinical and immunological features of celiac disease in patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus.	Celiac disease (CD) is one of the most frequent autoimmune disorders occurring in Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). The prevalence of CD in T1DM varies from 3 to 16%, with a mean prevalence of 8%. The clinical presentation of CD in T1DM is classified as symptomless in approximately half of cases, but a more accurate analysis often discloses a wide array of symptoms suggestive of CD. Both T1DM and CD show the same genetic background and an abnormal small intestinal immune response with inflammation and a variable grade of enteropathy. Serological screening for CD should be performed in all T1DM patients by means of antibodies to tissue transglutaminase at T1DM onset. T1DM patients found to be celiacs must be treated by a gluten-free diet. Potential CD cases (especially when asymptomatic) should be kept on a gluten-containing diet with a careful clinical and antibody follow-up, since many of them will not develop villous atrophy.
38224303	Dietitian-nutritionist incorporation in a university hospital: position statement of the Commission on Nutrition, Hospital Universitario La Paz.	Introduction: The present document has the objective of justifying the incorporation of a dietician/nutritionist to the multidisciplinary teams of specialized care that provide education, food anamnesis, nutritional recommendations, treatment and follow up of those patients in risk of malnutrition in Madrid. The appropriate nutritional status of hospitalized patients bears a close relationship with the existence of dieticians at hospitals. Dieticians use nutrition therapy as a cost-effective means to achieve significant health benefits by preventing or altering the course of diabetes, obesity, hypertension, lipid metabolism disorders, heart failure, osteoporosis, celiac disease, and chronic kidney disease, among other diseases.
35852982	[Amaranth grain proteins: prospects for use in specialized food products].	Amaranth is a widespread genus of predominantly annual herbaceous plants belonging to the Amaranthaceae family, which is one of the most widely used pseudocereals along with quinoa and buckwheat in nutrition. The aim of the research was to review and analyze the results of the studies on the characteristics of amaranth grain proteins, the effect of various food processing methods on their quality, and the prospects for using amaranth protein hydrolysates in therapeutic nutrition. Material and methods. For the main search for the literature, the PubMed bibliographic database was used, which covers about 75% of the world's medical publications. In addition, Scopus and Web of Science databases and non-commercial search engine Google Scholar were used. The depth of the search was 15 years. Results. The paper presents a brief review of modern approaches for obtaining amaranth protein isolates and concentrates, including the use of a complex of physicochemical methods: grinding, sifting, extraction at high pH values, defatting, ultrafiltration, centrifugation, isoelectric precipitation, and drying of the protein product. A comparative characteristic of amino acid content of protein fractions of pseudocereals is presented. Basically, leucine, isoleucine, and valine are limiting amino acids for the grain protein of various varieties of amaranth. When substantiating and developing modern effective food technologies for processing amaranth grain, the studies dedicated to the evaluation of their impact on the biological value of amaranth protein deserve special attention. Methods of grain fermentation, sprouting, steaming, malting, boiling can be used to increase the bioavailability and digestibility of its ingredients. The results of in vitro and in vivo studies indicate the presence of hypotensive, hypolipidemic and antioxidant activity of the amaranth protein and its hydrolysates what determines the prospects for their use as part of foods for special dietary uses and therapeutic nutrition. An analysis of the scientific publications presented in the review indicates an increase in demand for high-quality gluten-free products and an increase in the range of mass-consumption foods, such as bakery, pasta, flour confectionery, with pseudo-cereals in their composition, including amaranth. Conclusion. The high biological value and technological properties of amaranth protein concentrates/isolates determine the prospects for their use to create a wide range of specialized foods for various purposes.
21900830	Monitoring of anti-transglutaminase autoantibodies in pediatric celiac disease using a sensitive radiobinding assay.	OBJECTIVES: The diagnosis of celiac disease (CD) is based on the histological identification of gluten-sensitive enteropathy and detection of anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTGA) and/or endomysial antibodies. Serial measurements of tTGA are now recommended as a follow-up strategy to monitor compliance with a gluten-free diet (GFD). We evaluated the performances of a quantitative radiobinding assay (RBA) of tTGA immunoglobulin A at diagnosis and during monitoring of GFD in pediatric CD. METHODS: Eighty children with confirmed CD were selected. Levels of serum tTGA measured by RBA and a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were compared at diagnosis. The relation between RBA-tTGA levels and histological damage was analyzed, as well as the time course of tTGA clearance during GFD. RESULTS: Both RBA and ELISA showed high sensitivity and specificity for tTGA detection at diagnosis. There was no relation between RBA-tTGA levels at diagnosis and severity of mucosal damage. Upon initiation of GFD, the rate of RBA-tTGA positivity declined slower than that of endomysial antibodies positivity, with >50% of the children still tTGA positive at year 5; however, tTGA levels decreased rapidly during the first year of GFD and more slowly thereafter. Children who seroreverted had lower tTGA levels at diagnosis (2080+-1554 cpm) than those who remained tTGA positive throughout follow-up (3688+-1435 cpm). CONCLUSIONS: The high sensitivity of RBA is likely responsible for higher tTGA positivity rates during GFD than previously reported with ELISA. A decreasing trend for tTGA levels may represent a better surrogate marker of compliance with GFD than absolute normal tTGA levels.
35161479	Application of a Platform for Gluten-Free Diet Evaluation and Dietary Advice: From Theory to Practice.	The present work aimed to analyze, through the GlutenFreeDiet digital platform, the evolution over one year of the nutritional status, dietary profile and symptoms present among celiac people on a gluten-free diet (GFD) while receiving individualized dietary advice. Twenty-seven adults and thirty-one celiac children/adolescents participated in the study. This was then followed up by three visits, at diagnosis, and after 3 and 12 months (vt0, vt3 and vt12). Participants filled out dietary and gastrointestinal symptoms questionnaires. All patients received written personalized dietary advice from dietitians who interpreted data from the platform. Results obtained indicated that participants consumed proteins and lipids in excess and carbohydrates in defect. Low intakes of cereals, fruit and vegetables and high meat intakes were observed. However, gluten-free product (GFP) consumption and that of ultra-processed foods was reduced after 1 year in adults. Symptoms decreased after vt3 but recurred in vt12. Changes in ultra-processed foods and GFP intake, but lack of changes in the rest of the parameters suggested that the platform support was not effective enough. Even though the platform represents a useful tool for monitoring celiac patients and giving dietary advice, modules that require more continuous attention and nutritional education of patients should be provided for interventions to be more effective.
36082593	[A clinical case of depression finally explained by biology].	We report the clinical case of a patient, 36 years old, presenting a major depressive disorder for more than 6 months. Somatic complaints (diarrhea and eczema) are also present. Thanks to a biological assessment, the diagnosis of celiac disease will be made and a strict gluten-free diet will be prescribed to the patient. This will allow the improvement of depressive symptoms and somatic complaints. This clinical case underlines the importance of the search for somatic causes in the development of a depressive symptomatology.

22729336	Remission without insulin therapy on gluten-free diet in a 6-year old boy with type 1 diabetes mellitus.	A 5-year and 10-month old boy was diagnosed with classical type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) without celiac disease. He started on a gluten-free diet after 2-3 week without need of insulin treatment. At the initiation of gluten-free diet, HbA1c was 7.8% and was stabilised at 5.8%-6.0% without insulin therapy. Fasting blood glucose was maintained at 4.0-5.0 mmol/l. At 16 months after diagnosis the fasting blood glucose was 4.1 mmol/l and after 20 months he is still without daily insulin therapy. There was no alteration in glutamic acid decarboxylase positivity. The gluten-free diet was safe and without side effects. The authors propose that the gluten-free diet has prolonged remission in this patient with T1DM and that further trials are indicated.
24215034	How I treat unexplained refractory iron deficiency anemia.	Endoscopic gastrointestinal workup fails to establish the cause of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in a substantial proportion of patients. In patients referred for hematologic evaluation with unexplained or refractory IDA, screening for celiac disease, autoimmune gastritis, Helicobacter pylori, and hereditary forms of IDA is recommended. About 4% to 6% of patients with obscure refractory IDA have celiac disease, and autoimmune gastritis is encountered in 20% to 27% of patients. Stratification by age cohorts in autoimmune gastritis implies a disease presenting as IDA many years before the establishment of clinical cobalamin deficiency. Over 50% of patients with unexplained refractory IDA have active H pylori infection and, after excluding all other causes of IDA, 64% to 75% of such patients are permanently cured by H pylori eradication. In young patients with a history suggestive of hereditary iron deficiency with serum ferritin higher than expected for IDA, mutations involving iron trafficking and regulation should be considered. Recognition of the respective roles of H pylori, autoimmune gastritis, celiac disease, and genetic defects in the pathogenesis of iron deficiency should have a strong impact on the current diagnostic workup and management of unexplained, or refractory, IDA. 
24374645	Characteristics of patients who avoid wheat and/or gluten in the absence of Celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal symptoms that respond to the removal of wheat and/or gluten are becoming more common. Patients who avoid wheat and/or gluten (PWAWG) are a heterogeneous group and predominantly self-diagnosed prior to presenting for clinical evaluation. SPECIFIC AIM: We characterized PWAWGs seen at a tertiary care referral center and compared them to patients with celiac disease (CD) and subjects in the National Health and Nutrition examination survey (NHANES). METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study evaluating patients seen by four gastroenterologists at a CD referral center. Baseline characteristics, laboratory values, and medical comorbidities were compared to CD patients who presented at the same center and subjects enrolled in NHANES. RESULTS: Eighty-four PWAWGs were identified and compared to 585 CD patients and 2,686 NHANES patients. Thirty-two alternative diagnoses were made in 25 (30%) PWAWGs, including small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and fructose/lactose intolerance. When compared to patients with CD, PWAWGs had similar body mass index (BMI, 23.1 vs. 23.5, p = 0.54) and mean hemoglobin value (13.4 vs. 13.3, p = 0.6). When compared to male and female patients in NHANES, BMI, folate, and mean hemoglobin values were lower in PWAWGs. Both male and female PWAWGs had a lower prevalence of hypertension. CONCLUSION: While there are similarities between CD and PWAWGs that could possibly be due to shared HLA haplotypes or an effect of the gluten-free diet, alternative diagnoses are common in these patients. PWAWGs have a similar cardiovascular profile as CD patients in terms of lower BMI and lower prevalence of hypertension.
36305882	Budesonide and the Gluten Containing Elimination Diet as Treatments for Non-responsive Celiac Disease in Children.	OBJECTIVES: Non-responsive celiac disease (NRCD) is defined as patients having persistent symptoms and enteropathy (Marsh 3 histology) suggestive of active celiac disease (CeD), after following a gluten-free diet (GFD) for at least 12 months. NRCD is suggested to affect 15% of children with CeD but data are limited and there is no research to date describing treatment of children with this condition. The aim of this study was to describe our center's approach to identifying and treating NRCD with budesonide and the Gluten Containing Elimination Diet (GCED). METHODS: We performed a retrospective, single center analysis over a 5-year period of patients with CD less than 18 years of age (inclusive) who underwent treatment for persistent symptoms and enteropathy despite following a GFD. RESULTS: We identified 22 patients with NRCD. Thirteen were treated with the GCED for 3 months with 46% achieving both histological and symptomatic resolution. Nine patients were treated with budesonide (6-9 mg), with 89% achieving both symptomatic and histologic resolution after a median 3-month treatment course. Further, 67% of patients who responded to the GCED and 100% of patients who responded to budesonide remained in remission for at least 6 months following treatment transition back to exclusive GFD. CONCLUSIONS: The GCED and budesonide can provide benefit for NRCD. Most patients with NRCD can return to a GFD after 3 months of treatment.
22998972	[Gluten-related disorders and demyelinating diseases].	Gluten-related disorders are a spectrum of systemic immune mediated conditions that occur at any age in genetically susceptible individuals upon ingesting gluten. Celiac disease and gluten sensitivity are the most important conditions of the spectrum. They may be associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica. Treatment with a gluten-free diet can provide considerable benefits to the patients having both a gluten-related disorder and one of these 2 demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system.
22555320	Celiac disease: an overview from pathophysiology to treatment.	Celiac disease (CD) is one of the most common immune-mediated diseases with a worldwide prevalence of around 1%, although a couple of decades ago the disease was thought to be very rare. CD is characterized by an inadequate inflammatory response to gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. In this inflammatory response both the adaptive and innate immunity are involved. The clinical picture of CD is variable ranging from severe malabsorption syndrome to silent cases. Disease specific antibodies can aid in selecting patients for a small intestinal biopsy, which is thought to be the gold standard investigation to diagnose CD. However, in selected patients, serology can be sufficient to confirm the diagnosis and a biopsy is not needed. Hitherto, the only treatment for CD is adherence to a lifelong strict gluten-free diet. The purpose of this review was to summarize current literature on the epidemiology and pathophysiology of CD and to discuss diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.

30959740	The Profile of Urinary Headspace Volatile Organic Compounds After 12-Week Intake of Oligofructose-Enriched Inulin by Children and Adolescents with Celiac Disease on a Gluten-Free Diet: Results of a Pilot, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial.	The concentration of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can inform about the metabolic condition of the body. In the small intestine of untreated persons with celiac disease (CD), chronic inflammation can occur, leading to nutritional deficiencies, and consequently to functional impairments of the whole body. Metabolomic studies showed differences in the profile of VOCs in biological fluids of patients with CD in comparison to healthy persons; however, there is scarce quantitative and nutritional intervention information. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the supplementation of a gluten-free diet (GFD) with prebiotic oligofructose-enriched inulin (Synergy 1) on the concentration of VOCs in the urine of children and adolescents with CD. Twenty-three participants were randomized to the group receiving Synergy 1 (10 g per day) or placebo for 12 weeks. Urinary VOCs were analyzed using solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Sixteen compounds were identified and quantified in urine samples. The supplementation of GFD with Synergy 1 resulted in an average concentration drop (36%) of benzaldehyde in urine samples. In summary, Synergy 1, applied as a supplement of GFD for 12 weeks had a moderate impact on the VOC concentrations in the urine of children with CD.
33843325	Navigating celiac disease and the gluten-free diet in China.	BACKGROUND: Little is known about celiac disease (CeD) diagnosis and management in China. AIM: This pilot aimed to be the first study to describe, quantitatively and qualitatively, how individuals living in China navigate CeD and the gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: Participants were 13 adults and four parents of children with reported CeD, recruited from 11 mainland China cities via an online GFD support group. CeD-specific quality of life (CD-QOL and CD-PQOL) and diet adherence (CDAT) were assessed. In-depth interviews addressed experiences with CeD and the GFD. RESULTS: Six of 17 participants reported biopsy- or serology-confirmed CeD. The mean (SD) adult CDAT score was 15.2 (3.6), > 13 indicating inadequate GFD adherence. The mean adult CD-QOL score was 62.1 (24.1) out of 100, in the "medium" to "good" range. Results were similar in children. Major interview themes included: (1) a challenging journey to obtain diagnosis; (2) social and structural barriers to maintaining the GFD; and (3) reliance on self in management of CeD. CONCLUSION: Obtaining a diagnosis, maintaining a GFD, and living with CeD can be extremely challenging in mainland China. Results suggest an urgent need for CeD-specific education and Asian-adapted GFD guidance for both healthcare practitioners and patients.
31183842	Interpretation and implementation of the revised European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) guidelines on pediatric celiac disease amongst consultant general pediatricians in Southwest of England.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a lifelong condition with significant morbidity and requires an accurate diagnosis. Guidelines for pediatric CD were revised by the European and British Societies of Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition in 2012 and 2013, respectively. New recommendations introduced non-biopsy pathway (NBP) of diagnosis for a selective group of symptomatic children whose anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) antibody titer is greater than ten times upper limit of normal. A clear understanding of the guidelines amongst consultant pediatricians will ensure all children with suspected CD receive a prompt and secure diagnosis. The aim of this study was to establish the interpretation and implementation of the revised guideline for CD amongst consultant general pediatricians in Southwest England (SWE) during the study period. METHODS: Telephone/email survey was conducted amongst consultant general pediatricians (n   140) working in 12 secondary care hospitals across SWE. The survey included eight questions incorporating three main themes: understanding of diagnostic pathway particularly for non-biopsy diagnosis, awareness of laboratory tests involved, and variations in practice in relation to the revised guidelines. RESULTS: Responses were available from 101/140 (72%). One hundred respondents were aware of the revised guidelines for diagnosing CD. However, only 17 respondents stated all the criteria of the guideline required for diagnosis by NBP, with further 17 seeking immediate advice from a specialist. Forty-four listed both the criteria for HLA-DQ2/DQ8 testing applicable to pediatricians. Forty-nine out of 100 pediatricians would commence gluten-free diet only after all the results were available. Thirty-three pediatricians also considered asymptomatic children with high anti-tTG titer eligible for diagnosis of CD by NBP. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for improved understanding of revised CD guidelines amongst consultant general pediatricians especially while using the NBP and requesting HLA-DQ2/DQ8 testing.

38769224	Yield of Gluten Challenge in Patients on Self-Prescribed Gluten-Free Diets.	BACKGROUND: Patients on a gluten-free diet (GFD) whose celiac disease (CD) status is unknown may undergo gluten challenge (GC) to clarify their diagnosis. Though this is an established diagnostic practice, the proportion of patients undergoing GC who are diagnosed with CD is unknown. AIMS: We aimed to analyze which factors were predictive of having CD in a cohort of patients who underwent GC followed by upper endoscopy with duodenal biopsy. METHODS: We identified adult patients at a CD referral center who had been on a GFD and then underwent GC to determine a diagnosis of CD during the years spanning 2006 to 2020. We compared those patients found to have CD (defined as villus atrophy/Marsh 3) on duodenal biopsy with those who did not, using the chi square and Fischer exact tests. RESULTS: We identified 206 patients who underwent GC. Of these 206, 30 (14%) were diagnosed with CD based on post-GC duodenal biopsy. 176 of the 206 (85%) patients reported various gastrointestinal symptoms, including bloating (39%), though these were more common in those without CD (any GI symptoms: 89% vs 67%, p 0.004; bloating: 43% vs 20%, p 0.019). Serology values, when normalized, including pre- and post-challenge TTG IgA (37% vs 1.7%, p 0.001; 23% versus 2.3%, p 0.001), DGP IgG and IgA (57% vs 2.8%, p 0.001; 37% vs 6.2%, p 0.001) were higher in the group of patients with CD. CONCLUSION: Among patients undergoing GC for diagnostic purposes, only 14% had evidence of villus atrophy corresponding with CD on duodenal biopsy. The presence of any elevated pre-challenge serology was associated with CD. Bloating in combination with low serologies may help risk stratify patients as being less likely to have CD upon GC.
23688532	The relationship of autism and gluten.	BACKGROUND: Autism is now a common condition with a prevalence of 1 in 88 children. There is no known etiology. Speculation about possible treatments for autism or autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has included the use of various dietary interventions, including a gluten-free diet. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this article was to review the literature available evaluating the use of gluten-free diets in patients with autism to determine if diet should be instituted as a treatment. METHODS: A literature review was performed, identifying previously published studies in which a gluten-free diet was instituted as an autism treatment. These studies were not limited to randomized controlled trials because only 1 article was available that used a double-blind crossover design. Most publish reports were unblinded, observational studies. RESULTS: In the only double-blind, crossover study, no benefit of a gluten-free diet was identified. Several other studies did report benefit from gluten-free diet. Controlling for observer bias and what may have represented unrelated progress over time in these studies is not possible. There are many barriers to evaluating treatment benefits for patients with autism. Gluten sensitivity may present in a variety of ways, including gastrointestinal and neurologic symptoms. Although making a diagnosis of celiac disease is easier with new serology and genetic testing, a large number of gluten-sensitive patients do not have celiac disease. Testing to confirm non-celiac gluten sensitivity is not available. CONCLUSIONS: A variety of symptoms may be present with gluten sensitivity. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to support instituting a gluten-free diet as a treatment for autism. There may be a subgroup of patients who might benefit from a gluten-free diet, but the symptom or testing profile of these candidates remains unclear.
29338961	Is eosinophilic esophagitis an equivalent of pollen allergic asthma? Analysis of biopsies and therapy guided by component resolved diagnosis.	BACKGROUND: Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is characterized by esophageal dysfunction and, histologically, by eosinophilic inflammation. There is not a clear etiologic treatment. Biopsies analysis using plant histology methods may show callose and pollen tubes in the esophageal mucosa. Component-resolved diagnosis (CRD) with microarrays could detect possible allergens involved and indicate an elimination diet and allergen immunotherapy (AIT). METHODS: One hundred and twenty-nine patients with EoE were tested for environmental and food allergens. CRD, histological and botanical analysis were performed. Clinical scores and endoscopic biopsy were performed every six months for three years. Fifty healthy patients, 50 asthmatics due to pollen, and 53 celiac disease patients were included as comparison groups. CRD-directed AIT was administered in 91 EoE patients and elimination diet in 140 patients (87 EoE and all 53 CD patients). RESULTS: CRD detected allergen hypersensitivity in 87.6% of patients with EoE. The predominant allergens were grass group 1 (55%), lipid transfer proteins (LTP) of peach and mugwort, hazelnuts and walnuts. Callose from pollen tubes was found in 65.6% of biopsies. After CRD-guided elimination diet and/or AIT, 101 (78.3%) EoE patients showed significant clinical improvement (p<0.017) and 97 (75.2%) were discharged (negative biopsy, no symptoms, no medication) without relapse. AIT-treated patients had better outcomes (odds ratio 177.3, 95% CI 16.2-1939.0). CONCLUSION: CRD-directed AIT and/or elimination diet was efficient in treating EoE patients and was well tolerated.
25179492	Rectal effluent as a research tool.	Studies of localized secretions are generally superior to those of blood because they contain higher concentrations of molecules specific to the organ of interest. A common method used to analyze localized secretions is lavage. The flow of fluid over the lining of a cavity picks up both cells and soluble factors, and the effluent can be collected for study. Gastrointestinal (GI) lavage is easily and noninvasively performed by the administration of gut lavage solutions such as those routinely given to patients prior to colonoscopy, with GI lavage fluid being the copious, watery rectal effluent subsequently induced. Residual effluent is currently suctioned from the colon and discarded during colonoscopy. With millions of routine colonoscopies performed per year, GI lavage fluid is a rich and largely untapped resource for basic and clinical research. Rectal effluent can also be easily collected in a toilet receptacle without need for a colonoscopy. Rectal effluent generated in this manner has been used to study diarrheal disease, mucosal immunology, inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, and cancer. It is often referred to as gut lavage, colon lavage, GI lavage, or whole gut lavage fluid, which makes it challenging to locate previous studies in the literature and there are currently no comprehensive reviews of its use as a research tool. This review attempts to fill this void by discussing previous applications of rectal effluent in research and the methods that have been developed for its collection, stabilization, and analysis. 
37882829	[Dermatitis herpetiformis and other forms of wheat sensitivity].	BACKGROUND: Wheat sensitivity is a collective term for several, especially gastrointestinal, diseases that occur as part of a hypersensitivity reaction after wheat consumption. The symptoms, which are mostly similar to those of irritable bowel syndrome, are often accompanied by skin lesions. In addition to celiac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis, the cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease, wheat sensitivity also includes nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), allergic nickel contact mucositis, wheat allergy, amylase-trypsin inhibitor intolerance, and fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) intolerance. OBJECTIVES: This review article aims to provide an overview of the clinical, especially dermatological and gastrointestinal features of the different forms of wheat sensitivity. Diagnosis and therapeutic management are also discussed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A selective literature search was carried out with evaluation of our own clinical data. RESULTS: The skin lesions in dermatitis herpetiformis are very disease-specific. In contrast, wheat allergy often shares signs and symptoms with many other diseases. Other forms of wheat sensitivity cause primarily gastrointestinal abnormalities, but extra-intestinal manifestations can also occur. Their diagnosis is often complex and requires cross-disciplinary collaboration with experts in gastroenterology. The therapy consists of a wheat- or gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of the different and frequently occurring dermatological signs of wheat sensitivity is of great importance, because dermatological manifestations associated with gastrointestinal pathology, intolerance reactions, and allergies appear more and more frequently.

21770680	Refractory iron-deficiency anemia and gluten intolerance - Response to gluten-free diet.	INTRODUCTION: refractory iron-deficiency anemia has a multifactorial origin related to various gastrointestinal conditions, with celiac disease plus malabsorption and IBD together with isolated gluten intolerance being most common. OBJECTIVES: to determine the prevalence of serum, genetic, and histological markers for gluten intolerance, and to analyze the response to gluten withdrawal from the diet in these patients. METHODS: a number of patients with refractory anemia were prospectively and consecutively enrolled. A protocol to measure serum (TGt-2), genetic (HLA-DQ2/DQ8), and histological markers for celiac disease was applied. All followed a gluten-free diet for a median 3.6 years. Sustained remission of anemia during follow-up was interpreted as positive response. RESULTS: ninety-eight patients (84% females) with a mean age of 54 years were studied. Anti-TGt2 antibodies were positive in 5% of cases. A total of 67 cases (68%) were haplotype HLA-DQ2 or -DQ8 (+). We found villous atrophy (Marsh III) in 13% of patients, and an inflammatory pattern (Marsh I or II) in 13%. All remaining 72 patients (74%) had no histological duodenal changes.Age, anemia duration, number of transfusions, number of parenteral iron doses, and time on a gluten-free diet were all compared according to the presence or absence of villous atrophy and HLA-DQ2/8 positivity, and no significant differences were found for any of the analyzed variables. Response was positive in 92% of subjects. CONCLUSIONS: celiac disease with villous atrophy is rarely a cause of refractory anemia. Gluten intolerance with no histological lesions is seen in almost 75% of patients, and therefore plays a relevant role in its development.
22176557	Clinical benefit of gluten-free diet in screen-detected older celiac disease patients.	BACKGROUND: The utility of serologic screening for celiac disease is still debatable. Evidence suggests that the disorder remains undetected even in the older population. It remains obscure whether screening makes good or harm in subjects with long-standing gluten ingestion. We evaluated whether older subjects benefit from active detection and subsequent gluten free dietary treatment of celiac disease. METHODS: Thirty-five biopsy-proven patients aged over 50 years had been detected by serologic mass screening. We examined the disease history, dietary compliance, symptoms, quality of life and bone mineral density at baseline and 1-2 years after the commencement of a gluten-free diet. Symptoms were evaluated by gastrointestinal symptom rating scale and quality of life by psychological general well-being questionnaires. Small bowel biopsy, serology, laboratory parameters assessing malabsorption, and bone mineral density were investigated. RESULTS: Dietary compliance was good. The patients had initially low mean serum ferritin values indicating subclinical iron deficiency, which was restored by a gluten-free diet. Vitamin B12, vitamin D and erythrocyte folic acid levels increased significantly on diet. Celiac patients had a history of low-energy fractures more often than the background population, and the diet had a beneficial effect on bone mineral density. Alleviation in gastrointestinal symptoms was observed, even though the patients reported no or only subtle symptoms at diagnosis. Quality of life remained unchanged. Of all the cases, two thirds would have been diagnosed even without screening if the family history, fractures or concomitant autoimmune diseases had been taken carefully into account. CONCLUSIONS: Screen-detected patients benefited from a gluten-free diet. We encourage a high index of suspicion and active case-finding in celiac disease as an alternative to mass screening in older patients.

31335839	Celiac Dietary Adherence Test simplifies Determining Adherence to a Gluten-free Diet in Swedish Adolescents.	OBJECTIVES: The aims of the study were to ascertain whether the Celiac Dietary Adherence Test (CDAT) could contribute in determining adherence to a gluten-free diet in patients with celiac disease and to evaluate the diet adherence and well being of a study population 5 years after a celiac disease screening known as "Exploring the Iceberg of Celiacs in Sweden." METHODS: Through the screening, 90 adolescents (born 1997) were diagnosed with biopsy-proven celiac disease at 12 years of age. Of them, 70 (78%) came to a 5-year follow-up where anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies 2 was tested and a questionnaire was filled in, including CDAT, which consists of 7 questions related to adherence. Nonparametrical tests were used to determine associations between adherence measures. RESULTS: Among the adolescents, 86% were adherent to a gluten-free diet 5 years after screening, 38% reported their general well being as excellent, 50% very well, and 12% well. Statistically significant associations were seen between anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies 2 and the CDAT score (P = 0.033), and the self-reported adherence question and the CDAT score (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The screening-detected adolescents reported a high level of well being and adherence to a gluten-free diet 5 years after screening. We conclude that the CDAT can be used in clinical practice as an estimation of adherence to a gluten-free diet. It would be most suitable to use in conjunction with currently used adherence measures, but can also be used as a stand-alone method when others are not accessible.
22744191	Parental report of abdominal pain and abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders from a community survey.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are common in children. Abdominal pain (AP) is the most common gastrointestinal (GI) symptom in children. The severity of AP drives medical consultations and quality of life in adult patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Thirty-eight percent of 8- to 15-year-old schoolchildren report AP weekly with 24% of those children reporting persistence of AP >8 weeks. Despite the high prevalence of AP, only 2% of school children seek medical attention for AP. Lack of parental knowledge on their child's symptoms may constitute one of the factors affecting the low ratio of consultation in children reporting AP. The aim was to assess parental reports of AP symptoms in a population of healthy community children. METHODS: Data of 5 studies with identical methodology to assess GI symptoms in children with celiac disease (CD), cow's milk allergy (CMA), pyloric stenosis (PS), Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP), and stem cell transplant (SC) and their healthy siblings were reviewed: a phone questionnaire on GI symptoms and Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rome III version questionnaire (QPGS-RIII). Inclusion criteria were healthy children 4 to 18 years of age with a sibling previously diagnosed with CD, CMA, PS, HSP, or SC. RESULTS: Data on 246 healthy children, mean age (9.8 years, range 3-24, 112 girls) were obtained. Parents reported presence of AP in the last 8 weeks before the telephone contact in 20 (8.1%) children (age range 4-18 years, 11 girls). There was no significant difference in AP prevalence between boys and girls (P = 0.64). Six children (2.4%) met QPGS-RIII diagnostic criteria for FGIDs: 3 functional abdominal pain (FAP) and 3 IBS. CONCLUSIONS: AP was common in community children. FAP was the most common FGID among healthy community children. The prevalence of AP by parental report is lower than the previously published prevalence of AP reported by children. Lack of awareness of children's symptoms may play a role in the low ratio of consultation for AP in symptomatic children. Future prospective studies should confirm our findings and investigate the factors influencing the medical consultation decision including parental awareness of children's symptoms.
22386570	Markers of gluten sensitivity in acute mania: a longitudinal study.	Increased levels of antibodies to gliadin, which is derived from the wheat protein gluten, have been reported in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in cross-sectional studies. We examined longitudinally the levels of antibody reactivity to gliadin in acute mania. The sample included 60 individuals assessed during a hospital stay for acute mania, 39 at a 6-month follow-up, and a sample of 143 non-psychiatric controls. Antibodies to gliadin were measured by enzyme immunoassay. The relationship of the antibodies to the clinical course of mania was analyzed by the use of regression models. Individuals with mania had significantly increased levels of IgG antibodies to gliadin, but not other markers of celiac disease, at baseline compared with controls in multivariate analyses. However, these levels were not significantly different from those of controls at the six month follow-up. Among the individuals with mania, elevated levels at follow-up were significantly associated with re-hospitalization in the 6-month follow-up period. The monitoring and control of gluten sensitivity may have significant effects on the management of individuals hospitalized with acute mania.
26982681	Children and adolescents living with diabetes and celiac disease.	Objective To understand the experience of children and adolescents living with type 1 diabetes and celiac disease. Method This is a qualitative exploratory-descriptive study. The participants were 3 children and 2 adolescents. The data were collected by means of semi-structured interviews between January and September 2012 at the participant's residence or at the diabetic outpatient clinic of the Hospital das Clinicas, Faculty of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The content analysis technique was used to process the data. Results The key aspect of the illness experience of the patients was their diet, but with different meanings. The children had difficulty following the diet, while the adolescents reported that they had greater difficulty coping with the social and affective aspects of their diet. Conclusion The results reinforce the importance of nurses who seek strategies, together with the patients and their families, that help minimize the difficulties of these patients, especially with regard to managing the diet imposed by both diseases. 
34618236	The costs of celiac disease: a contingent valuation in Switzerland.	This paper proposes a first monetary measure of the private costs of celiac disease, including intangible costs (physical symptoms, logistical constraints, etc.) in Switzerland. This auto-immune disease damages the intestine when patients ingest gluten. The only treatment currently available is a gluten-free diet, which implies great nutritional constraints. To get a monetary equivalent of the costs borne by celiac patients, we used a contingent valuation. The scenario suggested to celiac patients a treatment in form of a daily pill, which would allow them to eat normally and avoid any physical pain from celiac disease. Mean Willingness To Pay (WTP) for the treatment is found to be around CHF 87 (approx. USD 87) per month. WTP is positively influenced by direct and indirect costs of the disease. Oppositely, individuals, who find the gluten-free diet healthier are willing to pay less. Finally, unlike symptoms before diagnostic, the current presence or intensity of physical symptoms are found to be insignificant. The latter result can be explained by the fact that, individuals facing stronger symptoms are more likely to adhere strictly to the GFD and hence to reduce their frequency.
38704129	The Association Between Adverse Cardiovascular Outcomes in Celiac Disease and the Role of Inflammation: Retrospective Analysis Using the National Inpatient Sample.	Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated disease with patients being prone to a proinflammatory state. With recent studies showing an association between adverse cardiovascular events in patients with CD, we aim to further elucidate this relationship. Furthermore, when risk-stratifying patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic inflammatory conditions such as CD are not included in these calculations. We conducted a retrospective analysis using the National Inpatient Sample database from 2016 to 2019 to investigate the relationship between CD and adverse cardiovascular events. Our secondary endpoints include examining patient demographics, underlying comorbidities, in-hospital mortality, and cost of hospitalization. In addition, we performed a subgroup analysis in the CD cohort to assess if concomitant iron deficiency anemia increased CVD. Our study aims to examine the association between atherosclerosis and inflammation and aims to be a stepping stone for future long-term randomized controlled trials for the incorporation into atherosclerotic CVD risk score stratification.
27136959	The Decreasing Prevalence of Severe Villous Atrophy in Dermatitis Herpetiformis: A 45-Year Experience in 393 Patients.	GOALS: We analyzed from our prospectively collected series of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) whether small-bowel histologic findings are changing and how serum tissue transglutaminase (TG2) IgA antibodies correlate to mucosal damage. BACKGROUND: DH is an extraintestinal manifestation of celiac disease presenting with itchy blistering rash and pathognomonic IgA deposits in the skin. Prominent gastrointestinal symptoms are rare, and small-bowel findings range from severe villous atrophy (SVA) and partial villous atrophy (PVA) to normal mucosa with inflammatory changes. METHODS: The cohort included 393 patients (214 male and 179 female) with DH having small-bowel biopsies performed at Tampere University Hospital since 1970. The small-bowel findings were calculated in the three 15-year periods, and in the last period they were correlated with serum IgA class TG2 antibody levels measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The prevalence of SVA decreased significantly (P=0.032), from 42% in the first study period to 29% in the last study period. A concomitant increase was seen in PVA, from 33% to 41%, and normal villous architecture, from 25% to 30%. The patients with SVA (P<0.001) and PVA (P=0.046) had significantly higher TG2 antibody levels than those with normal villous architecture. CONCLUSIONS: This long-term study in patients with DH disclosed a significant decrease in the occurrence of SVA. Serum IgA TG2 antibody levels correlated to damage in the small bowel. The trend toward milder small-bowel histology in DH suggests that a similar pattern could occur in the pool of undiagnosed celiac disease from which DH develops.
31166403	Consensus on the treatment of autoimmune bullous dermatoses: dermatitis herpetiformis and linear IgA bullous dermatosis - Brazilian Society of Dermatology.	Dermatitis herpetiformis and linear IgA bullous dermatosis are autoimmune diseases that present with pruritic urticarial papules and plaques, with formation of vesicles and blisters of subepidermal location, mediated by IgA antibodies. Mucosal lesions are present only in linear IgA bullous dermatosis. The elaboration of this consensus consisted of a brief presentation of the different aspects of these dermatoses and, above all, of an updated literature review on the various therapeutic options that were discussed and compared with the authors' experience, aiming at the treatment orientation of these diseases in Brazil. Dermatitis herpetiformis is a cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease, and can be controlled with a gluten-free diet and dapsone. On the other hand, linear IgA bullous dermatosis arises spontaneously or is triggered by drugs, and can be controlled with dapsone, but often requires the association of systemic corticosteroids and eventually immunosuppressants.
28574969	Daily Experiences and Challenges Among Children and Adolescents With Celiac Disease: Focus Group Results.	OBJECTIVES: Maintaining a restrictive gluten-free diet is the only treatment for celiac disease (CD). Adherence among children and adolescents presents unique challenges and is often inadequate. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health: Children and Youth version (ICF-CY) model encompasses all aspects of human health and daily function while dealing with a disease and interacting with the environment. The purpose was to explore everyday life experiences and challenges as perceived by children and adolescents with CD and their parents in light of the ICF-CY concepts to identify the most crucial components in management challenges. The present study was the first stage in developing a standardized questionnaire to assess these needs. METHODS: Children and adolescents diagnosed with CD for more than 6 months and their parents participated in 4 separate focus group interviews: 12 children (8-12 years) and 13 of their parents, and 10 adolescents (13-16 years) and 10 of their parents. RESULTS: The ICF-CY body functions component that includes higher-level cognitive functions, such as organization, planning, and problem solving was largely reflected. Food-related activities in and out of the home were discussed, yet thorough activity analysis was lacking in the available literature. CONCLUSIONS: The focus groups revealed a wide scope of coping issues that contribute to a deeper understanding of specific CD characteristics including daily management, participation in food-related activities, roles, strategies, and supporting or hindering factors in everyday life with CD.
39241138	Evaluation and treatment of celiac disease in the central and south of Iraq.	OBJECTIVE: Aim: To estimate the differences between patients with celiac disease based on symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional study carried out between July 1, 2022 and April 2023, enrolling 200 patients from different provinces of central and south Iraq with Celia disease, whose diagnosis depended on a specialized physician according to WHO guidelines with long-term follow-up. Participants were following up for three to six months in private clinics. Survey was written in English, and the questionnaire form contains 13 fields divided into three sections. Diagnosis of Celia before and after treatment parameters: Tissue Transglutaminase Antibody, IgG, Serum (tTg-Ig G), and tTg-IgA levels the fourth part included a glutin-free diet and symptomatic treatment. RESULTS: Results: Females and ages below 20 were most affected. 176(88%) patients had detectable tTG levels; after 3 months, 72(36.0%) patients had an increase in their body weight but less than 5 kg, while 14(7.0%) of the patients showed an increase of more than 5 kg. But after 6 months, 73(36.5%) patients had an increase in their body weight less than 5 kg, while 45(22.5%) of patients showed an increase of more than 5 kg. CONCLUSION: Conclusions: Celiac patient profile in central Iraq is not different from that in other parts of the world, with typical patient being female and under 30 years of age. The study highlighted to a certain degree that a gluten-free diet can have a modest and promising positive impact on BMI in some patients.

39275172	From Struggle to Strength: A Multicentric Study on How Public Policies for Celiac Disease Transform Lives.	This multicenter study aims to assess the impact of public policies (PPs) on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of individuals with celiac disease (CD) using the Celiac Disease Questionnaire (CDQ) and PPs for Celiac Disease Score (PPCDS). This cross-sectional exploratory study was conducted in four stages: first, standardizing data from countries using the CDQ; second, analyzing PPs aimed at CD patients; third, statistically examining these data; and fourth, associating HRQoL indicators with corresponding PPs. This study analyzed 15 CDQ assessments from 12 countries from 2007 to 2023. It found that comprehensive PPs positively correlated with HRQoL outcomes (Spearman correlation of 0.358). However, policies specifically targeting gluten-free meals and certification did not significantly improve HRQoL individually, suggesting they may be more effective when implemented together. Additionally, specialized health services did not notably reduce gastrointestinal symptoms, underscoring the necessity for improved patient education to enhance the effectiveness of these services. This study concludes that implementing and rigorously monitoring regulations to support CD patients is crucial for enhancing their HRQoL.
25793906	Onset of Thrombin Generation Occurs More Rapidly in Pediatric Patients With Celiac Disease.	OBJECTIVE: Celiac disease (CD) is a risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE) and stroke, but the mechanisms are unclear. Continuous measurement of thrombin generation in plasma is a feasible way to detect hypercoagulable changes. The aim of this pilot study was to investigate thrombin generation in pediatric patients with CD compared with pediatric controls. METHODS: Plasma samples were collected from 19 pediatric patients with CD and 20 healthy controls. In each patient diagnosed as having CD, thrombin generation was determined twice by means of calibrated automated thrombography. The first measurement was undertaken when CD was diagnosed; the second measurement was undertaken after normalization of their IgA antitissue transglutaminase antibody (tTG-Ab) titers following a gluten-free diet. In the controls, measurement for TTG-Ab and thrombin generation was undertaken once during recruitment. RESULTS: Patients with CD at diagnosis showed a significantly shorter lag time compared with controls (P < 0.001) and a shorter time-to-peak compared with controls (P < 0.02). These differences were no longer detectable after normalization of TTG-Ab values. The overall amount of generated thrombin, represented by the endogenous thrombin potential (ETP), showed no significant difference between the study groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that alterations in coagulation can be found in untreated CD that may help to explain the described increased risk of stroke or VTE. A shorter lag time in patients with untreated CD indicates a more rapid onset of thrombin generation as a sign of hypercoagulability. ETP, the best predictive parameter for thromboembolic disease, however, was not altered.
32960627	[Celiac disease: causes, pathology, and nutritional assessment of gluten-free diet. A review].	INTRODUCTION: Introduction: celiac patients suffer deficiencies before and during their maintenance of a gluten-free diet. This is due to malabsorption, associated with the disease, and to non-enriched, mostly processed foods high in saturated fats and deficient in the minerals typically present in wheat. Objectives: the main objective of this review was to determine the molecular basis of celiac disease and the nutritional deficiencies that gluten-free diet entails, as well as an assessment of gluten-free diet and its nutritional deficiencies once the intestinal microvilli have been restored. Material and methods: a bibliographic search was carried out through electronic databases. The content of the review focuses on the pathogenesis of celiac disease and the assessment of gluten-free diet when established for treatment. Results: the main deficiencies that occur in untreated celiac patients are (calcium, iron, fiber, folic acid, omega-3, vitamin B12, and vitamin D). It has been observed that the quality of life of celiac patients, after starting treatment, is reduced, and this leads to low adherence to gluten-free diet. In addition, these gluten-free diets without proper follow-up by a nutritionist entail other deficits such as: an increase in the risk of cardiovascular, metabolic, overweight and obesity diseases. Conclusion: gluten-free diet, as followed by celiac patients, usually entails certain deficiencies such as group-B vitamins, vitamin D, calcium, iron, folic acid, and fiber, which is mainly due to the poor nutritional quality of gluten-free products as compared to their equivalents with gluten, and a scarce monitoring by health professionals.
28970717	Helminths as an alternative therapy for intestinal diseases.	Animal models and clinical studies have shown that helminth infections exert immunomodulatory activity, altering intestinal permeability and providing a potential beneficial action on autoimmune and inflammatory disorders in human beings, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and celiac disease. This is consistent with the theory that intestinal microbiota is responsible for shaping human immunological responses. With the arrival of the immunobiologic era and the use of antibodies, we propose a distinctive pathway for treating patients with IBD and celiac disease. We have some evidence about the safety and tolerability of helminth use, but evidence about their impact on disease activity is lacking. Using worms to treat diseases could be a possible way to lower treatment costs, since the era of immunobiologic agents is responsible for a significant rise in expenses. Some questions remain to be investigated regarding the use of helminths in intestinal disease, such as the importance of the specific species of helminths used, appropriate dosing regimens, optimal timing of treatment, the role of host genetics, diet, environment, and the elucidation of the exact mechanisms of action. One promising approach is the use of helminth-derived anti-inflammatory molecules as drugs. Yet there are still many challenges with this method, especially with regard to safety. Studies on intestinal permeability point to Strongyloides stercoralis as a useful nematode for these purposes.
28216978	Role of capsule endoscopy in suspected celiac disease: A European multi-centre study.	AIM: To analyze the diagnostic yield (DY), therapeutic impact (TI) and safety of capsule endoscopy (CE). METHODS: This is a multi-centre, observational, analytical, retrospective study. A total of 163 patients with suspicion of celiac disease (CD) (mean age = 46.4 +- 17.3 years, 68.1% women) who underwent CE from 2003 to 2015 were included. Patients were divided into four groups: seronegative CD with atrophy (Group-I, n = 19), seropositive CD without atrophy (Group-II, n = 39), contraindication to gastroscopy (Group-III, n = 6), seronegative CD without atrophy, but with a compatible context (Group-IV, n = 99). DY, TI and the safety of CE were analysed. RESULTS: The overall DY was 54% and the final diagnosis was villous atrophy (n = 65, 39.9%), complicated CD (n = 12, 7.4%) and other enteropathies (n = 11, 6.8%; 8 Crohn's). DY for groups I to IV was 73.7%, 69.2%, 50% and 44.4%, respectively. Atrophy was located in duodenum in 24 cases (36.9%), diffuse in 19 (29.2%), jejunal in 11 (16.9%), and patchy in 10 cases (15.4%). Factors associated with a greater DY were positive serology (68.3% vs 49.2%, P = 0.034) and older age (P = 0.008). On the other hand, neither sex nor clinical presentation, family background, positive histology or HLA status were associated with DY. CE results changed the therapeutic approach in 71.8% of the cases. Atrophy was associated with a greater TI (92.3% vs 45.3%, P < 0.001) and 81.9% of the patients responded to diet. There was one case of capsule retention (0.6%). Agreement between CE findings and subsequent histology was 100% for diagnosing normal/other conditions, 70% for suspected CD and 50% for complicated CD. CONCLUSION: CE has a high DY in cases of suspicion of CD and it leads to changes in the clinical course of the disease. CE is safe procedure with a high degree of concordance with histology and it helps in the differential diagnosis of CD.
22728033	Severe spruelike enteropathy associated with olmesartan.	OBJECTIVE: To report the response to discontinuation of olmesartan, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist commonly prescribed for treatment of hypertension, in patients with unexplained severe spruelike enteropathy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All 22 patients included in this report were seen at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, between August 1, 2008, and August 1, 2011, for evaluation of unexplained chronic diarrhea and enteropathy while taking olmesartan. Celiac disease was ruled out in all cases. To be included in the study, the patients also had to have clinical improvement after suspension of olmesartan. RESULTS: The 22 patients (13 women) had a median age of 69.5 years (range, 47-81 years). Most patients were taking 40 mg/d of olmesartan (range, 10-40 mg/d). The clinical presentation was of chronic diarrhea and weight loss (median, 18 kg; range, 2.5-57 kg), which required hospitalization in 14 patients (64%). Intestinal biopsies showed both villous atrophy and variable degrees of mucosal inflammation in 15 patients, and marked subepithelial collagen deposition (collagenous sprue) in 7. Tissue transglutaminase antibodies were not detected. A gluten-free diet was not helpful. Collagenous or lymphocytic gastritis was documented in 7 patients, and microscopic colitis was documented in 5 patients. Clinical response, with a mean weight gain of 12.2 kg, was demonstrated in all cases. Histologic recovery or improvement of the duodenum after discontinuation of olmesartan was confirmed in all 18 patients who underwent follow-up biopsies. CONCLUSION: Olmesartan may be associated with a severe form of spruelike enteropathy. Clinical response and histologic recovery are expected after suspension of the drug.

31868785	A Quantitative Assessment of Gluten Cross-contact in the School Environment for Children With Celiac Disease.	OBJECTIVES: A gluten-free (GF) diet is the primary treatment for celiac disease (CD). Gluten is used in schools, particularly in early childhood, art, and home-economics classrooms. This study aimed to measure gluten transfer from school supplies to GF foods that a child with CD may eat. Also, to measure efficacy of washing techniques to remove gluten from hands and tables. METHODS: Five experiments measured potential gluten cross-contact in classrooms: Play-Doh (n = 30); baking project (n = 30); paper mache (n = 10); dry pasta in sensory table (n = 10); cooked pasta in sensory table (n = 10). Thirty participants ages 2 to 18 were enrolled. Following activities, gluten levels were measured on separate slices of GF bread rubbed on participant's hands and table surfaces. Participants were assigned 1 of 3 handwashing methods (soap and water, water alone, or wet wipe). Repeat gluten transfer measurements were taken from hands and tables. Gluten measurements made using R-Biopharm R7001 R5-ELISA Sandwich assay. RESULTS: Paper mache, cooked pasta in sensory tables, and baking project resulted in rates of gluten transfer far greater than the 20 ppm threshold set by Codex Alimentarius Commission. Play-Doh and dry pasta, however, resulted in few gluten transfers to GF bread >20 ppm. Soap and water was consistently the most effective method for removing gluten, although other methods proved as effective in certain scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: The potential for gluten exposure at school is high for some materials and low for others. For high-risk materials, schools should provide GF supplies and have a robust strategy to prevent gluten cross-contact with food.
30318895	Detection and quantification of gluten immunogenic peptides in feces of infants and their relationship with diet.	BACKGROUND: there are no effective methods to easily control the correct adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) in celiac disease (CD) patients. AIM: to assess the sensitivity and specificity of a rapid immunochromatographic (IC) test that detects gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) in feces, compared to an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. METHODS: fecal samples from healthy infants were analyzed by a rapid IC test and ELISA, both methods are based on the anti-gliadin 33-mer monoclonal antibody. Group 1 included infants aged from 6 to 24 months, with an unrestricted consumption of gluten containing cereals. Group 2 (negative controls) was comprised of infants aged from 0 to 6 months, either breastfed or formula fed who had never ingested gluten. RESULTS: in group 1 (n = 34), all infants had positive values by ELISA, the mean was 13.13 mugGIP/g (range 0.56-46.79). The IC test was negative in 5/20 cases and there was a significant correlation (p=0.006) between the mean daily gluten intake and GIP in feces. In group 2 (n = 20), all the samples were negative by both methods. Moreover, the Kappa Fleiss concordance index (Kappa = 0.79 CI95% [0.616, 0.965]) indicated a moderate concordance between both methods. CONCLUSIONS: according to our results, both methods are highly specific. However, the ELISA test had a higher sensitivity. Although we found a significant correlation between the amount of gluten consumed and GIP recovery in feces, further studies are needed to clarify the impact of individual confounding factors in GIP recovery.
31102129	Going Against the Grains: Gluten-Free Diets in Patients Without Celiac Disease-Worthwhile or Not?	While the gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only known effective therapy for celiac disease, in recent years it has become increasingly popular in the USA and worldwide, with many believing it to be more "healthful" and others claiming that it has beneficial effects for health conditions, many extraintestinal, other than celiac disease. This review examines the evidence for use of the GFD in patients without celiac disease who self-report intestinal and/or extraintestinal symptoms (non-celiac gluten sensitivity), as well as for enhancement of athletic performance and treatment of autism, rheumatoid arthritis, and psychiatric disorders. Overall, the evidence for use of GFDs in conditions other than celiac disease is poor. Though non-celiac gluten sensitivity may ultimately emerge as a biomarker-defined condition, a large proportion of patients with apparent non-celiac gluten sensitivity have, after careful investigation, an alternative diagnosis. In light of this, and coupled with the potential physical and psychological harms associated with the avoidance of gluten, initiating a GFD should not be encouraged for people who have these other conditions or are seeking physical/athletic enhancement.
39360696	Celiac disease and nonceliac enteropathies.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review highlights recent research in the field of celiac disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiological studies continue to identify celiac disease-associated diseases such as inflammatory arthritis, irritable bowel syndrome, and cardiovascular disease. Recently published consensus guidelines provide recommendations for the long-term management and monitoring of patients with celiac disease. There are multiple pharmaceutical therapies for celiac disease under investigation, and recent phase I and phase II trials are reviewed here. Finally, a recent trial of patients with nonceliac gluten sensitivity demonstrates a significant nocebo effect in this condition. SUMMARY: Recent advances in celiac disease include the development of new clinical guidelines as well as promising new therapeutics. Continued high-quality research is needed to improve the outcomes of patients with celiac disease and nonceliac enteropathies.
35212046	Maternal autoimmune disease and risk of hospitalization for autoimmune disease, allergy, and cancer in offspring.	BACKGROUND: Children whose mothers have autoimmune disease may be at risk of developing immune-mediated disorders. We assessed the association between maternal autoimmune disease and risk of autoimmune disease, allergy, and cancer in offspring. METHODS: We analyzed a cohort of 1,011,623 children born in Canada between 2006 and 2019. We identified mothers who had autoimmune diseases and assessed hospitalizations for autoimmune disease, allergy, and cancer in offspring between birth and 14 years of age. We estimated hazard ratios (HR) for the association of maternal autoimmune disease with child hospitalization in adjusted Cox regression models. We used within-sibling analysis to control for genetic and environmental confounders. RESULTS: A total of 20,354 children (2.0%) had mothers with an autoimmune disease. Compared with no autoimmune disease, maternal autoimmune disease was associated with the risk of childhood hospitalization for autoimmune disease (HR 1.96, 95% CI 1.66-2.31) and allergy (HR 1.30, 95% CI 1.21-1.40), but was not significantly associated with cancer (HR 1.31, 95% CI 0.96-1.80). Type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, inflammatory arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus were among specific maternal autoimmune diseases most strongly associated with childhood hospitalization for autoimmune disease and allergy. The associations disappeared after controlling for genetic and environmental confounders in the within-sibling analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal autoimmune disease is associated with an increased risk of autoimmune disease and allergy hospitalization in offspring, but the relationship appears to be confounded by genetic and environmental factors. Prenatal exposure to immunologic or pharmacologic products is not likely a direct cause of immune-mediated disease in children.
37432208	Follow-Up of Celiac Disease in Adults: "When, What, Who, and Where".	For patients with celiac disease (CeD), a lifelong gluten-free diet is not a voluntary lifestyle choice-it is a necessity. The key end points in clinical follow-up are symptom resolution, the normalization of weight, prevention of overweight, seroconversion, and negation or minimization of increased long-term morbidity. For the latter, a surrogate endpoint is mucosal healing, which means the normalization of histology to Marsh 0-1. Ideally, celiac follow-up care includes a multidisciplinary approach, effective referral processes, improved access that leverages technological advances, and following guidelines with the identification of measurable quality indicators, ideally informed by evidence-based research. Face-to-face CeD care and telemedicine are considered the standards for this process, although published data are insufficient. Guidelines and statements on diagnosis are readily available. However, data are lacking on optimal clinic visit intervals and outcomes and quality indicators such as improvement of symptoms, function and quality of life, survival and disease control, and how to most effectively use healthcare resources. The results of future research should provide the basis for general recommendations for evidence-based standards of quality of care in CeD.
32545596	Thyroid-Gut-Axis: How Does the Microbiota Influence Thyroid Function?	A healthy gut microbiota not only has beneficial effects on the activity of the immune system, but also on thyroid function. Thyroid and intestinal diseases prevalently coexist-Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) and Graves' disease (GD) are the most common autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITD) and often co-occur with Celiac Disease (CD) and Non-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCWS). This can be explained by the damaged intestinal barrier and the following increase of intestinal permeability, allowing antigens to pass more easily and activate the immune system or cross-react with extraintestinal tissues, respectively. Dysbiosis has not only been found in AITDs, but has also been reported in thyroid carcinoma, in which an increased number of carcinogenic and inflammatory bacterial strains were observed. Additionally, the composition of the gut microbiota has an influence on the availability of essential micronutrients for the thyroid gland. Iodine, iron, and copper are crucial for thyroid hormone synthesis, selenium and zinc are needed for converting T4 to T3, and vitamin D assists in regulating the immune response. Those micronutrients are often found to be deficient in AITDs, resulting in malfunctioning of the thyroid. Bariatric surgery can lead to an inadequate absorption of these nutrients and further implicates changes in thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and T3 levels. Supplementation of probiotics showed beneficial effects on thyroid hormones and thyroid function in general. A literature research was performed to examine the interplay between gut microbiota and thyroid disorders that should be considered when treating patients suffering from thyroid diseases. Multifactorial therapeutic and preventive management strategies could be established and more specifically adjusted to patients, depending on their gut bacteria composition. Future well-powered human studies are warranted to evaluate the impact of alterations in gut microbiota on thyroid function and diseases.
34578835	It Is High Time for Personalized Dietary Counseling in Celiac Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis on Body Composition.	The body composition of patients with celiac disease (CD), on which the effects of a gluten-free diet (GFD) are controversial, differs from that of the average population. In this study, we aimed to compare the body composition across CD patients before a GFD, CD patients after a one-year GFD and non-celiac control subjects. A systematic search was conducted using five electronic databases up to 15 July 2021 for studies that reported at least one of the pre-specified outcomes. In meta-analyses, weighted mean differences (WMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. A total of 25 studies were eligible for systematic review, seven of which were included in meta-analysis. During a >=1-year GFD, fat mass of CD patients, compared to that at baseline, significantly increased (WMD = 4.1 kg, 95% CI = 1.5 to 6.6, three studies). In CD patients after a >=1-year GFD, compared to non-celiac controls, fat mass (WMD = -5.8 kg, 95% CI = -8.7 to -2.9, three studies) and fat-free mass (WMD = -1.9 kg, 95% CI = -3.0 to -0.7, three studies) were significantly lower. In conclusion, body composition-related parameters of CD patients differ from that of the non-celiac control subjects even after a longstanding GFD.
30905717	Efficacy of Enteric-Release Oral Budesonide in Treatment of Acute Reactions to Gluten in Patients With Celiac Disease.	Celiac disease (CeD) is a common gluten-responsive T cell-mediated enteropathy. The only current treatment is gluten avoidance; however, even when attempting to adhere to a gluten-free diet (GFD), symptomatic gluten exposures are frequent.1.
22940076	Celiac disease and selected long-term health issues.	Celiac disease is a genetically-based and immunologically-mediated systemic disorder, affecting primarily the small intestine in adults. About 0.5-1% of most populations studied are affected, with up to 2% in Finland. In families, specifically first-degree relatives, up to 20% may have the disease. Despite increased awareness among physicians and the public, celiac disease is still markedly under-diagnosed at all ages, including the elderly. Although serological screening is now widely used, celiac disease remains a biopsy-defined disorder, and a critical element to the correct diagnosis is documentation of a response to a gluten-free diet (since it is a gluten-sensitive disease). Sometimes, after the diagnosis has been established with a treatment response, changes re-appear and seem resistant to a gluten-free diet. Usually, poor or limited diet compliance, possibly from an unrecognized gluten source is responsible. In others, another superimposed cause, such as an infectious agent, could be important. Finally, another associated disease causing similar clinical and biopsy features or, alternatively, a complicating disorder may develop, such as a lymphoma. Some with biopsy features suggestive of celiac disease may not respond to a gluten-free diet. These may not have celiac disease at all, but instead, a sprue-like intestinal disease, or so-called unclassified sprue.

28502438	Celiac Disease and Nonceliac Gluten Sensitivity.	Gluten-related disorders include celiac disease (CD), wheat allergy, and nonceliac gluten sensitivity. CD is an autoimmune enteropathy caused by damage to small intestinal mucosa when gluten is ingested in genetically susceptible individuals. Currently, the only available treatment of CD is gluten-free diet. Several potential treatments are being researched. Wheat allergy is a hypersensitivity reaction caused by IgE-mediated and/or non-IgE-mediated immune response, and can involve the gastrointestinal tract, skin, or respiratory tract. Nonceliac gluten sensitivity is one of a variety of immunologic, morphologic, or symptomatic manifestations precipitated by ingestion of gluten in individuals in whom CD and wheat allergy are excluded.
28687943	Symptoms of Functional Intestinal Disorders Are Common in Patients with Celiac Disease Following Transition to a Gluten-Free Diet.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease and functional intestinal disorders may overlap, yet the natural history of functional symptoms in patients with celiac disease is unknown. AIM: To investigate the prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional dyspepsia (FD), and functional bloating (FB) symptoms among patients with celiac disease at diagnosis and during the first year of a gluten-free diet. METHODS: Adults with a new diagnosis of celiac disease were surveyed at baseline, 6 months and 1 year using standardized measures for intestinal symptoms [Rome III diagnostic questionnaire and celiac symptom index (CSI)] and gluten-free diet adherence [gluten-free eating assessment tool (GF-EAT) and celiac diet adherence test]. RESULTS: At diagnosis, two-thirds fulfilled Rome III diagnostic questionnaire symptom criteria for IBS (52%), functional dyspepsia (27%), and/or functional bloating (9%). One year post-diagnosis, there was high adherence to a gluten-free diet as 93% reported gluten exposure less than once per month on the GF-EAT and only 8% had ongoing celiac disease symptoms (CSI score >45). The rates of those meeting IBS (22%) and functional dyspepsia (8%) symptom criteria both decreased significantly on a gluten-free diet. The prevalence of functional symptoms (any of IBS, FD or FB) at 1 year was 47%. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term follow-up of patients with celiac disease is necessary because many patients with celiac disease who are adherent to a gluten-free diet have persistent gastrointestinal symptoms.
31880159	The value of a biopsy in celiac disease follow up: assessment of the small bowel after 6 and 24 months treatment with a gluten free diet.	INTRODUCTION: a routine small bowel biopsy (SBB) during the follow up of celiac disease (CD) is controversial. Little information is available regarding the histological changes during (gluten free diet (GFD) in the long term. OBJECTIVES: the aim of the study was to evaluate a novel criterion to compare duodenal histology in CD patients after six months and two years of gluten withdrawal. METHODS: this was a cross-sectional study of 200 patients with confirmed Marsh I-III who were under the six months (group A, n = 100) and 24 months (group B, n = 100) of a GFD. Nineteen patients were excluded due to an inadequate adherence to the GFD and another 23 patients were excluded as they were unwilling to undergo a re-endoscopy and did not comply with the necessary criteria. Endoscopy with a duodenal biopsy, serological assays and clinical evaluation were performed and compared with baseline data in the remaining 58 patients (20 patients in group A and 38 patients in group B). RESULTS: a significant complete histological recovery was found in 47.4% of patients in group B compared to 30% in group A (p = 0.026). A partial histological recovery was reported in seven (35%) and eleven (28.9%) patients in groups A and B, respectively. Any changes in mucosal histology after GFD was observed in 35% of patients in group A and 23.7% in group B. Serological assessment and endoscopic appearance normalized in 78.9% vs 75.0% in group B and 68.4% vs 65.0% in group A, respectively. However, this improvement did not reach statistical significance (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: the results of this study show that histological recovery in patients with Marsh >= III is slow and does not correlate with symptomatic improvement. We suggest that the long-term effects of a GFD can play an important role in achieving histological improvement, especially in older patients.
30016020	Effects of age of diagnosis and dietary compliance on growth parameters of patients with celiac disease.	INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to evaluate the relation between age at diagnosis and compliance to gluten free diet (GFD) on growth in children with celiac disease and the factors that influenced compliance to GFD. POPULATION AND METHODS: Celiac disease (CD) patients with villous atrophy followed in our hospital between January 2015 and January 2017, were included. They were classified according to diagnosis age and GFD compliance. Patients' anthropometric characteristics at diagnosis and follow-up were compared. RESULTS: There were 73 patients with 10.4 +- 4.5 years of average age, 35 (47.9%) patients had a short stature at diagnosis, the ages of patients who had short stature (7.8 +- 4.2 years) were higher than those who did not (5.1 +- 4.3 years) (p= 0.005). At diagnosis, 33 (45.2%) patients were aged <=6 years, 40 (54.8%) were aged >6 years. The height and weight z-scores of patients who were diagnosed at >6 years of age were significantly lower than those who were diagnosed <=6 years of age both at diagnosis (p= 0.01 and 0.04) and at last control (p= 0.001 and 0.001), respectively. Forty-five (61.6%) patients were fully compliant with GFD. In comparison of anthropometric data in terms of GFD compliance, the increase in BMI and weight z-score in the fully compliant group was found to be significantly higher when compared with the other group. CONCLUSIONS: Delay in CD diagnosis negatively affected both the height and weight and other growth parameters. GFD compliance positively affected the patients' all growth parameters, especially weight and BMI z-score.

38477385	Gluten-free diet adherence in pediatric celiac patients: Evaluating CDAT questionnaire and test for gluten detection in urine.	OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the contributions of the Adapted Celiac Dietary Adherence Test (CDAT) and the Rapid Urinary Gluten Detection Test (u-GIP) in assessing gluten-free diet adherence in children and adolescents with celiac disease. METHODS: Fifty-four celiac patients from two pediatric gastroenterology outpatient clinics affiliated with university hospitals were evaluated. The original CDAT was adapted for children through a transcultural process, and the original cutoff point was adopted to define adherence. A single examiner carried out the u-GIP test in fresh urine samples. Sociodemographic and clinical factors and family food security status were also evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 88.9% of participants (confidence interval [CI]: 77.4-95.8; p<0.001) adhered to the gluten-free diet, as determined by the adapted CDAT score, while 87.0% (CI: 75.1-94.6; p<0.001) had negative u-GIP results. Among the 48 children adhering to the CDAT, six exhibited positive u-GIP results in a urine sample. Of the six nonadherent participants, only one had a positive u-GIP result. Notably, none of the children and adolescents with celiac disease who tested positive for u-GIP reported symptoms on the day of testing, and their growth rates remained stable. CONCLUSIONS: Even celiac children and adolescents adhering to the CDAT questionnaire may show a positive u-GIP in a single measurement without accompanying symptoms or growth impairment. The u-GIP could be helpful in complementary tests in specific situations, such as for patients who exhibit compliant behavior but still experience symptoms or maintain persistent positive serology.
34464324	Bone Mineral Density Screening and the Frequency of Osteopenia/Osteoporosis in Turkish Adult Patients With Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis in adult patients with celiac disease (CD) at diagnosis and/or in the follow-up after a gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: Adult patients diagnosed with CD were retrospectively screened through follow-up records and computer databases. Patients assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) at diagnosis and/or in the follow-up after a GFD were included in the study. RESULTS: One hundred patients who underwent a DEXA scan at least once after diagnosis or after being on a GFD were included in the study. The mean age of the patients at diagnosis was 34.61 +- 10.3 years, and 84% of the patients (n = 84) were female. At the time of diagnosis (n = 46), the prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis was 67.3% and 15.2%, respectively, at the lumbar spine, and 43.4% and 10.8%, respectively, at the femur. After a GFD (n = 78), the prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis was 61.5% and 8.9%, respectively, at the lumbar spine, and 37.1% and 2.5%, respectively, at the femur. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of CD patients with low bone mineral density (BMD) is high after diagnosis and in the follow-up after a GFD. It is important for all patients with CD to undergo a DEXA scan to determine the follow-up and/or treatment characteristics.
28431885	Safety of Adding Oats to a Gluten-Free Diet for Patients With Celiac Disease: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Clinical and Observational Studies.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with celiac disease should maintain a gluten-free diet (GFD), excluding wheat, rye, and barley. Oats might increase the nutritional value of a GFD, but their inclusion is controversial. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the safety of oats as part of a GFD in patients with celiac disease. METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases for clinical trials and observational studies of the effects of including oats in GFD of patients with celiac disease. The studies reported patients' symptoms, results from serology tests, and findings from histologic analyses. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence. RESULTS: We identified 433 studies; 28 were eligible for analysis. Of these, 6 were randomized and 2 were not randomized controlled trials comprising a total of 661 patients-the remaining studies were observational. All randomized controlled trials used pure/uncontaminated oats. Oat consumption for 12 months did not affect symptoms (standardized mean difference: reduction in symptom scores in patients who did and did not consume oats, -0.22; 95% CI, -0.56 to 0.13; P = .22), histologic scores (relative risk for histologic findings in patients who consumed oats, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.01-4.8; P = .35), intraepithelial lymphocyte counts (standardized mean difference, 0.21; 95% CI, reduction of 1.44 to increase in 1.86), or results from serologic tests. Subgroup analyses of adults vs children did not reveal differences. The overall quality of evidence was low. CONCLUSIONS: In a systematic review and meta-analysis, we found no evidence that addition of oats to a GFD affects symptoms, histology, immunity, or serologic features of patients with celiac disease. However, there were few studies for many endpoints, as well as limited geographic distribution and low quality of evidence. Rigorous double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trials, using commonly available oats sourced from different regions, are needed.
34049371	Gluten-induced Neurocognitive Impairment: Results of a Nationwide Study.	GOALS: This study aimed to understand the neurocognitive symptoms associated with gluten exposure in individuals with self-reported celiac disease (CD) and nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). BACKGROUND: While gluten-induced neurocognitive impairment (GINI; eg, "celiac fog" or "brain fog") is commonly described by individuals with CD and NCGS, there are little data regarding the prevalence and symptoms associated with these experiences. STUDY: A 9-question online survey was accessed by 1396 individuals (1143 with CD; 253 with NCGS). Forced choice and free-response questions were asked of participants to obtain a description of neurocognitive symptoms experienced after gluten ingestion. Free-response answers were coded using a coding structure developed based on the Health-Related Quality of Life Instrument. RESULTS: The majority of survey participants (89% of CD and 95% of NCGS) reported having GINI symptoms. When describing symptoms, the most common word descriptors for both groups were difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, and grogginess. Timing of symptoms, including onset and symptom peak, were similar across the 2 groups. Coding of free responses found the most common references were to cognitive, physical, psychological, and overall quality of life impacts. CONCLUSIONS: This survey suggests that GINI is common and may be severe in both individuals with CD and NCGS. Cognitive impairment and decline in physical functioning may be similar to that occurring in other illnesses, such as lupus. Clinical follow-up with both individuals with CD and NCGS should include assessment of GINI symptoms. Further research is warranted, including the development of a patient-reported outcome measure including neurocognitive effects of gluten exposure.
32059410	Constitutive Differential Features of Type 2 Transglutaminase in Cells Derived from Celiac Patients and from Healthy Subjects.	Type 2 transglutaminase (TG2) is a ubiquitous enzyme able to modify gliadin peptides introduced into the organism through the diet. By means of its catalytic activity, TG2 seems to have an important pathogenetic role in celiac disease (CD), an inflammatory intestinal disease caused by the ingestion of gluten-containing cereals. A strong autoimmune response to TG2 characterizes CD development. Anti-TG2 antibodies specifically derange the uptake of the alpha-gliadin peptide 31-43 by control, but not by celiac dermal fibroblasts, underlying some different constitutive features regarding TG2 in healthy and celiac subjects. Our aim was to investigate whether these differences depended on a different TG2 subcellular distribution and whether peptide 31-43 differentially regulated TG2 expression and activity in cells of the two groups of subjects. We found that TG2 was more abundantly associated with membranes of celiac fibroblasts than of control cells, in particular with the early endosomal and autophagic compartments. We also found that peptide 31-43 differentially affected TG2 expression and activity in the two groups of cells, activating TG2 more in control than in celiac cells and inducing TG2 expression in celiac cells, but not in control ones. The different TG2 subcellular localization and the different way the peptide 31-43 modulates TG2 activity and availability into control and CD cells suggested that TG2 is involved in the definition of a constitutive CD cellular phenotype, thus having an important and still undefined role in CD pathogenesis.
21694536	Use of deamidated gliadin peptide antibodies to monitor diet compliance in childhood celiac disease.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate performance of serum antibodies against deamidated gliadin peptides (a-DGPs) in detecting compliance with gluten-free diet (GFD) in children with celiac disease (CD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serum samples were collected the same day of endoscopy in 95 children with CD and 106 controls. We preliminarily calculated the cutoff of a-DGP immunoglobulin A (IgA) and a-DGP IgA+G in our population by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Of 95 children with CD, 28 were studied during the first year after GFD introduction, with interview and serum collection every 3 months. In addition, serum samples were collected in 106 children with CD on GFD for more than 1 year (range 1-14). In both groups of children with CD on GFD, we compared a-DGP IgA and IgA+G performance in monitoring compliance with GFD with anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (anti-tTG) IgA and anti-gliadin antibody (AGA) IgA. RESULTS: The cutoff resulted in 13.1 arbitrary units (AU) for a-DGP IgA (sensitivity 87.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 79%-92%, specificity 97.2, 95% CI 92%-99%) and 16.5 for a-DGP IgA+G (sensitivity 94.7, 95% CI 88%-98%, specificity 89.6, 95% CI 84%-95%). In the first year of GFD, at 6 to 8 months prevalence of positive a-DGPs was significantly higher in partially versus strictly compliant children, and at 9 to 12 months only prevalence of positive a-DGP IgA+G remained significantly higher. Moreover, at 9 to 12 months sensitivity to detect transgressions to GFD was 44% for a-DGP IgA and 100% for a-DGP IgA+G (P = 0.03). In the 106 children on GFD for more than 1 year, sensitivity to detect transgressions to GFD was 60% for a-DGP IgA and 76% for a-DGP IgA+G. Anti-tTG IgA and AGA IgA sensitivity was much lower (24% and 4%, respectively). The 4 tests showed comparable high specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Both a-DGPs showed higher sensitivity than anti-tTG IgA and AGA IgA in monitoring compliance with GFD, but a-DGP IgA+G seemed to perform better. a-DGPs did not outperform anti-tTG IgA for CD screening.
37625879	In vivo sensitization to gliadin by oral administration.	Celiac disease is a highly prevalent immune-mediated enteropathy that develops in genetically susceptible individuals expressing HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 after ingestion of gluten and results in decreased quality of life and increased morbidity. This pathology is triggered by immunogenic peptides generated from gliadins present in gluten, which act on the intestinal mucosa in a context of high intestinal permeability, activating the innate and adaptive response of the immune system. Several in vivo rodent models attempt to reproduce some phases of the intestinal inflammatory process that occurs in celiac disease. Allergic sensitization to gluten simulates, or enhances in some animal models, the loss of tolerance to gliadin peptides and the initial events that lead to celiac disease in a specific genetic or environmental context. Here we describe a simple method for performing gliadin sensitization in an in vivo animal model.

28054938	Evolution of Gluten Content in Cereal-Based Gluten-Free Products: An Overview from 1998 to 2016.	The treatment of Celiac disease consists in a strict lifelong gluten-free (GF) diet. As the ingestion of small amounts can have damaging complications, there has been an ongoing discussion regarding the safe threshold for dietary residual gluten. The aim was to analyze the evolution of gluten content in cereal-based GF foodstuffs (n = 3141) from 1998 to 2016 measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique. Eight categories were defined: flours, breakfast cereals/bars, bakery, pasta, breads, dough, snacks, and yeasts, and these were divided into GF labeled-foods (GF-L) or reportedly GF foodstuffs, but not certified (GF-NC). Gluten-detection was decreased over time in line with the evolving European regulations about food information and gluten content claims. This decline started sooner in GF-L products than in GF-NC. As a whole, gluten was detected in 371 samples, with breakfast cereals/bars being the most contaminated group. Snacks and yeasts changed from being high gluten-detected samples to being totally GF over the years. The downside is that, of contaminated samples, those in the low levels of gluten detection range have decreased while flour samples containing over 100 mg/kg gluten have risen in the 2013-2016 period. Obtained data confirm that GF cereal-based foods are becoming safer but gluten control must be maintained.
26665656	[Benefits of gluten-free diet: myth or reality?].	Non celiac gluten sensitivity may explain digestive and general symptoms in patients without celiac disease but this recently described entity is controversial. The role of gluten in comparison to other nutriments such as saccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) remains debated. If a gluten-free diet is clearly indicated in celiac disease and wheat allergy, it remains debatable in non-celiac gluten sensitivity given weak and contradictory evidence. There is no strong evidence for a strict indication to a gluten-free diet in endocrinological, psychiatric, and rheumatologic diseases, or to improve performance in elite sports.
31144026	Oxidative stress, DNA stability and evoked inflammatory signaling in young celiac patients consuming a gluten-free diet.	PURPOSE: Celiac disease (CD) is a multifactorial, autoimmune, gluten-sensitive inflammatory disorder of the small intestine. Taking into account the pathogenesis of CD, a strict gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only treatment able to restore epithelium integrity and eliminate complications. The current study was designed to assess whether the use of a GFD is sufficient for maintaining a correct oxidative/antioxidant balance and ameliorating the evoked inflammatory signaling in young patients with CD. METHODS: The study covered 80 children, aged between 7 and 18 years, attending the Gastroenterology Service of the Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Child Nutrition Service from the Virgen de las Nieves Hospital in Granada. Children with CD diagnosed were included in the celiac group who followed a strict GFD for 2 years (n = 40) and the control group (n = 40) included healthy children, with negative serological screening. Soluble superoxide dismutase 1 and 2, total antioxidant status, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, cortisol, melatonin and inflammatory parameters in plasma, 15-F2t-isoprostanes in urine, and DNA breaks in peripheral blood lymphocytes were analysed. RESULTS: No differences were found in oxidative stress between CD patients and controls; however, IFN-gamma, IL-1alpha, IP-10 and TNF-beta were higher in the CD patients. VEGF was also higher than in the control group. CONCLUSION: The GFD in the CD patients is enough to reduce the oxidative stress; however, in the case of the inflammatory signaling, the initial exposure to gluten prior to stablish the GFD is strong enough to induce an inflammatory state which is maintained (even when consuming the GFD); meanwhile the increase in VEGF recorded in the CD group could be a compensatory mechanism to restore the damaged mucosa and duodenal villous atrophy, due to its role in endothelial activation and generation of new functional and stable vascular networks.

27352981	Seronegative celiac disease: Shedding light on an obscure clinical entity.	BACKGROUND: Although serological tests are useful for identifying celiac disease, it is well established that a minority of celiacs are seronegative. AIM: To define the prevalence and features of seronegative compared to seropositive celiac disease, and to establish whether celiac disease is a common cause of seronegative villous atrophy. METHODS: Starting from 810 celiac disease diagnoses, seronegative patients were retrospectively characterized for clinical, histological and laboratory findings. RESULTS: Of the 810 patients, fourteen fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for seronegative celiac disease based on antibody negativity, villous atrophy, HLA-DQ2/-DQ8 positivity and clinical/histological improvement after gluten free diet. Compared to seropositive, seronegative celiac disease showed a significantly higher median age at diagnosis and a higher prevalence of classical phenotype (i.e., malabsorption), autoimmune disorders and severe villous atrophy. The most frequent diagnosis in the 31 cases with seronegative flat mucosa was celiac disease (45%), whereas other diagnoses were Giardiasis (20%), common variable immunodeficiency (16%) and autoimmune enteropathy (10%). CONCLUSIONS: Although rare seronegative celiac disease can be regarded as the most frequent cause of seronegative villous atrophy being characterized by a high median age at diagnosis; a close association with malabsorption and flat mucosa; and a high prevalence of autoimmune disorders.
21288140	The effect of gluten-free diet on Th1-Th2-Th3-associated intestinal immune responses in celiac disease.	OBJECTIVE: To study T-helper (Th)1-Th2-Th3 gene activation profile in the small intestine and peripheral blood of children with celiac disease (CD) with special interest in the response to the gluten-free diet (GFD) treatment in order to elucidate an immune dysregulation not triggered by gluten. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Small intestinal biopsies and venous blood were taken from seven children with CD (mean age: 8 years, four girls) at presentation and after 1 year of strict GFD. The Th1-Th2-Th3 gene expression profile was examined by real-time PCR arrays. The findings were compared with the corresponding expressions in peripheral blood and small intestinal biopsies from six reference children without CD (mean age: 6 years, four girls). RESULTS: The Th1 gene expression profile including interferon (IFN)-gamma, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 and interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 1 together with reduced interleukin (IL)-2 expression was pronounced in small intestinal biopsies from children with untreated CD. A downregulation of IFN-gamma transcripts was seen after 1 year of GFD, but there was still increased expression of STAT1 and IRF1 in association with low IL-2 expression in spite of eliminated exposure to wheat gluten. By contrast, the decreased intestinal expression of Th2 gene markers observed at presentation was normalized with GFD. The alterations in the mucosal gene expression profile were not reflected in peripheral blood. CONCLUSION: The GFD did not correct the increased activation of the IFN-gamma signaling pathway related markers and reduced IL-2 expression, suggesting that they represent an immune dysregulation not dependent on gluten exposure.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the eyes of adult celiac disease (CD) patients and investigate the association between these ocular parameters with celiac specific antibodies and duration of gluten free diet (GFD). METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 72 eyes of 36 CD patients (18-51 years of age) and 70 eyes of 35 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. In addition to a complete ophthalmologic examination, all patients were scanned by a Scheimpflug camera, specular microscopy and spectral domain optical coherence tomography. RESULTS: Endothelial cell density (ECD), anterior chamber angle (ACA) degrees, anterior chamber depth (ACD), anterior chamber volume (ACV) and central macular thickness (CMT) values were lower in CD patients as compared with control group (p values = 0.038, 0.024, 0.002, 0.038 and 0.046 respectively). ECD and CMT were lower in celiac patients whom endomysial antibodies (EMA) IgA were positive (p = 0.001, p = 0.042 respectively). Tissue transglutaminase IgA antibody (anti tTG IgA) was weakly positively correlated (p > 0.05) with ACD, and positively (r = 0.319; p < 0.05) correlated with ACV. As the duration of compliance to the diet increased in the celiac group the mean and inferior retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness decreased (p = 0.035, p = 0.008 respectively). Mean, inferior and temporal RNFL thicknesses were lower in celiac patients whose duration of GFD was longer than 5 years (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Decreases in ECD, ACA degree, ACD, ACV and CMT can occur in CD patients. In adult celiac patients; ECD, CMT might be effected in the presence of positive EMA, and ACD, ACV might be effected in the presence of higher anti tTG IgA titer. Adult celiac patients who had longer duration of GFD may have thinner RNFL. RNFL may be thinner in celiac patients who comply with GFD for more than 5 years.
38276560	Gluten and Wheat in Women's Health: Beyond the Gut.	Since the rise of awareness of gluten/wheat-related disorders in the academic and clinical field in the last few decades, misinformation regarding the gluten-free diet (GFD) and its impact on health has been spreading among the general population. Despite the established link between gluten and celiac disease (CD), where a GFD is mandatory to reach clinical and histological remission, things are more complicated when it comes to non-celiac gluten/wheat sensitivity (NCGWS) and other autoimmune/dysimmune disorders. In the last conditions, a beneficial effect of gluten withdrawal has not been properly assessed, but still is often suggested without strong supporting evidence. In this context, women have always been exposed, more than men, to higher social pressure related to nutritional behaviors and greater engagement in controlling body weight. With this narrative review, we aim to summarize current evidence on the adherence to a GFD, with particular attention to the impact on women's health.
26971345	Severe influenza symptoms in celiac disease: implications of CD103- dendritic cells?	
21057330	First salivary screening of celiac disease by detection of anti-transglutaminase autoantibody radioimmunoassay in 5000 Italian primary schoolchildren.	OBJECTIVE: The high prevalence of celiac disease (CD) prompted us to evaluate a new, noninvasive disease screening strategy. The aim was to identify CD in 6- to 8-year-old children for a timely diagnosis, start gluten-free diet (GFD) in compliant subjects, achieve the growth target, and prevent CD complications. METHODS: Five thousand subjects were invited to participate in the study. Four thousand forty-eight saliva samples were tested for anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) immunoglobulin (Ig)A using a fluid-phase radioimmunoprecipitation method. Positive children were tested for serum radioimmunoassay tTG IgA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tTG IgA, and anti-endomysium IgA. Children confirmed as positive by serum assays underwent endoscopy with duodenal biopsies and, at the diagnosis of CD, were suggested to start GFD. RESULTS: Consent was obtained from 4242 parents (84.8%) for the screening to be performed, and adequate saliva samples were collected from 4048 children (95.4%). Thirty-two children were found to be salivary tTG IgA positive and 9 with borderline autoantibody levels. Thirty-one of the 32 and 3 of the 9 subjects were also serum positive. Twenty-eight children showed villous atrophy when undergoing intestinal biopsy, whereas 1 had Marsh 1 lesions; 3 children were suggested to start GFD without performing endoscopy. CD prevalence in the population investigated (including 19 CD known cases) was 1.16%. The ratio between screening-detected patients and those diagnosed before the screening was 3:2. The ratio between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients was 1:1.6. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that it is possible to perform a powerful, simple, well-accepted, and sensitive CD screening using saliva. Until now, the compliance with GFD in children with CD has been optimal.
32251205	Short-term, low dose vitamin D supplementation in young patients with celiac disease: a pilot study.	
21189704	Intractable seizures and metabolic bone disease secondary to celiac disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is Gluten sensitive enteropathy with a wide spectrum of severity and protean clinical manifestations. Patients with atypical (non-diarrhoeal) presentations are missed as the diagnosis of Celiac Disease is not considered. We present three young girls (ages 18, 19, 23 at presentation) who were admitted to our hospital as intractable seizures. All had low serum calcium, features of rickets/osteomalacia and anaemia. This prompted us to consider malabsorption due to CD. The diagnosis of CD was confirmed by serologic tests (IgA transglutaminase and IgG antigliadin antibodies) and biopsy of the duodenum. In all patients gluten free diet not only provided drug free control of seizures but also helped correct other features of malabsorption like hypocalcaemia and anaemia as the primary pathology behind these symptoms was corrected. We wish to highlight that hypocalcaemia of CD which may present as intractable seizures can be treated only by treating CD with gluten free diet and not by oral vitamin D and Calcium alone.
25678010	Prevention of hepatitis B virus infection: from the past to the future.	About 3-5 % of the world's population is chronically infected by hepatitis B virus (HBV) and is at risk of developing liver cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. The risk of dying prematurely because of chronic HBV infection is higher in younger people. The current strategies to prevent HBV infection involve immunization (active and/or passive) and antiviral chemoprophylaxis. The vaccines available for active immunization, containing hepatitis B surface antigen, are safe and confer long-term immunity in most healthy subjects. Since the vaccination is unsatisfactory in some patients, e.g., those with chronic kidney disease, human immunodeficiency virus infection, type I diabetes mellitus, and celiac disease, new strategies of vaccination are required. The neonatal, infant, and adolescent routine program vaccination in about 180 countries has greatly decreased the disease burden. Passive immunization with specific HBV immunoglobulins is recommended after single acute exposure, in infants born to infected mothers, and in HBV-infected patients undergoing liver transplantation combined with nucleoside/nucleotide analogues (chemoprophylaxis). Chemoprophylaxis is also indicated in HBV carrier candidates for immunosuppressive treatment and in patients with occult B infection undergoing immunosuppressive therapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Since HBV is not eradicable by an immune response or by antiviral drugs developed so far, the only preventive strategy remains global neonatal vaccination in all countries, firstly in HBV-endemic countries.
28673580	The enteric toxicity of gluten enhances graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.	Pro-inflammatory peptides present in wheat and related grains are associated with celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity. We hypothesize that these peptides induce enteric responses that may exacerbate the gastrointestinal manifestations of graft-versus-host disease after an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Therefore, we propose that a gluten free diet should be tested as a prophylactic and/or therapeutic intervention against gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease for patients undergoing an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant.
35328331	Antibody Responses to Transglutaminase 3 in Dermatitis Herpetiformis: Lessons from Celiac Disease.	Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is the skin manifestation of celiac disease, presenting with a blistering rash typically on the knees, elbows, buttocks and scalp. In both DH and celiac disease, exposure to dietary gluten triggers a cascade of events resulting in the production of autoantibodies against the transglutaminase (TG) enzyme, mainly TG2 but often also TG3. The latter is considered to be the primary autoantigen in DH. The dynamics of the development of the TG2-targeted autoimmune response have been studied in depth in celiac disease, but the immunological process underlying DH pathophysiology is incompletely understood. Part of this process is the occurrence of granular deposits of IgA and TG3 in the perilesional skin. While this serves as the primary diagnostic finding in DH, the role of these immunocomplexes in the pathogenesis is unknown. Intriguingly, even though gluten-intolerance likely develops initially in a similar manner in both DH and celiac disease, after the onset of the disease, its manifestations differ widely.
29095937	Younger age at diagnosis predisposes to mucosal recovery in celiac disease on a gluten-free diet: A meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Persistent intestinal damage is associated with higher complication rates in celiac disease. We aimed to assess the potential modifiers of mucosal recovery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We screened databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Trials, and Web of Science) for papers on celiac disease. Papers discussing (1) celiac patients (2) follow-up biopsy and (3) mucosal recovery after commencement of a gluten-free diet were included. The primary outcome was to produce a comprehensive analysis of complete mucosal recovery (i.e., Marsh 0 on follow-up). We compared children's recovery ratios to those of adults. Patients following a strict gluten-free dietary regimen were included in a subgroup. Summary point estimates, 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and 95% predictive intervals (PIs) were calculated. Heterogeneity was tested with I2-statistic. The PROSPERO registration number is CRD42016053482. RESULTS: The overall complete mucosal recovery ratio, calculated from 37 observational studies, was 0.36 (CI: 0.28-0.44, PI: -0.12-0.84; I2: 98.4%, p<0.01). Children showed higher complete mucosal recovery ratio than adults (p<0.01): 0.65 (CI: 0.44-0.85, PI: -0.10-1.39; I2: 96.5%, p<0.01) as opposed to 0.24 (CI: 0.15-0.33, PI: -0.19-1.08; I2: 96.3%, p<0.01). In the strict dietary adherence subgroup, complete mucosal recovery ratio was 0.47 (CI: 0.24-0.70, PI: -0.47-1.41; I2: 98.8%, p<0.001). On meta-regression, diagnostic villous atrophy (Marsh 3) ratio (-8.97, p<0.01) and male ratio (+6.04, p<0.01) proved to be a significant determinant of complete mucosal recovery, unlike duration of gluten-free diet (+0.01, p = 0.62). The correlation between complete mucosal recovery ratio and age on diagnosis is of borderline significance (-0.03, p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable heterogeneity across studies concerning complete mucosal recovery ratios achieved by a gluten-free diet in celiac disease. Several celiac patients fail to achieve complete mucosal recovery even if a strict dietary regimen is followed. Younger age on diagnosis, less severe initial histologic damage and male gender predispose for achieving mucosal recovery.
29752728	A retrospective study of dermatitis herpetiformis from an immunobullous disease clinic in north India.	BACKGROUND: Indian data on dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is not available. The aim of this study was to investigate the demographic and clinicopathological characteristics of patients with DH and to study its association with other autoimmune diseases. METHODS: All data were collected from case record forms of patients registered in immunobullous disease clinic of our institute. The diagnosis was based on characteristic clinical and immuno/histopathological features. RESULTS: A total of 65 patients were included, which constituted 9.47% of the registered patients in the immunobullous disease clinic over 3.5 years. The male to female ratio was 1.4 : 1; the average age was 44.35 +- 15.52 years. Direct immunofluorescence showed granular IgA deposits at the papillary tips in 83.07% and basement membrane zone in 12.3% patients. Sixteen (24.1%) patients had associated celiac disease, and 15 (23.07%) patients had other autoimmune comorbidities such as hypothyroidism. Forty percent of patients on strict gluten-free diet achieved remission in 2 years, while 35.4% had frequent relapses as they continued gluten intake. CONCLUSIONS: Dermatitis herpetiformis is not a rare disease in northern India as previously believed. The clinical, histological, and immunopathological characteristics of Indian DH patients are similar to those reported in Caucasian populations. The limitations of our study include an absence of genetic testing for HLA-DQ2 or DQ8, nonavailability of kits for detecting IgA specific for epidermal transglutaminase (IgA eTG), and short follow-up period.
32245180	Is a Gluten-Free Diet Enough to Maintain Correct Micronutrients Status in Young Patients with Celiac Disease?	The current study assesses whether the use of a gluten-free diet (GFD) is sufficient for maintaining correct iron status in children with celiac disease (CD). The study included 101 children. The celiac group (n = 68) included children with CD, with long (> 6 months) (n = 47) or recent (< 6 months) (n = 21) adherence to a GFD. The control group (n = 43) included healthy children. Dietary assessment was performed by a food frequency questionnaire and a 3-day food record. Celiac children had lower iron intake than controls, especially at the beginning of GFD (p < 0.01). The group CD-GFD >6 months showed a higher intake of cobalamin, meat derivatives and fish compared to that of CD-GFD <6 months (all, p < 0.05). The control group showed a higher consumption of folate, iron, magnesium, selenium and meat derivatives than that of children CD-GFD >6 months (all, p < 0.05). Control children also showed a higher consumption of folate and iron compared to that of children CD-GFD <6 months (both, p < 0.05). The diet of celiac children was nutritionally less balanced than that of the control. Participation of dietitians is necessary in the management of CD to guide the GFD as well as assess the inclusion of iron supplementation and other micronutrients that may be deficient.
27018786	Effective Identification of Low-Gliadin Wheat Lines by Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS): Implications for the Development and Analysis of Foodstuffs Suitable for Celiac Patients.	SCOPE: The aim of this work was to assess the ability of Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) to distinguish wheat lines with low gliadin content, obtained by RNA interference (RNAi), from non-transgenic wheat lines. The discriminant analysis was performed using both whole grain and flour. The transgenic sample set included 409 samples for whole grain sorting and 414 samples for flour experiments, while the non-transgenic set consisted of 126 and 156 samples for whole grain and flour, respectively. METHODS AND RESULTS: Samples were scanned using a Foss-NIR Systems 6500 System II instrument. Discrimination models were developed using the entire spectral range (400-2500 nm) and ranges of 400-780 nm, 800-1098 nm and 1100-2500 nm, followed by analysis of means of partial least square (PLS). Two external validations were made, using samples from the years 2013 and 2014 and a minimum of 99% of the flour samples and 96% of the whole grain samples were classified correctly. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the ability of NIRS to successfully discriminate between wheat samples with low-gliadin content and wild types. These findings are important for the development and analysis of foodstuff for celiac disease (CD) patients to achieve better dietary composition and a reduction in disease incidence.
28695483	Diagnosis and management of treatment-refractory hypothyroidism: an expert consensus report.	There is a frequently encountered subset of hypothyroid patients who are refractory to standard thyroid hormone replacement treatment and require unexpectedly high doses of levothyroxine. In addition to clinical situations where hypothyroid patients are non-compliant, or where there is the possibility of excipient-induced disease exacerbation (gluten/celiac disease), therapeutic failure may be due to impaired absorption of the administered drug. The common approach to managing patients with unusual thyroxine needs is to escalate the dose of levothyroxine until targeted TSH levels are achieved. This approach can increase the risk for prolonged exposure to supratherapeutic doses of levothyroxine, which increase the chances of adverse outcomes. Repeated adjustments of levothyroxine can also escalate the costs of treatment, as frequent office visits and laboratory tests are required to determine and maintain the desired dose. Clinicians should take a systematic approach to managing patients whom they suspect of having treatment-refractory hypothyroidism. This may include searching for, and adjusting, occult medical conditions and/or other factors that may affect the absorption of levothyroxine, before up-titrating the dose of traditional levothyroxine therapy. Depending on the underlying pathology, another approach that may be considered is to try alternative formulations of levothyroxine that are less susceptible to intolerance issues related to excipients, or, in some cases, to malabsorption. The early discovery of these factors via a thoughtful patient work-up may avoid unnecessary thyroid medication adjustments and their consequences for both patients and clinicians.
38613127	Efficacy of a Low-FODMAP Diet for Coeliac Patients with Persistent IBS-like Symptoms despite a Gluten-Free Diet: A Systematic Review.	Background: Persistent symptoms in coeliac disease (CD) can be due to not only poor gluten-free diet (GFD) adherence and complications of CD, but also functional gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Although the role of a low fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) diet is well-established in IBS, little data are available on its role in coeliac patients with persistent IBS-like symptoms despite a GFD. Methods: We systematically reviewed the literature in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines for studies evaluating the role of FODMAPs and/or a low-FODMAP diet in coeliac patients with persistent symptoms. PubMed and Embase were searched from inception to 16 January 2024 for eligible full-text papers. The study protocol was registered on Open Science Framework. Results: A total of 239 records were identified, and six papers were included. Of these, four were interventional studies comparing a low-FODMAP GFD to a regular GFD for persistent symptoms in 115 total coeliac patients (two randomized controlled trials and two open-label studies). A low-FODMAP GFD for a minimum of 4 weeks was significantly more effective than a regular GFD in reducing symptoms (p < 0.05 in 3/4 studies). Dietary FODMAP content of a conventional GFD was significantly lower than that of non-coeliac patients on a gluten-containing diet (both p < 0.05), especially regarding high-FODMAP grain products. However, coeliac patients consumed more servings of fruits/vegetables high in FODMAP. No relationship between FODMAP intake and persistence of symptoms was reported. Conclusions: A low-FODMAP diet may be beneficial for uncomplicated celiac patients with persistent IBS-like symptoms despite strict adherence to a GFD.
30726852	Pigment Epithelium-Derived Factor Affects Angiogenesis in Celiac Disease.	OBJECTIVE: Recent studies have demonstrated that angiogenesis is impaired in patients with celiac disease (CD). In this study, we evaluated the levels of the novel antiangiogenic factor pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) in CD patients. METHODS: Eighty-four patients were included in the study; 71 patients with CD and 13 healthy controls. In the CD patient cohort, there were 21 newly diagnosed patients, 19 with adherence to a gluten-free diet and 31 practicing no adherence to this diet. The PEDF levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. RESULTS: The data revealed that celiac patients had higher levels of PEDF than did healthy controls. PEDF levels were not significantly different among the three CD groups. Additionally, the PEDF levels were not correlated with tissue transglutaminase IgA or IgG. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that PEDF levels are significantly higher in CD patients than those in the healthy controls. This result suggests that PEDF negatively affects angiogenesis in CD. Although we did not observe any differences of PEDF levels among celiac patients, additional studies including more patients could clarify this issue.
30872088	Sequence of acquisition of self-management skills to follow a gluten-free diet by adults with celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) treatment is lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD), requiring mastery of numerous skills to maintain health. AIMS: To assess the rate of self-management skill acquisition following diagnosis, and the influence of demographic factors on this rate. METHODS: Patients attending a celiac center were invited to complete an anonymous survey which reported demographic information and time for mastery of self-management skills relevant to CD. RESULTS: Completed surveys were returned by 137 patients (79% female). Most participants reported mastering skills that involved identifying gluten-containing versus gluten-free foods within 6 months. Explaining CD and GFD to others required 1-2 years. Identifying gluten in medications and supplements required 3-5 years. Traveling internationally with GFD adherence required more than five years to learn. Demographic factors were not associated with the rate of acquisition. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first description of a timeline for relevant skill acquisition following diagnosis for CD. A sequence emerges, with most patients learning skills relevant to home, then social settings, then the workplace, and, finally, unfamiliar settings. Awareness of this progression of mastery, and particular recognition of difficult skills will allow physicians and dietitians to provide CD patients with targeted education and resources to facilitate adherence.
32316028	Immune profiling of breast milk from mothers with treated celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: The protective effect of breastfeeding on celiac disease (CD) onset is controversial. We studied a wide range of milk components in milk produced by celiac mothers following long-term gluten-free diet (GFD) in comparison to milk produced by healthy mothers. METHODS: Breast-milk samples from celiac (n = 33) and healthy (n = 41) mothers were obtained during the first year of lactation. A panel of bioactive components was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the aqueous fraction. We studied molecules involved in defenses, immunoregulation, and strengthening of the gut-epithelial barrier. RESULTS: During late lactation (from 6 to 12 months after delivery), the content of total immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgM was significantly lower in the milk produced by celiac patients. Nevertheless, gliadin (GFD)-specific IgA relative contribution was higher in this group, in contrast to tetanus toxoid-specific antibodies. The balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory molecules was different. While interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 were most frequently found in samples from celiac mothers, soluble Toll-like receptor-2 prevalence was lower. CONCLUSIONS: We describe differences between the innate and adaptive immune profile of milk produced by celiac and healthy mothers. These results might explain previous controversial reports about breastfeeding and CD protection. IMPACT: In spite of a long-term adherence to GFD, the milk produced by mothers with CD exhibit a different immune profile, in relation with some immunoregulatory factors and antibody content. This work shows a more comprehensive characterization of milk from celiac mothers, including macronutrients, lysozymes, growth factors, and immunoregulatory components that had not been studied before. The present study widens the available data regarding the characteristics of human milk of celiac mothers following GFD. Further follow-up studies of the health of children who were breastfed by celiac mothers will be necessary in order to also estimate the impact of the present results therein.
22690983	Celiac disease in elderly adults: clinical, serological, and histological characteristics and the effect of a gluten-free diet.	OBJECTIVES: To compare celiac disease (CD) in older and younger adults and to assess the effects of a gluten-free diet (GFD). DESIGN: Retrospective retrieval of information prospectively entered into a structured database. SETTING: CD clinic, University and Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy. PARTICIPANTS: Two cohorts were identified (older, Group A, n = 59, >65; younger, Group B, n = 1,166, 18-64), and Group B was subgrouped (B1, n = 600, 18-34; B2, n = 440, 35-49; and B3, n = 26, 50-64). MEASUREMENTS: Clinical, serological, and histological characteristics of individuals with CD studied before and during a GFD. RESULTS: At presentation, weight loss (37% vs 21%, P = .005) and dyspepsia (22% vs 12%, P = .04) were more frequent in older than younger participants. Incidence at diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) was much higher in older (5%) than younger participants (0.3%, P = .003). Prevalence of osteoporosis was 67% in older and 14% in younger male participants and 70% in older and 9% in younger female participants ( P < .001). During treatment, adherence to a GFD was 90%, normal villous structure was reconstituted, and t-transglutaminase antibodies were negative in 80% of older and younger participants. Lumbar-sacral and femoral T scores increased significantly during a GFD in pooled results of 48 older and younger participants studied before and during GFD. CONCLUSION: NHL is already present at CD diagnosis in most cases in individuals aged 50 and older, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis. Older and younger individuals are equally adherent and equally benefit from a GFD, indicating that older age is not a barrier to dietary treatment.
26222659	FTO Polymorphism rs9939609 Contributes to Weight Changes in Children With Celiac Disease on Gluten-Free Diet.	OBJECTIVES: Studies of adults and children with celiac disease have reported an increased risk of overweight during gluten-free diet (GFD). The fat mass and obesity-associated gene (FTO) variant rs9939609 has been associated with increased risk of developing obesity in children and adults. METHODS: In our study, we analyzed the effect of this variant on weight gain in a cohort of 280 children with celiac disease on GFD. RESULTS: We found that after a mean follow-up time of 3.0 years on GFD, FTO polymorphism influenced significantly the mean change in body mass index z score (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the FTO gene contributes to determine weight changes in children with celiac disease on GFD.
29478494	Safety of Oats in Children with Celiac Disease: A Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term validity and safety of pure oats in the treatment of children with celiac disease. STUDY DESIGN: This noninferiority clinical trial used a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design extended over 15 months. Three hundred six children with a biopsy-proven diagnosis of celiac disease on a gluten-free diet for >=2 years were randomly assigned to eat specifically prepared gluten-free food containing an age-dependent amount (15-40 g) of either placebo or purified nonreactive varieties of oats for 2 consecutive 6-month periods separated by washout standard gluten-free diet for 3 months. Clinical (body mass index, Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale score), serologic (IgA antitransglutaminase antibodies, and IgA anti-avenin antibodies), and intestinal permeability data were measured at baseline, and after 6, 9, and 15 months. Direct treatment effect was evaluated by a nonparametric approach using medians (95% CI) as summary statistic. RESULTS: After the exclusion of 129 patients who dropped out, the cohort included 177 children (79 in the oats-placebo and 98 in the placebo-oats group; median, 0.004; 95% CI, -0.0002 to 0.0089). Direct treatment effect was not statistically significant for clinical, serologic, and intestinal permeability variables (body mass index: median, -0.5; 95% CI, -0.12 to 0.00; Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale score: median, 0; 95% CI, -2.5 to 0.00; IgA antitransglutaminase antibodies: median, -0.02; 95% CI, -0.25 to 0.23; IgA anti-avenin antibodies: median, -0.0002; 95% CI, -0.0007 to 0.0003; intestinal permeability test: median, 0.004; 95% CI, -0.0002 to 0.0089). CONCLUSIONS: Pure nonreactive oat products are a safe dietary choice in the treatment of children with celiac disease. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00808301.
23818144	Relaxation and guided imagery used with 12-year-olds during venipuncture in a school-based screening study.	Needle-related procedures are reported to be problematic for children. In a school-based celiac disease screening, 12-year-olds' experiences with relaxation and guided imagery (R-GI) during venipuncture were investigated. One group tried nurse-led R-GI (n = 60) and another group received standard care (SC; n = 49). A mixed method design was applied using short written narratives, facial affective scale (FAS), and visual analog scale (VAS) for pain intensity. Qualitative content analysis highlighted that diversity and contradictions when facing blood tests. FAS scores were significantly lower in the SC group before (p = 0.01), during (p = 0.01), and after (p = 0.01) venipuncture. VAS scores did not differ between the groups. The blood test was mostly experienced as unproblematic, and GI during venipuncture did not decrease pain or affect. However, the fact that a number of children scored high FAS indicates a need for effective methods to help children cope with needle-related school-based procedures. 
31594655	Pseudo-obstruction, enteric dysmotility and irritable bowel syndrome.	New diagnostic techniques have advanced our knowledge about the irritable bowel syndrome. The majority of patients that we believed to have a psychosomatic disorder have received other diagnoses explaining their symptoms. Endoscopy makes it possible to diagnose celiac disease before it leads to malnutrition and allows the detection of microscopic colitis as a cause of watery diarrhea. At the severe end of the symptom spectrum enteric dysmotility marks the border at which IBS ceases to be a functional disorder and becomes a genuine motility disorder. Joint hypermobility or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is present in a substantial proportion of patients with enteric dysmotility. Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction is the end-stage of a large number of very rare disorders in which failed peristalsis is the common denominator. Nutritional needs and symptom control are essential in the management of pseudo-obstruction. Home parenteral nutrition is life saving in more than half of patients with chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction.
30978358	Progression of Celiac Disease in Children With Antibodies Against Tissue Transglutaminase and Normal Duodenal Architecture.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Potential celiac disease is characterized by positive results from serologic tests for tissue transglutaminase antibodies (anti-TG2) but normal duodenal architecture (Marsh stages 0-1). There is controversy over the best way to manage these patients. We investigated risk factors associated with the development of villous atrophy in children with potential celiac disease. METHODS: We performed a prospective study of 280 children (ages 2-18 years) in Italy with suspected celiac disease, followed for up to 12 years (range, 18-150 months; median 60 months). The subjects had 2 consecutive positive results from tests for anti-TG2, tested positive for the endomysial antibody (anti-EMA), had total serum levels of immunoglobulin A in the normal range, normal duodenal architecture (Marsh stages 0-1) in 5 biopsies, and HLA DQ2- or DQ8-positive haplotypes. The children underwent serologic tests and clinical analyses every 6 months and a small bowel biopsy was taken every 2 years. A total of 210 patients of the original cohort were assessed at the 9-year follow-up evaluation. We performed multivariate analyses of clinical, genetic, and histologic data to identify factors associated with progression to villous atrophy. RESULTS: During the follow-up period, 42 (15%) of 280 children developed villous atrophy, whereas 89 (32%) children no longer tested positive for anti-TG2 or anti-EMA. The cumulative incidence of progression to villous atrophy was 43% at 12 years. In multivariate analysis, the baseline factors most strongly associated with development of villous atrophy were numbers of gammadelta intraepithelial lymphocyte cells followed by age and homozygosity for the HLA DQB1*02. In discriminant analysis, these baseline factors identified 80% of the children who developed baseline atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: In a long-term study of 280 children with suspected celiac disease (based on anti-TG2 and anti-EMA) on gluten-containing diets, the cumulative incidence of progression to villous atrophy was 43% over a 12-year period. We identified factors that can be used to identify children at highest risk for villous atrophy. This approach might be used to determine whether children with suspected celiac disease should immediately start a gluten-free diet or be monitored on their regular diet.
31952431	Suppressive Mechanisms Induced by Tregs in Celiac Disease	Celiac disease (CD) is a systemic immune-mediated disorder caused by the dietary gluten in individuals who are genetically susceptible to the disease. In fact, CD is a T cell-mediated immune disease in which gluten-derived peptides activate the lamina propria CD4+ Teff cells, and these T-cell subsets can cause the intestinal tissue damages. Also, there are additional subsets of CD4+ T cells with suppressor functions. These subsets express the master transcription factor, FOXP3, and include Tr1 cells and CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), which are the main population involved in maintaining the peripheral tolerance, preventing the autoimmune diseases and limiting the chronic inflammatory diseases such as CD. The suppressive function of Tregs is important to maintain the immune homeostasis. This paper examined the features and the basic mechanisms used by Tregs to mediate the suppression in CD.
29672438	Alterations of Inflammatory and Matrix Production Indices in Celiac Disease With Low Bone Mass on Long-term Gluten-free Diet.	BACKGROUND: A clinically meaningful impairment of bone mass secondary to malabsorption is frequent in untreated celiac disease. In adult patients, a rigorous gluten-free diet (GFD) significantly improves, but does not always normalize, bone mineral density (BMD). The reason for this marginal response is unclear. Accordingly, we evaluated the role of both local and systemic factors for bone loss in celiac patients on long-term GFD. STUDY: In a prospective cohort, 22 patients with low lumbar and/or femoral BMD and 22 with normal BMD underwent bone and mineral metabolism evaluation: we tested calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D; telopeptide of type I collagen, a bone resorption index; propeptide of type I procollagen, a bone neoformation index; receptor antagonist of NF-kB ligand, an osteoclast-stimulating factor; osteoprotegerin (OPG), a decoy receptor for RANKL. Sunlight exposure and physical exercise were measured. RESULTS: Patients with bone loss showed prevalently osteopenia, severe osteoporosis was rare. In comparison with normal BMD patients, they showed higher serum OPG, telopeptide, and lower serum propeptide, suggesting an increased bone turnover. Lumbar T-score was negatively correlated with OPG, telopeptide and RANKL and positively with propeptide. Propeptide was negatively correlated with OPG and telopeptide. OPG was positively correlated with telopeptide. CONCLUSIONS: The persistent activation of inflammation should be considered the main pathophysiological mechanism for bone defect in celiac disease patients with bone loss on long-term GFD. High levels of OPG, an attempt at protective mechanism, and low levels of propeptide of type I procollagen, reflecting an insufficient matrix production, characterize this subgroup of patients.
36380606	Anemia in Celiac Disease: Multiple Aspects of the Same Coin.	Extraintestinal manifestations of celiac disease (CD) are an integral part of the disease's clinical profile and, frequently, appear as the presenting feature. Given that anemia in CD may be multifactorial, increased awareness is needed on the part of treating physicians, and especially hematologists, to screen for CD. In this study, we highlight anemia as the presenting feature of CD which has remained undiagnosed for several years. In patients with a positive antibody testing or high suspicion of CD, endoscopy with a biopsy of the small intestine is performed, as it is considered the "gold standard" for diagnosing CD. Since most of the manifestations of CD are preventable or treatable with a gluten-free diet, an early diagnosis is vital for the prevention of serious and potentially lethal complications.
27908520	Diagnosis and Updates in Celiac Disease.	Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder induced by gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. It can result in intraintestinal and extraintestinal manifestations of disease including diarrhea, weight loss, anemia, osteoporosis, or lymphoma. Diagnosis of celiac disease is made through initial serologic testing and then confirmed by histopathologic examination of duodenal biopsies. Generally celiac disease is a benign disorder with a good prognosis in those who adhere to a gluten-free diet. However, in refractory disease, complications may develop that warrant additional testing with more advanced radiologic and endoscopic methods. This article reviews the current strategy to diagnose celiac disease and the newer modalities to assess for associated complications.
28229610	Coping with celiac disease: how heavy is the burden for caregivers?	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is the most common chronic enteropathy demanding a lifelong gluten-free diet. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to identify and estimate the subjective burden of caregivers of celiac patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted during the regional meeting of the Italian Society for the Celiac Disease in April 2014. A written self-administered anonymous questionnaire enquired into caregivers' demographic profile, natural history of patients' disease and caregivers' self-reported degree of burden at the onset of symptoms (T0), at CD diagnosis (T1) and during follow-up (T2). Fifty-five caregivers completed the questionnaire (69% females, 47 +- 13 years old, 73% first-degree relatives). RESULTS: The presence of warning symptoms, such as abdominal pain, chronic diarrhea and weight loss was responsible for higher levels of concern. A statistically significant reduction of concern in the follow-up was demonstrated by the comparison of visual analogue scales (VAS) values from T0 to T2 and from T1 to T2 (6.8 +- 3.1 vs 4.2 +- 2.9 and 7.0 +- 2.5 vs 4.2 +- 2.9, respectively; p < 0.001), mirroring the reduction of distress among newly diagnosed individuals. A global impact of gluten-free diet and CD on quality of life was reported in VASs (6.7 +- 2.4). Family (5.4 +- 3.1), social (5.6 +- 2.9) and economic (4.5 +- 3.4) domains were the most associated. CONCLUSION: The assessment of caregivers' subjective burden should be considered as an essential step in the evaluation of celiac patients, needing a specific investigation and support.
31127932	Mendelian randomization analysis of celiac GWAS reveals a blood expression signature with diagnostic potential in absence of gluten consumption.	Celiac disease (CeD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy with a strong genetic component where the main environmental trigger is dietary gluten, and currently a correct diagnosis of the disease is impossible if gluten-free diet (GFD) has already been started. We hypothesized that merging different levels of genomic information through Mendelian randomization (MR) could help discover genetic biomarkers useful for CeD diagnosis. MR was performed using public databases of expression quantitative trait loci (QTL) and methylation QTL as exposures and the largest CeD genome-wide association study conducted to date as the outcome, in order to identify potential causal genes. As a result, we identified UBE2L3, an ubiquitin ligase located in a CeD-associated region. We interrogated the expression of UBE2L3 in an independent data set of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and found that its expression is altered in CeD patients on GFD when compared to non-celiac controls. The relative expression of UBE2L3 isoforms predicts CeD with 100% specificity and sensitivity and could be used as a diagnostic marker, especially in the absence of gluten consumption. This approach could be applicable to other diseases where diagnosis of asymptomatic patients can be complicated.
28340001	Early-life origin of intestinal inflammatory disorders.	A growing body of evidence supports the concept of perinatal programming through which the perinatal environment affects the development of the fetus and infant, thereby modifying the risk profile for disease later in life. Increasing attention is focusing on the role of the early environment in the development of chronic intestinal disorders. Epidemiological studies have highlighted the link between perinatal factors, such as breastfeeding, cesarean delivery, and antibiotic use, and an increased risk for inflammatory bowel disease and/or celiac disease. These links are consistent with the concept of perinatal programming of intestinal inflammatory disorders. Animal models have shown that the early-life environment affects the development of the gastrointestinal tract, but further experimental studies are needed to confirm the long-term effects of the perinatal environment on susceptibility to chronic intestinal disorders later in life. Changes in the development and composition of the intestinal microbiota as well as epigenetic changes are emerging as key mechanisms through which the perinatal environment determines susceptibility to intestinal inflammatory disorders.
30282900	Social and Emotional Fears and Worries Influencing the Quality of Life of Female Celiac Disease Patients Following a Gluten-Free Diet.	The gluten-free diet is effective in the majority of celiac disease (CD) patients, but it is burdensome and may influence quality of life (QoL). The aim of the study was to analyze the social and emotional fears and worries influencing the QoL of female CD patients following a gluten-free (GF) diet, as well as to indicate the sociodemographic interfering factors. The study was conducted on a group of 251 female CD patients, while emotional, social and worries subscales of the Celiac Disease Questionnaire (CDQ) were applied, as well as purchase-related emotions and behaviors were assessed. Respondents declaring worse economic status obtained significantly lower scores in the emotional, social and worries subscales of the CDQ than respondents declaring better economic status, while for other factors (CD duration, GFD adherence, BMI, place of residence and educational level) no significant association was stated in the multi-factor analysis. Moreover, respondents declaring worse economic status more often declared that a bad mood affected their purchase decisions than did respondents declaring better economic status. It was stated, that the economic status of CD patient could be one of the most important factors influencing their social and emotional fears and worries. It may be supposed that low economic status may lead some CD patients to choose to relieve stress by purchasing GF products instead of other products.
32532079	Association Between Celiac Disease and Cancer.	Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic enteropathy that develops in genetically susceptible individuals after the ingestion of gluten. There has been a substantial increase in CD prevalence in the last 50 years, and it is now estimated that this disease affects approximately 1% of the population in the Western world. In the large majority of cases, CD is a benign disease, characterized by the complete resolution of symptoms and a normal life expectancy after the onset of a gluten-free diet (GFD). However, failure to adhere to a strict GFD bears the risk of adverse events and increases mortality. A considerable number of studies have considered the possible association between CD and neoplasms. In particular, an increased risk of malignancies, such as cancers of the gastrointestinal tract and intestinal lymphomas, has been reported. In this review, we summarize and discuss the current evidence on the possible association between CD and cancer.
32061547	Factors associated with non adherence to a gluten free diet in adult with celiac disease: A survey assessed by BIAGI score.	INTRODUCTION: The cornerstone of the recommended treatment for Celiac disease (CeD) is a lifelong strict gluten-free diet (GFD). We aimed to identify prospectively the demographic, clinical, social and psychological profile associated with non-adherence to a GFD in adult CeD patients in Israel. METHODS: An anonymous online questionnaire was sent via the Israeli Celiac association and through social networks. Only CeD patients>=18 years old were included. Socio-demographic, laboratory and clinical data as well as anxiety and depression scores were reported. Adherence to a GFD was assessed by a Biagi questionnaire. RESULTS: In total, 301 patients completed the questionnaire with a mean age of 37.5+-14.9 years, 79.2% female. The most common presenting symptoms were: anemia (59.7%), abdominal pain (50.8%) and diarrhea (42.8%). According to the Biagi score, 82% of patients were found to be high adherent to a GFD (Biagi 3-4) and 18% were low adherent to a GFD (Biagi-0-2). Univariate analysis revealed that low adherence was associated with: younger age at the time of diagnosis (P<0.001), longer duration of disease (P=0.011) non academic education (P=0.011), below average income (P=0.018), smoking (P<0.001) and no gastroenterology follow up (P=0.038). However, in multivariate analysis, only a young age at diagnosis and smoking were significantly associated with non-adherence to a GFD (OR 0.924, 3.48, P-value<0.001, 0.029, respectively). In further analysis, we identified that age 20 is the best cutoff value to discriminate between those with high adherence and those with low adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Young age, smoking, long disease duration, no academic education, low income and no gastroenterology follow-up were found to be associated with low adherence to GFD rate in a univariate analysis, however only the first two were found to be significant in the multivariate analysis. Additional intervention strategies might improve adherence and reduce future complications with a better quality of life.
32304557	Routine Screening for Celiac Disease in Children With Down Syndrome Improves Case Finding.	OBJECTIVES: Children with Down syndrome have an estimated 6-fold increased risk of developing celiac disease in the United States compared with the general population, yet the determination to screen for celiac disease in this population is not agreed upon. The objectives of this study are to assess the prevalence of celiac disease in children with Down syndrome in our center and compare features from this population identified clinically and through screening. METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review of 1317 children with Down syndrome who received treatment at a single institution from 2011 to 2017. All participants (n = 90; 53.3% boys) met inclusion criteria of celiac disease diagnosis between 1 month and 22 years of age and Down syndrome. Clinical details were collected, which included the results from celiac disease screening tests, reason for diagnosis and/or testing, symptoms, nutrition notes, demographics, comorbidities, and outcomes. RESULTS: Prevalence of celiac disease in our population of children with Down syndrome ages 3 years or older was 9.8%. Mean age at diagnosis was 9.24 years (SD = 4.98) with an average of 2.85 years (SD +- 3.52) lag from the onset of symptoms to diagnosis for children clinically identified in comparison with 1.69 years (SD +- 2.09) for children identified through routine screening. Eighty-two percentage of clinic patients received a diagnosis of celiac disease because of routine screening compared with clinical testing based on identified symptoms alone. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest the need for routine celiac disease screening in children with Down syndrome to improve case-finding and avoid diagnostic delay.
24643797	Evidence for a role of autoantibodies to heat shock protein 60, 70, and 90 in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis.	Heat shock proteins (Hsp) are highly conserved immunomodulatory molecules upregulated when cells are exposed to stressful stimuli, such as inflammation. Their involvement in various autoimmune diseases, including autoimmune bullous diseases and celiac disease, has been increasingly recognized. To further study the role of Hsp in autoimmune bullous diseases, we have investigated for the first time the humoral autoimmune response to Hsp40, Hsp60, Hsp70, and Hsp90 in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH; n = 26), bullous pemphigoid (BP; n = 23), and pemphigus vulgaris (PV; n = 16), the first representing a cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease. While in patients with active BP and PV, serum levels of autoantibodies against these Hsp did not differ from the corresponding age- and gender-matched healthy controls (n = 9-14); circulating autoantibodies against Hsp60, Hsp70, and Hsp90 were found to be increased at the active disease stage of DH. Further analysis of this latter patient subgroup showed that these anti-Hsp autoantibodies decreased in parallel with serum autoantibodies against epidermal and tissue transglutaminase during remission of skin lesions following a gluten-free diet, revealing significantly positive correlations. Although further studies on larger groups of patients will be needed to confirm the present data, our results support the notion that autoantibodies against Hsp60, Hsp70, and Hsp90 deserve attention in the study of the mechanisms that promote the development and maintenance of DH and possibly also the underlying celiac disease as well as potential novel disease biomarkers.
29915405	Wheat Intolerance and Chronic Gastrointestinal Symptoms in an Australian Population-based Study: Association Between Wheat Sensitivity, Celiac Disease and Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders.	OBJECTIVES: Wheat avoidance in the absence of celiac disease (CD) is common but occurrence of concurrent functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) in this group is uncertain. The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of self-reported wheat or gluten sensitivity and doctor diagnosed CD in an Australian population, define the associated gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and FGIDs, and determine the relationship between self-reported wheat sensitivity, demographic and medical factors. METHODS: A total of 3542 people randomly selected from the Australian population returned a mail survey which contained questions on wheat avoidance, GI symptoms, demographic, medical, and lifestyle factors. We defined self-reported wheat sensitivity as people who reported gastrointestinal symptoms on ingestion of wheat based foods, but did not suffer from celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease or colorectal cancer. Functional dyspepsia (FD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) were diagnosed by Rome III criteria. CD status was self-reported. RESULTS: The prevalence of self-reported wheat sensitivity in this cohort was 14.9% (95% CI 13.7-16.2). The prevalence of CD was 1.2% (95%CI 0.8-1.6). Doctor diagnosed CD was significantly associated with a diagnosis of FD (OR 3.35, 95%CI 1.72-6.52) and IBS (OR 2.28, 95%CI 1.08-4.81). Those with self-reported wheat sensitivity were more likely to report multiple abdominal symptoms (of the 18 assessed) than those without (3.9 symptoms with self-reported wheat sensitivity vs. 1.6 without, p = 0.0001). In a multivariate analysis, self-reported wheat sensitivity was independently associated with IBS (OR 3.55, 95%CI 2.71-4.65) and FD (1.48, 95%CI 1.13-1.94). CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported wheat sensitivity is common, with a prevalence of 14.9% in this cohort. There is a strong association between both celiac disease and self-reported wheat sensitivity, and chronic gastrointestinal symptoms, as well as a diagnosis of FD and IBS.
25457448	Role of the gluten-free diet on neurological-EEG findings and sleep disordered breathing in children with celiac disease.	PURPOSE: To determine whether celiac children are at risk for EEG-neurological features and sleep disordered breathing (SDB), and whether an appropriate gluten-free diet (GFD) influences these disorders. METHODS: We consecutively enrolled 19 children with a new biopsy-proven celiac disease (CD) diagnosis. At CD diagnosis and after 6 months of GFD, each patient underwent a general and neurological examination, an electroencephalogram, a questionnaire about neurological features, and a validated questionnaire about SDB: OSA (obstructive sleep apnea) scores<0 predict normality; values>0 predict OSA. RESULTS: At CD diagnosis, 37% of patients complained headache that affected daily activities and 32% showed positive OSA score. The EEG examinations revealed abnormal finding in 48% of children. After 6 months of GFD headache disappeared in 72% of children and EEG abnormalities in 78%; all children showed negative OSA score. CONCLUSION: According to our preliminary data, in the presence of unexplained EEG abnormalities and/or other neurological disorders/SDB an atypical or silent CD should also be taken into account.
27216895	Immunogenetic Pathogenesis of Celiac Disease and Non-celiac Gluten Sensitivity.	Celiac disease is the most common oral intolerance in Western countries. It results from an immune response towards gluten proteins from certain cereals in genetically predisposed individuals (HLA-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8). Its pathogenesis involves the adaptive (HLA molecules, transglutaminase 2, dendritic cells, and CD4(+) T-cells) and the innate immunity with an IL-15-mediated response elicited in the intraepithelial compartment. At present, the only treatment is a permanent strict gluten-free diet (GFD). Multidisciplinary studies have provided a deeper insight of the genetic and immunological factors and their interaction with the microbiota in the pathogenesis of the disease. Similarly, a better understanding of the composition of the toxic gluten peptides has improved the ways to detect them in food and drinks and how to monitor GFD compliance via non-invasive approaches. This review, therefore, addresses the major findings obtained in the last few years including the re-discovery of non-celiac gluten sensitivity.

35276940	Lactose Malabsorption and Presumed Related Disorders: A Review of Current Evidence.	BACKGROUND: Lactose malabsorption (LM) is a frequent clinical problem associated with several digestive and extra-digestive diseases. The aim of this manuscript was to clarify the real clinical impact of LM on these disorders. METHODS: A literature search for digestive and extra-digestive disorders related to LM was carried out using PubMed, Medline and Cochrane. RESULTS: A transient lactase deficiency is present in celiac disease (CD) on a normal diet. The persistence of symptoms in CD on a gluten-free diet may be instead, in part, attributed to a primary LM. Similar circumstances are present in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), in which LM can be responsible for a part of persistent symptoms in IBD on clinical remission. LM and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are instead independent conditions. On the other hand, a lactose-restricted diet may be useful for some IBS patients. A reduced lactose intake can lead to low bone mass and limited risk of fragility fractures. Finally, the absorption of levothyroxine could be conditioned by LM. CONCLUSIONS: LM can be responsible for persistent symptoms in CD and IBD. The association with IBS seems to be casual. Bone mass and levothyroxine absorption can be affected by LM.
25838102	Fatal anaphylaxis to wheat after gluten-free diet in an adolescent with celiac disease.	
20816591	The prevalence of celiac disease in patients fulfilling Rome III criteria for irritable bowel syndrome.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Celiac disease shares several symptoms which constitute some of the ROME criteria used for the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and as such many patients with underlying Celiac disease may be mistakenly diagnosed as having IBS. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of Celiac disease in patients with IBS fulfilling ROME III criteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who fulfilled ROME III criteria for irritable bowel syndrome were screened for Celiac disease using the Biocard(TM) Celiac Disease Stick test, and patients who tested positive had their serum samples analyzed for antigliadin IgA and IgG, and anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA antibodies. Patients with detectable antibody levels underwent endoscopic duodenal biopsy to confirm a diagnosis of Celiac disease. RESULTS: Two of 100 patients who were diagnosed as having irritable bowel syndrome as per the Roma III criteria were found to have elevated levels of serum antigliadin IgA and IgG, and anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA antibodies, with histological evidence of Celiac disease on examination of duodenal biopsy. Both patients were started on a gluten-free diet, showing significant improvement in their symptoms on follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Celiac disease is a common finding among patients labeled as IBS. Celiac disease must be considered in differential diagnosis of IBS especially in the therapy refractory group.
26186878	Celiac disease in children.	Celiac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy, triggered by ingestion of gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. Since the use of anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysium antibodies in the early 1990s, two main groups of clinical presentation can be identified: patients with a symptomatic form of the disease, and patients with a pauci (a)-symptomatic form detected during the work-up of another autoimmune disease or due to a family history of celiac disease. The prevalence of both forms of the disease is currently estimated between 1/100 and 1/400. Classical form of the disease is characterized by occurrence of diarrhoea, failure to thrive, and abdominal bloating in young infants in the months following gluten introduction. Serological tests show high level of anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysium antibodies. Until recently, the diagnosis required duodenal biopsies that show villous atrophy. HLA genotype can help for diagnosis: the absence of the HLA-DQ2 or DQ8 alleles has a high negative predictive value. European guidelines recently proposed to reconsider the need for systematic endoscopy in typical symptomatic forms with high level of anti-transglutaminase and positive anti-endomysium. These recommendations are being assessed now. Currently, the gluten-free diet remains the only effective treatment for celiac disease. Children with celiac disease have to exclude from their diet all products containing wheat, barley and rye. Gluten-free diet causes clinical remission within a few weeks, but normalization of the small bowel mucosa and negativity of anti-transglutaminase antibodies are obtained in several months or even years. Gluten-free diet is useful to obtain clinical assessment, but also to prevent long-term complications of celiac disease, mainly osteoporosis, other autoimmune diseases, decreased fertility and cancers.
21623292	Celiac disease and the athlete.	With the diagnosis of celiac disease rising in the past decade and with increased public awareness, team physicians are faced with both managing and diagnosing athletes with celiac disease. Sports medicine physicians need to recognize that celiac disease can present with a number of different symptoms and, therefore, should consider celiac disease as part of their differential in evaluating athletes with prolonged unexplained illnesses. Sports medicine physicians must be familiar with the appropriate laboratory tests and diagnostic procedures used to establish the diagnosis of celiac disease. A multidisciplinary approach in helping the newly diagnosed athlete with celiac disease is important to the successful treatment of the disease. Athletes with celiac disease often have problems with iron absorption (leading to anemia) and/or vitamin D and calcium absorption (leading to osteoporosis and poor bone health). Even athletes with known and long-standing celiac disease need additional care and supervision in ensuring there is no disruption in their gluten-free diet, which can lead to a flare-up of symptoms or a decrease in performance.
29691797	Designing a Score-Based Method for the Evaluation of the Nutritional Quality of the Gluten-Free Bakery Products and their Gluten-Containing Counterparts.	Gluten-free (GF) products are consumed both by individuals with celiac disease and by an increasing number of people with no specific medical needs. Although the technological quality of GF products has been recently improved, their nutritional quality is still scarcely addressed. Moreover, the few published studies report conflicting results, mostly because the information from product nutrition facts is the only considered factor. The aim of the present study was to develop a score-based method for the nutritional evaluation of 134 packaged Italian GF bakery products and to compare it with that of 162 matched gluten-containing (GC) food items. The score included the information from the nutrition facts and the presence/absence of some nutritionally relevant components in the ingredients list. Results indicated an overall low nutritional quality of the considered GF bakery products. Additionally, with the sole exception of GF bread substitutes, there was no difference in nutritional quality between GF and equivalent GC bakery products. Future research and development of GF bakery products may take advantage of this scoring method, as it may represent an easy approach to evaluate their nutritional quality. The present findings do not justify the consumption of packaged GF bakery products by people without any specific medical needs.
28168522	No association between gluten sensitivity and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.	To examine evidence for a role of gluten sensitivity (GS) or celiac disease (CD) in ALS etiology, we included participants from a population-based case-control study in The Netherlands between January 2006 and December 2015. We compared levels and seroprevalence of IgA antibodies to tissue transglutaminase 6 (TG6) in 359 ALS patients and 359 controls, and to transglutaminase 2 (TG2) and endomysium (EMA) in 199 ALS patients and 199 controls. Questionnaire data on 1829 ALS patients and 3920 controls were examined for CD or gluten-free diets (GFD). Genetic correlation and HLA allele frequencies were analyzed using two genome-wide association studies: one on ALS (12,577 cases, 23,475 controls), and one on CD (4533 cases, 10,750 controls). We found one patient with TG6, TG2 and EMA antibodies who had typical ALS and no symptoms of GS. TG6 antibody concentrations and positivity, CD prevalence and adherence to a GFD were similar in patients and controls (p > 0.66) and in these patients disease progression was compatible with typical ALS. CD and ALS were not found to be genetically correlated (p > 0.37). CD-associated HLA allele frequencies were similar in patients and controls (p > 0.28). In conclusion, we found no serological evidence for involvement of gluten-related antibodies in ALS etiology nor did we observe an association between CD and ALS in medical history or genetic data, indicating that there is no evidence in our data for an association between the two diseases. Hence, a role for a GFD in the ALS treatment seems unlikely.

21695960	[Asymptomatic celiac disease in patient with chronic acalculous cholecystitis].	We described a patient 40 years old, admitted to the clinic with periodic attacks of pain in the right upper quadrant. With ultrasound it was confirmed chronic acalculous cholecystitis, and at endoscopy and multiple biopsies revealed atrophy of the mucosa of the duodenum (DM), corresponding to celiac disease (stage III in the Marsh classification). Titer of antibodies to gliadin (AGA) and tissue transglutaminase (AtTG) were higher: 60 and 110 units/ml, respectively, at a rate of 10 units/ml. The patient was assigned a lifetime adherence to a gluten-free diet, serologic test and a control endoscopy with biopsy at 6 months. The important role of the doctor-endoscopist in the diagnosis of latent forms of celiac disease. The significance of DM atrophy in the pathogenesis of patients with chronic cholecystitis.
36297063	Celiac Disease and Gallbladder: Pathophysiological Aspects and Clinical Issues.	Background: Celiac Disease (CD) is an immune-mediated disorder which primarily affects the small intestine; however, extra-intestinal organs are often affected by the pathological process, too. As regards the digestive system, liver alterations in CD patients have been widely described, which can also extend to the biliary tract. Notably, gallbladder function can be altered in CD patients. In this review, we specifically analyze and summarize the main pathophysiological aspects and clinical evidence of gallbladder dysfunction in CD patients, in order to discuss the potential medical complications and clinical research gaps. In addition to some perturbations of bile composition, CD patients can develop gallbladder dysmotility, which mainly expresses with an impaired emptying during the digestive phase. The main pathophysiological determinant is a perturbation of cholecystokinin secretion by the specific duodenal enteroendocrine cells in response to the appropriate nutrient stimulation in CD patients. This situation appears to be reversible with a gluten-free diet in most cases. Despite this gallbladder impairment, CD patients do not seem to be more predisposed to gallbladder complications, such as calculous and acalculous cholecystitis. However, very few clinical studies have actively investigated these clinical aspects, which may not be completely evidenced so far; alternatively, the substantial improvements in the last two decades regarding CD diagnosis, which have reduced the diagnostic delay (and related dietary treatment), may have lessened the potential clinical consequences of CD-related gallbladder dysfunction. Specific clinical studies focused on these aspects are needed for a better understanding of the clinical implications of gallbladder alterations in CD patients.
34764035	Prevalence of medically unsupervised activated charcoal use a cause for concern in celiac disease?	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes an intolerance to gluten. Owing to hidden sources, lack of clear labeling, and cross-contamination, it is not uncommon for individuals with celiac disease to inadvertently ingest gluten. A strict gluten-free diet is the only treatment. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to identify the frequency of activated charcoal use in celiac disease as a purported remedy despite the lack of literature on the safety and efficacy of the practice and to elucidate the manner in which using activated charcoal as a treatment for acute gluten ingestion is being communicated. METHODS: Using a descriptive study design, a Web-based survey was sent to members of the celiac disease community via social media pages for voluntary participants 18 years and older diagnosed with celiac disease. Participants were stratified into 3 major groups: (1) those who had heard of using activated charcoal as a remedy to counteract gluten ingestion and used it, (2) those who had heard of using activated charcoal but had not used it, and (3) those who had not heard of using activated charcoal. RESULTS: In subjects with celiac disease, 424 of 1613 respondents (26%) had heard of using activated charcoal as a potential remedy for gluten ingestion, and 12% had used it. The top source of information regarding any general information including remedies for maladies related to celiac disease was social media networks 72.3% (879/1613). Of those who had used activated charcoal, 122 participants (61.3%) reported subjectively feeling a reduced severity of symptoms. CONCLUSION: Pharmacists should be aware of the off-label use of activated charcoal for accidental gluten ingestion in celiac disease. Pharmacists should educate patients with celiac disease that there is not sufficient evidence to support the use of activated charcoal.
29157049	Small for gestational age as an independent risk factor for long-term pediatric gastrointestinal morbidity of the offspring.	OBJECTIVE: The concept of neonatal programming has begun to emerge as an important component of adult health. Scarce data exist regarding perinatal risk factors for long-term gastrointestinal (GI) morbidity of the offspring. We aimed to evaluate the association between birthweight (BW) at term and long-term pediatric GI morbidity. STUDY DESIGN: A population-based cohort analysis was performed, comparing the risk of long-term GI morbidity (up to the age of 18 years) in children delivered at term according to their BW. The study included all term deliveries occurring between 1991 and 2014 at a single regional tertiary medical center. Multiple gestations and fetuses with congenital malformations were excluded. BW was subdivided into: small for gestational age (small for gestational age (SGA) - BW <= 5th centile), appropriate for gestational age (AGA -5th centile < BW < 95th centile), and large for gestational age (LGA - BW >=95th centile). Hospitalizations up to the age of 18 years involving GI morbidity were evaluated, using a predefined set of ICD-9 codes, as recorded in the hospital files. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was used to compare cumulative GI morbidity incidence. A Cox proportional hazards model was constructed to control for confounders. RESULTS: During the study period, 225,600 term singleton deliveries met the inclusion criteria. Of them, 4.6% (n = 10,415) were SGA and 4.3% (n = 9796) were LGA. During the 18-years follow-up period, 11,791 (5.2%) children were hospitalized with GI morbidity. Hospitalizations were significantly more common in the SGA group, as compared with the AGA and LGA groups (6.6 versus 5.2 versus 4.5%, respectively, p < .001) Specifically, inflammatory bowel disease, celiac, hernia, hepatitis, and cholecystitis, were more common in the SGA group. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve demonstrated a significantly higher cumulative incidence of gastrointestinal morbidity in the SGA group (log rank p < .001). In the Cox proportional hazards model, controlled for relevant clinical confounders, SGA BW was found to be an independent risk factor for long-term GI morbidity (adjusted HR = 1.23, 95%CI 1.14-1.33, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: SGA offspring are at an increased and independent risk for long-term pediatric GI morbidity.
38578113	Microbiological quality of gluten-free meals, naturally gluten free foods, and gluten free-labelled products.	Background: The rising prevalence of gluten-related disorders such as celiac disease explains the increased consumption of gluten-free foods (GFF). However, these foods must be safe in terms of both gluten content and contamination by pathogenic microorganisms in order to avoid food poisoning. Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the microbiological quality of gluten-free meals, naturally gluten free foods, and gluten free-labelled products. Material and Methods: We collected 62 GFF samples including 20 meals (M-GF), 22 naturally gluten free (N-GFF) and 20 labelled (L-GFF) products, which were investigated for microbiological contamination according to Moroccan regulations guidelines, issued by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The analysis consisted of the detection of Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes in each sample, and the quantification of the microbial load of the following six micro-organisms: total aerobic mesophilic flora, total coliforms, fecal coliforms, Staphylococcus aureus, Sulphite-Reducing Anaerobic, and yeasts and molds. Results: A total of 372 analyses were carried out, showing a microbiological contamination rate of 5.1%. This contamination concerned N-GFF in 8.3% (predominantly with yeasts and molds), and meals prepared at home in 11.7 (predominantly with Staphylococcus aureus and coliforms). Only one case (0.8%) of contamination was observed in products labelled gluten-free and no contamination was noticed in meals prepared in food services. Listeria monocytgenes and Salmonella were not detected in any samples of food analyzed. These results indicate a good compliance of L-GFP and M-GF prepared in food services, while unsatisfactory quality was observed in N-GFF and M-GF prepared at home. Conclusion: Therefore, rigorous hygienic practices and adequate corrective measures should be considered by celiac patients, especially regarding the N-GFF and M-GF prepared at home.
26343710	The Role of Gluten in Celiac Disease and Type 1 Diabetes.	Celiac disease (CD) and type 1 diabetes (T1D) are autoimmune conditions in which dietary gluten has been proven or suggested to play a pathogenic role. In CD; gluten is established as the instigator of autoimmunity; the autoimmune process is halted by removing gluten from the diet; which allows for resolution of celiac autoimmune enteropathy and subsequent normalization of serological markers of the disease. However; an analogous causative agent has not yet been identified for T1D. Nevertheless; the role of dietary gluten in development of T1D and the potentially beneficial effect of removing gluten from the diet of patients with T1D are still debated. In this review; we discuss the comorbid occurrence of CD and T1D and explore current evidences for the specific role of gluten in both conditions; specifically focusing on current evidence on the effect of gluten on the immune system and the gut microbiota. 
27196596	Transition from childhood to adulthood in coeliac disease: the Prague consensus report.	The process of transition from childhood to adulthood is characterised by physical, mental and psychosocial development. Data on the transition and transfer of care in adolescents/young adults with coeliac disease (CD) are scarce. In this paper, 17 physicians from 10 countries (Sweden, Italy, the USA, Germany, Norway, the Netherlands, Australia, Britain, Israel and Denmark) and two representatives from patient organisations (Association of European Coeliac Societies and the US Celiac Disease Foundation) examined the literature on transition from childhood to adulthood in CD. Medline (Ovid) and EMBASE were searched between 1900 and September 2015. Evidence in retrieved reports was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation method. The current consensus report aims to help healthcare personnel manage CD in the adolescent and young adult and provide optimal care and transition into adult healthcare for patients with this disease. In adolescence, patients with CD should gradually assume exclusive responsibility for their care, although parental support is still important. Dietary adherence and consequences of non-adherence should be discussed during transition. In most adolescents and young adults, routine small intestinal biopsy is not needed to reconfirm a childhood diagnosis of CD based on European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) or North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) criteria, but a biopsy may be considered where paediatric diagnostic criteria have not been fulfilled, such as, in a patient without biopsy at diagnosis, additional serology (endomysium antibody) has not been performed to confirm 10-fold positivity of tissue transglutaminase antibodies or when a no biopsy strategy has been adopted in an asymptomatic child.
28552877	Gluten-Free Flours from Different Raw Materials as the Source of Vitamin B1, B2, B3 and B6.	Gluten-free (GF) products are those with a natural absence or acceptable level (<20 mg/kg) of gluten. They should be a part of a diet for people with gluten-related disorders, like celiac disease. Recently the popularity of a gluten-free diet (GFD) has risen extremely, because a lot of healthy individuals exclude gluten from their menus. According to the literature data on nutritional deficiencies in the GFD, this trend seems to be risky. This paper describes the nutritional value of 14 flours from different GF raw materials from the aspect of B-group vitamin content (B1, B2, B3, B6). Vitamins were determined using high performance liquid chromatography after enzymatic and acid hydrolysis of the samples. The vitamin contents significantly differed in the analysed flours. The content (in 100 g of the product) of vitamin B1 ranged from 0.01 mg (amaranth flour) to 0.60 mg (teff flour), vitamin B2 from 0.03 mg (GF flour with oats) to 0.22 mg (buckwheat flour), vitamin B3 from below 0.01 mg (amaranth flour) to 6.02 mg (millet flour), and vitamin B6 from 0.03 mg (acorn flour) to 0.69 mg (amaranth flour). The content of vitamins in the analysed GF flours was also compared to gluten-containing flours. Obtained results indicate that flours from teff, millet, chestnut, buckwheat, and amaranth are better sources of certain B-group vitamins than flours from corn, rice, and some flours with gluten.
31970917	Circulating Dendritic Cells from Celiac Disease Patients Display a Gut-Homing Profile and are Differentially Modulated by Different Gliadin-Derived Peptides.	SCOPE: Circulating dendritic cell (DC) and monocyte subsets contribute to the pool of intestinal DC and macrophages in celiac disease (CeD), an autoimmune gut disorder triggered by dietary gluten. Here, this study aims to characterize these circulating subsets in CeD and assess the effect of different gliadin-derived peptides on conventional DC (cDC). METHODS AND RESULTS: Flow cytometry profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells reveals a slight decrease in the proportion of plasmacytoid and type 1 cDC in gluten-free diet (GFD)-treated CeD patients. In comparison to healthy donors, DC and monocyte subsets from active and GFD-treated CeD patients display an increased gut-homing profile. Type 2 cDC (cDC2) are sorted and stimulated with the gliadin-derived peptides 8-mer, 19-mer, and 33-mer. All peptides induce cDC2 maturation, although the profile is different. While peptide 8-mer induces a Th1/Th17 pro-inflammatory cytokine profile in active CeD patients, cDC2 primed with peptide 33-mer displays a higher capacity to promote gut-homing CCR9+ expression onto autologous T-cells. CONCLUSION: Distinct gliadin-derived peptides elicit different effects on cDC2 phenotype and function. This effect is compatible with a model where diverse gliadin peptides may cooperate to promote full cDC2 activation and the subsequent T-cell response in genetically predisposed individuals.
26047356	Loss and Gain of Tolerance to Pancreatic Glycoprotein 2 in Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND: Autoantibodies against pancreatic secretory-granule membrane glycoprotein 2 (GP2) have been demonstrated in patients with Crohn's disease but recently also with celiac disease (CD). Both entities are characterized by intestinal barrier impairment with increased gut permeability. Pathophysiological hallmark of CD is a permanent loss of tolerance to alimentary gliadin and a transient loss of tolerance to the autoantigen human tissue transglutaminase (tTG). Therefore, we explored the behavior of loss of tolerance to GP2 reported in CD. METHODS: We assessed prevalences and levels of autoantibodies against GP2, CD-specific antibodies to endomysial antigens and tTG as well as Crohn's disease-specific anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies in sera of 174 patients with active CD, 84 patients under gluten-free diet (GFD) and 129 controls. Furthermore, we looked for an association between anti-GP2 antibody positivity and degree of mucosal damage in CD. RESULTS: We found significantly elevated anti-GP2 IgA positivity in active CD patients (19.5%) compared to CD patients under GFD (0.0%) and controls (5.4%, p < 0.001, respectively). Anti-GP2 IgA levels correlated significantly with CD-specific antibodies (p < 0.001). Anti-GP2 autoantibody positivity disappeared under GFD similarly to CD-specific autoantibodies against tTG and endomysial antigens. For the first time, IgA antibody levels to GP2 are demonstrated to be associated with degree of villous atrophy according to Marsh classification. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-GP2 IgA seems to be associated with disease activity in a distinct subgroup of patients with CD. The observed loss of tolerance to GP2 in a subset of patients with CD is transient and disappears under GFD.
22198767	A single conformational transglutaminase 2 epitope contributed by three domains is critical for celiac antibody binding and effects.	The multifunctional, protein cross-linking transglutaminase 2 (TG2) is the main autoantigen in celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder with defined etiology. Glutamine-rich gliadin peptides from ingested cereals, after their deamidation by TG2, induce T-lymphocyte activation accompanied by autoantibody production against TG2 in 1-2% of the population. The pathogenic role and exact binding properties of these antibodies to TG2 are still unclear. Here we show that antibodies from different celiac patients target the same conformational TG2 epitope formed by spatially close amino acids of adjacent domains. Glu153 and 154 on the first alpha-helix of the core domain and Arg19 on first alpha-helix of the N-terminal domain determine the celiac epitope that is accessible both in the closed and open conformation of TG2 and dependent on the relative position of these helices. Met659 on the C-terminal domain also can cooperate in antibody binding. This composite epitope is disease-specific, recognized by antibodies derived from celiac tissues and associated with biological effects when passively transferred from celiac mothers into their newborns. These findings suggest that celiac antibodies are produced in a surface-specific way for which certain homology of the central glutamic acid residues of the TG2 epitope with deamidated gliadin peptides could be a structural basis. Monoclonal mouse antibodies with partially overlapping epitope specificity released celiac antibodies from patient tissues and antagonized their harmful effects in cell culture experiments. Such antibodies or similar specific competitors will be useful in further functional studies and in exploring whether interference with celiac antibody actions leads to therapeutic benefits.

29253321	Role of capsule endoscopy in alarm features and non-responsive celiac disease: A European multicenter study.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: The role of capsule endoscopy (CE) in established celiac disease (CD) remains unclear. Our objective was to analyze the usefulness of CE in the suspicion of complicated CD. METHODS: This was a retrospective multicenter study. One hundred and eighty-nine celiac patients (mean age: 46.6 +- 16.6, 30.2% males) who underwent CE for alarm symptoms (n = 86, 45.5%) or non-responsive CD (n = 103, 54.5%) were included. Diagnostic yield (DY), therapeutic impact and safety were analyzed. RESULTS: Capsule endoscopy was completed in 95.2% of patients (small bowel transit time: 270.5 +- 100.2 min). Global DY was 67.2%, detecting atrophic mucosa (n = 92, 48.7%), ulcerative jejunoileitis (n = 21, 11.1%), intestinal lymphoma (n = 7, 3.7%) and other enteropathies (n = 7, 3.7%, six Crohn's disease cases and one neuroendocrine tumor). The DY of CE was significantly higher in patients presenting with non-responsive disease compared to patients with alarm symptoms (73.8% vs 59.3%, P = 0.035). The new findings of the CE modified management in 59.3% of the cases. There were no major complications. CONCLUSION: Capsule endoscopy may be a moderately helpful and safe diagnostic tool in the suspicion of complicated CD, modifying the clinical course of these patients.

34895120	Advanced Protein Drugs and Formulations.	Previously, the application of proteins was uncommon as therapeutically active molecules. Some of the first applications of proteins as drugs have been insulin and vaccines for overcoming a physiological deficiency and the prevention of diseases, respectively. Nowadays, proteins have many applications, not only as drugs but also as drug delivery systems to be administered by different routes. Due to their nature, the behavior of proteins varies while the conditions of the environment are modified. For this reason, it is necessary to study their behavior for predicting the correct manufacturing, storing, or combination with other possible molecules in a formulation or into the body. The application of techniques for predicting the behavior of proteins in different environments has led to associating this type of behavior into the body with the occurrence of diseases, such as celiac disease or Alzheimer's disease. Thus, this work shows an overview of the main types of proteins applied as active therapeutically molecules, proteins-based drug delivery systems, and techniques for predicting their stability into the primary storing container and the body.
22832512	Should intussusception in children prompt screening for celiac disease?	OBJECTIVES: An association between adult celiac disease (CD) and intussusceptions (ISs) has been described. Although more common among children, intussusception has not been linked with childhood CD aside from isolated case reports. Our aim was to investigate the frequency of IS among children with CD. METHODS: A patient database containing children with biopsy-proven CD was reviewed, in addition to radiology records contained in a hospital-maintained clinical data repository. RESULTS: Of 254 children with biopsy-proven CD and complete records available for review, abdominal imaging was performed in 21%, mainly because of abdominal pain. Among children with CD, 1.2% experienced an IS <9 months before their diagnosis with CD. Among children seen at our institution in the same time period, 0.07% experienced an IS. The majority of those children with CD who were found to have IS had no evidence of nutritional deficit at the time of IS. IS was not identified in any children with CD who had been treated with a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: IS was far more common among children in our cohort with untreated CD than in the general pediatric population simultaneously seen at our center. The diagnosis of CD should be considered in children with IS, even in the absence of signs of nutritional compromise.
23754511	Prevalence of serum celiac antibody in patients with IBD in Japan.	BACKGROUND: Although the incidence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in Japan has increased, the prevalence of celiac disease is considered very low with the lowest genetic disposition. IBD is reported as the most common comorbidity because of the high positive rate of serological celiac markers. The aim of this study was to examine the current incidence of celiac disease, especially in IBD patients in Japan, where both wheat consumption and incidence of IBD have increased. METHODS: A total of 172 patients with IBD and 190 controls in Japan were screened for serum antibody of tissue transglutaminase and deaminated gliadin peptide. In sero-positive patients, HLA testing and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with duodenal biopsy was performed. Some of the sero-positive patients started a gluten-restricted or unrestricted diet, and serological change was determined. RESULTS: The positivity of both serum antibodies was significantly higher in IBD and correlated with disease activity. However, no biopsy-defined or HLA-defined true celiac disease was found. A decrease in serum antibody titers was observed with a gluten-restricted diet. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the increased incidence of IBD and high positivity for serum celiac antibody in Japanese IBD patients, no true-positive celiac disease was noted, suggesting the presence of gluten intolerance in these populations.
24124879	Gluten contamination of naturally gluten-free flours and starches used by Canadians with celiac disease.	A large national investigation into the extent of gluten cross-contamination of naturally gluten-free ingredients (flours and starches) sold in Canada was performed. Samples (n = 640) were purchased from eight Canadian cities and via the internet during the period 2010-2012 and analysed for gluten contamination. The results showed that 61 of the 640 (9.5%) samples were contaminated above the Codex-recommended maximum level for gluten-free products (20 mg kg-1) with a range of 5-7995 mg kg-1. For the ingredients that were labelled gluten-free the contamination range (5-141 mg kg-1) and number of samples were lower (3 of 268). This picture was consistent over time, with approximately the same percentage of samples above 20 mg kg-1 in both the initial set and the subsequent lot. Looking at the total mean (composite) contamination for specific ingredients the largest and most consistent contaminations come from higher fibre ingredients such as soy (902 mg kg-1), millet (272 mg kg-1) and buckwheat (153 mg kg-1). Of the naturally gluten-free flours and starches tested that do not contain a gluten-free label, the higher fibre ingredients would constitute the greatest probability of being contaminated with gluten above 20 mg kg-1.

37806803	Factors associated to influenza vaccination among hospital's healthcare workers in the Autonomous Community of Madrid, Spain 2021-2022.	Influenza vaccination (IV) aims primarily to protect high-risk groups against severe influenza-associated disease and death. It is recommended in Spain for high-risk groups, including Healthcare workers (HCWs). However, vaccination uptake has been consistently below desirable levels. The objective of this study were to evaluate influenza vaccination coverage using data from the regional vaccination registry, during 2021-2022 season, among HCWs in public hospitals in Autonomous Community of Madrid (CAM) and to explore factors associated with influenza vaccination. We conducted a cross-sectional study using administrative data retrieved from the Regional Department of Health data repositories. A multilevel logistic regression model was designed to estimate Level 1 (individual) and Level 2 (contextual) variables that are associated with HCWs vaccination. The study population was HCWs from 25 public hospitals in CAM who were active during the period of the influenza 2021-2022 vaccination campaign. The global influenza vaccination coverage (IVC) was 52.1 %. All study Level 1 variables were significantly associated with vaccine uptake. Greater IVC is associated with individual characteristics: female (OR1.14; 95 %CI 1.09-1.19), older age 59-69 years old (OR1.72; 95 %CI 1.60-1.84), born in Spain, medical staff, more than one high-risk condition (OR1.24; 95 %CI 1.10-1.40; respectively) and vaccinated in two previous campaigns (OR25.64; 95 %CI 24.27-27.09). IVC was highest among HCWs celiac disease (65.5 %) followed by diabetes mellitus (65.1 %) and chronic inflammatory disease (64.3 %). The hospital where the study subject worked also showed an effect on the vaccination uptake, although Level 2 variable (hospital complexity) was not positively associated. IVC in HCWs remains suboptimal. These findings may prove useful to tailor strategies to reach specific groups. It is recommended to delve into the identification of factors associated with the HCWs workplace that may have a positive impact on IV.
31394930	Should we worry about the eyes of celiac patients?	PURPOSE: In this article, we evaluate subfoveal choroidal thickness in celiac patients with respect to adherence to the gluten-free diet and nonadherence to the gluten-free diet, comparing with age and sex matched healthy controls using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case-control study among 42 celiac patients and 42 healthy participants was conducted in the Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology. Celiac patients of our policlinics compliant with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography examination enrolled in the study. Celiac patients had been asked verbally about their adherence to gluten-free diet, were evaluated according to negative or positive EmA and anti-TG2 for defining adherence, and were divided into two groups (adherence to gluten-free diet and nonadherence to gluten-free diet). RESULTS: Subfoveal choroidal thickness was thinner in EmA (+) or anti-TG2 (+) eyes than EmA(-) or anti-TG2 (-) eyes in celiac patients, but it was not statistically significant. The mean subfoveal choroidal thickness values in eyes with celiac disease, whose diagnosis time was longer than 60 months, were thinner than shorter group. Longer duration of gluten-free diet was associated with adherence difficulty and thinner choroidal thickness (r = -0.15, p = 0.34). Adherence to gluten-free diet was 88.2% for children below the age of 60 months and 57.1% for children older than 60 months. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, in addition to other extraintestinal manifestations of celiac disease, diagnosis time longer than 60 months in pediatric celiac patients, nonadherence to the gluten-free diet, and antibody positivity should be focused on during ophthalmologic examination and choroid measurement.
24209578	Clinical impact of a gluten-free diet on health-related quality of life in seven fibromyalgia syndrome patients with associated celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder, characterized by the presence of gastrointestinal and multisystem symptoms, which occasionally mimic those of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS). To assess the effectiveness of a Gluten-Free Diet (GFD) in seven adult female screening-detected CD subjects, categorized as severe IBS and FMS patients. METHODS: All subjects showed villous atrophy in duodenal biopsies, were HLA-DQ2/DQ8-positive, and fulfilled the Rome III and ACR 1990 criteria respectively for IBS and FMS classification. GFD effectiveness was assessed at baseline and after 1 year, examining the score changes in the Tender Points (TPs) test, Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) for gastrointestinal complaints, pain and tiredness, drug prescriptions and tissue-Trans-Glutaminase (tTG) serum levels. RESULTS: At baseline, all patients had poor Quality of Life and VAS scores, a high number of TPs and drug prescriptions, and increased tTG levels. After 1 year of GFD, all outcome measures significantly improved, with a decrease of 51-60% in TPs, FIQ, HAQ, and VAS scales, and in the number of prescribed drugs, accompanied by an increase of 48-60% in SF-36 Physical and Mental Component Summary scores, and a decrease of tTG to normal values. CONCLUSION: Results of this pilot study show that the adherence to a GFD by CD-related IBS/FMS patients can simultaneously improve CD and IBS/FMS symptoms, and indicate the merit of further research on a larger cohort.
29795662	Identification of peculiar gene expression profile in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of celiac patients on gluten free diet.	Celiac disease (CD) is a systemic disorder characterized by an immune-mediated reaction to gluten and a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. Currently, the main treatment of CD is represented by adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) which determines the resolution of symptoms, and the normalization of the serology and of the duodenal villous atrophy. In the present study, we aimed to identify changes in gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of celiac patients on GFD for at least 2 years, in order to identify novel disease biomarkers and candidate targets for putative therapeutic approaches. Microarray analysis was performed on PBMCs from 17 celiac patients on long-term GFD and 20 healthy controls. We identified 517 annotated genes that were significantly modulated between celiac patients and controls. Significant biological pathways were functionally clustered using the Core Function of Ingenuity System Pathway Analysis (IPA). Intriguingly, despite being on a GFD, celiac patients exhibited a peculiar PBMC profile characterized by an aberrant expression of genes involved in the regulation of immunity, inflammatory response, metabolism, and cell proliferation. Random forest algorithm was then used to validate the prediction ability of core genes as classifiers of the "celiac status". In conclusion, our study identified a characteristic PBMCs signature profile in clinically asymptomatic celiac patient.
30525325	Consumption of different types of bakery products and its effect on visceral fat area in healthy population	Background: Bread is one of the world's most consumed food commodity. However, in the last years consumption of breadand bakery products has declined, especially in the Western population. The reason for concern is the weight gain and presence of gluten in these products. Gluten is unacceptable in the diet only in patients with celiac disease who are forced adhere the gluten-free diet all the time. The consequences of gluten-free diet in healthy people are the subject of many recent studies. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes of visceral fat area in the general population after 6 weeks of consumption of gluten-free, gluten-containing and whole-grain bread and other bakery products. Material and Methods: The study group consisted of 120 volunteers divided into four subgroups each with 30 subjects. Anthropometric measurements were made using the InBody 720 (Biospace Co. Ltd., Seoul, Republic of Korea). We used the Lookin'Body 3.0 software to process the results. The collected data from anthropometric measurements were evaluated statistically and graphically in Microsoft Office Excel 2010 (Los Angeles, CA, USA). Results: After the intervention we found out that visceral fat area values increased in probands consuming gluten-free and gluten-containing bakery products, but these changes were not significant (P>0.05; 72.7+-29.18 cm2 vs 73.26+-30.32 cm2 and 69.6+-34.06 cm2 vs 70.34+-32.33 cm2, respectively). In whole-grain and control group we observed a reduction in visceral fat area, in the control group there was a significant change (P>0.05 - 91.58+-33 cm2 vs 90.47+-34.37 cm2 and P<0.05 - 77.3+-21.65 cm2 vs 75.56+-21.87 cm2, respectively). After the intervention the visceral fat area values increased in gluten-free group in 57% of subjects, in gluten group in 73% of subjects and in the whole-grain group in 43% of volunteers. Although visceral fat area values had inceased in gluten-free and gluten-containing groups, the number of probands with reference values increased from 80% to 86% in the gluten-free group and from 43% to 66% in the gluten-containing group. In the whole-grain group we found decrease in number of subjects with reference values of visceral fat area (from 70% to 63%). There were no changes in the control group (86% vs. 86%). Conclusions: Consumption of different types of bakery products has mostly changed the visceral fat area values in a positive direction.
22732824	Targeted modification of wheat grain protein to reduce the content of celiac causing epitopes.	The prolamin peptides in wheat gluten and in the homologous storage proteins of barley and rye cause painful chronic erasure of microvilli of the small intestine epithelium in celiac patients. If untreated, it can lead to chronic diarrhea, abdominal distension, osteoporosis, weight-loss due to malabsorption of nutrients, and anemia. In addition to congenital cases, life-long exposure to gluten proteins in bread and pasta can also induce development of celiac sprue in adults. To date, the only effective treatment is life-long strict abstinence from the staple food grains. Complete exclusion of dietary gluten is, however, difficult due to use of wheat in many foods, incomplete labeling and social constraints. Thus, finding alternative therapies for this most common foodborne disease remained an active area of research, which has led to many suggestions in last few years. The pros and cons associated with these therapies were reviewed in the present communication. As different celiac patients are immunogenic to different members of the undigestible proline/glutamine rich peptides of ~149 gliadins and low molecular weight glutenin subunits as well as the six high molecular weight glutenin subunits, an exhaustive digestion of the immunogenic peptides in the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, and ileum of celiacs is required. In view of the above, we evaluated the capacity of cereal grains to synthesize and store the enzymes prolyl endopeptidase from Flavobacterium meningosepticum and the barley cysteine endoprotease B2, which in combination are capable of detoxifying immunogenic gluten peptides in a novel treatment of celiac disease.
32418545	Comparison of diet quality between celiac patients and non-celiac people in East Azerbaijan-Iran.	BACKGROUND: Considering the lifelong dietary restriction in celiac patients, it is important to assess the diet quality in these patients. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the diet quality in adult celiac patients and compare it with that of the non-celiac people. METHODS: In the present cross-sectional study, 130 celiac patients were selected from the celiac disease (CD) registry database of East Azerbaijan province, Iran. Non-celiac people (n = 464) was selected from the major lifestyle promotion project conducted in the East Azerbaijan district. The dietary intake data was obtained by an 80-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Diet quality was assessed using the healthy eating index-2015 (HEI-2015). RESULTS: The mean total HEI score was significantly higher in the celiac group compared with the non-celiac people (P < 0.001) and 68.5% of non-celiac people and 17.4% of celiac patients had poor diet quality. After adjusting for confounding factors, the mean score of total HEI in adherents to gluten-free diet (GFD) was significantly higher compared with non-adherents (P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Although the mean total HEI score was higher in celiac patients compared with the non-celiac people, about 17.5% of patients had poor diet quality and the scores of whole grains and dairy products group were very low in our population. Accordingly, it seems that educational programs should be held for the celiac patients and non-celiac people to increase their nutritional literacy and enable them to select healthy gluten-free alternatives.
28753188	The Relationship Between Child Mortality Rates and Prevalence of Celiac Disease.	OBJECTIVES: Some evidence suggests that prevalence of celiac disease in the general population is increasing over time. Because the prognosis of celiac disease was a dismal one before discovering the role of gluten, our aim was to investigate a possible relationship between children under-5 mortality rates and prevalence rates of celiac disease. METHODS: Thanks to a literature review, we found 27 studies performed in 17 different countries describing the prevalence of celiac disease in schoolchildren; between 1995 and 2011, 4 studies were performed in Italy. A meta-analysis of prevalence rates was performed. Prevalence was compared between specific country under-5 mortality groups, publication year, and age. RESULTS: In the last decades, under-5 mortality rates have been decreasing all over the world. This reduction is paralleled by an increase of the prevalence of celiac disease. The Spearman correlation coefficient was -63%, 95% confidence interval -82% to -33% (P < 0.001). So, the higher the mortality rate, the lower the prevalence of CD. This finding is confirmed by the meta-analysis of the 4 studies conducted in Italy over time. CONCLUSIONS: The under-5 mortality rate seems to influence the prevalence of celiac disease in the general population. In the near future, the number of patients with celiac disease will increase, thanks to the better environmental conditions that nowadays allow a better survival of children with celiac disease.
26974761	Intestinal, Systemic, and Oral Gluten-related Alterations in Patients With Nonceliac Gluten Sensitivity.	BACKGROUND: Nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is an emergent condition, the framework of which is yet unclear, whereas the diagnosis is suggested only by gluten-dependent symptoms after excluding wheat allergy and celiac disease (CD). Our goal was to highlight intestinal, systemic, and oral alterations to clarify the NCGS pathogenesis and identify new diagnostic tools. STUDY: A total of 60 NCGS patients, 20 untreated CD, 20 treated CD, and 20 healthy volunteers were recruited. The differential diagnosis among gluten-related disorders was performed by serological, allergy, and histologic tools. NCGS patients were also subjected to antigliadin antibody (AGA) detection and HLA typing. All participants underwent an oral mucosa patch test for gluten (GOMPT), whereas an oral provocation test (OPT) for gluten was performed in 26 NCGS patients. RESULTS: About 6/60 (10%) NCGS patients showed IgG AGA-positive results, whereas 45/60 (75%) patients carried HLA-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8 genes. GOMPT showed positive results in 45/60 (75%) NCGS patients, 3/20 (15%) untreated CD patients, 5/20 (25%) treated CD patients, and in no healthy volunteers. No significant difference was found between the severity of symptoms reported by NCGS patients subjected to OPT with gluten-containing croissants and those who underwent OPT with gluten-free croissants. CONCLUSIONS: GOMPT seems to be a specific tool for NCGS diagnosis, although further investigations are needed to overcome limits due to the small population studied and to contextualize GOMPT false-positive results.
22624684	Review: Management of postprandial diarrhea syndrome.	Unexpected, urgent, sometimes painful bowel movements after eating are common complaints among adults. Without a clear etiology, if pain is present and resolves with the movements, this is usually labeled "irritable bowel syndrome-diarrhea" based solely on symptoms. If this symptom-based approach is applied exclusively, it may lead physicians not to consider treatable conditions: celiac disease, or maldigestion due to bile acid malabsorption, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, or an a-glucosidase (sucrase, glucoamylase, maltase, or isomaltase) deficiency. These conditions can be misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome-diarrhea (or functional diarrhea, if pain is not present). Limited testing is currently available to confirm these conditions (antibody screens for celiac disease; fecal fat as a surrogate marker for pancreatic function). Therefore, empirical treatment with alpha amylase, pancreatic enzymes, or a bile acid-binding agent may simultaneously treat these patients and serve as a surrogate diagnostic test. This review will summarize the current evidence for bile acid malabsorption, and deficiencies of pancreatic enzymes or a-glucosidases as potential causes for postprandial diarrhea, and provide an algorithm for treatment options.
33513886	Prevalence of Wheat/Gluten-Related Disorders and Gluten-Free Diet in Paraguay: An Online Survey-Based Study.	Gluten-related disorders (GRDs) are increasing around the world, but their magnitude and relevance remain unknown in most Latin American countries. Thus, an online survey was conducted to estimate the prevalence of GRDs as well as adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) in Paraguayan adult population. There were 1058 individuals surveyed using a validated questionnaire (response rate of 93.9%). The self-reported prevalence rates were as follows (95% CI): gluten sensitivity (GS), 10.30% (8.53-12.29); non-celiac GS (NCGS), 5.19% (3.94-6.71); physician-diagnosed celiac disease (PD-CD), 3.11% (2.15-4.35); wheat allergy (WA), 2.07% (1.30-3.13); and adherence to GFD, 15.69% (13.55-18.02). Excluding CD, more women than men met the criteria for GRDs, adverse food reactions, and GFD (p < 0.05). Eight respondents reported the coexistence of NCGS with PD-CD and/or WA. Most cases on a GFD indicated medical/dietitian advice for following the diet (68.07%). Non-self-reported GS individuals indicated weight control (46.4%) and the notion that the GFD is healthier (20.2%) as the main motivations for following the diet. GRDs are not uncommon in Paraguayan adult population. It seems that there is awareness about GRDs and the GFD, but training about the diagnosis of GRDs is desirable because of the informed overlapping diagnoses of CD or WA with NCGS. Future studies involving face-to-face interviews are necessary.
29704914	Celiac disease and non-celiac gluten or wheat sensitivity and health in later life: A review.	Celiac disease (CD) and non-gluten (or wheat) sensitivity (NCGS) are two gluten-related disorders, the treatment of which relies on dietary withdrawal of gluten (absolute and lifelong in the case of CD patients). However, these conditions differ in their pathophysiology and impact on health. CD is an autoimmune disorder of the intestine, and is associated with a wide range of disorders, pre- and post-diagnosis. Its autoimmune and inflammatory nature raises concerns about its potential effects on mortality and morbidity. Here we review the data on the health impact CD or NCGS may have prospectively, and report on the role of a gluten-free diet (GFD) in this respect. Since study designs have been heterogeneous, we focus on studies of treated patients with a biopsy-proven diagnosis of CD, to eliminate possible bias from misdiagnosis. The review revealed a moderately increased mortality risk among CD patients, mainly attributed to cardiovascular disease and malignancy. Other long-term morbidities of CD include autoimmune disorders, nutritional deficiencies, impaired bone health, reproductive abnormalities, and neurologic and neuropsychiatric disorders, which are substantially improved, and some of them even completely treated, after strict adherence to a GFD. For NCGS, the literature is too limited and its long-term complications are unknown.
37721353	Efficacy of a gluten-free diet in reducing the widespread pain index and symptom severity scale in patients affected by fibromyalgia.	OBJECTIVE: Dietary interventions to improve fibromyalgia (FM) symptoms reported conflicting results. This study aimed to treat FM patients with a gluten-free diet (GFD), alternated with a non-restricted gluten-containing diet, followed by a rechallenge of the GFD. METHODS: Twenty postmenopausal women with FM and no history of celiac disease participated. A GFD was assigned for 6 months. This was followed by 3 months of a non-restricted gluten-containing diet and then a new GFD for another 6 months. At each visit, the widespread pain index (WPI) and the symptom severity scale (SS) scores were evaluated. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients enrolled was 53.9+-10 years. None of the patients had a diagnosis of irritable bowel disease, although they reported vague gastrointestinal symptoms. After 6 months of a GFD, a statistically significant reduction was observed for the WPI (10.3+-1.8 vs 7.7+-1.4; p<0.0001) and the SS scale (6.4+-1.8 vs 4.15+-1.6; p=0.0002). The D percentage reduction of the WPI after 6 months of GFD was -24%+-9%, while for the SS scale, it was -36%+-21%. The following reintroduction of a gluten-containing diet brought about a statistically significant rise in the absolute SS scale and WPI, as well as a D modification of the WPI (21%+-13%) and of the SS scale (74%+-90%). The rechallenge of the GFD showed a significant improvement in absolute and D WPI (-24%+-7%) and SS (-36%+-11%). No modifications to the body mass index were found. CONCLUSIONS: A GFD improved FM symptoms evaluated with WPI and SS. This was confirmed for the first time, also with a rechallenge of the GFD that followed a non-restricted gluten-containing diet.
33224137	Bacterial-Based Strategies to Hydrolyze Gluten Peptides and Protect Intestinal Mucosa.	Gluten is a mixture of proteins highly resistant to hydrolysis, resulting in the emergence of toxic peptides responsible for gluten-related disorders. Currently, a gluten-free diet (GFD) is the unique proven therapy for celiac disease (CD). Several research groups and pharmaceutical companies are developing new nondietetic therapeutic strategies for CD. Probiotics are viable microorganisms thought to have a healthy effect on the host. The proteolytic mechanism of lactic acid bacteria comprises an extracellular serine protease, di- and oligopeptide-specific transport systems, and several intracellular peptidases that might affect gluten degradation. Therefore, probiotic supplementation is an attractive therapy because of its possible anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Several studies have been performed to assess the effectiveness of various specific probiotic strains, showing positive effects on immune-modulation (inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha) restoring gut microbiota and decrease of immunogenic peptides. The present review aims to summarize the current knowledge on the ability of probiotic strain (single or mixtures) to digest gliadin peptides in vitro and to modulate the inflammatory response in the gut.

23348901	Collagenous colitis in children and adolescents: study of 7 cases and literature review.	The aim of this study is to examine the clinical and pathologic characteristics of collagenous colitis (CC) in children and adolescents. Seven patients (five females and two males, median age: 13 years, ranging from 4 to 16) were included. Four (of 7, 57%) patients presented with non-bloody watery diarrhea, one with alternating constipation and diarrhea with rectal prolapse, one with constipation, and one with normal bowel movement. Abdominal pain and weight loss were manifested in 80 and 40% patients, respectively. Two patients had celiac disease in remission. None of the patients took non-steroidal antiinflammatory agents. All patients had normal colonoscopy, but had typical histologic features of CC in colon biopsies. Four patients had clinical follow-up (24-75 months duration, median 54 months): three patients had no gastrointestinal symptoms upon follow-up, but one patient had continued symptoms of alternating diarrhea and constipation. Two patients had follow-up biopsies: one showed persistence of CC, and one had complete histologic resolution. We conclude that while CC is rare in children and adolescents, the clinical presentation is similar to adults, with a female preponderance, presentation with diarrhea and abdominal pain, and an association with celiac disease and other autoimmune disorders. However, compared with adults, children and adolescents are more likely to have weight loss and an atypical presentation including alternating constipation and diarrhea, constipation alone or normal bowel movements. Treatment is less standardized in children and adolescents with CC.
24728027	Fibromyalgia and non-celiac gluten sensitivity: a description with remission of fibromyalgia.	Fibromyalgia (FM) syndrome is a disabling clinical condition of unknown cause, and only symptomatic treatment with limited benefit is available. Gluten sensitivity that does not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for celiac disease (CD) is increasingly recognized as a frequent and treatable condition with a wide spectrum of manifestations that overlap with the manifestations of FM, including chronic musculoskeletal pain, asthenia, and irritable bowel syndrome. The aim of this report was to describe 20 selected patients with FM without CD who improved when placed on a gluten-free diet. An anti-transglutaminase assay, duodenal biopsy, and HLA typing were performed in all cases. CD was ruled out by negative anti-transglutaminase assay results and absence of villous atrophy in the duodenal biopsy. All patients had intraepithelial lymphocytosis without villous atrophy. Clinical response was defined as achieving at least one of the following scenarios: remission of FM pain criteria, return to work, return to normal life, or the discontinuation of opioids. The mean follow-up period was 16 months (range 5-31). This observation supports the hypothesis that non-celiac gluten sensitivity may be an underlying cause of FM syndrome.
22209002	Abnormal anandamide metabolism in celiac disease.	The endocannabinoid system has been extensively investigated in experimental colitis and inflammatory bowel disease, but not in celiac disease, where only a single study showed increased levels of the major endocannabinoid anandamide in the atrophic mucosa. On this basis, we aimed to investigate anandamide metabolism in celiac disease by analyzing transcript levels (through quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction), protein concentration (through immunoblotting) and activity (through radioassays) of enzymes responsible for anandamide synthesis (N-acylphosphatidyl-ethanolamine specific phospholipase D, NAPE-PLD) and degradation (fatty acid amide hydrolase, FAAH) in the duodenal mucosa of untreated celiac patients, celiac patients on a gluten-free diet for at least 12 months and control subjects. Also, treated celiac biopsies cultured ex vivo with peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin were investigated. Our in vivo experiments showed that mucosal NAPE-PLD expression and activity are higher in untreated celiac patients than treated celiac patients and controls, with no significant difference between the latter two groups. In keeping with the in vivo data, the ex vivo activity of NAPE-PLD was significantly enhanced by incubation of peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin with treated celiac biopsies. On the contrary, in vivo mucosal FAAH expression and activity did not change in the three groups of patients, and accordingly, mucosal FAAH activity was not influenced by treatment with peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin. In conclusion, our findings provide a possible pathophysiological explanation for the increased anandamide concentration previously shown in active celiac mucosa.
35458242	What about TSH and Anti-Thyroid Antibodies in Patients with Autoimmune Thyroiditis and Celiac Disease Using a Gluten-Free Diet? A Systematic Review.	The prevalence of celiac disease (CD) in patients with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (CAIT) is estimated to be between 2 and 7.8%. A gluten-free diet (GFD) in patients with CD is suggested to have a beneficial effect on CAIT. Thus, the present systematic review was undertaken to achieve more robust evidence about the change in thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroid-specific antibodies (T-Ab) levels obtained in CD patients following a GFD. A specific search strategy was planned. The last search was performed on March 2022. The following data were mainly searched for in order to be extracted: sample size, mean and/or median with standard deviation (SD), and error (SE), individually, of thyroid hormones and T-Ab at baseline and after GFD, and the duration of the study. The initial search retrieved 297 records and 6 articles met the inclusion criteria. In total, 50 patients with both CD and CAIT and 45 controls were reported. The effects of a GFD on the thyroid hormonal and immunological profile could be extracted only in a part of the studies. Two studies were case reports. A low risk of bias was observed. These findings advise further studies, ideally randomized, in order to better investigate the potential relationship between GFD and thyroid homeostasis. The level of evidence is not still sufficient to recommend GFD to patients with CAIT.
38286391	DIAGNOSIS OF SERONEGATIVE AND ULTRASHORT CELIAC DISEASE.	Nowadays celiac disease (CD) in its conventional form, characterized by both positive serology and flat villi in the duodenum, is well known by gastroenterologists and general practitioners. The aim of the present review is to shed light on two neglected and not yet well defined celiac phenotypes, i.e. seronegative and ultrashort celiac disease. Seronegative celiac disease can be suspected in the presence of flat villi, positive HLA-DQ2 and/or -DQ8 and absence of CD antibodies. After having ruled out other seronegative enteropathies, the diagnosis can be confirmed by both clinical and histological improvement after 1-year of gluten-free diet. Ultrashort celiac disease is characterized by the finding of flat villi in the duodenal bulb in the absence of mucosal damage in the distal duodenum and with serological positivity. Data on the prevalence, clinical manifestations, histological lesions, genetic features and outcome of seronegative and ultrashort celiac disease are inconclusive due the few studies available and the small number of diagnosed patients. Some additional diagnostic tools have been developed recently, such as assessing of intestinal transglutaminase 2 (TG2) deposits, the flow-cytometry technique, micro-RNA detection or proteomic analysis and they seem to be useful in the identification of complex patients. Further co-operative studies are highly desirable to improve the knowledge of these two still obscure variants of celiac disease.
22470028	[Plasma citrulline as a marker of loss of enterocitary mass in coeliac disease in childhood].	INTRODUCTION: Plasma citrulline is not incorporated in endogenous or exogenous proteins so it is a theoretical marker of villous atrophy. Our aim was to correlate plasma citrulline levels with severity of villous atrophy in celiac patients. METHODS: Observational case-control study longitudinal in children 16 month-old to 14 year-old: 48 with untreated celiac disease, 9 celiac children under gluten free diet and 35 non-celiac healthy children. Plasma amino acids concentration is determined, expressed in mumol/L, and so are other clinical and analytical data. RESULTS: No statistically significative difference found in the referring to BMI, age or renal function. Small increase in fecal fat in celiac children. Citrulline, arginine and glutamine are significantly lower in cases (17.7 mumol/l, 38.7 mumol/l, 479.6 mumol/l respectively) than in controls (28.9 mumol/l, 56.2 mumol/l, 563.7 mumol/l). Citrulline levels are significantly lower in the severe degrees of atrophy than in mild ones (13.8 mumol/l vs. 19.7 mumol/l, p < 0.05), not happening so with rest of amminoacids. SUMMARY: Postabsortive mean of plasma citrulline is a good marker of reduction in enterocyte mass in celiac patients with villous atrophy; secondary reduction in plasma arginine too. Just a small histological alteration in intestinal biopsy is enough to differentiate citrulline in cases and controls and besides it can be seen that high levels of atrophy present with lower plasma citrulline.
33118261	Celiac disease in children with type 1 diabetes varies around the world: An international, cross-sectional study of 57 375 patients from the SWEET registry.	BACKGROUND: Children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are at much higher risk of developing celiac disease (CD) than the general population. The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence and differences in clinical presentation of CD in T1D in different regions of the world. METHODS: This study is based on the Better control in Pediatric and Adolescent diabeteS: Working to crEate cEnTers of Reference (SWEET) database. There were 57 375 patients included in the study, aged <=18 years from 54 SWEET centers. Only centers with screening for celiac disease were included. Regression models adjusted for age, diabetes duration, and gender and a fixed effect in the models for region was used. Diabetes duration, age at diabetes onset, and sex were presented as unadjusted results. RESULTS: CD was present in 2652 subjects (4.5%), with different prevalence among regions: from 1.9% in Asia/Middle East to 6.9% in Australia/New Zealand. CD was observed more often among females. Comparing children with and without CD, characteristics for those with CD were younger age at diabetes onset (6.3 [3.3; 9.8] vs 8.1 [4.6; 11.3], P < 0.001) and had longer diabetes duration (6.4 [3.6; 9.8] vs 4.8 [2.1; 8.2], P < 0.001). Further, they had lower glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in Europe and North America/Canada; lower body mass index (BMI)-SD score (BMI-SDS) in southern Europe, North America, and Canada; In most regions daily insulin dose was lower, height-SDS was lower, and the percentage of insulin pump users was higher in children with T1D and CD. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence and the anthropometric and metabolic consequences of CD in children with T1D differ around the world.
23390116	Central pontine myelinolysis presenting with tremor in a child with celiac disease.	A 4-year-old boy presented with a history of tremor for 7 days. He also had recurrent diarrhea for the previous 1 year, and poor weight gain. Magnetic resonance of the brain was suggestive of central pontine myelinolysis. There was no evidence of electrolyte abnormalities. The serum tissue transglutaminase level was markedly elevated, and the duodenal biopsy revealed features of celiac disease. The patient was started on gluten-free diet. The tremor resolved within 3 months. Repeat imaging of the brain done 3 months after starting gluten-free diet showed complete resolution of the lesion. This case highlights the unusual presentation of central pontine myelinosis as tremor in a malnourished child with celiac disease. 
26835908	Assessment of Endothelial Dysfunction With Adhesion Molecules in Patients With Celiac Disease.	OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease (CD) is a systemic immune disorder. We assessed serum levels of adhesion molecules as a marker of endothelial dysfunction in patients with CD at first diagnosis and in those on a gluten-free diet. METHODS: Sixty-five patients with CD (mean age 6.74 +- 4.6 years) and 51 age- and sex-matched control patients participated in the present case-controlled, prospective clinical study. Serum levels of vascular adhesion molecule-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, endothelial selectin, vascular endothelial cadherin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and homocysteine levels were measured. RESULTS: Average soluble vascular adhesion molecule-1 (CD vs control group: 1320 +- 308 vs 1120 +- 406 ng/mL, P = 0.006), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (336 +- 99 vs 263 +- 67 ng/mL, P = 0.025), and soluble endothelial selectin (113.9 +- 70 vs 76.9 +- 32 ng/mL, P = 0.007) levels were significantly higher in cases of newly diagnosed CD than in the control group. Soluble vascular adhesion molecule-1 (1050 +- 190 ng/mL) and soluble endothelial selectin (68.7 +- 45 ng/mL) levels in patients with CD, who were fully compliant with a gluten-free diet, were significantly lower than that in those newly diagnosed as having CD (P = 0.003 and P = 0.0012, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These results show that serum adhesion molecule levels are higher in patients with CD. Some of the risks associated with endothelial dysfunction may be related to CD and these risks can be reduced with an appropriate and fully controlled diet.
36286890	[Celiac crisis in patients with celiac disease. Case report].	Celiac crisis (CC) is a rare life-threatening course of celiac disease, observed mainly in children. In adults, CK can be the first manifestation of the disease and, very rarely, a relapse that occurs in patients who do not follow the gluten-free diet (AGD). Triggers can be stress, surgery, childbirth, etc. A clinical observation of CC developed in a 49-year-old patient with previously established latent celiac disease with subtotal villous atrophy, stage Marsh III C is presented. The patient did not comply with AHD. After severe angina, she developed anorexia, diarrhea, emaciation, coagulopathy, bilateral pulmonary embolism, infarction pneumonia, and enterogenic sepsis. As a result of intensive therapy with prednisolone, Fraxiparine, antibiotics, fresh frozen plasma and strict adherence to hypertension, remission of the disease was achieved.
35482279	Migraine and Diet: Updates in Understanding.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We explore recent developments in the prevention and treatment of migraine through dietary interventions. RECENT FINDINGS: Healthier diets (defined in multiple ways), meal regularity, and weight loss are associated with decreased headache burden. Specific diets including the ketogenic diet, the low-glycemic index diet, and the DASH diet are supported by modest evidence for the prevention of migraine. Neither a gluten-free diet, in patients without celiac disease, nor elimination diets have sufficient evidence for their routine consideration. Diet remains a crucial, but underexplored, component of comprehensive migraine management. Multiple interventions exist for providers and patients to consider integrating into their treatment plan. Larger studies are needed to support stronger recommendations for utilization of specific dietary interventions for the prevention and treatment of migraine.
28176232	Celiac Disease in Children with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM): A Hospital Based Study.	OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prevalence and clinical features of Celiac disease among children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM). METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted in PBM Children Hospital, Bikaner from July 2012 through December 2013. All consecutively admitted children with SAM were recruited. All subjects were screened for Celiac disease by serological test for IgA-anti tissue Transglutaminase (IgA tTG) antibodies. All seropositive children underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for small bowel biopsy for the confirmation. Clinical features of patients with and without celiac disease were compared. RESULTS: The sero-prevalence (IgA tTg positivity) of Celiac disease was found to be 15.38% while prevalence of biopsy confirmed Celiac disease was 14.42% among SAM children. Abdominal distension, diarrhea, anorexia, constipation, pain in abdomen, vitamin deficiencies, edema, clubbing and mouth ulcers were more common in patients of Celiac disease compared to patients without Celiac disease but the difference was statistically significant only for abdominal distension and pain abdomen. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high prevalence of Celiac disease in SAM. Screening for Celiac disease (especially in presence of pain abdomen and abdominal distension) should be an essential part of work-up in all children with SAM.
29854070	Oxidative and Antioxidative Status of Children with Celiac Disease Treated with a Gluten Free-Diet.	AIMS: Oxidative stress is a factor involved in the pathogenesis of celiac disease (CD), possibly affecting the course of the disease and celiac-related complications. We assessed the intensity of oxidative processes and the efficiency of antioxidant defense in children with celiac disease. Methods. Group I (n = 32) consisted of children with CD treated with a gluten-free diet, and group II (n = 24) consisted of healthy children on a traditional diet. Antioxidative and oxidative status was assessed by measurement of serum total antioxidant capacity (TAC), total oxidant capacity (TOC), and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) and on the basis of oxidative stress index (OSI). RESULTS: There were no significant differences in serum TAC, TOC, ox-LDL, and OSI between children with CD and healthy children. Cluster analysis showed that the group of children with CD is not homogeneous in terms of serum TAC and TOC levels. About 50% of these children had TAC levels < 1.3 mmol/L and TOC levels > 0.35 mmol/L. CONCLUSIONS: Strict adherence to a gluten-free diet by children with CD seems to be important for maintaining oxidative-antioxidant balance. However, further research is needed to identify factors potentially responsible for increased oxidative stress in some children with celiac disease despite adherence to a gluten-free diet.
39012773	Gluten Ataxia and mGluR1 Autoimmune Encephalitis Presenting as Acute Cerebellar Ataxia: A Case Report.	A Caucasian male in his 60s presented with acute onset of dizziness, dysarthria, and gait ataxia. Upon extensive workup, positive findings were cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showing lymphocytic pleocytosis with oligoclonal bands, positive celiac disease autoantibodies in blood, a duodenal biopsy indicating lymphocytic infiltration, and positive anti-mGluR1 antibody titers in CSF. The patient was started on a strict gluten-free diet and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy for 5 days and showed mild consecutive improvements each day of treatment. He was discharged after 22 days, and was encouraged to continue gluten adherence, physical and speech therapy, and follow up with neuroimmunology. This report demonstrates that autoimmune encephalitis due to anti-mGluR1antibodies and gluten ataxia are both immune-mediated disorders that should be considered in acute cerebellar ataxia cases. By broadening the differential diagnosis and a comprehensive CSF analysis, identification of gluten ataxia and autoimmune encephalitis were beneficial in the management of this particular patient.

31311347	Challenges to drug discovery for celiac disease and approaches to overcome them.	Introduction: The only available effective treatment for celiac disease (CD) is strict and long-term compliance with a gluten-free diet. Dietary gluten restriction must be strict and long term, but is difficult to achieve in many cases and alternative dietary strategies have been investigated in the past few years. Areas covered: This review highlights the progress that has been made in the development of new therapeutics for CD. Detailed information is provided on the targets of drugs for CD as their related mechanisms of action. The therapies are classified in five mechanisms: modification of gluten, intraluminal therapies, immunomodulation, intestinal permeability and modulation of adaptative response. The actual development phase and future approach are also described and discussed. Expert opinion: There are several limitations in each of the treatment targets related either through complications or the lack of complete response to a normal gluten containing diet. It is clear that the most desired therapy for celiac patients would induce gluten tolerance and progress has been made as per the treatments described herein. Therefore, it is shortly expected that curative or complimentary tools to a gluten free diet will be available that will improve the quality of life of CD sufferers.
21537123	Serological tests for celiac disease as indicators of long-term compliance with the gluten-free diet.	OBJECTIVES: The efficacy of celiac disease (CD)-related antibodies in monitoring clinical outcome of patients remains unclear. Our aims were to determine dynamics of antibodies after diagnosis and to assess their performances in monitoring patients' long-term compliance with the gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: We prospectively estimated the performance of seven celiac disease-related antibody tests at diagnosis and at 1 year and more than 4 years after treatment initiation in 53 adults. The ability of antibodies to identify patients partially compliant to treatment was explored by the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The derived cut-off values ('compliance' cutoffs) were compared with cut-off values used for diagnosis ('diagnostic' cutoffs). The degree of compliance with the GFD was assessed using a standardized, multidisciplinary approach. RESULTS: Concentrations of all antibodies decreased significantly at 1 year after diagnosis. The decline continued for more than 4 years in strictly compliant patients (P<0.05-0.001). The gap between 'compliance' and 'diagnostic' cut-offs values was wider at 1 year than at more than 4 years. The predictability of partial compliance determined by the area under receiver operating characteristic curves was relevant for most tests examined at 1 year (areas ranging: 0.64-0.72) and more than 4 years (0.58-0.78). Immunoglobulin A antibodies to deamidated gliadin peptides and tissue transglutaminase had the best performance for monitoring long-term compliance. CONCLUSION: Decreased concentrations of antibodies were significantly associated with the degree of compliance with the GFD. Immunoglobulin A antibodies to deamidated gliadin peptides and tissue transglutaminase had the best and more consistent performances. The serial measurement of antibody levels seems to be more reliable in monitoring compliance than the positive/negative expression of results.
32338009	National survey on the experiences of people with celiac disease in Spain. The CELIAC-SPAIN project.	INTRODUCTION: coeliac disease (CD) is well known, but not so its impact on the patient's life. OBJECTIVE: to determine the impact of CD in the life of celiac patients on different aspects such as diagnosis, follow-up and treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: associates of FACE participated in an auto-administered, telematic survey conducted between May and July, 2019. Three participant profiles have been defined: adults diagnosed in adulthood, adults diagnosed in childhood and parents/guardians of celiac children. RESULTS: 540 surveys (343 adult celiacs, 58 celiacs from children and 139 parents/guardians) from all autonomous communities have been included. In the diagnostic process highlights the diagnostic delay (up to 2 years) and the limitations to screening of family members. After diagnosis, about 20 % of adults do not refer to follow any control. Having a CD generates different reactions, but concern and quality of life limitation are very common. As for the gluten-free diet, 90 % of patients referred good adherence to treatment, which is accompanied by improved symptoms and weight gain. Diet tracking limits patients' daily lives. Gluten-free manufactured products are considered expensive, with unclear and unappealing labeling. CONCLUSIONS: the results of the "CELIAC-SPAIN" project show that there are still many aspects to be improved in CD, both diagnosis and follow-up and in facilitating access to gluten-free products.
29057833	Indications and Use of the Gluten Contamination Elimination Diet for Patients with Non-Responsive Celiac Disease.	For the majority of patients diagnosed with celiac disease, once a gluten-free diet is initiated, symptoms improve within weeks and may completely resolve in months. However, up to 30% of patients may show signs, symptoms or persistent small intestinal damage after one year on a gluten-free diet. These patients require evaluation for other common GI etiologies and assessment of their celiac disease status in order to make a diagnosis and suggest treatment. Here, we propose an approach to evaluating patients with celiac disease with persistent symptoms, persistently elevated serology, and or persistent villous atrophy despite a gluten-free diet. We detail how to diagnose and distinguish between non-responsive and refractory celiac disease. Finally, we introduce the indications for use of the gluten contamination elimination diet and provide information for practitioners to implement the diet when necessary in their practice.
31652803	Multifactorial Etiology of Anemia in Celiac Disease and Effect of Gluten-Free Diet: A Comprehensive Review.	Celiac disease (CD) is a multisystemic disorder with different clinical expressions, from malabsorption with diarrhea, anemia, and nutritional compromise to extraintestinal manifestations. Anemia might be the only clinical expression of the disease, and iron deficiency anemia is considered one of the most frequent extraintestinal clinical manifestations of CD. Therefore, CD should be suspected in the presence of anemia without a known etiology. Assessment of tissue anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysial antibodies are indicated in these cases and, if positive, digestive endoscopy and intestinal biopsy should be performed. Anemia in CD has a multifactorial pathogenesis and, although it is frequently a consequence of iron deficiency, it can be caused by deficiencies of folate or vitamin B12, or by blood loss or by its association with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or other associated diseases. The association between CD and IBD should be considered during anemia treatment in patients with IBD, because the similarity of symptoms could delay the diagnosis. Vitamin B12 deficiency is common in CD and may be responsible for anemia and peripheral myeloneuropathy. Folate deficiency is a well-known cause of anemia in adults, but there is little information in children with CD; it is still unknown if anemia is a symptom of the most typical CD in adult patients either by predisposition due to the fact of age or because biochemical and clinical manifestations take longer to appear.
21224837	Gluten causes gastrointestinal symptoms in subjects without celiac disease: a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial.	OBJECTIVES: Despite increased prescription of a gluten-free diet for gastrointestinal symptoms in individuals who do not have celiac disease, there is minimal evidence that suggests that gluten is a trigger. The aims of this study were to determine whether gluten ingestion can induce symptoms in non-celiac individuals and to examine the mechanism. METHODS: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled rechallenge trial was undertaken in patients with irritable bowel syndrome in whom celiac disease was excluded and who were symptomatically controlled on a gluten-free diet. Participants received either gluten or placebo in the form of two bread slices plus one muffin per day with a gluten-free diet for up to 6 weeks. Symptoms were evaluated using a visual analog scale and markers of intestinal inflammation, injury, and immune activation were monitored. RESULTS: A total of 34 patients (aged 29-59 years, 4 men) completed the study as per protocol. Overall, 56% had human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8. Adherence to diet and supplements was very high. Of 19 patients (68%) in the gluten group, 13 reported that symptoms were not adequately controlled compared with 6 of 15 (40%) on placebo (P=0.0001; generalized estimating equation). On a visual analog scale, patients were significantly worse with gluten within 1 week for overall symptoms (P=0.047), pain (P=0.016), bloating (P=0.031), satisfaction with stool consistency (P=0.024), and tiredness (P=0.001). Anti-gliadin antibodies were not induced. There were no significant changes in fecal lactoferrin, levels of celiac antibodies, highly sensitive C-reactive protein, or intestinal permeability. There were no differences in any end point in individuals with or without DQ2/DQ8. CONCLUSIONS: "Non-celiac gluten intolerance" may exist, but no clues to the mechanism were elucidated.
27571864	Celiac disease and new diseases related to gluten	Celiac disease is the most common chronic intestinal disease. Nowadays it s known that this is a multisistemic pathology of immune mechanism, triggered by gluten, which occurs in genetically susceptible individuals. It affects approximately 1% of the world population, which is a very high prevalence, affects all age groups and has symptoms both digestive and extra-digestive.Since it is a disease that requires maintaining a gluten-free diet and medical monitoring for life, it is important to know it and establish its diagnosis properly.Along with celiac disease a number of new diseases related to gluten are diagnosed increasingly, including the non celiac gluten sensitivity or wheat allergy.The suffering of celiac disease, or other related diseases, by conditioning diet changes of the affected individual, it may be associated with nutritional imbalances that need to monitor and try to solve. Therefore patients with this problem need special nutritional advice.

27750262	The obestatin/ghrelin ratio and ghrelin genetics in adult celiac patients before and after a gluten-free diet, in irritable bowel syndrome patients and healthy individuals.	BACKGROUND: Ghrelin levels and obestatin/ghrelin ratio have been proposed as activity markers in ulcerative colitis, but no data are available in celiac disease (CD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Our aims were as follows: (a) to assess obestatin and ghrelin concentrations in adult active CD patients, diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-d), and healthy controls (HC) in relation to intestinal permeability; (b) to evaluate the ghrelin-obestatin profile in CD patients after a 1-year gluten-free diet (GFD); and (c) to establish the impact of ghrelin genetics. METHODS: The study included 31 CD patients, 28 IBS-d patients, and 19 HC. Intestinal permeability, assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography determination of urinary lactulose (La)/mannitol (Ma), and circulating concentrations of obestatin, ghrelin, and their ratio were evaluated at enrollment and after GFD. The ghrelin single nucleotide polymorphisms Arg51Gln (rs34911341), Leu72Met (rs696217), and Gln90Leu (rs4684677) were analyzed. RESULTS: Intestinal permeability was impaired in CD patients and ameliorated after GFD. Ghrelin was significantly (P=0.048) higher and the obestatin/ghrelin ratio was significantly (P=0.034) lower in CD patients compared with both IBS-d and HC, and GFD reduced the peptide levels, but without reaching the concentrations in HC. Significant differences (P<0.05) were found in the Leu72Met polymorphism among groups, with the reduction of the GT genotype and the T allele in both CD and IBS-d patients compared with HC. CONCLUSION: Intestinal permeability is altered in CD, but not in IBS-d patients, and ghrelin levels increase in CD patients as observed in other inflammatory conditions. Moreover, a role for ghrelin genetics is hypothesized in sustaining the many pathogenetic components of these different pathologies, but with a similar symptom profile.
31978015	Frequency and Predictors of Successful Transition of Care for Young Adults With Childhood Celiac Disease.	OBJECTIVES: Transition from pediatric to adult care for individuals with chronic conditions is important to prevent gaps in care, though this has not been well-studied in celiac disease (CD). The aim of this study was to discern rates and predictors of successful transition of care for young adults with childhood-diagnosed CD. METHODS: An anonymous 21-question online survey was sent to individuals on our center's email contact list seeking responses from those ages 18 to 25 years diagnosed with CD before age 18 years. Information collected included method of diagnosis, demographics, CD-related care, reasons for not seeking care, and symptoms. RESULTS: Respondents (n = 98), 70% women, had a median age of 21 years (IQR 19--23 years). The majority were full or part-time students (67%; 95% CI 59%-77%). Only 31% of respondents had successfully transitioned to an adult CD provider. Some 37% (95% CI 29%-48%) were not receiving any CD medical care. An older age at diagnosis was associated with successful transition to adult gastroenterology (P = 0.002) as well as with greater symptom scores (P = 0.002). Receiving a referral for ongoing adult CD care predicted successful transition to an adult provider (odds ratio [OR] 3.92, 95% CI 1.58-9.72). CONCLUSIONS: Transition of care for young adults with CD is inconsistent, particularly among asymptomatic patients. Receipt of a referral for an adult provider significantly improves follow-up rates.
38613039	Gluten-Free Diet and Other Celiac Disease Therapies: Current Understanding and Emerging Strategies.	A lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only treatment for celiac disease and other gluten-related disorders. Nevertheless, strict adherence to the GFD is often challenging due to concerns about social isolation, risk of gluten contaminations, high cost, poor quality and the taste of gluten-free products. Moreover, although the GFD is effective in achieving mucosal healing, it may lead to dietary imbalances due to nutrient deficiencies over a long period of time. To overcome these issues, several gluten-free wheat flours have been developed to create products that closely resemble their gluten-containing counterparts. Furthermore, given the critical importance of adhering to the GFD, it becomes essential to promote adherence and monitor possible voluntary or involuntary transgressions. Various methods, including clinical assessment, questionnaires, serology for celiac disease, duodenal biopsies and the detection of Gluten Immunogenic Peptides (GIPs) are employed for this purpose, but none are considered entirely satisfactory. Since adherence to the GFD poses challenges, alternative therapies should be implemented in the coming years to improve treatment efficacy and the quality of life of patients with celiac disease. The aim of this narrative review is to explore current knowledge of the GFD and investigate its future perspectives, focusing on technology advancements, follow-up strategies and insights into a rapidly changing future.
21682114	Increased prevalence of celiac disease in patients with unexplained infertility in the United States.	OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there might be an increased prevalence of undiagnosed celiac disease among a population of infertile women using serologic screening. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective cohort study was performed at an academic infertility clinic in the United States. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of celiac disease in this population was 2.1% (4/188). There was a significantly increased prevalence (5.9%) of undiagnosed celiac disease among women presenting with unexplained infertility (n = 51). CONCLUSION: Women with unexplained infertility are at increased risk for having undiagnosed celiac disease, which may be a potentially modifiable (and treatable) risk factor.
25782659	Gluten-Free Diet and Lipid Profile in Children With Celiac Disease: Comparison With General Population Standards.	OBJECTIVES: A gluten-free diet (GFD) may carry high energy and fat load. We verified lipid profile and dietary indicators cross-sectionally and prospectively in patients with celiac disease (CD). METHODS: In any consecutive child receiving a GFD (group 1) or newly diagnosed as having CD (group 2), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, blood pressure (BP), anthropometric data, physical activity, and a 24-hour food diary were collected during follow-up visits (yearly in group 1 and during the first year of GFD in group 2). RESULTS: In group 1 (132 girls, 73 boys, 10.7 +- 4.2 years), TC (P = 0.006), TG (P = 0.014), and HDL (P = 0.019) were significantly higher in girls than in boys. Compared with the general pediatric population, group 1 girls had higher TC, TG, HDL, and low-density lipoprotein; group 1 boys had lower TC, TG, and low-density lipoprotein and higher HDL. TC was significantly and positively affected by age, sex, and time receiving GFD, whereas HDL was significantly and positively affected by body mass index, diastolic BP, and sex; TG was negatively affected by diastolic BP. Compared with recommendations, group 1 children introduced less calories, iron, and calcium; one-third more sodium; similar amounts of fiber; and twice as many proteins. In group 2 (20 girls, 10 boys, 8.6 +- 3.55 years), TC did not change over time and TG diminished, whereas HDL, blood glucose, and body mass index increased; saturated fats and caloric intake were below recommendations, whereas proteins were excessively introduced. Fibers were optimal. HDL was inversely correlated to calories and saturated fat (R2 = 80, P = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: Lipid profiles of children with CD differ across sexes and from reference population. GFD, being unexpectedly appropriate in fibers and fat proportion, may be a contributor.
23609110	The role of HLA DQ2 and DQ8 in dissecting celiac-like disease in common variable immunodeficiency.	OBJECTIVES: Gastrointestinal manifestations are frequent in patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), and some of the patients present with celiac-like features. Diagnosing celiac disease (CD) in CVID however is challenging, as autoantibody detection and histopathology of the small intestine cannot reliably discriminate between classic CD and a celiac-like disease in these individuals. For the development of classic gluten-sensitive CD a certain HLA haplotype involving the loci DQA1* and DQB1* and encoding two different HLA DQ heterodimers is the prerequisite. We aimed to determine the frequency of these haplotypes in CVID patients with suspected CD. Furthermore, we report on autoimmune manifestations and the lymphocyte phenotype in these patients. METHODS: By retrospective analysis data on gastrointestinal symptoms, diet, concurrent autoimmune diseases, and routine laboratory values were collected. CVID patients were classified according to their B-cell phenotype. Expression of HLA-DQA1* and HLA-DQB1* alleles were determined by genetic analysis. RESULTS: Twenty out of 250 CVID patients presented with a clinical phenotype resembling celiac disease. Four (20%) out of these CVID patients carried the CD-associated HLA DQ2.5 or DQ8 heterodimer, while HLA DQ2.5 was present in 100% of a CD control cohort. Gluten-free diet (GFD) resulted in a clinical and histological response in two out of four patients with HLA high-risk alleles for CD. The response could not be assessed in the remaining two patients, as these patients did not adhere sufficiently long to GFD. The percentage of autoimmune manifestations other than CD was high (50%) in CVID patients presenting with a CD-like enteropathy, and most of these patients had an expansion of B-cells with low expression of CD21 (CD21low B-cells). CONCLUSIONS: In CVID patients with suspected celiac disease typing of the HLA loci DQA1 and DQB1 can help to identify those that have a genetic susceptibility for CD. In CVID patients with a celiac-like phenotype but negative for CD-associated HLA-DQ markers, an autoimmune enteropathy (AIE) as part of an extended autoimmune dysregulation needs to be considered. This has important implications for further diagnostics and therapy of these patients.
28830676	Gluten related illnesses and severe mental disorders: a comprehensive review.	The putative role of gluten in the pathophysiology of severe mental illnesses remains uncertain and there is doubt about the possible benefit of gluten-free diets for individuals affected by psychosis and mood disorders. The objective of this review was to summarize the findings linking gluten related conditions to pathophysiological substrates implicated in schizophrenia and mood disorders and review the evidences of potential benefits of glute-free diets in these populations. A literature search was conducted within PubMed and Scielo databases including references from inception until March 1st 2017. The strategy search was to use the key words "gluten", "celiac disease", "wheat", "bipolar disorder", "mood disorders", "psychosis", "schizophrenia", "depression". In the review about the potential efficacy of gluten-free diets in severe mental illnesses, we included only studies with original data, including cross sectional and longitudinal studies and clinical trials. Book chapters, review articles and meta-analysis and republished data were excluded. Although the current available evidences suggest that people with celiac disease or gluten allergy could have a slightly higher risk of schizophrenia and mood disorders compared to the general population, the literature review reveals significant inaccuracies in the data. There is insufficient evidence to recommend gluten-free diets for populations with psychosis and mood disorders.
21182543	Prevalence of celiac disease in the northern part of India: a community based study.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: While celiac disease is estimated to affect about 1% of the world's population, it is thought to be uncommon not only in India but in Asia also. There is a lack of studies on the prevalence of celiac disease from Asian nations. The aim of the present study was to estimate the prevalence of celiac disease in the community. METHODS: In a cross sectional study, we estimated the prevalence of celiac disease in urban and rural populations in the National Capital Region, Delhi, India. A structured questionnaire was administered, by door-to-door visits, to all participants to collect socio-demographic data and to screen for features of celiac disease, namely chronic or recurrent diarrhea and, anemia. In children, additional features, namely short stature (linear height below 5th percentile for age) and failure to thrive/gain weight were also used. All respondents who were screen positive (any one of above) and 10% of screen negative individuals were called for serological testing, which is anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody. All serologically positive respondents were invited to undergo further evaluation including endoscopic biopsy. Celiac disease was diagnosed on the basis of a positive serology, the presence of villous atrophy and/or response to gluten free diet. RESULT: Among 12,573 contacted, 10,488 (83.4%) (50.6% male) agreed to participate. Based on screening, 5622 (53.6%) participants were screen positive. Of all those screen positive, 2167 (38.5%) agreed for serological testing; additionally 712 (14%) negatives were also tested. The overall sero-prevalence of celiac disease was 1.44% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.22 1.69) and the overall prevalence of celiac disease was 1.04% (95% CI 0.85 1.25). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of celiac disease in this north Indian community is 1 in 96. Celiac disease is more common than is recognized in India.
37243608	The role of gluten challenge in the diagnosis of celiac disease: a review.	INTRODUCTION: Duodenal biopsy is the gold standard in the diagnosis of celiac disease, with increasing utilization of serology. A gluten challenge may be required, for example, when dietary gluten reduction precedes appropriate diagnostic evaluations. Evidence on the best challenge protocol is currently sparse. Pharmaceutical trials in recent years may have provided new insights into the challenge and advanced the development of novel sensitive histological and immunological methods. AREAS COVERED: This review outlines the current perspectives on the use of gluten challenge in the diagnosis of celiac disease and explores future directions in this area. EXPERT OPINION: Comprehensive elimination of celiac disease before dietary gluten restriction is essential to avoid diagnostic uncertainties. Gluten challenge continues to have an important role in certain clinical scenarios, although it is important to understand its limitations in the diagnostic evaluation. The evidence so far permits no unequivocal recommendation considering the timing, duration, and amount of gluten used in the challenge. Thus, these decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis. Further studies with more standardized protocols and outcome measures are called for. In the future novel immunological methods may help to shorten or even avoid gluten challenge.
32960543	A Narrow Window: Booming Gluten-free Market and Fostering Healthy Dietary Habits in Children With Celiac Disease.	An expanding gluten-free marketplace has left children with celiac disease and their families with a host of new dietary options. The quality of these foods is inconsistent and processed items may be high in caloric content while lacking nutritional value. Assessing the dietary preferences of a cohort of children with celiac disease via cross-sectional survey, we find that these processed food items have become a staple of the gluten-free diet, and in many cases, these foods are consumed to the exclusion of healthy alternatives. Furthermore, children with celiac disease and their families become less interested in dietary education over time, indicating that the greatest opportunity for imparting a healthy diet may occur at the time of diagnosis.
26203574	[Non-celiac gluten sensitivity: Another condition that responds to gluten].	Remission of gastrointestinal and general symptoms after gluten withdrawal has been described in some non-celiac individuals for nearly 30 years. Only recently, efforts have been made to define this entity, now referred to as "non-celiac gluten sensitivity". It includes patients that clinically respond to gluten free diet without exhibiting allergic or autoimmune features to explain such response. Wheat allergy, celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome and symptoms induced by high FODMAPs (Fermentable, Oligo-, Di-, Mono-saccharides And Polyols) consumption are the main differential diagnoses. The relationship with neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and autism has not been demonstrated, but currently it gives ground to great hope in families with affected children. Epidemiology of non-celiac gluten sensitivity is not clear. It is described as more common among women and less common in children. Genetic and immune factors, changes in intestinal microbiota and non-gluten components present in wheat grains are main factors postulated in the pathogenesis of this condition. To date, there are no specific biomarkers for non-celiac gluten sensitivity and diagnosis is reached by excluding other causes of disease. A trial with gluten-free diet and subsequent gluten challenge is the methodology most frequently used to confirm diagnosis.
27030188	[Seronegative celiac disease: A case report].	The paper describes a rare case of celiac disease in the absence of serum anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) antibodies. A 51-year-old patient has been suffering from diarrheas for 20 years. He has lost 15 kg gradually; weakness progressed; muscle cramps, leg edemas, and signs of dynamic pseudoobstruction appeared. Morphological examination revealed small intestinal mucosal (SIM) villous atrophy (Marsh IIIC stage). IgA anti-tTG and IgG anti-tTG antibodies were 0.086 and 0.178, respectively. The patient was prescribed a gluten-free diet, water electrolyte solutions to correct metabolic disturbances, and prednisolone. During a control examination after 6 months, the patient had no complaints and gained 22 kg, and the SIM villus height was increased. The specific feature of the case is specific negative serological tests for celiac disease. 
28323276	Open-Capsule Budesonide for Refractory Celiac Disease.	OBJECTIVES: Refractory celiac disease (RCD) is a rare condition often associated with poor prognosis. Various immunosuppressive medications (IMs) have been used with modest success. We describe outcomes in patients treated with open-capsule budesonide (OB), including those for whom IM treatment failed. METHODS: We identified RCD patients treated with OB at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota from 2003 to 2015. Demographic, serologic, and clinical variables were analyzed. RESULTS: We identified 57 patients who received OB for suspected RCD. Based on clonal T-cell receptor gamma gene rearrangement or aberrant phenotype of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), 13 patients (23%) were classified as having RCD-2 and 43 (75%) as RCD-1. In one patient (2%) TCR gene rearrangement status was unknown. Most patients were women (69%), mean (s.d.) age was 60.5 (3.5) years and body mass index was 28.4 (4.5) kg/m2. The majority had diarrhea (72%), with median of 6 bowel movements per day (range, 4-25). IM treatment (azathioprine, systemic corticosteroids, or regular budesonide) had failed in nearly half. Twenty-four patients (42%) had anemia and 12 (21%) had hypoalbuminemia. All had Marsh 3 lesions on biopsy: 3a (19%), 3b (46%), and 3c (35%). After OB therapy, the majority had clinical (92%) and histologic (89%) improvement. Follow-up biopsy in 7 out of 13 patients with RCD-2 (53%) showed an absence of clonal TCR gamma gene rearrangement/aberrant IEL phenotype previously seen. On follow-up, 2 patients (4%) died of enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with RCD show clinical and histopathologic improvement with OB therapy, including those with failure of IMs. OB is a promising therapeutic option for management of RCD.
32160043	EFFECT OF GLUTEN-FREE DIET ON METABOLIC CONTROL AND ANTHROPOMETRIC PARAMETERS IN TYPE 1 DIABETES WITH SUBCLINICAL CELIAC DISEASE: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL.	Objective: It is unclear whether the institution of gluten-free diet (GFD) is beneficial in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and subclinical celiac disease (CD). Our primary objective was to evaluate the effect of GFD on the frequency of hypoglycemia, in patients with T1DM and subclinical CD. Our secondary objective was to investigate the effect of GFD on height, weight, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin dose requirement, and bone mineral homeostasis. Methods: We carried out a prospective open label randomized controlled trial (RCT). Patients with T1DM and subclinical CD were randomized to receive GFD or a normal diet for 1 year. The primary outcome was the frequency of hypoglycemic episodes (blood glucose <70 mg/dL) measured by self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) at the sixth month of the study in the 2 groups. Results: Screening for CD was carried out in 320 T1DM patients. Thirty eligible patients were randomized to receive GFD (n = 15) or a normal diet (n = 15). The mean number of hypoglycemic episodes/month recorded by SMBG and the mean time spent in hypoglycemia measured by CGM (minutes) in the GFD group versus the non-GFD group at six months was 2.3 minutes versus 3.4 minutes (P = .5) and 124.1 minutes versus 356.9 minutes (P = .1), respectively. The mean number of hypoglycemic episodes/month significantly declined in the GFD group (3.5 episodes at baseline versus 2.3 episodes at the sixth month; P = .03). The mean HbA1c declined by 0.73% in the GFD group and rose by 0.99% in non-GFD group at study completion. Conclusion: This is the first RCT to assess the effect of GFD in T1DM and subclinical CD. A trend towards a decrease in hypoglycemic episodes and better glycemic control was seen in patients receiving GFD. Abbreviations: BMC = bone mineral content; BMI = body mass index; CD = celiac disease; CGM = continuous glucose monitoring; GFD = gluten-free diet; Hb = hemoglobin; HbA1c = glycosylated hemoglobin; iPTH = intact parathyroid hormone; RCT = randomized controlled trial; SMBG = self-monitoring of blood glucose; T1DM = type 1 diabetes mellitus; tTG-IgA = tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin A.
25003267	Lower bifidobacteria counts in adult patients with celiac disease on a gluten-free diet.	CONTEXT: The ingestion of gluten is responsible for the symptoms of Celiac disease, but other environmental factors can also influence. Strains of the Bifidobacterium genus have been shown to afford protection against the inflammatory response and mucosal damage caused by gliadin peptides in vitro. OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to compare the concentration of fecal bifidobacteria and pH of patients with celiac disease on gluten-free diet and control subjects in order to identify if the imbalance on fecal microbiota still remain during the treatment of celiac disease and identify the necessity of dietary supplementation with pre- or probiotics. METHODS: It was analyzed the feces of 42 healthy subjects and 14 celiac patients. The bifidobacteria count in feces was done in selective medium BIM-25. Microscopic analysis of the colonies was performed by Gram stain. The identification of the genus Bifidobacterium was performed by determination of fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase. Fecal pH was measured using a pH meter. RESULTS: The concentration of bifidobacteria per gram of feces was significantly higher in healthy subjects (controls) (1.5 +- 0.63 x108 CFU/g) when compared to celiac patients (2.5 +- 1.5 x107 CFU/g). The fecal pH was not different between celiac patients (7.19 +- 0.521) and controls (7.18 +- 0.522). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that with lower levels of bifidobacteria, celiac patients have an imbalance in the intestinal microbiota, regardless of pH, even while on a gluten-free diet. This fact could favor the pathological process of the disorder.
26378476	Immune response to Hepatitis B vaccine in patients with celiac disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.	It is debated whether patients with celiac disease (CD) have non-protective antibody responses to HBV vaccination more frequently than non-affected subjects. To perform a literature review and meta-analysis on protective response to HBV vaccination in CD patients. RCTs and observational controlled studies were eligible. Outcome of interest was an anti-HBs (HBsAb) titer >= 10 IU/L after last vaccine dose. Comparative index was rate ratio (RR). Heterogeneity between studies was addressed and funnel plots were analyzed. Meta-regression models were applied to investigate effect size due to study-specific variables. Twelve retrospective studies on a total of 1,447 participants and 4 prospective studies on 184 subjects were selected. The RR was 0.732 (95% C.I.: 0.664-0.808) and 0.777 (95% C.I.: 0.629-0.960) in the prospective and retrospective studies, respectively. The I(2), indicating heterogeneity, was 51.1% in retrospective, 39.8% in prospective studies. Non-protective antibody responses occurred more frequently in patients than controls. Due to limitations in the available studies, additional trials to evaluate post-vaccination HBsAb titer in CD patients are needed.
26289701	Atypical Presentation of Celiac Disease in an Elderly Adult: Celiac Crisis.	
32350146	Celiac disease: a multi-faceted medical condition.	Celiac disease (CD) is a systemic condition of autoimmune origin, affecting genetically predisposed individuals who at some point lose tolerance towards dietary gluten. Prevalence in the general population is 0.5 - 1%, with a higher frequency in women. The most important environmental factor for CD is ingestion of specific gluten peptides. It triggers a sequence of molecular events, involving the intestinal permeability and the immune system, which ends in damage of the intestinal mucosa. A number of studies have demonstrated the correlation between the intestinal microbiota and celiac disease. MicroRNAs through their regulatory role on gene expression have been implicated in the pathogenesis of CD and suggested as potential biomarkers. In the pediatric and adult population, CD displays different clusters of clinical symptoms. Persistent diarrhea, abdominal pain and involuntary weight loss are the classic symptoms of CD. In the majority of cases diagnosis relies on the combination of serum autoantibodies (anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomisium IgA) and duodenal biopsy showing villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia and intraepithelial lymphocytes. Observance of a lifelong gluten-free diet, which interrupts the immune response to gluten peptides, is the only effective treatment of CD.

We report on 2 patients affected by both celiac disease (CD) and beta-thalassemia major who underwent successful myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for the latter condition. After HSCT, the introduction of a gluten-containing diet did not cause the reappearance of clinical, serological, and histological markers of CD in up to 5 years of follow-up. After transplantation, in both patients, dendritic cells and regulatory FoxP3T cells showed a recovery of normal values and no proliferative T-cell response upon gliadin stimulation was found. These data suggest that allogeneic HSCT may lead to induction of gluten tolerance in patients with CD.
37192180	Celiac disease and COVID-19 in adults: A systematic review.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease affecting around 1.4% of the total human population. Local and systemic manifestations are described in CD. Viral infections seem to trigger CD or even have a worse outcome in CD patients. The evidence on the relationship between CD and coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is limited. To evaluate existing evidence on the association between CD and COVID-19, we conducted the current systematic review. METHODS: We systematically searched Pubmed, Scopus, and Embase databases to find articles that reported risks or outcomes of COVID-19 in CD patients. Papers in any language published up to November 17, 2022, were evaluated for possible inclusion. The results were analyzed qualitatively. This study is registered with PROSPERO(CRD42022327380). RESULTS: We identified 509 studies by searching databases; 14 reported data on the risk or outcome of COVID-19 in CD patients and were eligible for qualitative synthesis. We found that the relative risk of acquiring COVID-19 in CD patients may be lower than in the general population. Approximately 90% of infected patients were treated as an outpatient, and 10% were hospitalized. GFD adherence and Health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) were more or less the same before and during the pandemic. The gluten-free products (GFP) supply seems to be plunged during the pandemic. The data on the psychological effects of the pandemic were conflicting. CONCLUSION: The risk of acquiring COVID-19 in CD patients is lower than in the general population. Females were more likely to be infected by COVID-19, and the most common comorbidity in infected patients was a chronic lower respiratory disease; around 10% of infected patients needed hospitalization, GFD adherence, and HR-QOL was more or less the same before and during the pandemic, depression, anxiety, and stress levels of patients varied among studies. Patients had more difficulties accessing GFPs based on limited data.
21516845	[Different characteristics of quality of life in celiac disease patients].	AIM: To study quality of life (QoL) in patients with celiac disease (CD) in the course of treatment with aglutenic diet (AD). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Modern algorithm of glutenic enteropathy diagnosis (enzyme immunoassay, histological examination of the biopsy of distal duodenum mucosa) was used in 650 patients with different gastrointestinal symptoms. QoL was assessed in the course of AD treatment of CD with application of universal standard questionnaire MOS SF-36. RESULTS: CD was diagnosed in 56 (8.6%) patients. Classic CD was diagnosed in 44 (78.6%) patients, atypical CD--in 12 (21.4%). Significant lowering of QoL characteristic psychological health" was observed in CD patients under 30 and over 50 and "physical health" in 30-50-year-old CD patients. Women had low points on "mental health" scale. After 3 AD months QoL worsened by all the scales, but after 12 months QoL significantly improved. CONCLUSION: QoL in patients with classic CD is associated with gender and age. First, AD deteriorates QoL, but 1-year diet therapy improves QoL.
23681421	Celiac disease and autoimmunity: review and controversies.	Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune condition affecting the small intestine, triggered by the ingestion of gluten, the protein fraction of wheat, barley, and rye. There is a strong linkage between CD and HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 haplotypes. Multiple case reports and small series suggest concordance between CD and other autoimmune disorders. This paper provides a brief overview of the pathogenesis of CD and reviews the literature regarding associations between CD and other autoimmune diseases, including the potential effects of gluten-free diet therapy on the prevention or amelioration of associated diseases. 
28723859	Determinants of Follow-up Care for Patients With Celiac Disease.	GOALS: This study aimed to investigate follow-up patterns among celiac disease (CD) patients. BACKGROUND: Gender factors are important in CD with women diagnosed more frequently than men despite equal seropositivity in screening studies. To determine if gender influences postdiagnosis care, we performed a retrospective cohort study investigating the impact of gender and mode of presentation on follow-up patterns after diagnosis. STUDY: The study included adults with biopsy-proven CD presenting to a single tertiary care center between 2005 and 2014. The primary exposure was at least 1 visit with a CD specialist. The primary outcome was >=2 follow-up visits, including office visits and endoscopic procedures. Data extracted included whether patients had tissue transglutaminase antibodies performed by our laboratory. RESULTS: We analyzed 708 patients of which 70.5% were female. Follow-up was good with a majority of patients (69%) having at least 1 follow-up visit. On bivariate analysis, patients least likely to follow-up were ages 18 to 29 (P=0.03) and women with atypical presentations (P=0.003). After adjusting for potential confounders, individuals over age 65 were significantly more likely to attend at least 2 follow-up visits (odds ratio, 2.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.21-3.55; P=0.0079). Individuals with an abnormal baseline tissue transglutaminase antibody value in our laboratory were significantly more likely to follow-up (odds ratio, 1.99; 95% confidence interval, 1.39-2.85; P=0.0002). CONCLUSIONS: Gender had no impact on follow-up patterns despite prior studies demonstrating an impact on diagnosis rates. Future attention should focus on retaining young patients and those with atypical modes of presentation.
26547400	Complementary Serologic Investigations in Children with Celiac Disease Is Unnecessary during Follow-Up.	OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency of nutritional deficiencies and thyroid dysfunction in children with celiac disease (CD) and during follow-up after initiation of a gluten-free diet. Laboratory investigations of hemoglobin, ferritin, calcium, folate, vitamin B12, vitamin D, and thyroid function are regularly ordered in children with CD despite sufficient evidence for these. STUDY DESIGN: Between 2009 and 2014, test results of hemoglobin, ferritin, folate, vitamin B12, calcium, vitamin D (25[OH]D), free thyroxin, and thyroid stimulating hormone of children with CD regularly seen at the Leiden University Medical Center were investigated. Laboratory reference ranges were used to define abnormal results. Pearson chi(2) test for trend, unpaired t test, and 1-way ANOVA were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Of the 182 children evaluated, 119 were newly diagnosed. On average, 17% of results per year were missing because of incomplete blood investigations. Iron deficiency (28%) and iron deficiency anemia (9%) were found at the time of diagnosis of CD. Folate (14%), vitamin B12 (1%), and vitamin D deficiencies (27%) were also seen. No hypocalcemia or thyroid dysfunction was found. At follow-up, iron deficiency, iron deficiency anemia, and folate and vitamin D deficiency were observed in 8%, 2%, 3%, and 25% of patients, respectively. Vitamin B12 deficiency, hypocalcemia, and thyroid disease were not found. CONCLUSIONS: Complementary blood investigations are relevant at the time of diagnosis of CD but have little diagnostic yield during follow-up visits once the patient is placed on a gluten-free diet. Thus, we recommend that these variables only be assessed on indication, such as fatigue or abnormal growth.
31770352	Persistent Symptoms in People With Celiac Disease Despite Gluten-Free Diet: A Concern?	Studies show that people with celiac disease have reduced well-being and have persistent symptoms, mainly related to the gastrointestinal tract. The aim of this study was to analyze how persons in a celiac disease member association report their symptoms, health, and life satisfaction. A questionnaire, with both open and closed questions, was distributed to all members (n = 726) of a celiac association in the southeast of Sweden. The response rate was 74.5%, of which 524 (72%) said they had received a celiac disease diagnosis and were thus included in the study. Almost half of the participants (40.7%-42.2%) stated that they had persistent celiac disease symptoms despite following a gluten-free diet. Diarrhea, abdominal pain, and congestion were persistent symptoms reported and could contribute to a lower health status compared with people without persistent symptoms. The life satisfaction scale (LiSat-9) showed differences in 5 of 9 variables between the groups. Living with celiac disease is far from easy when you have persistent symptoms. People with celiac disease require follow-up by healthcare services, and a new treatment needs to be developed because following the gluten-free diet alone does not seem to alleviate symptoms in everyone.
36771266	The Influence of SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic on the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease and Clinical Practice in Pediatric Gastroenterology.	Celiac disease (CD) has a high prevalence but remains largely underdiagnosed. Although extensive studies have confirmed that children with CD do not have an increased risk of severe COVID-19, public health regulations associated with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic may have exacerbated this problem. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the number of new-onset CD cases. Additionally, the role of SARS-CoV-2 in autoimmune diseases and its influence on clinical practice in pediatric gastroenterology were briefly reviewed. We described the data from the hospital electronic registry of new-onset CD, during the COVID-19 pandemic and 2 years before. A total of 423 children were diagnosed with CD between March 2018 and February 2022: 228 in the 2-year pre-COVID-19 period and 195 during the pandemic. The number of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic was 14.5% lower than in the previous years. The quarterly comparison of CD diagnoses showed a reduction in all quarters. A reduction in diagnoses during the lockdown and in the following months was evident and not compensated thereafter. This is the first study to evaluate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the diagnosis of CD in children. Further studies are necessary to improve the system of biopsy-sparing diagnosis and to evaluate the effect of the diagnostic delay. Special attention should be given to the implementation of telemedicine services.
26522202	Celiac Crisis in Refractory Celiac Disease Type I with Neurological Manifestations: A Diagnostic Dilemma.	Celiac crisis is a life-threatening condition in which patients have profuse diarrhea and severe metabolic disturbances. Refractory Celiac Disease (RCD) is a rare condition defined as persistence of symptoms despite being on Gluten Free Diet (GFD) for 6 months. Neurological involvement in Celiac Disease (CD) is seen in around 8 - 10% of adult patients; however, it is rare in children. Herein we present a case of an adolescent presenting with neurological symptoms and celiac crisis and diagnosed as RCD, type 1. He was treated with high dose steroids. This case underscores the need to consider RCD in patients presenting in celiac crisis and showing no improvement on GFD. 
24217985	Etiopathogenesis of recurrent aphthous stomatitis and the role of immunologic aspects: literature review.	Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS; recurrent aphthous ulcers; canker sores) belongs to the group of chronic, inflammatory, ulcerative diseases of the oral mucosa. Up to now, the etiopathogenesis of this condition remains unclear; it is, however, considered to be multifactorial. The results of currently performed studies indicate that genetically mediated disturbances of the innate and acquired immunity play an important role in the disease development. Factors that modify the immunologic response in RAS include: food allergies, vitamin and microelement deficiencies, hormonal and gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., celiac disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis), some viral and bacterial infections, mechanical injuries and stress. In this paper, we presented the main etiopathogenetic factors of RAS with a special emphasis on the mechanisms of the immune response modification. Moreover, we discussed the crucial clinical symptoms and types of RAS together with epidemiologic data based on the current medical literature reports and our own observations.
28815514	Intraepithelial lymphocyte immunophenotype: a useful tool in the diagnosis of celiac disease.	According to new ESPGHAN guidelines, gluten challenge is considered necessary when there is doubt about the initial diagnosis of celiac disease (CD). The main aim of this study was to quantify intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) immunophenotype on celiac patients on gluten-containing diet (GCD) compared to those on gluten-free diet (GFD). Another aim was to evaluate the clinical utility of IELs in the CD diagnosis, especially in selected patients on GFD where diagnostic uncertainty remains. IEL immunophenotype (TCRgammadelta and NK-like IELs) were studied by flow cytometry in 111 children with CD (81 children with CD on GCD and 30 celiac patients on GFD) and a control group (10 children). Duration of GFD was 5.4 +- 1.6 years. TCRgammadelta IELs in celiac patients receiving a GCD or GFD were significantly higher (p < 0.001) than in the control group. NK-like IELs in patients receiving a GCD or GFD were significantly lower than in the control group (p < 0.001). We observed a permanent decrease of NK-like IELs and an increment of TCRgammadelta IELs after following an adequate establishment and compliance of a long-term GFD in celiac patients. Recognition of IELs changes in the intestinal mucosa on celiac patients after long-term establishment of a GFD could constitute a useful tool for CD diagnosis in various situations: in which there is doubt about the initial diagnosis and repeat biopsy is necessary (avoiding the need of gluten challenges), and in those patients with symptoms/signs suggestive of CD who maintain a low gluten diet.

38662156	Patients with Celiac Disease Have High Prevalence of Fatty Liver and Metabolic Syndrome.	OBJECTIVE: In recent years, patients with celiac disease (CeD) have been reported to have a high prevalence of fatty liver and metabolic syndrome. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the prevalence of fatty liver and metabolic syndrome in patients with CeD and effect of gluten-free diet in them. METHODS: The PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library databases were searched for original studies upto November 18, 2022. We included full-text articles published in the English language after 1990 that used well-defined criteria for CeD, fatty liver and metabolic syndrome. A random effects model was used to calculate pooled prevalence. RESULTS: Of 350 studies identified, 11 studies (n = 2578) were included in the analysis. On analysis of both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, pooled prevalence of fatty liver and metabolic syndrome in treatment-naive patients with CeD were 18.2% (95% CI 8.3-30.8%, n = 1237) and 4.3% (95% CI 2.4-6.7, n = 1239) and in those on GFD of varying duration was 28.2% (95% CI 20.7-36.4%, n = 1368) and 21.3% (95% CI 11.7-32.9%, n = 2193), respectively. There was no difference in the prevalence of fatty liver and metabolic syndrome between low- or high-income group countries. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CeD have a high prevalence of fatty liver and metabolic syndrome which increases further with the initiation of GFD. Patients with CeD should thus be screened and monitored for development of fatty liver and metabolic syndrome. They should be counselled appropriately regarding their diet and inclusion of physical activity in their lifestyle.
23513421	[Peritoneal dialysis in a patient with right hemiparesis, lupus nephritis, significant insufficiency of arteries of aortic arch and celiac disease: case report].	Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a method of choice in patients in whom there are difficulties concerning creation of AV fistula. A 38-year old female patient came to our hospital because of a need of making an AV fistula. She had end-stage renal insufficiency of unknown origin. She had a right hemiparesis with a contracture of the right fist and epilepsy because of the stroke she suffered in 1993. After doing the diagnostics, we have found that patient had lupus nephritis, occlusion of brachiocephalic trunk, right and left common carotid artery and left subclavian artery. We also diagnosed celiac disease and a significant anemia. It was not possible to form an AV fistula, as it was not possible to do an assisted PD. Because of the right hemiparesis and contracture of the right fist, the possibility of performing PD independently was questionable. Despite the handicap, the patient had strong motivation and she managed to master the technique of PD independently. Even though it was estimated that she had a high risk score for applying anesthesia (ASA IV), the insertion of the peritoneal catheter went without complications. Because of the comorbidity, especially because of the significant stenosis and occlusions of the arteries of aortic arch, the kidney transplantation will not be performed. In the last fifteen months, the patient is performing PD independently, without any infectious complications, she is feeling well and is satisfied with the quality of her life. The consequences of the renal insufficiency are under control, systemic lupus erythematosus is, with a low dose of corticosteroids, in a steady state, malnutrition is corrected, but there is still hypoalbuminemia noted.
34952810	Improving the diagnostic approach to celiac disease: Experience from a regional network.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is still underestimated. To close this diagnostic gap, the Health Sicilian Authorities have constituted the "Sicilian Network for CD". AIMS: A) To verify the quality of the current diagnostic approach using the data sheet of the Network. B) To evaluate the clinical, serologic and histologic data of new diagnoses in the context of the Network METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the data collection forms of 369 patients with CD from three Centers within the Sicilian Network. All the Centers used a standard data collection form. RESULTS: A non-classical CD presentation was more frequent than the classical one, anemia being the most frequent symptom (50%). An IBS-like presentation was found in one third of the cases. A diagnostic delay of about 9 years following the onset of symptoms was observed. Almost half of the patients had not undergone multiple duodenal biopsies; unrecommended CD serology assays were prescribed in 59.9% of the cases. CONCLUSIONS: The regional data sheets allowed an assessment of the diagnostic delay. We recorded a frequent use of unrecommended tests prescribed before referring patients to the regional Centers. Updating the education of physicians regarding CD is necessary to avoid unwarranted health expenditure.
34628462	Treatment-Refractory, Primary Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura in a Patient with Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is primarily caused by antibody-mediated destruction of platelets. Alterations in immune homeostasis can induce loss of peripheral tolerance and promote the development of self-reactive antibodies. Primary ITP is the diagnosis of exclusion made after the extensive work-up rules out other possible causes of thrombocytopenia. The association between the ITP and other autoimmune disorders is well-established. In recent years, increasing attention has been directed toward the association between celiac disease (CD) and ITP. CASE REPORT A 27-year-old man with a history of primary ITP presented with an occasional nosebleed, 1 episode of rectal bleeding, and easy bruising. The patient was later found to have high titers of TTG-IGA and endomysial IGA levels consistent with CD. Our patient not only failed to improve with the gluten-free diet, but also failed multiple lines of treatment including steroids, IVIG, rituximab, eltrombopag, and even a non-traditional treatment for ITP (azathioprine and plasma exchange). The patient's CD-related antibody titers remained elevated. CONCLUSIONS It is possible that in certain cases the alteration of immune response caused by CD with a concurrent elevation of CD-related antibodies can make ITP refractory to all medical management. Whether or not this refractoriness to treatment is related to the persistently elevated antibody titers of CD or unknown genetic relationship between ITP and CD remains not entirely clear and warrants further molecular, immunologic, and genetic analysis.
21292306	Gluten-dependent enteropathy and atypical human leukocyte antigen alleles.	The risk for developing celiac disease is associated with the major histocompatibility complex class II human leukocyte antigen DQ2 and DQ8. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 127 consecutive cases of adult-onset celiac disease evaluated at a single United States center to determine the distribution of the associated human leukocyte antigen DQA1 and DQB1 alleles. The median patient age of diagnosis was 41 (range, 16-81) years. Ninety-five adults underwent human leukocyte antigen DQ typing. Eighty patients were DQ2 positive, 24 were DQ8 positive, and 11 were DQ2 and DQ8 positive. Four patients carried the uncommon, low-risk haplotype DQ2.2 (DQA1*02 and DQB1*02) without DQA1*05. Two patients did not carry human leukocyte antigen DQ2 or DQ8. All of the patients with atypical human leukocyte antigen DQ responded to a gluten-free diet. Although the majority of patients carry the human leukocyte antigen DQ2 or DQ8, gluten-dependent enteropathy periodically presents in adults with low-risk alleles.
30477107	Probiotics in Celiac Disease.	Recently, the interest in the human microbiome and its interplay with the host has exploded and provided new insights on its role in conferring host protection and regulating host physiology, including the correct development of immunity. However, in the presence of microbial imbalance and particular genetic settings, the microbiome may contribute to the dysfunction of host metabolism and physiology, leading to pathogenesis and/or the progression of several diseases. Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic autoimmune enteropathy triggered by dietary gluten exposure in genetically predisposed individuals. Despite ascertaining that gluten is the trigger in CD, evidence has indicated that intestinal microbiota is somehow involved in the pathogenesis, progression, and clinical presentation of CD. Indeed, several studies have reported imbalances in the intestinal microbiota of patients with CD that are mainly characterized by an increased abundance of Bacteroides spp. and a decrease in Bifidobacterium spp. The evidence that some of these microbial imbalances still persist in spite of a strict gluten-free diet and that celiac patients suffering from persistent gastrointestinal symptoms have a desert gut microbiota composition further support its close link with CD. All of this evidence gives rise to the hypothesis that probiotics might play a role in this condition. In this review, we describe the recent scientific evidences linking the gut microbiota in CD, starting from the possible role of microbes in CD pathogenesis, the attempt to define a microbial signature of disease, the effect of a gluten-free diet and host genetic assets regarding microbial composition to end in the exploration of the proof of concept of probiotic use in animal models to the most recent clinical application of selected probiotic strains.
26714791	Diet adherence and gluten exposure in coeliac disease and self-reported non-coeliac gluten sensitivity.	BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Adherence to gluten-free diet in self reported non-coeliac gluten sensitive subjects is scarcely researched. Objectives of the study were to compare dietary adherence in coeliac disease (CD) subjects and in non-coeliac gluten sensitive (NCGS) subjects, and to estimate gluten exposure based on weighed food records and analysis of gluten content in selected food items. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Twenty-three subjects with biopsy verified CD on a gluten-free diet and 34 HLA-DQ2+ NCGS subjects on a self-instituted gluten-free diet were enrolled. The latter group was under investigation of CD. Dietary adherence was assessed by frequency questionnaire and structured forms supplied by weighed food records. For the analyses of food samples, the sandwich R5-ELISA, Ridascreen  Gliadin competitive method was used. RESULTS: There was no difference in dietary adherence between CD and NCGS subjects (83% vs 68%, p = 0.21). NCGS subjects were mainly self-educated in gluten-free diet compared to CD subjects (91% and 39%, respectively, p < 0.001). In non-adherent subjects, there was no difference in gluten exposure between CD and NCGS (10 vs 138 mg/day, p = 0.83). There was no difference in BMR-factor between CD and NCGS subjects, or between adherent and non-adherent subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Both CD and NCGS subjects were largely adherent, and adherence did not differ between the groups. Gluten exposure varied greatly, and some CD and NCGS subjects reached gluten intake above 500 mg/day, which might have considerable health effects on the individual, especially in case of coeliac disease.
34526700	Society for the Study of Celiac Disease position statement on gaps and opportunities in coeliac disease.	Progress has been made in understanding coeliac disease, a relatively frequent and underappreciated immune-mediated condition that occurs in genetically predisposed individuals. However, several gaps remain in knowledge related to diagnosis and management. The gluten-free diet, currently the only available management, is not curative or universally effective (some adherent patients have ongoing duodenal injury). Unprecedented numbers of emerging therapies, including some with novel tolerogenic mechanisms, are currently being investigated in clinical trials. In March 2020, the Celiac Disease Foundation and the Society for the Study of Celiac Disease convened a consensus workshop to identify high-yield areas of research that should be prioritized. Workshop participants included leading experts in clinical practice, academia, government and pharmaceutical development, as well as representatives from patient support groups in North America. This Roadmap summarizes key advances in the field of coeliac disease and provides information on important discussions from the consensus approach to address gaps and opportunities related to the pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of coeliac disease. The morbidity of coeliac disease is often underestimated, which has led to an unmet need to improve the management of these patients. Expanded research funding is needed as coeliac disease is a potentially curable disease.
31337023	Nutritional Deficiencies in Children with Celiac Disease Resulting from a Gluten-Free Diet: A Systematic Review.	BACKGROUND: A strictly gluten-free diet (GFD) is the basis for managing celiac disease (CD). Numerous studies have reported nutritional deficiencies/imbalances ascribable to a GFD. The aim of this review is to describe nutritional deficiencies observed in children with celiac disease on a GFD, to discuss the clinical consequences related to these nutritional imbalances, and to identify strategies that may be adopted to treat them. METHODS: We reviewed the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases between January 1998 and January 2019. RESULTS: Children are, regardless of whether they are on a gluten-free diet or not, at risk of consuming too much fat and insufficient fiber, iron, vitamin D, and calcium. These imbalances may be exacerbated when children are on a gluten-free diet. In particular, the intake of folate, magnesium, zinc, and foods with a high glycemic index in children with CD who are on a GFD is significantly altered. CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic protocols should include nutritional education to help teach subjects affected by disorders such as CD the importance of labels, the choice of foods, and the combination of macro- and micronutrients. Children with CD on a GFD should be encouraged to rotate pseudo-cereals, consume gluten-free commercial products that have been fortified or enriched, and use foods that are local and naturally gluten-free.
27154884	Navigating Gluten-Related Health Disorders and Nutritional Considerations of Gluten-Free Diets.	There are myriad reasons why individuals choose to follow a gluten-free diet, which continues to be a pervasive nutrition trend. This commentary includes a discussion of the most common reasons that patients choose gluten-free foods, including celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity. 
30817868	Compliance with gluten-free diet in a selected group of celiac children in the Slovak Republic.	OBJECTIVE: Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic long-term disease with autoimmune disorder connected to an allergic reaction to the molecule of gluten. CD is manifested in persons who are genetically predisposed. The only therapy for CD is a strong gluten-free (GF) diet. The aim of our study was to follow the adherence to the gluten-free diet in the selected group of parents and caregivers of children with CD, and to compare factors influencing the adherence to GF diet and therefore influencing also clinical symptoms of CD. We compared and examined important food-related activities as well, by using a personal questionnaire in the group of CD children's parents or caregivers. METHODS: We designed a cross-sectional study; 325 parents or caregivers of children with CD were recruited in the sample. CD was confirmed by the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) criteria. The anonymous questionnaires were collected at summer camps within period data 2012-2016 and followed factors which might have an influence on compliance with GF diet, according to parents' opinions. RESULTS: Adherence to GF diet was statistically significantly higher among girls compared to boys. Parents' questionnaires confirmed that younger group of children and children with the family history of CD had statistically higher compliance with GF diet. Parents with higher education confirmed better adherence to GF diet, statistical analyses confirmed higher adherence in mother s education compared to father's education. Duration of CD, socio-demographic factors of parents - age of parent, gender of parent, and residency were not statistically significant in terms of compliance with the diet. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed important factors influencing adherence to the GF diet, which are connected to the symptoms and consequences of CD. The assessment of parents' opinions and burden on the families of children with celiac disease should be also reflected in the evaluation of patient's status. Important is also the role of parents in order to facilitate and support clinical interventions and prevention of CD.
24806736	Current status of drugs in development for celiac disease.	INTRODUCTION: Gluten is the main trigger for celiac disease, and the current treatment is based on its elimination from the diet. Although the symptoms usually disappear during the diet, it is restrictive and difficult to maintain. Further, despite a strict treatment the small-bowel mucosal damage does now always heal. Consequently, adherence is often poor and new treatment approaches are needed. With an increased understanding of the disease pathogenesis, several novel treatments have been suggested, and some of them have already entered Phase II clinical trials. AREAS COVERED: This article reviews the latest status of the drugs in development for celiac disease. The article focuses mainly on synthetic drugs currently entering in clinical trials. EXPERT OPINION: It is anticipated that some of the treatments under investigation will soon enter Phase III clinical trials, although challenges remain. For instance, histological studies are problematic in wide-scale clinical studies. On the other hand, the existing non-invasive serological methods and clinical outcome measures might be too insensitive for monitoring responses to the possible drug candidates. There is also no animal model which would accurately reflect celiac disease. Well-conducted basic and clinical research is required to develop better non-invasive surrogate markers and patient-related outcomes for future pharmacological studies.
23674375	Celiac disease in patients with type 1 diabetes: screening and diagnostic practices.	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate screening practices for celiac disease in patients with type 1 diabetes across North America. The research question investigated was whether diabetes centers screen for celiac disease in type 1 diabetes more frequently than other facilities. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A survey with 27 questions on screening practices for celiac disease in patients with type 1 diabetes was designed by experts in celiac disease and diabetes. Surveys were sent by email to diabetes educators and dietitians throughout the United States and Canada between December 2010 and May 2011. RESULTS: There were 514 respondents from 484 endocrine clinics, diabetes clinics, private practices, community nutrition centers, and inpatient centers. Thirty-five percent of work locations screened for celiac disease, with endocrine clinics reporting screening at the highest frequency (80%). Tissue transglutaminase was the most common screening test used. The most frequently recommended treatment of confirmed celiac disease was a gluten-free diet. However, only 71% of respondents recommended biopsy in patients with positive serologies. Most respondents (55.3%) reported that the gluten-free diet resulted in symptom improvement in the majority of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Staff at endocrine clinics were more likely to suggest screening for celiac disease in patients with type 1 diabetes. Both low screening frequency as well as inconsistency in management of positive celiac disease serological tests indicated an increase in education regarding celiac disease in patients with type 1 diabetes is required. In addition uniform guidelines should be developed.
37316859	Identifying and validating the educational needs to develop a Celiac Self-Care System.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is a major public health problem in many countries, including Iran. Considering the disease's exponential spread throughout the world and its risk factors, identifying the educational priorities and minimum data required to control and treat the disease is of great significance. METHODS: The present study was conducted in two phases in 2022. In the first phase, a questionnaire was developed based on the information obtained from a review of the literature. Later, the questionnaire was administered to 12 pundits in the fields of nutrition (n = 5), internal medicine (n = 4), and gastroenterology (n = 3). As a result, the necessary and important educational content was determined for developing the Celiac Self-Care System. RESULTS: According to the experts' viewpoints, the educational needs of patients were classified into nine categories of demographic information, clinical information, long-term complications, comorbidity, tests, medications, dietary recommendations, general recommendations, technical capabilities as well as 105 subcategories. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the increased prevalence of Celiac disease and the lack of an established minimum set of data, determining the required educational information is of great importance at the national level. Such information could be useful in implementing educational health programs to raise the public level of awareness. In the field of education, such contents can be employed in planning new technology based on mobile phones (mobile health), preparing registries, and producing widely used content.
26692164	Design of a dietary intervention to assess the impact of a gluten-free diet in a population with type 1 Diabetes and Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND: Celiac Disease occurs at a 5-10 fold greater prevalence in patients with type-1 diabetes (T1D), despite this increased risk, there is limited objective evidence regarding the impact of a Gluten-Free Diet (GFD) in the large proportion of asymptomatic (30-70%) patients with both autoimmune diseases. Given the requirements and intricacies inherent to each condition, we describe the rationale and design a dietary curriculum specifically addressing the educational requirements for children and adults with CD and diabetes as part of the CD-DIET Study. METHODS AND DESIGN: The CD-DIET Study (Celiac Disease and Diabetes - Dietary Intervention and Evaluation Trial) is a multicenter randomized controlled trial aimed at evaluating the safety and efficacy of a GFD in patients with asymptomatic celiac disease and T1D on key diabetes and patient-centered outcomes. DISCUSSION: Key dietary components of the trial include a description and evaluation of food consumption patterns including glycemic index and glycemic load, novel assessments of gluten quantification, and objective and subjective measures of GFD adherence. This dietary curriculum will establish rigorous guidelines to assess adherence and facilitate evaluation of a GFD on metabolic control, bone health and patient quality of life in patients with CD and diabetes. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01566110. Date of Registration: March, 2012.
24206414	Fulminant type 1 autoimmune hepatitis in a recently diagnosed celiac disease patient.	Celiac disease (CD) is a small intestine immune-mediated disorder triggered by gluten ingestion in genetically predisposed patients. This condition can also affect many extraintestinal tissues, including the liver. We report a patient presenting with a marked increase of transaminases at diagnosis of CD. The immune markers for autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) were negative. Following a few months of a strict gluten-free diet (GFD), aminotransferase levels decreased significantly (< 2.5x U/L). The response to GFD suggested that the liver damage was due to a gluten-dependent celiac hepatitis, the most common liver abnormality in CD. Despite the fact that the patient never stopped the GFD, yet, in a few months, the aminotransferase levels raise again to high values (> 50x U/L). At this time, the liver autoantibodies turned to be positive thus confirming the development of a type 1 AIH. The hepatic damage progressed to a late onset liver failure requiring liver transplantation. 
32983117	Commentary: Gut Antibody Deficiency in a Mouse Model of CVID Results in Spontaneous Development of a Gluten-Sensitive Enteropathy.	
21560646	[Treatment and prevention of gluten-sensitive celiac disease].	In this article presented results of examination and treatment of 207 patients with glutensensitive celiac disease. And also you can find comprehensive method for the treatment of patients with varying severity of disease. The fundamental method of therapy glutensensitive celiac disease is strict lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD), which eliminated protein cereal--gluten contained in wheat, rye and barley. Recently, there is large number of products which include the "hidden gluten". Its elimination from the diet of GFD is mandatory for patients with celiac disease. In the presence of diarrhea and malabsorption syndrome are used adsorbents, astringents, enzymes, intestinal antiseptic, probiotics. With the purpose of correction of metabolic disorders intravenous electrolyte mixture containing potassium, calcium and magnesium. To eliminate protein deficiency drugs used solid protein mixture of pure amino acids, gluten-free mixes for enteral feeding. Clinical examination of patients with celiac disease is aimed at monitoring compliance with GFD, early detection of cancer, autoimmune and other related diseases.
29387990	Hypervigilance to a Gluten-Free Diet and Decreased Quality of Life in Teenagers and Adults with Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Avoidance of gluten is critical for individuals with celiac disease (CD), but there is also concern that "extreme vigilance" to a strict gluten-free diet may increase symptoms such as anxiety and fatigue, and therefore, lower quality of life (QOL). We examined the associations of QOL with energy levels and adherence to, and knowledge about, a gluten-free diet. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional prospective study of 80 teenagers and adults, all with biopsy-confirmed CD, living in a major metropolitan area. QOL was assessed with CD-specific measures. Dietary vigilance was based on 24-h recalls and an interview. Knowledge was based on a food label quiz. Open-ended questions described facilitators and barriers to maintaining a gluten-free diet. RESULTS: The extremely vigilant adults in our sample had significantly lower QOL scores than their less vigilant counterparts [(mean (SD): 64.2 (16.0) vs 77.2 (12.2), p = 0.004]. Extreme vigilance was also associated with greater knowledge [5.7 (0.7) vs 5.1 (0.8), p = 0.035]. Adults with lower energy levels had significantly lower overall QOL scores than adults with higher energy levels [68.0 (13.6) vs 78.9 (13.0), p = 0.006]. Patterns were similar for teenagers. Cooking at home and using internet sites and apps were prevalent strategies used by the hypervigilant to maintain a strict gluten-free diet. Eating out was particularly problematic. CONCLUSION: There are potential negative consequences of hypervigilance to a strict gluten-free diet. Clinicians must consider the importance of concurrently promoting both dietary adherence and social and emotional well-being for individuals with CD.
30029702	How to improve the gluten-free diet: The state of the art from a food science perspective.	The celiac disease is the most common food intolerance and its prevalence is increasing. Consequently, use of gluten-free diet has expanded, notwithstanding consumption as therapy for other gluten-related disorders or by wellbeing people without any medical prescription. Even the therapeutic efficiency has undoubtedly proven, several drawbacks mainly regarding the compliance, nutritional deficits and related diseases, and the alteration of the intestinal microbiota have described in the literature. Food science has been considered as one of the primary area of intervention to limit or eliminate such drawbacks. Efforts have approached shelf life, rheology and palatability aspects but more recently have mainly focused to improve the nutritional features of the gluten-free diet, and to propose dietary alternatives. The sourdough fermentation has shown the most promising results, also including a biotechnology strategy that has allowed the complete degradation of gluten prior to consumption.
33435615	Gliadin Sequestration as a Novel Therapy for Celiac Disease: A Prospective Application for Polyphenols.	Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder characterized by a heightened immune response to gluten proteins in the diet, leading to gastrointestinal symptoms and mucosal damage localized to the small intestine. Despite its prevalence, the only treatment currently available for celiac disease is complete avoidance of gluten proteins in the diet. Ongoing clinical trials have focused on targeting the immune response or gluten proteins through methods such as immunosuppression, enhanced protein degradation and protein sequestration. Recent studies suggest that polyphenols may elicit protective effects within the celiac disease milieu by disrupting the enzymatic hydrolysis of gluten proteins, sequestering gluten proteins from recognition by critical receptors in pathogenesis and exerting anti-inflammatory effects on the system as a whole. This review highlights mechanisms by which polyphenols can protect against celiac disease, takes a critical look at recent works and outlines future applications for this potential treatment method.
38873319	Associations between special diet and incidence risk of osteoporosis: a Mendelian randomization study.	Introduction: Osteoporosis is a prevalent challenge in clinical orthopedics, affecting a significant percentage of individuals aged 50 and above. The goal of this study was to comprehensively understand the relationships between a specialized dietary regimen and the risk of developing osteoporosis. Methods: This study employed extensive genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics derived from the UK Biobank. It encompassed 8 kinds of special diets and 7 datasets pertaining to osteoporosis and associated symptoms. The principal analytical approach employed was the inverse-variance weighted method. Additionally, sensitivity analysis was employed to elucidate the diverse multiplicity patterns observed in the final model. Results: Our results showed that there is significant evidence that a gluten-free diet is associated with osteoporosis [odds ratio (OR): 1.080, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.048-1.112, p = 4.23E-07)]. Furthermore, there exists a suggestive link between the three distinct dietary approaches and osteoporosis [(OR: 0.949, 95%CI: 0.929-0.970, p = 3.00E-06) for comprehensive consumption; (OR: 1.053, 95%CI: 1.018-1.089, p = 2.23E-03) for abstaining from wheat consumption; (OR: 1.036, 95%CI: 1.005-1.068, p = 1.97E-02) for abstaining from sugar consumption]. No additional correlation between the special dietary regimens and osteoporosis has been observed. Conclusion: Our research has uncovered a notable correlation between a gluten-free diet and the occurrence of osteoporosis. Furthermore, it exerts a promoting influence on the onset of osteoporosis, which stands in direct contradiction to the therapeutic principles for Celiac Disease's complications. As such, a novel association among these three elements is postulated.
27130911	Innate and adaptive immunity in self-reported nonceliac gluten sensitivity versus celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: Immune mechanisms have been implicated in nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), a condition characterized by intestinal and/or extraintestinal symptoms caused by the ingestion of gluten in non-celiac/non-wheat allergic individuals. AIMS: We investigated innate and adaptive immunity in self-reported NCGS versus celiac disease (CD). METHODS: In the supernatants of ex vivo-cultured duodenal biopsies from 14 self-reported NCGS patients, 9 untreated and 10 treated CD patients, and 12 controls we detected innate cytokines - interleukin (IL)-15, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-12p70, IL-23, IL-27, IL-32alpha, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), IFN-alpha-, adaptive cytokines - interferon (IFN)-gamma, IL-17A, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13-, chemokines - IL-8, CCL1, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CXCL1, CXCL10-, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). RESULTS: Mucosal innate and adaptive cytokines, chemokines and growth factors did not differ between self-reported NCGS, treated CD and controls. On the contrary, IL-6, IL-15, IL-27, IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-17A, IL-23, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-8, CCL1 and CCL4 were significantly higher in untreated CD than in self-reported NCGS, treated CD and controls, while TSLP was significantly lower in untreated CD than in self-reported NCGS, treated CD and controls. CONCLUSION: In our hands, patients with self-reported NCGS showed no abnormalities of the mucosal immune response.
27633005	Improved Quantitation of Gluten in Wheat Starch for Celiac Disease Patients by Gel-Permeation High-Performance Liquid Chromatography with Fluorescence Detection (GP-HPLC-FLD).	Purified wheat starch (WSt) is commonly used in gluten-free products for celiac disease (CD) patients. It is mostly well-tolerated, but doubts about its safety for CD patients persist. One reason may be that most ELISA kits primarily recognize the alcohol-soluble gliadin fraction of gluten, but insufficiently target the alcohol-insoluble glutenin fraction. To address this problem, a new sensitive method based on the sequential extraction of gliadins, glutenins, and gluten from WSt followed by gel-permeation high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (GP-HPLC-FLD) was developed. It revealed that considerable amounts of glutenins were present in most WSt. The gluten contents quantitated by GP-HPLC-FLD as sum of gliadins and glutenins were higher than those by R5 ELISA (gluten as gliadin content multiplied by a factor of 2) in 19 out of 26 WSt. Despite its limited selectivity, GP-HPLC-FLD may be applied as confirmatory method to ELISA to quantitate gluten in WSt.
27678407	Association Between Celiac Disease and Asthma.	
22516775	[Effects of elimination diets on bone metabolism in children and adolescents with phenylketonuria, galactosemia and celiac disease].	Phenylketonuria, galactosemia and celiac disease are disorders in which elimination diets are the only known therapy, which reverses many clinical manifestations of acute phase in the patients. Unfortunately, most of them develop long-term complications, including bone turnover impairment and low bone mineral density. These disturbances are not only observed in adulthood but also in childhood and adolescence. Insufficient accumulation of peak bone mass in these periods is a risk factor for osteoporosis and fractures in later life. The pathological mechanisms leading to a diminished bone mineral content in these disorders are not well known. The patients might be at risk for a decreased bone mineral content because of either dietary deficiencies secondary to the elimination diets and/or unknown intrinsic factors. This article overviews bone metabolism disturbances in phenylketonuria, galactosemia and celiac disease during childhood and adolescence, when growth and bone turnover are most intensive. The available data and own results concerning bone markers in children with these disorders and proposal for the prevention of osteoporosis in pediatric patients treated with elimination diets are discussed.
28866981	Carpal spasm in a girl as initial presentation of celiac disease: a case report.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is an immune-mediated disorder elicited by ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible persons. This disorder is characterized by specific histological changes of the small intestine mucosa resulting in malabsorption. This case was written up as it was an unusual and dramatic presentation of celiac disease. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 3-year-old Albanian girl who presented at our clinic with carpal spasms and hand paresthesia. A physical examination at admission revealed a relatively good general condition and body weight of 10.5 kg (10 percentile). Carpal spasms and paresthesias of her extremities were present. Neuromuscular irritability was demonstrated by positive Chvostek and Trousseau signs. Blood tests showed severe hypocalcemia with a total serum calcium of 1.2 mmol/L (normal range 2.12 to 2.55 mmol/L), ionized calcium of 0.87 (normal range 1.11 to 1.30 mmol/L), and 24-hour urine calcium excretion of 9.16 mmol (normal range female <6.2 mmol/day). Among other tests, screening for celiac disease was performed: antigliadin immunoglobulin A, anti-tissue transglutaminase, and anti-endomysial immunoglobulin A antibodies were positive. A duodenal biopsy revealed lymphocyte infiltration, crypt hyperplasia, and villous atrophy compatible with celiac disease grade IIIb according to the Marsh classification. Following the diagnosis of celiac disease, human leukocyte antigen typing was performed, giving a definite diagnosis of celiac disease. She was started on a gluten-free diet. Due to failure to follow a gluten-free diet, episodes of carpal spasms appeared again. Unfortunately, at the age of 7 years she presents with delayed psychophysical development. CONCLUSIONS: Although hypocalcemia is a common finding in celiac disease, hypocalcemic carpal spasm is a rare initial manifestation of the disease. Therefore, the possibility of celiac disease should be considered in patients with repeated carpal spasms that seem unduly difficult to treat. This should be evaluated even in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms since hypocalcemia and its manifestation may present as initial symptoms of celiac disease even in young children.
26197336	Self-Reported Prevalence of Symptomatic Adverse Reactions to Gluten and Adherence to Gluten-Free Diet in an Adult Mexican Population.	The prevalence of symptomatic adverse reactions to gluten and adherence to gluten-free diet in Latin American countries is unknown. These measurements are strongly linked to gluten-related disorders. This work aimed to estimate the prevalence of adverse reactions to oral gluten and the adherence to gluten-free diet in the adult Mexican population. To reach this aim, a self-administered questionnaire was designed and tested for clarity/comprehension and reproducibility. Then, a self-administered questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was conducted in the Mexican population. The estimated prevalence rates were (95% CI): 11.9% (9.9-13.5) and 7.8 (6.4-9.4) for adverse and recurrent adverse reactions to gluten respectively; adherence to gluten-free diet 3.7% (2.7-4.8), wheat allergy 0.72% (0.38-1.37); celiac disease 0.08% (0.01-0.45), and NCGS 0.97% (0.55-1.68). Estimated pooled prevalence of self-reported physician-diagnosis of gluten-related disorders was 0.88% (0.49-1.5), and 93.3% respondents reported adherence to gluten-free diet without a physician-diagnosis of gluten-related disorders. Symptom comparisons between those who reported recurrent adverse reactions to gluten and other foods showed statistically significant differences for bloating, constipation, and tiredness (p < 0.05). Gluten-related disorders may be underdiagnosed in the Mexican population and most people adhering to a gluten-free diet are doing it without proper diagnostic work-up of these disorders, and probably without medical/dietician advice. 
31590358	The Gut Microbiota in Celiac Disease and probiotics.	Celiac disease (CeD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy, and unique in that the specific trigger is known: gluten. The current mainstay of therapy is a gluten-free diet (GFD). As novel therapies are being developed, complementary strategies are also being studied, such as modulation of the gut microbiome. The gut microbiota is involved in the initiation and perpetuation of intestinal inflammation in several chronic diseases. Intestinal dysbiosis has been reported in CeD patients, untreated or treated with GFD, compared to healthy subjects. Several studies have identified differential bacterial populations associated with CeD patients and healthy subjects. However, it is still not clear if intestinal dysbiosis is the cause or effect of CeD. Probiotics have also been considered as a strategy to modulate the gut microbiome to an anti-inflammatory state. However, there is a paucity of data to support their use in treating CeD. Further studies are needed with therapeutic microbial formulations combined with human trials on the use of probiotics to treat CeD by restoring the gut microbiome to an anti-inflammatory state.
25187315	Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma and thymic stromal lymphopoietin are involved in the pathophysiology of childhood coeliac disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic autoimmune enteropathy caused by exposure to dietary gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. The transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) was shown to exert protective effects in several immune-mediated disorders. Activation of PPARgamma suppressed the expression of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), an inducer of proinflammatory cytokines. Since the role of TSLP in gluten-sensitive enteropathy is completely unknown, we investigated the involvement of TSLP and its regulator PPARgamma in childhood CD. We collected duodenal biopsy specimens from 19 children with newly diagnosed CD, 6 children with treated CD (gluten-free diet, GFD), and 10 controls. Expression of mRNA and protein levels of PPARgamma, TSLP, and TSLP receptor were determined by real-time RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. Duodenal localization of PPARgamma and TSLP was studied by immunohistochemistry. In duodenal mucosa of children with CD, the amount of PPARgamma was significantly lower and simultaneously that of TSLP significantly higher compared to controls (p < 0.05). In GFD-treated patients, the levels of PPARgamma mRNA and protein were significantly higher while that of TSLP markedly lower compared to newly diagnosed CD (p < 0.05). Immunohistochemistry revealed PPARgamma and TSLP expression in lamina propria immune cells and in enterocytes. Low expression of PPARgamma and high expression of TSLP in the duodenal mucosa of children with newly diagnosed CD suggest that they are involved in the pathophysiology of CD. We hypothesize that PPARgamma may be an inhibitory regulator of TSLP-stimulated inflammatory processes in CD.

32751379	Dietary Gluten and Neurodegeneration: A Case for Preclinical Studies.	Although celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease that primarily involves the intestinal tract, mounting evidence suggests that a sizeable number of patients exhibit neurological deficits. About 40% of the celiac patients with neurological manifestations have circulating antibodies against neural tissue transglutaminase-6 (tTG6). While early diagnosis and strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) have been recommended to prevent neurological dysfunction, better therapeutic strategies are needed to improve the overall quality of life. Dysregulation of the microbiota-gut-brain axis, presence of anti-tTG6 antibodies, and epigenetic mechanisms have been implicated in the pathogenesis. It is also possible that circulating or gut-derived extracellular structures and including biomolecular condensates and extracellular vesicles contribute to disease pathogenesis. There are several avenues for shaping the dysregulated gut homeostasis in individuals with CD, non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) and/or neurodegeneration. In addition to GFD and probiotics, nutraceuticals, such as phyto and synthetic cannabinoids, represent a new approach that could shape the host microbiome towards better prognostic outcomes. Finally, we provide a data-driven rationale for potential future pre-clinical research involving non-human primates (NHPs) to investigate the effect of nutraceuticals, such as phyto and synthetic cannabinoids, either alone or in combination with GFD to prevent/mitigate dietary gluten-induced neurodegeneration.
37375589	Assessment of Nutritional Status by Bioelectrical Impedance in Adult Patients with Celiac Disease: A Prospective Single-Center Study.	The gluten-free diet [GFD] has been linked to an increased risk of weight gain and the development of metabolic disorders. Most of the studies have focused on the effect of GFD on the Body Mass Index [BMI]. We aimed to evaluate the nutritional status using specific nutritional parameters in patients with celiac disease [CeD] at diagnosis and on a GFD compared to healthy controls. We recruited subjects at our outpatient clinic at the University of Padua. We collected demographic and clinical data and values obtained with bioelectrical impedance analysis. A total of 24 CeD patients and 28 healthy controls were enrolled. CeD patients at diagnosis had a lower body cell mass index [BCMI, p = 0.006], fat-free mass index [FFMI, p = 0.02], appendicular skeletal muscle index [ASMI, p = 0.02], and phase angle [PA] [p < 0.001] compared to controls. Their percentage of extracellular water [ECW] was also higher [p < 0.001]. Considering CeD patients after GFD, nutritional status significantly improved after 6 months of GFD. We did not observe differences in BMI among groups [p = ns]. CeD patients at diagnosis were found to have a poorer nutritional status than healthy controls, with a positive effect of the GFD on their nutritional status, underlining the inefficacy of evaluating this aspect through only BMI evaluation.
21105201	Erythrocytic transglutaminase inhibition hemolysis at presentation of celiac disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is a common autoimmune condition. Previously it was considered to be a rare childhood disorder, but is actually considered a relatively common condition, present at any age, which may have multiple complications and manifestations. Hematological disorders of the disease are not uncommon. Among these disorders, the most frequently reported are anemias as a result of iron deficiency, often associated with folate and/or B12 deficiency. Anemias caused by hemolysis are very rarely reported in celiac patients. An 11-year-old girl with a previous uneventful medical history presented with severe hemolytic anemia. Hemolysis was Coombs negative, accompanied by inappropriate low reticulocyte count, despite exaggerated bone marrow hyperplasia of the erythroid precursors which showed normal maturation. Serology for recent infections, including Epstein-Barr virus, parvovirus B19, cytomegalovirus and mycoplasma, were all negative. Levels of serum IgA, IgG and IgM, were all within normal ranges for age. Screening for anti-DNA, antinuclear, antineutrophil cytoplasmic, antimicrosomal, antithyroglobulin, and antimitochondrial antibodies and lupus anticoagulants, was negative. She was also negative for human immunodeficiency virus. Conventional therapy with corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin failed. CD was serendipitously discovered upon screening for anti-tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies. The disease was confirmed by biopsy of the small intestine mucosa. The patient recovered with gluten-free diet. A unique case of CD is presented. CD should be serologically screened in each patient with Coombs negative "immune" hemolytic anemia, particularly if accompanied by "reticulocytopenia". A new hemolytic mechanism and very speculative explanation for "reticulocytopenia" are discussed.
29275927	E-Healthcare for Celiac Disease-A Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the (cost-)effectiveness of online consultations in follow-up of patients with celiac disease (CD). STUDY DESIGN: Multicenter randomized, controlled trial involving 304 patients aged <=25 years with CD for >=1 year, randomized to an online (n = 156) or outpatient consultation (n = 148). An online consultation included questionnaires for symptom and growth measurement. Antitransglutaminase-type-2 antibodies were determined using a point-of-care (POC) test. Controls had a traditional consultation with antitransglutaminase-type-2 antibodies testing in laboratories. Both groups completed questionnaires concerning CD-specific health-related quality of life (HRQOL), gluten-free diet adherence, and patient satisfaction. Six months later, participants repeated HRQOL and patient satisfaction questionnaires and the POC test. The primary outcome was anti-transglutaminase-type-2 antibodies after 6 months, and the secondary outcomes were health problems, dietary adherence, HRQOL, patient satisfaction, and costs. RESULTS: The performance of the POC test was inferior to laboratory testing (2/156 positive POC tests vs 13/148 positive laboratory tests; P = .003). Health problems were detected significantly more frequently using online consultation. The detection of growth problems and dietary transgressions was similar. HRQOL (from 1 [good] to 5 [poor]) improved after online consultation (from 3.25 to 3.16 [P = .013] vs controls from 3.10 to 3.23; P = .810). Patient satisfaction (from 1 [low] to 10 [high]) was 7.6 (online) vs 8.0 (controls; P = .001); 58% wished to continue online consultations. Mean costs per participant during the studied period were $202 less for the online group (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The primary outcome could not be tested because the POC test was unreliable. Nevertheless, our results indicate that online consultations for children and young adults with CD are cost saving, increase CD-specific HRQOL, and are satisfactory for the majority.

34201435	New Insights into Non-Dietary Treatment in Celiac Disease: Emerging Therapeutic Options.	To date, the only treatment for celiac disease (CD) consists of a strict lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD), which has numerous limitations in patients with CD. For this reason, dietary transgressions are frequent, implying intestinal damage and possible long-term complications. There is an unquestionable need for non-dietary alternatives to avoid damage by involuntary contamination or voluntary dietary transgressions. In recent years, different therapies and treatments for CD have been developed and studied based on the degradation of gluten in the intestinal lumen, regulation of the immune response, modulation of intestinal permeability, and induction of immunological tolerance. In this review, therapeutic lines for CD are evaluated with special emphasis on phase III and II clinical trials, some of which have promising results.
21502996	Gluten-sensitive hypertransaminasemia in celiac disease: an infrequent and often subclinical finding.	OBJECTIVES: Earlier studies suggest that 40-50% of untreated celiac disease patients have elevated transaminase levels. Celiac disease can also be the underlying reason for unexplained hypertransaminasemia or even liver failure. We investigated the prevalence and gluten dependency of hypertransaminasemia in celiac patients also diagnosed with minor or atypical symptoms. METHODS: In the cross-sectional study, serum aspartate (AST) and alanine (ALT) transaminase levels were measured in 313 untreated and 339 treated adult celiac patients and 237 non-celiac controls. In the prospective part, transaminase levels were investigated in 130 celiac patients at diagnosis and after 1 year on a gluten-free diet and in 25 treated celiac patients in clinical remission before and after gluten challenge. RESULTS: The proportion of subjects with elevated serum AST values in the untreated celiac disease group (11%) did not differ significantly from that in the treated celiac disease (8%) or non-celiac control groups (9%) (P=0.587). Although the serum transaminase values were within normal range in the majority of untreated patients, initially normal liver enzyme levels decreased significantly on a gluten-free diet. In treated celiac disease, gluten challenge led to mild and transient hypertransaminasemia. CONCLUSIONS: In our area, where the prevalence of celiac disease is high, hypertransaminasemia is less frequent in untreated celiac disease patients than previously reported. The regular screening of transaminases in celiac disease needs to be re-evaluated. Although the liver enzyme levels were within the reference values in the majority of celiac patients, an obvious gluten dependence of transaminase levels was observed even in these subjects.
31129127	Gluten Does Not Induce Gastrointestinal Symptoms in Healthy Volunteers: A Double-Blind Randomized Placebo Trial.	
36961593	Nutrition and oral health in children with recently and previously diagnosed celiac disease.	OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the nutritional and oral health status of children with previously diagnosed celiac disease (CD) who follow a gluten-free diet and recently diagnosed CD patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Previously and recently diagnosed groups were formed from children with CD, aged 4 to 15 years. A questionnaire was completed about the children's dental history and nutritional and oral hygiene habits. All the children underwent an oral examination, and dmft-DMFT indices were determined. Dental plaque status, periodontal health, and dental enamel defects were recorded. Oral soft tissues were examined for the presence of lesions. Unstimulated salivary flow rate and pH value were evaluated. RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was determined between the previously and recently diagnosed patients in terms of toothpaste preference (p=0.003), frequency of going to the dentist (p=0.039), and the types of dental treatment they had received (p=0.001). A statistically significant difference was determined between the previously and recently diagnosed patient groups in terms of dmft values (p=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Children with CD should be directed to a pediatric dentist to improve oral and dental health, relieve the symptoms of oral mucosal lesions, be informed about enamel defects, and be encouraged to use gluten-free oral care products. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The collaboration of pediatric gastroenterologists and pediatric dentists can prevent the progression of oral symptoms in children with CD and eliminate long-term complications in terms of both oral health and multisystemic problems.
28475169	Alterations in serum levels of selected markers of oxidative imbalance in adult celiac patients with extraintestinal manifestations: a pilot study.	INTRODUCTION    Oxidative stress is considered to be one of the mechanisms responsible for gluten toxicity, but its role in celiac disease (CD) remains unclear. OBJECTIVES    The aim of the study was to evaluate oxidative imbalance in the pathomechanism of CD by determining the concentrations of nitric oxide (NO) and selected antioxidant parameters. PATIENTS AND METHODS    The study involved 197 adult patients: 53 patients with untreated active CD, 92 celiac patients on gluten-free diet (GFD), and 52 controls. The serum levels of antioxidants (uric acid, bilirubin, ferritin, albumin), celiac antibodies, NO, glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPx3), and vitamin E were measured. A histopathological study of duodenal biopsy was performed. RESULTS    Celiac patients had higher uric acid concentrations than controls (P <0.001). NO levels were higher in patients with active CD than in controls (P <0.01) and were correlated with the degree of mucosal damage (r2 = 0.04; P = 0.01). Vitamin E levels were decreased in celiac patients (P <0.01), and GPx3 activity was reduced in patients with active CD compared with controls (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS    Oxidative imbalance may be involved in the pathomechanism of CD in adults. GFD only partially reduces oxidative stress. Serum NO levels seem to be a marker of the effectiveness of treatment. Uric acid may act as an antioxidant in CD.
27747460	Non Celiac Gluten Sensitivity.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: A new syndrome responding to gluten-free diet and defined non-celiac gluten sensitivity entered the spectrum of gluten-related disorders, together with celiac disease and wheat allergy. However, its definition, prevalence, diagnosis, pathogenesis, treatment, and follow up are still controversial. The purpose of the review is to summarize the evidence and problems emerging from the current literature. RECENT FINDINGS: Direct implication of gluten in the onset of symptoms is often unproved as a low fermentable oligo-, di- and mono-saccharides and polyols diet or other components of cereals as wheat amylase trypsin inhibitor could be similarly involved. To date, no specific biomarkers or histological abnormalities confirm diagnosis, and only the self-reported response to gluten-free diet as well as a positive double blind placebo-gluten challenge characterizes these non-celiac, non-wheat allergic patients. Critical revision of published studies can offer practical indications in approaching this clinical topic and useful suggestions to standardize scientific researches.
24361466	Interleukin 15 and CD4+ T cells cooperate to promote small intestinal enteropathy in response to dietary antigen.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: CD4(+) T cells specific for dietary gluten and interleukin 15 (IL15) contribute to the pathogenesis of celiac disease. We investigated whether and how they interact to damage the intestine using mice that overexpress human IL15 in the intestinal epithelium and have CD4(+) T cells specific for ovalbumin, a dietary antigen. METHODS: We crossed mice with CD4(+) T cells specific for ovalbumin (OTII) with mice that overexpress human IL15 under an intestine-specific promoter (B6 x IL15Tge). The offspring (OTII x IL15Tge mice) received control or ovalbumin-containing diets until 3 months of age. Enteropathy was monitored by weight, ratio of villous:crypt length, and the number of intestinal lymphocytes. Phenotype, cytokine production, and degranulation of mucosal and spleen lymphocytes were analyzed by multicolor flow cytometry or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Regulatory T-cell function and CD8(+) T-cell activation were analyzed in co-culture assays. RESULTS: Exposure to ovalbumin reduced growth and led to enteropathy in OTII x IL15Tge mice but not in control OTII x B6 littermates. Enteropathy was associated with expansion of mucosal granzyme B(+) CD8(+) T cells, and developed despite increased frequency of functional ovalbumin-specific regulatory T cells. Ovalbumin-activated CD4(+) T cells secreted IL2, which along with IL15 stimulated expansion of noncognate intestinal cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells, which did not respond to regulatory T cells and induced epithelial damage. CONCLUSIONS: We observed that in mice given food antigen, cooperation between IL15 and CD4(+) T cells is necessary and sufficient to activate CD8(+) T cells and damage the small intestine. We propose that this process is involved in the development of celiac disease.
25697611	[Catching up on celiac disease].	Knowledge about celiac disease continues to grow and amaze those who investigate, seek and treat this condition. Gone are the days when it was considered just a rare child's digestive disease. It is now recognized as a highly prevalent autoimmune condition that affects children and adults with digestive and extra-digestive symptoms of diverse intensity, disorder that may be either mono, oligo or asymptomatic from a digestive point of view. Today, it is an underdiagnosed condition, not actively considered, and often mistakes are made regarding its diagnosis, treatment and gluten-free diet monitoring. This article reviews the current definition of the disease, clinical presentations, potential patients, how to search for the disease, how the diagnosis is made and characteristics of the treatment and monitoring of celiac patients, all based on internationally agreed standards, and emphasizing those aspects that have proven to be useful in other countries regarding the management of the disease. 
29895017	Transition in Pediatric and Adolescent Hypogonadal Girls: Gynecological Aspects, Estrogen Replacement Therapy, and Contraception.	Hypogonadism may be suspected if puberty is delayed. Pubertal delay may be caused by a normal physiological variant, by primary ovarian insufficiency (Turner syndrome), or reflect congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH; genetic) or acquired HH (brain lesions). Any underlying chronic disease like inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, malnutrition (anorexia or orthorexia), or excessive physical activity may also result in functional HH. Thus, girls with delayed puberty should be evaluated for an underlying pathology before any treatment, including oral contraception, is initiated. Estrogen replacement is important and natural 17beta-estradiol, preferably transdermally, is the preferred choice, whereas the oral route can be used as an alternative depending on patient preference and compliance. Sexual activity is often delayed in the hypogonadal adolescent girl. In the adolescent hypogonadal girl, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) most likely has been initiated at the time she becomes sexually active. If a risk of unwanted pregnancy cannot be ruled out, there is a need to consider contraception. This consideration does not contradict the principles of HRT but can be included as a part of the substitution, e.g. oral contraceptives containing 17beta-estradiol or a progestogen intrauterine device combined with continuous 17beta-estradiol (transdermal or oral).
38501745	Gluten-free lentil cakes with optimal technological and nutritional characteristics.	BACKGROUND: Celiac population usually struggle finding nutritive gluten-free (GF) baked goods. GF foods can be improved using legume flours. Eleven GF cake formulations were elaborated according to different percentages of lentil flour (LF), corn flour (CF) and rice flour (RF) using a simplex lattice design. Water holding capacity (WHC) and particle size of flours were evaluated. Moisture, aw, pH, specific volume, texture profile analysis, relaxation, color and alveolar characteristics were determined for crumbs of all formulations. An optimization process was used to enhance the technological and nutritional attributes, selecting the three best formulations containing LF: 46 % LF + 54 % RF (CLF+RF ); 49 % LF + 51 % CF (CLF+CF ); and 100 % LF (CLF ), evaluated in their proximal composition and sensory characteristics. Linear and quadratic models for predicting behavior of GF lentil cakes were obtained. RESULTS: LF and CF could favor water incorporation and more resistance to enzymatic digestion than RF. Formulations with LF showed an improve in specific volume and alveolar parameters, while use of RF led to better cohesiveness, elasticity and resilience but it deteriorated chewiness and firmness. CLF can be labeled as high in protein and fiber and presented the lowest amounts of lipids, carbohydrates and energy content. Consumer preference leaned towards CLF+RF. CONCLUSION: It was possible to elaborate GF cakes using LF, obtaining nutritive products that can be offered to people intolerant to gluten ingestion. This article is protected by copyright.

25139307	Factors associated with long diagnostic delay in celiac disease.	OBJECTIVE: Here, we investigated the factors associated with long diagnostic delay in celiac disease and the impact of the national Current Care Guidelines in reducing the delay. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This population-based study involved 825 adult celiac disease patients. The diagnosis was considered delayed when the interval between first symptoms and diagnosis was >10 years. The patients were asked about the duration and type of symptoms before diagnosis, time and site (tertiary, secondary, or primary care) of the diagnosis, family history of the disease, and presence of significant comorbidities. Analysis was performed by binary logistic regression. RESULTS: Altogether, 261 (32%) out of 825 participants reported a diagnostic delay of >10 years. Female gender, neurological or musculoskeletal disorders and presence of diarrhea, abdominal pain, and malabsorption were associated with prolonged delay. Male gender, diagnosis after the introduction of the first Current Care Guidelines in 1997, and being detected by serological screening, and family history of celiac disease were associated with a lower risk of delayed diagnosis. Factors not associated with the delay were site of diagnosis, age, and presence of dermatitis herpetiformis, type 1 diabetes, or thyroidal disease. CONCLUSION: The number of long diagnostic delays in celiac disease has decreased over the past decades. The shift of diagnostics from secondary and tertiary care to primary care has not been detrimental. National guidelines together with increased awareness and active screening in at-risk groups of celiac disease are important in these circumstances.
30081502	Extraintestinal Manifestations of Celiac Disease: Early Detection for Better Long-Term Outcomes.	Population-based screening studies have shown celiac disease to be one of the most common chronic gastrointestinal diseases. Nevertheless, because of the diverse clinical presentation, the great majority of patients remain unrecognized. Particularly difficult to identify are the multifaceted extraintestinal symptoms that may appear at variable ages. Although the pathogenesis and long-term outcome of these manifestations are still poorly established, there is some evidence that unrecognized celiac disease predisposes to severe complications if not diagnosed and prevented with an early-initiated gluten-free diet. Therefore, it is of utmost importance that physicians of different disciplines learn to recognize celiac disease in individuals with non-gastrointestinal symptoms. In the future, more studies are needed to clarify the factors affecting development and prognosis of the extraintestinal manifestations.
34350534	Post-bariatric Surgery Outcomes and Complications in Patients with Celiac Disease: a Matched Case-Control Study.	PURPOSE: The shift towards an obese phenotype in celiac disease (CD) patients increases risk of morbidity and mortality. Bariatric surgery (BS) is the gold standard treatment for obesity. Few studies have explored the role of BS in patients with CD. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of BS in this population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a retrospective matched case-control (1:5) study of adult patients with confirmed CD who underwent BS at our institution from 1998 to 2018. Demographics, operative data, post-operative outcomes, complications, and nutritional parameters were collected. RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients (mostly Caucasian females) were included. Thirteen had confirmed CD and were compared with 65 controls. The most common type of BS was the RYGB. The percent of total body weight loss (%TWL) was similar for both groups at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months, with the highest weight loss being at 12 months: %TWL 28.4 (20.2-38.4) for CD, n=13; vs. 29.1 (19.6-39.3) for non-CD, n=49; p=0.8. Obesity-associated co-morbidities greatly and comparably improved in both groups. Patients with CD had no complications after BS. Post-BS malodorous and oily stools were more common among patients with CD (23.1% vs. 4.6%, p=0.03). Micronutrient deficiencies were common and comparable among both groups with iron and vitamin D being the most common deficiencies. Gluten-free diet (GFD) non-adherence post-operatively was associated with a higher incidence of post-BS abdominal pain (60.0% vs. 0.0%, p=0.012). CONCLUSIONS: BS is safe and effective in patients with CD. Close monitoring is necessary to ensure compliance with GFD and vitamin supplementation. KEY POINTS:   Bariatric surgery leads to significant weight loss in celiac disease (CD) patients.   Mid- and long-term weight loss does not differ between patients with and without CD.   Obesity-associated co-morbidities significantly improve after surgery in CD patients.   The incidence of post-surgical complications is not higher in CD patients.
34034270	Serum transglutaminase antibodies do not always detect the persistent villous atrophy in patients with celiac disease on a gluten-free diet.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: Serum transglutaminase antibodies (tTGs) are used for celiac disease screening and to monitor celiac disease patients on a gluten-free diet (GFD). The need for histology of duodenal biopsies to assess mucosal healing after a GFD is still a matter of debate. We evaluated whether tTGs are adequate to detect the persistence of histological lesions of duodenal mucosa in celiac patients after a GFD. METHODS: In total 253 patients with histological diagnosis of celiac disease according to Marsh criteria, both at the time of diagnosis (T0) and 18-24 months after starting a GFD (T2), were included. tTGs were evaluated both at T0 and T2; endomysial antibodies (EMAs) only at T0. RESULTS: At T0, 9.2% of patients had both tTG and EMA negative values, despite the evidence of duodenal lesions: 33.3% of Marsh 1, 14.3% of Marsh 2 and 5.2% of Marsh 3. At T2, tTGs were negative in 77.6% of patients: 82.2% of Marsh 0, 79.8% of Marsh 1, 70.0% of Marsh 2 and 59.1% of Marsh 3. At T2, approximately 60% of patients with the persistence of mucosal atrophy had negative tTGs. At T0, tTG median values were lower in patients with Marsh 1 and Marsh 2 than patients with Marsh 3 (P < 0.001), whereas no difference was found at T2 regardless of Marsh's grade (P = 0.4). CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study highlight how histologic evaluation of duodenal biopsies remains the gold standard for both celiac disease diagnosis and the evaluation of mucosal recovery after 18-24 months of a GFD.
32745639	Genome-Wide Transcriptomic Analysis of Intestinal Mucosa in Celiac Disease Patients on a Gluten-Free Diet and Postgluten Challenge.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Gluten challenge studies are instrumental in understanding the pathophysiology of celiac disease. Our aims in this study were to reveal early gluten-induced transcriptomic changes in duodenal biopsies and to find tools for clinics. METHODS: Duodenal biopsies were collected from 15 celiac disease patients on a strict long-term gluten-free diet (GFD) prior to and post a gluten challenge (PGC) and from 6 healthy control individuals (DC). Biopsy RNA was subjected to genome-wide 3' RNA-Seq. Sequencing data was used to determine the differences between the three groups and was compared to sequencing data from the public repositories. The biopsies underwent morphometric analyses. RESULTS: In DC vs. GFD group comparisons, 167 differentially expressed genes were identified with 117 genes downregulated and 50 genes upregulated. In PGC vs. GFD group comparisons, 417 differentially expressed genes were identified with 195 genes downregulated and 222 genes upregulated. Celiac disease patients on a GFD were not "healthy". In particular, genes encoding proteins for transporting small molecules were expressed less. In addition to the activation of immune response genes, a gluten challenge induced hyperactive intestinal wnt-signaling and consequent immature crypt gene expression resulting in less differentiated epithelium. Biopsy gene expression in response to a gluten challenge correlated with the extent of the histological damage. Regression models using only four gene transcripts described 97.2% of the mucosal morphology and 98.0% of the inflammatory changes observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our gluten challenge trial design provided an opportunity to study the transition from health to disease. The results show that even on a strict GFD, despite being deemed healthy, patients reveal patterns of ongoing disease. Here, a transcriptomic regression model estimating the extent of gluten-induced duodenal mucosal injury is presented.
29373441	Impact of Thyroid Autoimmunity on Thyroid Function in 12-year-old Children With Celiac Disease.	OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease (CD) is associated with thyroid autoimmunity and other autoimmune diseases. Data are, however, lacking regarding the relationship between thyroid autoimmunity and thyroid function, especially in regard to CD. Our aim was to investigate the impact of thyroid autoimmunity on thyroid function in 12-year-old children with CD compared to their healthy peers. METHODS: A case-referent study was conducted as part of a CD screening of 12-year-olds. Our study included 335 children with CD and 1695 randomly selected referents. Thyroid autoimmunity was assessed with antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPOAb). Thyroid function was assessed with thyroid-stimulating hormone and free thyroxine. RESULTS: TPOAb positivity significantly increased the risk of developing hypothyroidism in all children. The odds ratios (with 95% confidence intervals) were 5.3 (2.7-11) in healthy 12-year-olds, 10 (3.2-32) in screening-detected CD cases, 19 (2.6-135) in previously diagnosed CD cases, and 12 (4.4-32) in all CD cases together. Among children with TPOAb positivity, hypothyroidism was significantly more common (odds ratio 3.1; 95% CI 1.03-9.6) in children with CD (10/19) than in children without CD (12/46). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of thyroid dysfunction due to thyroid autoimmunity is larger for those with CD than their healthy peers. Our study indicates that a gluten-free diet does not reduce the risk of thyroid dysfunction. Further studies are required for improved understanding of the role of the gluten-free diet for the risk of autoimmune diseases in children with CD.
23937528	Non-celiac gluten sensitivity: clinical relevance and recommendations for future research.	BACKGROUND: There has been increasing interest in the entity of Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity (NCGS) in recent years; however, it still remains a controversial topic and its pathogenesis is not well understood. Celiac Disease, in contrast, is a well-studied condition that has become increasingly recognized as a prevalent condition arising from a heightened immunological response to gluten. Wheat allergy is an IgE-mediated condition capable of causing a variety of gastrointestinal symptoms. However, the number of patients who have neither celiac disease nor wheat allergy, but appear to derive benefit from a gluten-free diet, is also increasing substantially. The use of the term NCGS as a way of describing this condition has become increasingly prevalent in recent years. PURPOSE: In this review, we will focus on gastrointestinal manifestations of NCGS and discuss the evidence for the condition and its putative pathogenesis. We will discuss areas of controversy and areas for potential future research.
22484356	Predictors of gluten avoidance and implementation of a gluten-free diet in children and adolescents without confirmed celiac disease.	OBJECTIVES: To determine independent predictors of gluten avoidance and of a physician's decision to initiate a gluten-free diet (GFD) in children and adolescents without confirmed celiac disease. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a structured medical record review of 579 patients aged 1-19 years presenting for evaluation of celiac disease between January 2000 and December 2010 at a large Boston teaching hospital. We collected data including demographic information, medical history, serology, small intestinal biopsy, history of gluten avoidance, and the postworkup recommendation of implementation of a GFD. Predictors of gluten-related issues were identified by multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 579 children without a previous diagnosis of celiac disease (mean age, 8.7 years), 43 (7.4%) had ever avoided gluten. Independent predictors of gluten avoidance were irritability or poor temper (OR, 3.2), diarrhea (OR, 2.5), weight issues (OR, 0.4), pervasive developmental disorder (OR, 5.3), and family history of celiac disease (OR, 2.2). Among 143 children without confirmed celiac disease who underwent diagnostic evaluation, several predictive factors were associated with a physician- recommended/parent-initiated GFD: irritability (OR, 6.4), diarrhea (OR, 3.4), pervasive developmental disorder (OR, 7.9), and positive serology before the referral (OR, 4.3). CONCLUSION: Gluten avoidance among children and adolescents without a previous diagnosis of celiac disease is relatively common. The identified predictors suggest that gluten avoidance is associated with nonspecific behavioral and gastrointestinal complaints and perhaps with the perceived dietary responses in another family member thought to have celiac disease.
25872537	Celiac disease: diagnosis and treatment.	This national clinical guideline approved by the Danish Society for Gastroenterology and Hepatology describes the diagnosis and treatment of celiac disease (CD) in adults. CD is a chronic immune-mediated enteropathy of the small intestine triggered by the ingestion of gluten-containing proteins, which are found in wheat, rye, and barley. The disease prevalence is 0.5-1.0%, but CD remains under-diagnosed. The diagnosis relies on the demonstration of lymphocyte infiltration, crypt hyperplasia, and villous atrophy in duodenal biopsies. Serology, malabsorption, biochemical markers, and identification of specific HLA haplotypes may contribute to CD diagnosis. Classical CD presents with diarrhoea and weight loss, but non-classical CD with vague or extraintestinal symptoms is common. The treatment for CD is a lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD), which, in the majority of patients, normalises the small intestinal mucosa and absorption. Adherence to a GFD usually requires dietary advice from a clinical dietician. The monitoring of antibody levels and malabsorption markers is crucial during follow-up and allows for early treatment of disease complications. Important complications include osteoporosis, iron and vitamin deficiencies, and enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma.
28067805	Content Validation and Semantic Evaluation of a Check-List Elaborated for the Prevention of Gluten Cross-Contamination in Food Services.	Conditions associated to the consumption of gluten have emerged as a major health care concern and the treatment consists on a lifelong gluten-free diet. Providing safe food for these individuals includes adapting to safety procedures within the food chain and preventing gluten cross-contamination in gluten-free food. However, a gluten cross-contamination prevention protocol or check-list has not yet been validated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to perform the content validation and semantic evaluation of a check-list elaborated for the prevention of gluten cross-contamination in food services. The preliminary version of the check-list was elaborated based on the Brazilian resolution for food safety Collegiate Board Resolution 216 (RDC 216) and Collegiate Board Resolution 275 (RDC 275), the standard 22000 from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO 22000) and the Canadian Celiac Association Gluten-Free Certification Program documents. Seven experts with experience in the area participated in the check-list validation and semantic evaluation. The criteria used for the approval of the items, as to their importance for the prevention of gluten cross-contamination and clarity of the wording, was the achievement of a minimal of 80% of agreement between the experts (W-values >= 0.8). Moreover, items should have a mean >=4 in the evaluation of importance (Likert scale from 1 to 5) and clarity (Likert scale from 0 to 5) in order to be maintained in the instrument. The final version of the check-list was composed of 84 items, divided into 12 sections. After being redesigned and re-evaluated, the items were considered important and comprehensive by the experts (both with W-values >= 0.89). The check-list developed was validated with respect to content and approved in the semantic evaluation.
28030659	Rituximab Treatment for Recalcitrant Dermatitis Herpetiformis.	Importance: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an autoimmune blistering condition seen in the context of celiac disease. While typically managed by gluten-free diet and dapsone, treatment of DH refractory to standard treatments is not well defined. Observations: A man in his 80s with DH not controlled by gluten-free diet (with poor adherence), dapsone, and conventional immune-suppressing agents responded to treatment with rituximab according to the lymphoma protocol (4 weekly infusions of 375 mg/m2). Thirteen months after treatment, the patient had achieved complete resolution of pruritus and clinical manifestations of the disease, as well as normalization of antibodies against epidermal and tissue transglutaminases. He achieved complete clinical and serological remission and has remained symptom-free up to 18 months following treatment. Conclusions and Relevance: We present here the first case of a patient with DH treated with rituximab who achieved complete clinical and serological remission. We suggest rituximab as a viable treatment option for recalcitrant DH.
26529008	Increased Intraepithelial Valpha24 Invariant NKT Cells in the Celiac Duodenum.	Celiac Disease (CD) is an interferon (IFN)gamma-mediated duodenal hypersensitivity to wheat gluten occurring in genetically predisposed individuals. Gluten-free diet (GFD) leads to a complete remission of the disease. Valpha24-restricted invariant NKT (iNKT) cells are important to maintain immune homeostasis in the gut mucosa because of their unique capacity to rapidly produce large quantities of both T-helper (Th)1 and Th2 cytokines upon stimulation. We studied the presence of these cells in the CD duodenum. Duodenal biopsies were obtained from 45 untreated-CD patients (uCD), 15 Gluten Free Diet-CD patients (GFD-CD), 44 non-inflamed non-CD controls (C-controls) and 15 inflamed non-CD controls (I-controls). Two populations from Spain and Argentina were recruited. Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of Valpha24-Jalpha18 (invariant TCRalpha chain of human iNKT cells), IFNgamma and intracellular transcription factor Forkhead Box P3 (Foxp3), and flow cytometry intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) profile were determined. Both uCD and GFD-CD patients had higher Valpha24-Jalpha18 mRNA levels than non-CD controls (I and C-controls). The expression of Valpha24-Jalpha18 correlated with Marsh score for the severity of mucosal lesion and also with increased mRNA IFNgamma levels. uCD and GFD-CD patients had decreased mRNA expression of FoxP3 but increased expression of Valpha24-Jalpha18, which revealed a CD-like molecular profile. Increased numbers of iNKT cells were confirmed by flow cytometry within the intraepithelial lymphocyte compartment of uCD and GFD-CD patients and correlated with Valpha24-Jalpha18 mRNA expression. In conclusion, we have found an increased number of iNKT cells in the duodenum from both uCD and GFD-CD patients, irrespective of the mucosal status. A CD-like molecular profile, defined by an increased mRNA expression of Valpha24-Jalpha18 together with a decreased expression of FoxP3, may represent a pro-inflammatory signature of the CD duodenum. 
30228265	Combination of Gluten-Digesting Enzymes Improved Symptoms of Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity: A Randomized Single-blind, Placebo-controlled Crossover Study.	INTRODUCTION: Recently, the population of individuals with non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) who do not have celiac disease but show improved symptoms with a gluten-free diet, has increased. Enzyme replacement therapy using digestive enzymes is expected to improve the symptoms of NCGS and be sustainable, since gluten-related proteins that are indigestible by the digestive system have been considered triggers of NCGS. METHODS: We selected patients with NCGS by screening demographic interviews, as well as performing medical evaluations, anti-gluten antibody tests, and gluten challenge tests. We performed a single-blind and crossover clinical trial with these subjects using a gluten challenge with the enzyme mixture or a placebo. Our designed enzyme mixture contained peptidase, semi alkaline protease, deuterolysin, and cysteine protease derived from Aspergillus oryzae, Aspergillus melleus, Penicillium citrinum, and Carica papaya L., respectively. RESULTS: Administration of the enzyme mixture significantly decreased the change in the score of the symptom questionnaire before and after the gluten challenge compared with administration of the placebo in patients with NCGS without adverse events. In particular, the changes in the score of the gluten-induced incomplete evacuation feeling and headaches were significantly improved. The serum levels of interleukin (IL)-8, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, andregulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) in subjects were not significantly changed by gluten, as expected from previous studies, and the enzyme mixture did not affect these inflammatory markers. CONCLUSION: In this human clinical study, we demonstrated the efficacy of the enzyme mixture derived from microorganisms and papaya in improving the symptoms of NCGS.
28639064	Whole lipid profile and not only HDL cholesterol is impaired in children with coexisting type 1 diabetes and untreated celiac disease.	AIMS: Low HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) levels have been described in patients with coexisting type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and celiac disease (CD). Data on other possible lipid abnormalities that could further increase cardiovascular risk in these patients are scarce and incomplete. Aim of this retrospective multicenter study was to evaluate whole lipid profiles, besides HDL-C, in children with T1DM associated with biopsy-proven CD, and to investigate the influence of age and degree of adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD) on lipid changes. METHODS: A total of 261 children with both T1DM and CD were enrolled. Serum lipid profiles at CD diagnosis were compared with those after 1 year of GFD and with those of 224 matched children with T1DM alone. The adherence to GFD was judged by means of CD-related antibodies. RESULTS: At CD diagnosis, children with T1DM + CD showed higher LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) compared to children with T1DM alone. Gluten withdrawal failed to normalize LDL-C levels, not even in completely adherent individuals. HbA1c values were not influenced by GFD. The youngest children were characterized at diagnosis by lower levels of total cholesterol and on treatment by a greater decrease in triglycerides levels. CONCLUSIONS: An unfavorable lipid profile, characterized not only by low HDL-C levels but also by high LDL-C values, may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease in children with T1DM and untreated CD. Therefore, a strict gluten-free diet is mandatory in these children, especially the youngest.
23448357	Celiac disease and juvenile idiopathic arthritis: a still enigmatic crossover.	
30528262	Management of celiac disease in daily clinical practice.	Celiac disease (CD) is the most common autoimmune enteropathy worldwide. In CD, dietary gluten triggers a T cell driven small intestinal inflammation in a subset of genetically predisposed subjects, expressing the HLA DQ2 and/or DQ8 genes on their antigen presenting cells. HLA DQ2/DQ8 can bind gluten peptides after their prior modification by the CD autoantigen, tissue transglutaminase (TG2). This process leads to the activation of gluten reactive T cells, small bowel villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia and intraepithelial lymphocytosis, the histological hallmarks of CD. The clinical picture of CD is extremely heterogeneous including intestinal (especially diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating) and extraintestinal (especially associated autoimmune diseases, anemia, osteoporosis) manifestations. The prevalence of CD in most parts of the world is estimated at 1:100-1:150 and its diagnosis is based on the presence of circulating autoantibodies (anti-TG2) and the histological detection of villous atrophy. Treatment is a lifelong gluten free diet but adjunctive therapies are in development. Although CD is a well-characterized disease, it is grossly underdiagnosed, despite the severe consequences of long-term gluten ingestion in CD, such as enhanced autoimmunity, refractory CD and intestinal T cell lymphoma. The aim of the presented review is to provide a clinical guide and to summarize the most recent clinical progress in CD research.
21990947	Ages of celiac disease: from changing environment to improved diagnostics.	From the time of Gee's landmark writings, the recent history of celiac disease (CD) can be divided into many ages, each driven by a diagnostic advance and a deeper knowledge of disease pathogenesis. At the same time, these advances were paralleled by the identification of new clinical patterns associated with CD and by a continuous redefinition of the prevalence of the disease in population. In the beginning, CD was considered a chronic indigestion, even if the causative food was not known; later, the disease was proven to depend on an intolerance to wheat gliadin, leading to typical mucosal changes in the gut and to a malabsorption syndrome. This knowledge led to curing the disease with a gluten-free diet. After the identification of antibodies to gluten (AGA) in the serum of patients and the identification of gluten-specific lymphocytes in the mucosa, CD was described as an immune disorder, resembling a chronic "gluten infection". The use of serological testing for AGA allowed identification of the higher prevalence of this disorder, revealing atypical patterns of presentation. More recently, the characterization of autoantibodies to endomysium and to transglutaminase shifted the attention to a complex autoimmune pathogenesis and to the increased risk of developing autoimmune disorders in untreated CD. New diagnostic assays, based on molecular technologies, will introduce new changes, with the promise of better defining the spectrum of gluten reactivity and the real burden of gluten related-disorders in the population. Herein, we describe the different periods of CD experience, and further developments for the next celiac age will be proposed.
32097370	Severity of Villous Atrophy at Diagnosis in Childhood Does Not Predict Long-term Outcomes in Celiac Disease.	OBJECTIVES: Current pediatric guidelines allow noninvasive diagnosis of celiac disease in selected children. We investigated in a large cohort study whether the severity of villous atrophy at diagnosis is associated with clinical characteristics or long-term health outcomes, thus having a prognostic significance. METHODS: Comprehensive medical data on 906 children with celiac disease were analyzed. Long-term health outcomes of 503 adult patients diagnosed in childhood were moreover assessed with a specific study questionnaire and validated Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) and Psychological General Well-Being (PGWB) questionnaires. Patients were classified into 3 groups according to the severity of villous atrophy at diagnosis, and all variables were compared. RESULTS: Altogether 34% of the patients had partial, 40% subtotal, and 26% total villous atrophy. Children with milder lesions were diagnosed more recently (median year 2007 vs 2006 vs 2001, respectively, P < 0.001), more often by screening (30% vs 25% vs 17%, P < 0.001) and they suffered less often from anemia (16% vs 21% vs 32%, P < 0.001) and growth disturbances (22% vs 36% vs 54%, P < 0.001) and had lower transglutaminase-2 antibody levels (median 64 U/L vs 120 U/L vs 120 U/L, P < 0.001). There was no difference in other disease features.Altogether 212 adults diagnosed in childhood completed the questionnaires. Severity of villous atrophy at childhood diagnosis did not predict presence of complications or comorbidities, persistent symptoms, and self-perceived health, quality of life or adherence to a gluten-free diet in adulthood. CONCLUSION: Presence of advanced villous atrophy at diagnosis is associated with more severe clinical characteristics but not with poorer long-term health and treatment outcomes.
30428550	Possible Prevention of Diabetes with a Gluten-Free Diet.	Gluten seems a potentially important determinant in type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Intake of gluten, a major component of wheat, rye, and barley, affects the microbiota and increases the intestinal permeability. Moreover, studies have demonstrated that gluten peptides, after crossing the intestinal barrier, lead to a more inflammatory milieu. Gluten peptides enter the pancreas where they affect the morphology and might induce beta-cell stress by enhancing glucose- and palmitate-stimulated insulin secretion. Interestingly, animal studies and a human study have demonstrated that a gluten-free (GF) diet during pregnancy reduces the risk of T1D. Evidence regarding the role of a GF diet in T2D is less clear. Some studies have linked intake of a GF diet to reduced obesity and T2D and suggested a role in reducing leptin- and insulin-resistance and increasing beta-cell volume. The current knowledge indicates that gluten, among many environmental factors, may be an aetiopathogenic factors for development of T1D and T2D. However, human intervention trials are needed to confirm this and the proposed mechanisms.
21995616	Medical nutrition therapy: use of sourdough lactic acid bacteria as a cell factory for delivering functional biomolecules and food ingredients in gluten free bread.	Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated disease, triggered in genetically susceptible individuals by ingesting gluten from wheat, rye, barley, and other closely related cereal grains. Currently, the estimated prevalence of CD is around 1 % of the population in the western world and medical nutritional therapy (MNT) is the only accepted treatment for celiac disease. To date, the replacement of gluten in bread presents a significant technological challenge for the cereal scientist due to the low baking performance of gluten free products (GF). The increasing demand by the consumer for high quality gluten-free (GF) bread, clean labels and natural products is rising. Sourdough has been used since ancient times for the production of rye and wheat bread, its universal usage can be attributed to the improved quality, nutritional properties and shelf life of sourdough based breads. Consequently, the exploitation of sourdough for the production of GF breads appears tempting. This review will highlight how sourdough LAB can be an efficient cell factory for delivering functional biomolecules and food ingredients to enhance the quality of gluten free bread.
22094979	Applications of microbial fermentations for production of gluten-free products and perspectives.	A gluten-free (GF) diet is recognised as being the only accepted treatment for celiac disease-a permanent autoimmune enteropathy triggered by the ingestion of gluten-containing cereals. The bakery products available in today's gluten-free market are characterised by lower palatability than their conventional counterparts and may lead to nutritional deficiencies of vitamins, minerals and fibre. Thus, the production of high-quality gluten-free products has become a very important socioeconomical issue. Microbial fermentation by means of lactic acid bacteria and yeast is one of the most ecological/economical methods of producing and preserving food. In this review, the role of a fermentation process for improving the quality of GF products and for developing a new concept of GF products with nutraceutical and health-promoting characteristics will be examined.
21628610	Prospective study of clinical and histological safety of pure and uncontaminated Canadian oats in the management of celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: Pure oats are safe for most patients with celiac disease, but concerns regarding contamination by other grains limit their consumption. The Canadian Celiac Association recently released guidelines governing the production of pure oats. The objective was to test the safety of a product manufactured under these guidelines. METHODS: Fifteen adults with established, biopsy-confirmed celiac disease of >= 1 year duration were challenged with 350 g/wk of pure oats for 12 weeks. Symptom scores, weight, hemoglobin, ferritin, albumin, and tissue transglutaminase (tTG) were assessed at weeks 0, 6, and 12. Duodenal biopsies were obtained before and after oat challenge and assessed based on the modified Marsh-Oberhuber score. Compliance with a gluten-free diet was monitored with random food diaries. RESULTS: Fifteen patients completed the study and were analyzed in intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. There were no significant changes in symptom scores, weight, hemoglobin, ferritin, or albumin during oat consumption. The tTG remained negative in all patients, and the histology scores did not significantly change during oat challenge. The only relapse occurred in a patient who became noncompliant with her gluten-free diet. CONCLUSION: The findings support the safety of pure, uncontaminated oats manufactured under Canadian Celiac Association guidelines for patients with celiac disease.
33176106	The use of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in celiac disease diagnosis and treatment.	Introduction: Celiac disease is characterized by an abnormal immune activation driven by the ingestion of gluten from wheat, barley, and rye. Gluten-specific CD4+ T cells play an important role in disease pathogenesis and are detectable among peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Areas covered: This review summarizes the use of celiac disease patient PBMCs in clinical applications focusing on their exploitation in the development of diagnostic approaches and novel drugs to replace or complement gluten-free diet. Expert opinion: The most used PBMC-based methods applied in celiac disease research include ELISpot and HLA-DQ:gluten tetramer technology. ELISpot has been utilized particularly in research aiming to develop a celiac disease vaccine and in studies addressing the toxicity of different grains in celiac disease. HLA-DQ:gluten tetramer technology on the other hand initially focused on improving current diagnostics but in combination with additional markers it is also a useful outcome measure in clinical trials to monitor the efficacy of drug candidates. In addition, the technology serves well in the more detailed characterization of celiac disease-specific T cells, thereby possibly revealing novel therapeutic targets. Future studies may also reveal clinical applications for PBMC microRNAs and/or dendritic cells or monocytes present among PBMCs.
30367395	All that a physician should know about gluten-free diet.	Gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only definitive treatment for patients with celiac disease (CeD). Strict adherence to GFD improves the symptoms, nutritional deficiencies, and the overall well-being of the patients. The management of CeD is truly different and unique from the treatment of other medical or surgical diseases. While prescribing a GFD is easy, the key to the success lies in the dietary counseling by a nutrition specialist/physician and maintenance of adherence to the prescribed diet by the patient. When restricting gluten from all possible sources, it is pertinent to recommend a diet that is healthy and balanced for patients with celiac disease. Those following GFD must be counseled properly on the ways of balancing their diets and of avoiding cross contamination. They should be taught how to read food labels properly and given tips for dining out or during traveling. Regular follow up with patients is required for assessing the compliance and monitoring growth and the status of recovery. In this review article, we have compiled, for the physicians and gastroenterologists, the relevant information about GFD including counseling, adherence, nutritional adequacy, and many other related issues.
37090031	Nutritional status, nutrient imbalances, food-related behaviors and dietary supplements use among patients with celiac disease on a gluten free diet in Lebanon: a national cross-sectional study.	Background: Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten, that occurs in susceptible individuals and is associated with dietary restriction and subsequent nutritional deficiencies. This study investigated the diet quality, nutrition imbalances and nutrition status among young children,adolescents and adults with CD who were referred to several hospitals in Lebanon. Methods: A cross-sectional study in 50 individuals (31.74 +- 15.64 years) with CD who follow a gluten free diet was conducted, using biochemical parameters, anthropometric measurements, dietary and physical activity assessments. Results: Of the 50 participants, 38% and 16% were presenting low serum levels of iron and vitamin B12, respectively. The majority of participants were physically inactive and around 40% of them had low muscle mass. A weight loss of 10% to 30% indicating mild to moderate malnutrition was shown in 14% of individuals. The assessment of food-related behaviors shows that 80% of participants were reading nutrition labels and 96% of them were following gluten-free diets (GFD). Some barriers including family ignorance (6%), language of the nutrition labels (20%) and expensive GF products (78%) were limiting the adherence to GFD. The inadequacy of the daily energy intake along with insufficient intakes of calcium and vitamin D were remarked among individuals with CD. However, protein and iron intake were exceeding the recommendations among all age groups, except in males aged 4-8 years and 19-30 years. Half the study participants were using dietary supplements where 38%, 10%, 46%, 18%, 16% and 4% used vitamin D, vitamin B12, iron, calcium, folate and probiotics, respectively. Conclusion: GFD is the key treatment for CD. However, it is not without inadequacies and may cause certain deficiencies such as calcium and vitamin D leading to reduced bone density. This underlines the critical role of dietitians in education and maintenance of healthy GFD among individuals with CD.
25046883	Pathology of celiac disease: a brief review.	Celiac disease is a gluten or prolamine-induced immunological disorder primarily affecting the intestines. Celiac disease is often missed since not only are clinical findings 'not typical' but also because many cases are asymptomatic. The diagnosis is based on a constellation of clinical, serological and histological findings in a duodenal biopsy, in addition to HLA genotype.and response to a gluten-free diet.Although some guidelines suggest that histology may not mandatory in every case, by and large changes in mucosal biopsies of the duodenum still remain an important diagnostic tool. The evaluation of a duodenal biopsy requires a properly oriented and satisfactory hematoxylin & eosin stained paraffin section. A poorly oriented and technically suboptimal biopsy is not uncommonly the reason for erroneous interpretation. An increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes [IELs] and an alteration of the crypt: villus ratio forms the basis of diagnosis. These are semiquantitavely classified. Despite varying opinions related to the cut-off values of IELs and findings that recommend appropriate site, number and size of the biopsy specimens, the sensitivity of biopsies vary from 90%-100%. Interpretation of histological findings require correlation with other evidences since the changes in duodenal biopsy may be similar to those seen in a host of other diseases including tropical sprue. It must also be mentioned that in the Indian subcontinent is that reference values for normal duodenal biopsies are lacking, making interpretation difficult especially when changes are mild. Histological changes in the duodenal mucosa often take months to normalize after clinical remission. This is a review of various aspects related to the histological changes in duodenal mucosal biopsies that aid in the diagnosis and follow-up of cases of celiac disease.
29306516	Long term effects of gluten-free diet in non-celiac wheat sensitivity.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Information about the clinical outcome of patients with non-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCWS) treated with gluten-free diet (GFD) derive from studies assessing the symptom response in the first few weeks of treatment. We aimed to evaluate the clinical response to the GFD and the quality of life (QoL) of NCWS patients in the long term. METHODS: Forty-four NCWS (diagnosed according to the Salerno criteria) participated in the study. Participants rated their symptoms according to a 0-10 scale patients and filled in a QoL questionnaire (CDQ) before the beginning of the GFD and during a follow-up evaluation performed after at least one year. To assess the reliability of the questionnaire we also included a control group of 43 matched patients with celiac disease (CD). RESULTS: Upon diagnosis, NCWS patients had a high prevalence of intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms. Also, most symptoms were described as severe and the QoL questionnaire showed high scores. On follow-up, both prevalence and severity of the most common symptoms were significantly reduced. However, persistent intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms of mild severity were found in 65.9 and 72.7% of NCWS patients. In comparison, in the CD group, the prevalence was lower (32.6 and 23.2% respectively) and consistent with previous studies. The analyses of the determinant of QoL showed that, upon diagnosis, NCWS patients had higher scores in the CDQ "gastrointestinal symptoms" (p < 0.001), "emotional aspects" (p < 0.001) and "social problems" (p < 0.001) subclasses compared to CD patients. After the GFD, NCWS and CD patients shared similar scores in all of the subclasses. CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of NCWS patients still complains of intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms, even if significantly attenuated by the GFD, even years after the diagnosis. A comprehensive nutritional evaluation of these patients is required to further improve their symptoms and their QoL.
28623177	Delay in Diagnosis of Celiac Disease in Patients Without Gastrointestinal Complaints.	PURPOSE: The purpose of our study is to investigate the delay in diagnosis of patients with biopsy-proven celiac disease in those who present with gastrointestinal complaints vs nongastrointestinal complaints at our tertiary care center. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder that affects approximately 1% of the population worldwide. Celiac disease can have variable clinical presentations; it can be characterized by predominately gastrointestinal symptoms, or it may present without any gastrointestinal symptoms. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 687 adult patients who carried the diagnosis of celiac disease. Patients included had biopsy-proven celiac disease and were categorized based on presence or absence of gastrointestinal symptoms prior to their diagnosis. RESULTS: There were 101 patients with biopsy-proven celiac disease that met inclusion criteria. Fifty-two patients presented with gastrointestinal symptoms and 49 had nongastrointestinal complaints. Results from Mann-Whitney statistical analysis showed a median delay in diagnosis of 2.3 months for the gastrointestinal symptoms group and 42 months for the nongastrointestinal group (P <.001); 43.2% of patients with nongastrointestinal symptoms had abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone, as opposed to 15.5% in the gastrointestinal symptom group (P = .004). Of patients with nongastrointestinal symptoms, 69.4% had anemia, compared with 11.5% of the gastrointestinal symptom group (P <.001). The majority of patients in the nongastrointestinal symptom group, 68%, were noted to have abnormal bone density scans, compared with 41% in the gastrointestinal symptom group. No sex differences were noted on chi-squared analysis between the 2 groups (P = .997). CONCLUSIONS: Although there is growing awareness of celiac disease, the delay in diagnosis for patients without gastrointestinal symptoms remains prolonged, with an average delay of 3.5 years.
23383526	Diagnosis of celiac disease during pre-operative work-up for bariatric surgery.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: Morbid obesity is a highly prevalent condition. In selected cases, bariatric surgery is indicated. Although for decades celiac disease (CD) has been associated with chronic diarrhea and weight loss, now it becomes clear that the clinical spectrum is extremely wide. METHODS: We report 5 morbidly obese patients that were diagnosed of CD during preoperative work-up for bariatric surgery. Diagnosis was suspected during routine upper endoscopy, and confirmed by histology and positive CD-specific serology. RESULT: Four of the 5 cases were asymptomatic. One complained of chronic diarrhea and anemia. All cases initiated a gluten-free diet. Due to CD, patients were offered a purely restrictive bariatric procedure. Three patients underwent a sleeve gastrectomy while the other two are still undergoing pre-operative evaluations. CONCLUSION: This report enlarges the clinical spectrum of untreated CD. Although prevalence of CD in obese patients seems to be similar to that in the general population, morbid obese patients should be tested for CD in order to establish the best surgical strategy and outcome.
33338656	Determinants and Trends of Adherence to a Gluten-Free Diet in Adult Celiac Patients on a Long-term Follow-up (2000-2020).	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Data on factors governing long-term adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) in celiac disease (CD) are scarce. We aimed to determine trends and clinical predictors of long-term GFD adherence in adult CD. METHODS: Initial and long-term (>3 years) GFD adherence, clinical characteristics at baseline and follow-up were collected retrospectively from celiac patients followed-up over 20 years (2000-2020). Predictors of long-term GFD adherence at diagnosis, and follow-up were evaluated by multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: 248 patients (37 +- 12 years, 186F, median time on a GFD 90 months) were included. Twenty-five (10.1%) had only short-term follow-up (<3 years) while 223 (89.9%) had initial and long-term dietary assessment. 187/223 (83.9%) patients were initially adherent and 36/223 (16.1%) were not. 17/36 (47.2%) patients initially not adherent become adherent, while only 4/187 (2.1%) initially adherent patients became not adherent. In the long-term, 200/223 (89.7%) were adherent and 21/223 (9.4%) patients were not. Adherence improved more frequently than worsened (OR, 39.5; 95% CI, 11.4-178.5; P < .01). Classical symptoms (diarrhea, weight loss) at diagnosis of CD predicted stricter long-term GFD adherence (OR, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.21-8.81; P = .02), while anemia (OR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.12-0.82; P = .02) and dermatitis herpetiformis (OR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.06-0.91; P = .04) predicted poorer long-term adherence. At follow-up, initial GFD adherence (OR, 42.70; 95% CI, 10.70-171.00; P = .04) was the major determinant of long-term GFD adherence. CONCLUSIONS: GFD adherence changes over time in <10% of patients, generally improving when it does. Major determinants of long-term GFD adherence are classical symptoms at diagnosis and initial adherence to a GFD. Patients with anemia or dermatitis herpetiformis at diagnosis require stricter dietetic input.
22846984	The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating pattern in special populations.	The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) trial showed that a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy products with reduced total and saturated fat, cholesterol, and sugar-sweetened products effectively lowers blood pressure in individuals with prehypertension and stage I hypertension. Limited evidence is available on the safety and efficacy of the DASH eating pattern in special patient populations that were excluded from the trial. Caution should be exercised before initiating the DASH diet in patients with chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, and those who are prescribed renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system antagonist, but these conditions are not strict contraindications to DASH. Modifications to the DASH diet may be necessary to facilitate its use in patients with chronic heart failure, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus type II, lactose intolerance, and celiac disease. In general, the DASH diet can be adopted by most patient populations and initiated simultaneously with medication therapy and other lifestyle interventions.
31399743	Dietary Gluten as a Conditioning Factor of the Gut Microbiota in Celiac Disease.	The gut microbiota plays a relevant role in determining an individual's health status, and the diet is a major factor in modulating the composition and function of gut microbiota. Gluten constitutes an essential dietary component in Western societies and is the environmental trigger of celiac disease. The presence/absence of gluten in the diet can change the diversity and proportions of the microbial communities constituting the gut microbiota. There is an intimate relation between gluten metabolism and celiac disease pathophysiology and gut microbiota; their interrelation defines intestinal health and homeostasis. Environmental factors modify the intestinal microbiota and, in turn, its changes modulate the mucosal and immune responses. Current evidence from studies of young and adult patients with celiac disease increasingly supports that dysbiosis (i.e., compositional and functional alterations of the gut microbiome) is present in celiac disease, but to what extent this is a cause or consequence of the disease and whether the different intestinal diseases (celiac disease, ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease) have specific change patterns is not yet clear. The use of bacterial-origin enzymes that help completion of gluten digestion is of interest because of the potential application as coadjuvant in the current treatment of celiac disease. In this narrative review, we address the current knowledge on the complex interaction between gluten digestion and metabolism, celiac disease, and the intestinal microbiota.
28117706	Prevalence of Self-Reported Gluten Sensitivity and Adherence to a Gluten-Free Diet in Argentinian Adult Population.	BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggest that the prevalence of wheat/gluten sensitivity and adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) are high in Latin population despite a poor diagnosis of celiac disease. However, these prevalence rates still remain unknown in most Latin American countries. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey study was conducted in Santa Fe, Argentina. RESULTS: The estimated self-reported prevalence rates were (95% Confidence Interval [CI]): self-reported gluten sensitivity (SR-GS) 7.61% (6.2-9.2), SR-GS currently following a GFD 1.82% (1.2-2.7), celiac disease 0.58% (0.3-1.2), wheat allergy 0.33% (0.12-0.84), self-reported non-celiac gluten sensitivity (SR-NCGS) 6.28% (5.1-7.8), SR-NCGS currently following a GFD 0.91% (0.5-1.6), and adherence to a GFD 6.37% (5.1-7.9). SR-GS was more common in women (6.0%; p < 0.001) and associated with irritable bowel syndrome (p < 0.001). Among the GFD followers, 71.4% were doing it for reasons other than health-related benefits and 50.6% without medical/dietitian advice. In the non-SR-GS group, the main motivations for following a GFD were weight control and the perception that a GFD is healthier. CONCLUSION: In Argentina, gluten sensitivity is commonly reported and it seems that physicians/gastroenterologists are aware of celiac disease diagnosis. Trustable information about the benefits and potential consequences of following a GFD should be given to the general population.
22915338	Primary effusion anaplastic large cell lymphoma in a patient with long-standing dermatitis herpetiformis and celiac disease.	
28140327	Nonceliac Gluten Sensitivity.	Nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) refers to a clinical phenotype in which patients experience intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms related to ingesting a gluten-containing diet after a diagnosis of celiac disease (CD) or wheat allergy has been excluded. CD, an autoimmune disease characterized by villous atrophy triggered by the ingestion of gluten, has increased in prevalence in recent decades, although the majority of patients remain undiagnosed. There is now an increasing public awareness of NCGS and growing interest in the health effects of gluten among health professionals and the lay public. Several randomized controlled trials have explored NCGS but have left many questions unanswered surrounding the pathophysiology, biomarkers, and established diagnostic approach to patients with this condition. Future studies are necessary to establish biomarkers and to elucidate the pathophysiology of this condition because at present, NCGS likely comprises a heterogeneous patient population. In this review, we outline the clinical trials of NCGS as well as the approach to patients with possible NCGS as recommended by an international expert panel. Because maintaining a gluten-free diet has important health, social, and economic consequences, it is necessary for medical professionals to provide practical and evidence-based advice to patients with this condition.
31000461	Metabolic effects in patients with celiac disease, patients with nonceliac gluten sensitivity, and asymptomatic controls, after six months of a gluten-free diet.	INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: It is essential for patients with celiac disease (CD) to be on a gluten-free diet (GFD) but said diet has also been reported to increase the risk for metabolic syndrome. There is no evidence on the metabolic effects of a GFD in patients with nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) or in asymptomatic subjects. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the metabolic effects of a GFD over a 6-month period in patients with CD, patients with NCGS, and in asymptomatic controls (ACs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study was conducted that evaluated metabolic syndrome and its components of obesity, high blood pressure, hepatic steatosis, and hyperglycemia at the baseline and at 6 months. RESULTS: A total of 66 subjects (22 CD, 22 NCGS, and 22 AC) were included in the study. At the baseline, 10% of the patients with CD presented with obesity, high blood pressure, hepatic steatosis, and metabolic syndrome. After 6 months, obesity and metabolic syndrome increased by 20% (p=0.125). In the patients with NCGS, obesity increased by 5% after the GFD and 20% of those patients presented with de novo hepatic steatosis. The prevalence of obesity decreased by 10% in the controls after the GFD (30 vs 20%, p=0.5) and none of the other components of metabolic syndrome were affected. CONCLUSIONS: The metabolic benefits and risks of a GFD should be considered when prescribing said diet in the different populations that opt for that type of intervention.
21397152	[Dermatitis herpetiformis: a review].	BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a rare auto-immune bullous disease characterized by its almost constant association to gluten sensitivity. OBJECTIVE: Review of literature about epidemiology, physiopathology, clinical data and treatment of DH. METHODS: Research on Medline and Embase database without any time limit until April 2010. Because of the lack of randomized therapeutic trials in DH, retrospective series and case reports have been analyzed. RESULTS: DH is related to auto-antibodies against epidermal transglutaminase, which belongs to the same family as tissue transglutaminase, the auto-antigen of celiac disease. Physiopathology is complex, occurring in HLA DQ2 or DQ8 predisposed patients, and implies gluten, immunological reaction in the intestinal wall then in the skin. DH and celiac disease may be encountered in the same family. DH is characterized by a very pruritic microvesicular eruption typically located on elbows, knees and buttocks. Digestive manifestations of celiac disease occur in 15% of cases. Direct immunofluorescence is necessary to confirm the diagnosis, showing granular IgA+-C3 deposits in the papillary dermis. Circulating IgA and IgG antiendomysium and antitransglutaminase antibodies are detected in almost all patients at the acute phase and follow the clinical course of the disease. Gastro-intestinal endoscopy with multiple duodenal biopsies shows partial or complete villous atrophy in two thirds of cases, intraepithelial lymphocyte infiltrate in the other cases. Other auto-immune diseases may be associated in 10-20% of cases. The main long-term risk is the occurrence of T or B nodal or intestinal tract lymphoma in 2% of cases (relative risk close to 6 in several studies, but not admitted by all authors), especially if adherence to gluten-free diet is not strict. Treatment is based on dapsone, which is quickly efficient on cutaneous manifestations, but not on the digestive involvement and on strict and definitive gluten-free diet, which cures villous atrophy and reduces the risk of lymphoma. CONCLUSION: DH is associated to a gluten enteropathy and its physiopathology is better known. Even if the risk of secondary lymphoma seems little, most of the authors recommend a definitive gluten-free diet.
29146521	HLA-DQ-Gluten Tetramer Blood Test Accurately Identifies Patients With and Without Celiac Disease in Absence of Gluten Consumption.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease is characterized by HLA-DQ2/8-restricted responses of CD4+ T cells to cereal gluten proteins. A diagnosis of celiac disease based on serologic and histologic evidence requires patients to be on gluten-containing diets. The growing number of individuals adhering to a gluten-free diet (GFD) without exclusion of celiac disease complicates its detection. HLA-DQ-gluten tetramers can be used to detect gluten-specific T cells in blood of patients with celiac disease, even if they are on a GFD. We investigated whether an HLA-DQ-gluten tetramer-based assay accurately identifies patients with celiac disease. METHODS: We produced HLA-DQ-gluten tetramers and added them to peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from 143 HLA-DQ2.5+ subjects (62 subjects with celiac disease on a GFD, 19 subjects without celiac disease on a GFD [due to self-reported gluten sensitivity], 10 subjects with celiac disease on a gluten-containing diet, and 52 presumed healthy individuals [controls]). T cells that bound HLA-DQ-gluten tetramers were quantified by flow cytometry. Laboratory tests and flow cytometry gating analyses were performed by researchers blinded to sample type, except for samples from subjects with celiac disease on a gluten-containing diet. Test precision analyses were performed using samples from 10 subjects. RESULTS: For the HLA-DQ-gluten tetramer-based assay, we combined flow-cytometry variables in a multiple regression model that identified individuals with celiac disease on a GFD with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value of 0.96 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.89-1.00) vs subjects without celiac disease on a GFD. The assay detected individuals with celiac disease on a gluten-containing diet vs controls with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value of 0.95 (95% CI 0.90-1.00). Optimized cutoff values identified subjects with celiac disease on a GFD with 97% sensitivity (95% CI 0.92-1.00) and 95% specificity (95% CI 0.84-1.00) vs subjects without celiac disease on a GFD. The values identified subjects with celiac disease on a gluten-containing diet with 100% sensitivity (95% CI 1.00-1.00]) and 90% specificity (95% CI 0.83-0.98) vs controls. In an analysis of 4 controls with positive results from the HLA-DQ-gluten tetramer test, 2 had unrecognized celiac disease and the remaining 2 had T cells that proliferated in response to gluten antigen in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: An HLA-DQ-gluten tetramer-based assays that detects gluten-reactive T cells identifies patients with and without celiac disease with a high level of accuracy, regardless of whether the individuals are on a GFD. This test would allow individuals with suspected celiac disease to avoid gluten challenge and duodenal biopsy, but requires validation in a larger study. Clinicaltrials.gov no: NCT02442219.
26043596	Osteoporosis reversibility in a patient with celiac disease and primary autoimmune hypothyroidism on gluten free diet--a case report.	INTRODUCTION: Secondary osteoporosis occurs in many diseases. Celiac disease-induced osteoporosis is the consequence of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Biochemical bone markers show predominance of bone resorption, thus making the bisphosphonates the first line therapy option. Intestinal mucosal changes are reversible on gluten-free diet. Osteoporosis reversibility is also possible, provided postmenopausal osteoporosis risk factors independent from celiac disease are not present. CASE REPORT: We presented a postmenopausal woman with at least a 10-year history of celiac disease prior to diagnosis, which had overt secondary hyperparathyroidism with insufficient status of vitamin D and a significant bone mass reduction. At the time of diagnosis of celiac disease the patient was receiving 250 mug of levothyroxine daily without achieving optimal substitution. Three years after the initiation of gluten-free diet the patient was without any signs and symptoms of the disease. All laboratory findings were within normal range. It was decided to treat the underlying disease and to supplement calcium and vitamin D without the initiation of bisphosponate therapy. CONCLUSION: Osteoporosis regression justified this therapeutic approach. The presence of primary autoimmune hypothyroidism makes this case specific, since the inability for optimal substitution therapy with a high daily dose of levothyroxine provoked the suspicion of celiac disease.

31009990	Feralgine  a New Approach for Iron Deficiency Anemia in Celiac Patients.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an immunologically-mediated disorder characterized by duodenal mucosa villi atrophy. Iron absorption is usually reduced in celiac patients making every kind of oral iron treatment unhelpful because of malasorption. Feralgine  is a new product that has been demonstrated to be more bioavailable. As such, the aim of our study was to evaluate the absorption of Feralgine  in adult patients with CD. METHODS: Twenty-six adults affected by Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA), of which 14 were also affected by CD and 12 were not affected by CD, were enrolled. An oral iron absorption test (OIAT) was performed in each patient by administrating Feralgine , and serum iron was evaluated at baseline (T0) and after 2 h (T1) from the oral iron ingestion. RESULTS: The OIAT was well tolerated in all patients, and, surprisingly, an equivalent statistically significant improvement in serum iron occurred in the two groups of patients (IDA plus CD: T0 = 28.21 microg/dL vs. T1 = 94.14 microg/dL p = 0.004 and IDA without CD: T0 = 34.91 microg/dL vs. T1 = 118.83 microg/dL, p = 0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated the high absorption of Feralgine  in celiac patients, confirming our previous data obtained with Ferrous Bysglicinate in children with CD.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of celiac disease (CeD) in children with short stature (SS) and growth hormone deficiency (GHD). METHODS: This is a retrospective study of patients with isolated SS and GHD, diagnosed during the period 2002 to 2016. Their medical records were reviewed and serum tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibody results retrieved. Patients with positive serology results underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and small bowel biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of CeD. Clinical, anthropometric, and laboratory data were recorded for all patients. RESULTS: Of the 351 patients identified with GHD, 199 (56.7%) were male. The mean age+-SD was 9.0+-3.7 years (range: 2-17.6 years), and the mean+-SD height-for-age z score was -2.9+-1.3. Partial GHD constituted 42.2% and severe GHD constituted 57.8% of GHD diagnoses. The mean growth hormone (GH) peak level was 5.8+-3.9 ng/ml. Forty-seven patients (13.4%) had positive serology, and 14 (4%) had biopsy-proven CeD. No predictors could be identified through binary logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSION: A prevalence of CeD seropositivity was found in 13.4% and overt CeD in 4% of children with GHD. The finding of GHD should not preclude the search for CeD, because the majority will potentially improve on a gluten-free diet (GFD).
24904927	Graves' disease, Celiac disease and liver function abnormalities in a patient--clinical manifestation and diagnostic difficulties.	Autoimmune diseases due to probable common pathogenesis tend to coexist in some patients. Complex clinical presentation with diverse timing of particular symptoms and sophisticated treatment with numerous side effects, may cause diagnostic difficulties, especially in children. The paper presents diagnostic difficulties and pitfalls in a child with Graves' disease, celiac disease and liver function abnormalities. 
22917169	Celiac disease.	Celiac disease is common, affecting approximately 1 in 100 people, yet it remains underdiagnosed. This article reviews our current understanding of celiac disease, diagnosis, and common pitfalls. Although the cornerstone of treatment is a gluten-free diet, some patients may still have persisting symptoms and warrant further investigations.
31560900	Preparation of Gluten-Free Foods Alongside Gluten-Containing Food May Not Always Be as Risky for Celiac Patients as Diet Guides Suggest.	
28922261	The Effect of Gluten-free Diet on Clinical Symptoms and the Intestinal Mucosa of Patients With Potential Celiac Disease.	In this prospective study, we evaluated the effect of gluten-free diet (GFD) in a cohort of 65 children with potential celiac disease. Patients received GFD for signs/symptoms (N = 47) or parents' choice (N = 18). Most frequent signs/symptoms were low body mass index (36%), recurrent abdominal pain (34%), and diarrhea (19%). Of the 35/47 patients followed-up on GFD, only 54% (19/35) showed a complete clinical response. In 9 of 65 patients an intestinal biopsy was also performed after at least 1 year of GFD. No significant differences were observed in terms of Marsh grade (P = 0.33), lamina propria CD25+ cells (P = 0.80), CD3+ (P = 0.9), and gammadelta+ (P = 0.59) intraepithelial lymphocytes density and intestinal anti-TG2 deposits (P = 0.60). In conclusion, caution is necessary before attributing all symptoms to gluten in this condition.
37806557	Comparison of weekly gluten immunogenic peptide measurement and conventional tools to assess adherence to the gluten-free diet in celiac disease: An observational prospective study.	AIM: Adherence to the gluten-free diet (GFD) is critical to achieve symptom control and mucosal healing in celiac disease (CeD), but its assessment is difficult. We sought to compare stool gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) measurements over a 4-week period with conventional tools commonly used to monitor compliance with a gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: Consecutive adult patients with CeD, attending the Small Bowel Section of the Buenos Aires Gastroenterology Hospital, were invited to this observational study, and were instructed to collect stool samples on Fridays for four consecutive weeks. Weekly average stool GIP concentration was measured was estimated. GIP results were compared with a self-assessment scale of adherence, specific-CeD serology, the celiac symptom index (CSI), and the assessment by expert dietitian. RESULTS: Fifty-three CeD patients were enrolled and those with stool GIP >=0.65 mug/g/week (n=13; 24.5%) had higher serum concentrations of IgA deamidated gliadin peptides (DGP) antibodies (69 [29-109] vs. 14 [13-29]; p=0.0005) and IgA tissue transglutaminase (tTG) (42 [14-200] vs. 10 [7-16]; p=0.02), higher proportion of cases with IgA DGP antibodies >20 AU/mL (84.6% vs. 33.3%; p=0.002), and a higher self-estimated adherence score (5 [4-9] vs. 9 [7-10]; p=0.003). GIP did not correlate with CSI scores (55.6% vs. 30.8%; p=0.9). Expert dietitian assessment identified 69% (OR: 5.25, [95% CI: 1.1-27.2]; p=0.01) of non-adherent cases when high stool GIP. Logistic regression analysis determined that IgA DGP (aOR: 1.1 [95% CI: 1.01-1.11]; p=0.02) and male sex (aOR: 28.3 [95% CI: 1.1-722.6]; p=0.04) were independently associated with excessive gluten exposure. CONCLUSION: Weekly stool GIP identifies gluten exposure that is not always detected by commonly used GFD adherence assessment methods. The higher the level of stool GIP, the better the predictive value of serology and dietitian interview. Stool GIP is a useful and practical test for GFD monitoring, particularly for risky gluten exposure in real life scenario.
25062250	Excitability of the motor cortex in de novo patients with celiac disease.	INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease (CD) may initially present as a neurological disorder or may be complicated by neurological changes. To date, neurophysiological studies aiming to an objective evaluation of the potential central nervous system involvement in CD are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To assess the profile of cortical excitability to Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) in a group of de novo CD patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty CD patients underwent a screening for cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms by means of the Mini Mental State Examination and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders, respectively. Instrumental exams, including electroencephalography and brain computed tomography, were also performed. Cortico-spinal excitability was assessed by means of single and paired-pulse TMS using the first dorsal interosseus muscle of the dominant hand. TMS measures consisted of resting motor threshold, motor evoked potentials, cortical silent period (CSP), intracortical inhibition (ICI) and facilitation (ICF). None of the CD was on gluten-free diet. A group of 20 age-matched healthy controls was used for comparisons. RESULTS: CD showed a significantly shorter CSP (78.0 vs 125.0 ms, p<0.025), a reduced ICI (0.3 vs 0.2, p<0.045) and an enhanced ICF (1.1 vs 0.7, p<0.042) compared to controls. A dysthymic disorder was identified in five patients. The effect size between dysthymic and non-dysthymic CD patients indicated a low probability of interference with the CSP (Cohen's d -0.414), ICI (-0.278) and ICF (-0.292) measurements. CONCLUSION: A pattern of cortical excitability characterized by "disinhibition" and "hyperfacilitation" was found in CD patients. Immune system dysregulation might play a central role in triggering changes of the motor cortex excitability.
30197183	Clinical guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of celiac disease in Mexico.	Celiac disease, celiac sprue, or gluten-sensitive enteropathy, is a generalized autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation and atrophy of the small bowel mucosa. It is caused by dietary exposure to gluten and affects genetically predisposed individuals. In Mexico, at least 800,000 are estimated to possibly have the disease, prompting the Asociacion Mexicana de Gastroenterologia to summon a multidisciplinary group of experts to develop the "Clinical guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of celiac disease in Mexico" and establish recommendations for the medical community, its patients, and the general population. The participating medical professionals were divided into three working groups and were given the selected bibliographic material by the coordinators (ART, LUD, JMRT), who proposed the statements that were discussed and voted upon in three sessions: two voting rounds were carried out electronically and one at a face-to-face meeting. Thirty-nine statements were accepted, and once approved, were developed and revised by the coordinators, and their final version was approved by all the participants. It was emphasized in the document that epidemiology and risk factors associated with celiac disease (first-degree relatives, autoimmune diseases, high-risk populations) in Mexico are similar to those described in other parts of the world. Standards for diagnosing the disease and its appropriate treatment in the Mexican patient were established. The guidelines also highlighted the fact that a strict gluten-free diet is essential only in persons with confirmed celiac disease, and that the role of gluten is still a subject of debate in relation to nonceliac, gluten-sensitive patients.
21826037	Celiac disease: helping patients live gluten-free.	Celiac disease affects approximately 1% of the U.S. population, and many cases go undiagnosed until later in life. A wide range of symptoms, illnesses, and disorders may accompany undiagnosed celiac disease. This article reviews screening, diagnosis, and treatment of celiac disease for the NP.
31401019	No major reduction in bone mineral density after long-term treatment of patients with Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND: At time of diagnosis, patients with celiac disease (CD) have been shown to have lower bone mineral density (BMD) than healthy controls. It is unclear whether adult patients with CD can regain a normal BMD after treatment with a gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: Patients diagnosed with CD as adults, who had been treated with GFD for a minimum of two years, were examined by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to determine BMD at femoral neck and spine L2-4. Adherence to GFD was measured using the Celiac Disease Adherence Test (CDAT) scoring tool. RESULTS: 143 CD patients underwent DXA assessment, mean age was 55.8 years and mean treatment duration was 9.3 years. 67% of the patients were women, and 51% of these were postmenopausal. The prevalence of low bone mass (Z-score <= -1.0) was 18.2% (95%CI: 12.7-25.3%) at femoral neck and 23.1% (95%CI: 16.9-30.6%) at spine L2-4. An increase in low bone density prevalence at spine L2-4 compared to the expected prevalence (p = 0.016) was limited to the postmenopausal women. In a multiple regression analysis, only postmenopausal status and poor adherence to GFD was independently associated with reduced bone density, this however limited to spine L2-4. CONCLUSION: Our study shows a small increase in the prevalence of low bone density at lumbar spine limited to the postmenopausal women. The main finding is that the majority of the CD patients after two years of treatment with GFD had a normal bone density when adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity and weight.
24343635	Celiac crisis in an adult type 1 diabetes mellitus patient: a rare manifestation of celiac disease.	Celiac crisis, an acute severe onset of celiac disease, is a rare and life-threatening manifestation. We report a 30-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes mellitus who arrived at our service with one-month history of severe acute watery diarrhea associated with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and weight loss of 9 kg. The diagnostic hypothesis of celiac crisis was reached based on profuse diarrhea leading to dehydration, severe metabolic and electrolyte abnormalities, and subsequent improvement after introduction of a gluten-free diet. 
25203248	Factors contributing to high levothyroxine doses in primary hypothyroidism: an interventional audit of a large community database.	BACKGROUND: While few hypothyroid patients require more than the expected weight-related dose of levothyroxine, the underlying causes of larger-than-expected dosing requirements have not been studied in a single cohort. Our aim was to determine and quantify the multiple factors contributing to high-dose levothyroxine requirements in a cohort of patients with hypothyroidism. METHODS: The Grampian Automated Follow-Up Register (GAFUR) monitors around 17,500 hypothyroid patients. In 2008, 190 (1%) patients took >225 mug of levothyroxine daily. A questionnaire was sent to 174 patients (16 were untraceable) to assess causes and to offer blood tests for endomysial, parietal cell (PCA), and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) autoantibodies. Primary care practices were contacted for medication details. All patients with positive endomysial autoantibodies were referred to a gastroenterologist. Thyroid function tests and levothyroxine doses were re-evaluated in 2011. RESULTS: A total of 125 questionnaires (72%) were returned. Mean levothyroxine dose was 248 mug daily. Twenty-six patients (20.8%) took medication known to interfere with levothyroxine absorption, and 21 patients (16.8%) admitted to compliance issues. Seven patients had positive anti-endomysial antibodies on initial screening, with four being new diagnoses of celiac disease, and PCA were positive in 27 (21.6%) patients. At follow-up in 2011, the mean levothyroxine dose had decreased in patients on interfering medications and in the four new cases of celiac disease. CONCLUSIONS: Causes of patients needing high-dose levothyroxine replacement include poor compliance, medication interference, PCA (as a marker of atrophic/autoimmune gastritis), and celiac disease. Doses can be decreased following advice regarding medication or after management of underlying conditions.
36469632	Effect of a gluten-free diet on bone mineral density in children and adolescents with celiac disease: Systematic review and meta-analysis.	Studies suggest an association between a gluten-free diet (GFD) and bone health in celiac disease (CD). However, the evidence on this relationship in children and adolescents is limited. Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to analyze the effect of GFD on the bone health and anthropometric profile of children and adolescents with CD. Five databases were searched up to January, 2022 to identify relevant studies. The studies' methodological quality was evaluated using two scales. The Hedge's g standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals were estimated using a random-effects model. The GRADE approach was used to assess the quality of evidence. Twenty-eight studies were included in the final review. GFD increased bone mineral content (BMC) (SMD = 0.39; 95%CI = 0.16, 0.62) and bone mineral density (BMD) (SMD = 0.29; 95%CI = 0.10, 0.47) in CD individuals. Difference in mean BMC and BMD between children and adolescents with CD versus healthy individuals was -0.49 (95%CI = -0.76, -0.22) and -0.47 (SMD = -95%CI = -0.72, -0.22), respectively. There was no difference in BMI and body fat among celiac children and adolescents versus healthy controls. In conclusion, GFD was associated with higher BMC and BMD in children and adolescents with CD.
32466557	The Gluten Free Diet's Impact on Growth in Children with Celiac Disease in Two Different Countries.	The effects of gluten free diet (GFD) on body mass index (BMI) and growth parameters in pediatric patients with celiac disease (CD) and their dependence on different socio-cultural environments are poorly known. We conducted an international retrospective study on celiac patients diagnosed at the University of Verona, Italy, and at the University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA, as underweight. A total of 140 celiac children and 140 controls (mean age 8.4 years) were enrolled in Chicago; 125 celiac children and 125 controls (mean age 7.3 years, NS) in Verona. At time of diagnosis, Italian celiac children had a weight slightly lower (p = 0.060) and a BMI z-score significantly (p < 0.001) lower than their American counterparts. On GFD, Italian celiac children showed an increased prevalence of both underweight (19%) as well as overweight (9%), while American children showed a decrease prevalence of overweight/obese. We concluded that while the GFD had a similar impact on growth of celiac children in both countries, the BMI z-score rose more in American than in Italian celiac children. Additionally, in Italy, there was an alarming increase in the proportion of celiac children becoming underweight. We speculate that lifestyle and cultural differences may explain the observed variations.
30652421	Online education for gluten-free diet teaching: Development and usability testing of an e-learning module for children with concurrent celiac disease and type 1 diabetes.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Celiac disease (CD), the most common genetically-based food intolerance, affects 3% to 16% of children with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Treatment involves lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). Individualized dietary education is resource-intensive. We, therefore, sought to develop and test the usability of an e-learning module aimed at educating patients and caregivers regarding implementation of the GFD in children with concurrent CD and T1D. METHODS: An interactive e-learning module was developed based on extensive review of CD, T1D, and educational literature. A mixed-methods usability testing approach was used to refine and evaluate the module, using qualitative semi-structured interviews, observations, and satisfaction and knowledge questionnaires in two iterative cycles. The module was refined based on themes identified from each usability cycle. RESULTS: Eighteen patients (8 in cycle 1, 10 in cycle 2) and 15 caregivers (7 in cycle 1, 8 in cycle 2) participated. Patient participants had CD and T1D for a mean (SD) of 6.1 +- 5.1 and 8.3 +- 5.5 years, respectively. Their mean age was 13.5 +- 4.5 years. Thematic analysis of usability interviews showed the module to be appealing and resulted in minor module revisions after each cycle to improve usability. Mean satisfaction scores post-module completion were high (4.67 +- 0.54), indicating participants were "very satisfied" with the education. Knowledge test scores increased significantly from pre- to post-module completion (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: A multifaceted user-centered usability approach demonstrated that an innovative, interactive e-learning module is effective in knowledge retention and can provide comprehensive and accessible information in the implementation of the GFD teaching in children with CD and T1D.
26796833	Serologic testing in celiac disease: Practical guide for clinicians.	OBJECTIVE: To address the questions and challenges commonly faced by primary care physicians when ordering serologic tests for celiac disease (CD) and provide practical clinical tips to help in the interpretation of test results. SOURCES OF INFORMATION: MEDLINE was searched from 2000 to 2015 for English-language guidelines on the diagnosis and management of CD published by professional gastroenterological organizations. MAIN MESSAGE: To screen patients for CD, measurement of the immunoglobulin A (IgA) tissue transglutaminase antibody is the preferred test. Total serum IgA level should be measured to exclude selective IgA deficiency and to avoid false-negative test results. Patients with positive serologic test results should be referred to a gastroenterologist for endoscopic small intestinal biopsies to confirm the diagnosis. Testing for human leukocyte antigens DQ2 and DQ8 can help exclude the diagnosis. A gluten-free diet should not be started before confirming the diagnosis of CD. CONCLUSION: Serologic testing is very useful for screening patients with suspected CD. Early diagnosis is essential to prevent complications of CD.
30986791	Rotavirus Vaccination Does Not Increase Type 1 Diabetes and May Decrease Celiac Disease in Children and Adolescents.	BACKGROUND: Rotavirus (RV) infection has been proposed to trigger type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1) and celiac disease (CD) by molecular mimicry in genetically susceptible children. If so, a live attenuated oral RV vaccine could also trigger these autoimmune diseases, or else, prevent the effect of wild-type RV infection. METHODS: In Rotavirus Efficacy and Safety Trial, conducted between 2001 and 2003, the participant children received RotaTeq (Kenilworth, NJ) vaccine or placebo in 1:1 ratio. The surveillance was extended as Finnish Extension Study. A questionnaire was sent in 2015 to the parents of 19,133 Finnish Extension Study participants and 5764 (30%) returned the questionnaire. Diagnosis of DM1, biopsy-proven CD and other autoimmune disease over the 11-14 year period were inquired. RESULTS: At the time of questionnaire, the prevalence of DM1 was similar in both groups, 0.97% (25 of 2580 children) in the placebo group and 1.04% (33 of 3184 children) in the vaccine group (P = 0.810). The prevalence of CD was significantly higher in placebo recipients (1.11%; confidence interval: 0.78%-1.6%) than in vaccine recipients (0.60%; confidence interval: 0.38%-0.93%) (P = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: RV vaccination using RotaTeq did not alter the occurrence of DM1 but decreased the prevalence of CD in childhood and adolescence. We propose that wild-type RV may trigger CD and the triggering effect can be prevented or reduced by RV vaccination.
31146067	Novel Nondietary Therapies for Celiac Disease.	Celiac Disease (CeD) is defined as a chronic small intestinal immune-mediated enteropathy that is precipitated by exposure to dietary gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. CeD is one of the most common autoimmune disorders affecting around 1% of the population worldwide. Currently, the only acceptable treatment for CeD is strict, lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) which can often present a challenging task. A GFD alone is not sufficient to control symptoms and prevent mucosal damage that can result from unintentional gluten exposure. Moreover, long-term complications can occur in many patients. Consequently, there is an unmet need for non-dietary therapies for the management of CeD. Such therapies could serve as an adjunct to the GFD but eventually may replace it. This review will focus on and discuss non-dietary therapies currently in clinical development for the management of CeD. METHODOLOGY: We searched clinicaltrials.gov and PubMed to extract articles about celiac disease. We used keywords including, but not limited to, "celiac disease," "non-dietary," "therapeutics," "pathophysiology," "Endopeptidases," "tight junction modulators," "vaccine," and "Nexvax2". We focused mainly on articles that conducted pathophysiologic and therapeutic research in human trials.
31739176	Effect of analytically measured fiber and resistant starch from gluten-free products on the diets of individuals with celiac disease.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present work was to assess the content of fiber and resistant starch (RS) in several gluten-free products (GFPs), compare them with their gluten-containing analogs (GCP) analytically and with label data, and measure the contribution of these foodstuffs to the fiber content of a gluten-free diet. METHODS: Total dietary fiber and RS content in a large amount of GFP (n = 55) and their counterparts (n = 55) were measured by analytical techniques based on AOAC methods. Dietary assessment was carried out with a sample of 141 individuals (pediatric and adult patients with celiac disease) submitted to a food frequency questionnaire and a 24-h recall survey (three times on different days). RESULTS: In general terms, GFP and GCP showed similar fiber and RS content, with the exception of breads, which revealed a higher percentage of both in GFPs. This food group was the main contributor to fiber intake in both groups of patients. Even if GFPs were to be blamed for being nutritionally poorer than GCPs, this was not the case for fiber. CONCLUSIONS: The fiber and RS content were not different in the studied samples, except for the bread. It is noteworthy that label information can underestimate fiber consumption among those with celiac disease, and this must be considered for future database revision. Additionally, we demonstrated a significant effect on the fiber intake of children and adults due to GFPs, and especially to bread, a widely consumed basic product.
32531982	Intestinal Permeability in Children with Celiac Disease after the Administration of Oligofructose-Enriched Inulin into a Gluten-Free Diet-Results of a Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Pilot Trial.	Abnormalities in the intestinal barrier are a possible cause of celiac disease (CD) development. In animal studies, the positive effect of prebiotics on the improvement of gut barrier parameters has been observed, but the results of human studies to date remain inconsistent. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of twelve-week supplementation of a gluten-free diet (GFD) with prebiotic oligofructose-enriched inulin (10 g per day) on the intestinal permeability in children with CD treated with a GFD. A pilot, randomized, placebo-controlled nutritional intervention was conducted in 34 children with CD, being on a strict GFD. Sugar absorption test (SAT) and the concentrations of intestinal permeability markers, such as zonulin, intestinal fatty acid-binding protein, claudin-3, calprotectin, and glucagon-like peptide-2, were measured. We found that the supplementation with prebiotic did not have a substantial effect on barrier integrity. Prebiotic intake increased excretion of mannitol, which may suggest an increase in the epithelial surface. Most children in our study seem to have normal values for intestinal permeability tests before the intervention. For individuals with elevated values, improvement in calprotectin and SAT was observed after the prebiotic intake. This preliminary study suggests that prebiotics may have an impact on the intestinal barrier, but it requires confirmation in studies with more subjects with ongoing leaky gut.
21029791	Diet improves perception of health and well-being in symptomatic, but not asymptomatic, patients with celiac disease.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: The benefits of serologic screening and early diagnosis of celiac disease in asymptomatic patients are not known. We investigated the impact of a gluten-free diet on self-perceived health and well-being in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with celiac disease. METHODS: We performed a prospective study of 698 consecutive adults newly diagnosed with celiac disease because of classic (n = 490) or extraintestinal (n = 62) symptoms or through screening of at-risk groups (n = 146; 23 were asymptomatic and analyzed separately). The survey included questions on health and well-being; quality of life was evaluated by the psychological general well-being (PGWB) questionnaire. Patients were followed for 1 year of treatment; 110 healthy subjects served as controls. RESULTS: On a gluten-free diet, self-perceived health improved significantly among patients with classic symptoms and those detected by screening. Patients in all groups were equally concerned about their health before the diagnosis, but anxiety was alleviated by the gluten-free diet. At diagnosis, the quality of life reduced among all 3 groups but improved significantly among patients on the diet. Among the 23 asymptomatic patients, perception of health worsened and concern about health increased while they were on the diet. CONCLUSIONS: Self-perceived health and well-being were low among patients at the time they were diagnosed with celiac disease. Most patients benefited from a gluten-free diet, so it is important to identify patients with celiac disease. Perception of health decreased among asymptomatic cases, which discourages population-based screening.
35437007	Biochemical abnormalities among patients referred for celiac disease antibody blood testing in a primary health care setting.	To investigate possible biochemical abnormalities associated with celiac disease (CD) antibody positivity in a primary health care setting and thereby identify predictors that could potentially reduce diagnostic delay and underdiagnosis of CD. This observational cohort study included measurements of CD antibodies in the Copenhagen Primary Care Laboratory (CopLab) database from 2000 to 2015; CD antibody positivity was defined as tissue transglutaminase antibody IgA or IgG >= 7 kU/L and/or deamidated gliadin peptide antibody IgG >= 10 kU/L. Individuals with a prior diagnosis of CD were excluded. We examined differences between individuals with positive and negative CD antibody tests regarding the results of biochemical tests performed six months before and one month after the date of the CD antibody test. We identified 76,265 measurements of CD antibodies during 2000-2015, and 57,061 individuals met the inclusion criteria (706 antibody-positive and 56,355 antibody-negative). We found lower ferritin, hemoglobin, cobalamin and folic acid levels and higher levels of transferrin, ALAT (alanine transaminase), and alkaline phosphate among individuals with a positive CD antibody test. Furthermore, we illustrated more measurements below the sex-specific reference intervals for hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), ferritin, cobalamin and folic acid among individuals with a positive CD antibody test. This study identified several biochemical abnormalities associated with CD antibody positivity among individuals referred to CD antibody testing. The pattern of abnormalities suggested that micronutrient deficiencies were prevalent among CD antibody-positive individuals, confirming malabsorption as a sign of CD. These findings illustrate the possibility of reducing diagnostic delay and underdiagnosis of CD.
32397695	Pilot study on non-celiac gluten sensitivity: effects of Bifidobacterium longum ES1 co-administered with a gluten-free diet.	BACKGROUND: Bifidobacterium longum ES1 is a strain probiotic, colonizing the human gut and capable of a degradative action on gliadin. In an attempt to find new nutritional solutions aimed at improving the quality of life of patients with non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) we evaluated the effectiveness of this strain, in association with a gluten-free diet, comparing its efficacy versus diet therapy alone. METHODS: The experimental design included a non-randomized, open-label, 1:1 intervention study in parallel groups. Enrolled patients with symptoms attributable to NCGS, and with negative diagnoses of both wheat allergy and celiac disease, were included in this three-month trial divided into four outpatient visits (baseline, T1, T2 and T3). Fifteen patients for each group completed the experimental protocol. RESULTS: Our results showed that a combination of diet and probiotic determined a more significant reduction in the frequency and intensity of intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms, and a clear improvement in stool consistency. CONCLUSIONS: Although the study was carried out on a small number of patients, the results of our pilot trial suggest that a combined strategy of naturally gluten-free diet therapy with administration of the probiotic strain ES1 appears to offer a greater advantage than the dietary regime alone in improving the clinical symptomatic picture and in stabilizing the intestinal microbiota.
29534461	Assessment of Mycotoxin Exposure in Breastfeeding Mothers with Celiac Disease.	OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk of mycotoxin exposure (aflatoxin M1, ochratoxin A, and zearalenone) in celiac disease (CD) breastfeeding mothers and healthy control mothers, as well as in their offspring, by quantifying these contaminants in breast milk. STUDY DESIGN: Thirty-five breastfeeding women with CD on a gluten-free diet and 30 healthy breastfeeding controls were recruited. Milk sampling was performed three times per day for three consecutive days. Mycotoxin content was investigated by an analytical method using immunoaffinity column clean-up and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorometric detection. RESULTS: Aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) was detected in 37% of CD group samples (mean +- SD = 0.012 +- 0.011 ng/mL; range = 0.003-0.340 ng/mL). The control group showed lower mean AFM1 concentration levels in 24% of the analyzed samples (0.009 +- 0.007 ng/mL; range = 0.003-0.067 ng/mL, ANOVA on ranks, p-value < 0.01). Ochratoxin A and zearalenone did not differ in both groups. CONCLUSION: Breast milk AFM1 contamination for both groups is lower than the European safety threshold. However, the estimated exposures of infants from CD mothers and control mothers was much higher ( 15 times and  11 times, respectively) than the threshold set by the joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). Since incongruities exist between JECFA and the European Union standard, a novel regulatory review of the available data on this topic is desirable. Protecting babies from a neglected risk of high AFM1 exposure requires prompt regulatory and food-control policies.
31203642	[Quality of life of consumers following a gluten-free diet. Results of a questionnaire survey in Hungary and Romania].	Introduction and aim: With the rising consumer's health awareness, especially towards patients with celiac disease, gluten has become a food ingredient to be avoided by many people expecting various positive health effects. The strict adherence of diet requires serious abandonments and lifestyle changes that affect directly their quality of life. The aim of the present study was to recognise the quality of life of Hungarian and Romanian consumers following a gluten-free diet as well as to explore the negative effects on them. Method: An online questionnaire survey was conducted upon 1155 Hungarian and Romanian respondents. Results: For gluten-free consumers, self-control was relatively easy to overcome, but their lifestyle was negatively affected by social events and dining out. In addition, diet adherence was a burden from both lifestyle and financial point of view. For Hungarian consumers, external factors such as price, choice, taste and availability of products had become a major obstacle, while Romanian ones were more likely to be affected by internal factors (product information, diet knowledge, lifestyle, self-control). Mandatory labelling of substances and products causing allergies and intolerances has achieved its purpose, as it has made it easier for consumers on diet to choose food and increased their confidence. Conclusions: The study points out that dieters' quality of life can be enhanced not only by general actions (improving the preparedness of out-of-home meal services and rationalising the price of products), but also through country-specific community intervention.

33407153	Non-celiac wheat sensitivity: rationality and irrationality of a gluten-free diet in individuals affected with non-celiac disease: a review.	Non-celiac gluten or wheat sensitivity (NCWS) is a "clinical entity induced by the ingestion of wheat leading to intestinal and/or extraintestinal symptoms that improve once the wheat-containing foodstuff is removed from the diet, and celiac disease and wheat allergy have been excluded". This mostly accepted definition raises several points that remain controversial on this condition. In the present review, the authors summarize the most recent advances in the clinic and research on NCWS through an accurate analysis of different studies. We screened PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Scopus using the keywords "non-celiac gluten sensitivity", "non-celiac wheat sensitivity", and "diagnosis". We would like to emphasize two main points, including (A) the controversial clinical and etiological aspects in different trials and experiences with particular attention to the Salerno criteria for the diagnosis of NCWS and (B) the histological aspects. The etiology of NCWS remains controversial, and the relationship with irritable bowel syndrome is obscure. Histologically, the duodenal mucosa may show a variable pattern from unremarkable to a slight increase in the number of T lymphocytes in the superficial epithelium of villi. The endorsement of this disease is based on a positive response to a gluten-free diet for a limited period, followed by the reappearance of symptoms after gluten challenge. The Salerno expert criteria may help to diagnose NCWS accurately. Social media and inaccurate interpretation of websites may jeopardize the diagnostic process if individuals self-label as gluten intolerant.
24152755	The gluten-free diet: testing alternative cereals tolerated by celiac patients.	A strict gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only currently available therapeutic treatment for patients with celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder of the small intestine associated with a permanent intolerance to gluten proteins. The complete elimination of gluten proteins contained in cereals from the diet is the key to celiac disease management. However, this generates numerous social and economic repercussions due to the ubiquity of gluten in foods. The research presented in this review focuses on the current status of alternative cereals and pseudocereals and their derivatives obtained by natural selection, breeding programs and transgenic or enzymatic technology, potential tolerated by celiac people. Finally, we describe several strategies for detoxification of dietary gluten. These included enzymatic cleavage of gliadin fragment by Prolyl endopeptidases (PEPs) from different organisms, degradation of toxic peptides by germinating cereal enzymes and transamidation of cereal flours. This information can be used to search for and develop cereals with the baking and nutritional qualities of toxic cereals, but which do not exacerbate this condition. 
21120001	[Ischemic stroke revealing celiac disease].	
21621928	[Clinical manifestations of adult celiac disease].	Celiac disease is an enteropathy due to gluten intake in genetically predisposed persons (HLA DQ2/DQ8). Celiac disease occurs in adults and children at rates approaching 1% of population in Europe and USA. Celiac disease is extremely various and anaemia, oral aphthous stomatis, amenorrhea or articular symptoms may be the only revealing symptoms. Diagnosis releases on evidence of histological villous atrophy in proximal small bowel and presence of specific serum antibodies. Treatment relies on eviction of gluten. Gluten free diet allows prevention of malignant complications such as small bowel adenocarcinoma and lymphoma and osteopenia. The main cause of resistance to gluten free diet is its bad observance. On the contrary, serious complications of celiac disease, such as clonal refractory celiac sprue and intestinal T-cell lymphoma need to be screen.

34959996	Compliance to a Gluten-Free Diet in Swedish Children with Type 1 Diabetes and Celiac Disease.	Children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are at increased risk of celiac disease (CD). The replacement of insulin in T1D, and the exclusion of gluten in CD, are lifelong, burdensome treatments. Compliance to a gluten-free diet (GFD) in children with CD is reported to be high, while compliance in children with both diseases has scarcely been studied. To examine compliance to a GFD in children with both T1D and CD, we analyzed tissue transglutaminase IgA-antibodies (tTGA). Moreover, associations between compliance and age, sex, glycemic control, ketoacidosis (DKA), body mass index (BMI), and time of CD diagnosis were investigated. Of the 743 children diagnosed with T1D in southern Sweden between 2005 and 2012, 9% were also diagnosed with CD. Of these, 68% showed good compliance to a GFD, 18% showed intermediate compliance, and 14% were classified as non-compliant. Higher age, poorer HbA1c, and more DKAs were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with poorer compliance. In conclusion, we found that compliance to a GFD in children with T1D and CD is likely be lower than in children with CD only. Our results indicate that children with both T1D and CD could need intensified dietary support and that older children and children with poor metabolic control are especially vulnerable subgroups.
36984425	Celiac Disease and the Gluten Free Diet during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Experiences of Children and Parents.	The COVID-19 pandemic perturbed the everyday life of children and those with chronic illnesses, along with the lives of their families. Patients with celiac disease (CD) follow a strict gluten-free diet (GFD), and gluten ingestion is associated with negative health outcomes. The aim of this study was to investigate the experiences of children with CD and their families concerning their GFD, symptoms and CD management during the first period of the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was performed including 37 Dutch pediatric patients with CD, along with their parents. The majority reported good compliance to the GFD and stated that the diet was easier to follow during the pandemic, mainly due to eating more meals in the home. Some discovered a greater variety of GF products by utilizing online shopping, potentially increasing the financial burden of the GFD. Concerning general dietary habits, 21.6% reported a healthier eating pattern, in contrast to 37.8% and 10.8% who consumed more unhealthy snacks and fewer fruits and vegetables, respectively, than normal during the pandemic. The natural experiment of the COVID-19 pandemic provides valuable information regarding the management of pediatric CD. Education on healthy dietary patterns is important, especially for children with restrictive diets, and the findings of this study show that there is room for improvement in this respect, regardless of the current pandemic.
36569268	Prevalence of functional gastrointestinal disorders in children with celiac disease on different types of gluten-free diets.	BACKGROUND: Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are common during the pediatric age. FGIDs are not related to biochemical or structural abnormalities. However, since they have a high prevalence, several studies have evaluated an overlap between FGIDs and organic diseases. Individuals with celiac disease (CD) have been shown to be at an increased risk for functional abdominal pain, even if they adhere well to a gluten-free diet (GFD). Little information is available for the pediatric age group. The aims of our study were to evaluate the prevalence of FGIDS in CD children 1 year after diagnosis and to compare the prevalence of FGIDs in CD children on a GFD with processed foods compared with those on a GFD with natural products. AIM: To assess the prevalence of FGIDs in children with CD after 1 year of follow-up and to compare the prevalence of FGIDs in children with CD on a GFD with processed foods and in children on a GFD with natural products. METHODS: We recruited pediatric patients aged 1-18 years with a new CD diagnosis. Participants were randomized to two groups: Group A on a GFD with processed foods (diet 1); and group B on a GFD with natural products (diet 2). Clinical monitoring, diet assessment and the questionnaire on pediatric gastrointestinal symptoms-Rome IV version were performed at diagnosis (T0) and after 12 mo of follow-up (T1). Dietary intake was assessed using a 3-d food diary record. Data from the diaries were evaluated using WinFood nutrient analysis software. We assessed the prevalence of FGIDs at T1 and the correlation with the type of GFD. RESULTS: We registered 104 CD children, with 55 patients in group A (53.0%) and 49 patients in group B (47.0%). Initially, 30 of the 55 (54.5%) CD children were symptomatic in group A, while 25 of 49 (51.0%) were symptomatic in group B. At T1, in spite of a low or negative serology for CD, FGIDs prevalence was 10/55 (18.0%) in group A and 8/49 (16.3%) in group B, with no statistically significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.780). At T1 the macro- and micronutrient intake was similar across the two groups with no significant differences in nutrient analysis. However, in both groups at T1 we found that a lower prevalence of FGIDs (P = 0.055) was associated with an inferior caloric (odds ratio = 0.99, 95% confidence interval: 0.99-1.00) and fat (odds ratio = 0.33, 95% confidence interval: 0.65-0.95) intake. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that CD children on a GFD have gastrointestinal symptoms with an elevated prevalence of FGIDs. Our study suggests that developing FGIDs may be linked to caloric intake and percentage of food fat, but it does not change between a GFD with processed foods or a GFD with natural products. However, long-term monitoring is required to evaluate a correlation between FGIDs and various types of GFDs.
31729208	How diabetes type 1 affects immune response to hepatitis B virus vaccine in pediatric population? Evaluation of a booster dose in unresponsive subjects with type 1 diabetes.	BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine reduced the incidence of Hepatitis B worldwide. Genetic variability , by the presence of specific haplotypes of HLA system (HLA-DR3, HLA-DR4) , influences the response to the vaccination. Subjects affected by T1D, contrary to non-diabetics, have a high prevalence of Hepatitis B. METHODS: The objective of the study was to evaluate anti-HBs antigen (anti-HBsAg) antibody (Ab) in a group of 201 children (age range: 2 - 18 years), regularly vaccinated against HBV according to the national vaccination schedule. Patients with anti-HBs Ab >=10 mlU/mL have been defined "Responders" and those with anti-HBs Ab<10mlU/mL have been defined "Non-Responders".The possible association between the Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) and a low immune response to the vaccine has been subsequently valued. Besides the presence of T1D, other possible influential variables have been studied: sex, age, presence of celiac disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis, intervening years from the diagnosis of diabetes and presence/absence of diabetic ketoacidosis at time of diagnosis. RESULTS: Among the 201 subjects with type 1 diabetes, 90 (44.8%) were Responders, while 111 (55.2%) were non-Responders; among the 145 subjects without type 1 diabetes, 86 (59.3%) were Responders and 59 (40.7%) non-Responders. We invited "Subjects with type 1 diabetes Non-Responders" to undergo a booster dose of the same vaccine. Of these, 21 refused the booster, reducing the sample to 90 patients. After 4 weeks from the booster dose 81 patients showed seroconversion ("false Non-Responders"), and 9 did not("true Non-Responders"). CONCLUSIONS: After the booster dose, immune response in our cross-section has been similar to general population. Given the high frequency of "false Non-Responders" anti-HBsAg Ab should be tested in T1D patients and a booster dose should be administrated in Non-Responders.
22649917	Gluten and gluten-free: issues and considerations of labeling regulations, detection methods, and assay validation.	Gluten is a commonly used cereal derivative found in bakery products, among other items. In some susceptible individuals, however, it triggers immune responses of different kinds; there is, to a lesser extent, the wheat allergy that is immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated and leads to histamine release and typical allergic symptoms. In this case, other water-soluble proteins, like albumins, are also involved. On the other hand, there is, more frequently, celiac disease (CD), where the gluten causes immune reactions in the intestines of certain individuals, leading to degeneration of villi, which typically leads to malabsorption of nutrients and, consequently, malnutrition. The only currently effective health strategy for affected consumers is avoidance of gluten-containing products, based on clear labeling rules. However, despite unanimously accepted Codex definitions by all member jurisdictions, the national implementation of equivalent laws shows significant differences. In the context of CD and in support of the gluten-free statement, regulatory enforcement, as well as manufacturers' quality controls are mostly based on analytical results. However, numerous methods are available, some of which have been validated better than others, and many provide different results on identical samples. Reasons include detection of different gluten components and variability in extraction efficiency due to different buffer compositions, especially from processed foods. Last but not least, the lack of reference materials is hindering the process of generating comparable data across different ELISA kits, as well as other methods. How can such data still be used to support a gluten-free claim? New methodologies, in particular mass spectrometric analysis of gluten derived peptides, are being introduced in numerous laboratories. This methodology is not only capable of detecting gluten derived peptides but can also differentiate between and quantitate wheat, barley, rye, and oat. This paper presents analytical limitations, as well as promising new approaches in support of industry and enforcement activities to ensure compliance with the gluten-free claim under the current regulatory framework.
32574219	Characterization of white and red sorghum flour and their potential use for production of extrudate crisps.	In the human food industry, the wheat-free market sales have increased over the years due to awareness of wheat gluten allergy and celiac disease. Sorghum is a gluten-free grain with great potential to address shortcomings in this market. The aim of this study was to evaluate the milling process and flour quality of one white and one red sorghum varieties and evaluate extrusion as a potential process to produce sorghum crisps. The white and red sorghum grains were milled into flour in three production cycles. Flour quality was evaluated by determination of nutritional composition, pasting, and thermal profile. Extrusion processing of white and red sorghum flour was performed, and macrostructure of final product was evaluated. The white and red sorghum used in this study yielded similar flour content (P > 0.05). Chemical analyses revealed a higher protein and lower starch content for white sorghum than red sorghum flour (P < 0.05); however, their pasting properties did not differ. Initial and peak gelatinization temperatures were higher (P < 0.05) for red sorghum compared to white sorghum flour. Regarding particle size, white sorghum flour presented lower d10 and d50 compared to the red sorghum flour (P < 0.05). However, these differences did not impact the extrusion conditions, and white and red sorghum crisps had similar macrostructure characteristics. In conclusion, although differences in nutritional, thermal, and particle size properties were observed between the sorghum flours used in this study, changes in extrusion parameters were not needed in order to produce sorghum crisps with similar characteristics.
37610566	Experiences and difficulties for primary caretakers of children with celiac disease - A qualitative study.	BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to understand the experiences of primary caretakers (PCTs) with a child diagnosed with celiac disease (CeD). There is paucity of research in understanding the experiences of PCTs of children with CeD in India. METHODS: Purposive sampling was used to select PCTs of CeD-affected children from a tertiary hospital in New Delhi. Ten PCTs took part in the investigation. To gather the data, semi-structured interviews were held with participants. Hindi was used to administer the interviews. RESULTS: The current study focused on the difficulties and worries PCTs experience in managing CeD. The main themes and sub-themes that emerged from the data were diagnosis of CeD (misdiagnosis of CeD, late diagnosis of CeD, feelings at the time of diagnosis, help from a doctor/nutritionist at the time of diagnosis); characteristics of CeD (CeD as a new disease, CeD as an allergy); attitude towards wheat (wheat as a poison, ignorance regarding negative effect of wheat); influence of significant others (making fun of the child, queries from others are a source of worry, non-acceptance of celiac disease by others and pressure to give gluten to the child); issues in following gluten-free diet (GFD) (fear of cross-contamination, distrust on GFD available outside home, GFD is expensive, making GFD is difficult, joint family, non-adherence to GFD, making non-GFD along with GFD); effect of CeD (financial effect of CeD, effect on physical and mental health of the child and PCT, effect on social life, change in family dynamics, eating restrictions); management of CeD (GFD for the whole family to manage CeD, family support to manage CeD, adhering to GFD, early diagnosis); and concerns (future marital concern for the child, cure of CeD, proper physical growth). CONCLUSION: The current study gave an understanding of how PCTs dealt with a child's CeD. The difficulties and worries of caretakers should be taken into consideration and appropriate recommendations made to lessen the strain of managing the child's CeD and the daily obstacles associated with it.
24369335	Celiac disease and common variable immunodeficiency: a familial inheritance?	
26355401	Nonceliac Gluten Sensitivity.	Nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is the clinical term used to describe gastrointestinal (GI) and/or extraintestinal symptoms associated with gluten ingestion. The prevalence of NCGS is unknown. The condition has clinical features that overlap with those of celiac disease (CD) and wheat allergy (WA). The pathophysiologic process in NCGS is thought to be through an innate immune mechanism, whereas CD and WA are autoimmune- and allergen-mediated, respectively. However, dietary triggers other than gluten, such as the fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols, have been implicated. Currently, no clinical biomarker is available to diagnose NCGS. Exclusion of CD and WA is necessary in the evaluation of a patient suspected to have NCGS. The onset of symptoms in patients with NCGS can occur within hours or days of gluten ingestion. Patients with NCGS have GI and extraintestinal symptoms that typically disappear when gluten-containing grains are eliminated from their diets. However, most patients suspected to have NCGS have already initiated a gluten-free diet at the time of an evaluation. A gluten elimination diet followed by a monitored open challenge of gluten intake to document recurrence of GI and/or extraintestinal symptoms can sometimes be helpful. If NCGS is strongly suggested, then a skilled dietitian with experience in counseling on gluten-free diets can provide proper patient education. Additional research studies are warranted to further our understanding of NCGS, including its pathogenesis and epidemiology, and to identify a biomarker to facilitate diagnosis and patient selection for proper management. 
31977451	Is Peer Support in Group Clinics as Effective as Traditional Individual Appointments? The First Study in Patients With Celiac Disease.	INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease (CD) is common, affecting approximately 1% of the population. The cornerstone of management is a gluten-free diet, with dietetic advice being the key to aiding implementation. The aim of the study was to assess group clinics in comparison with traditional individual appointments. METHODS: Patients with a new diagnosis of CD, confirmed histologically, were prospectively recruited over 18 months in Sheffield, United Kingdom. Patients received either a group clinic or traditional one-to-one appointment, led by a dietitian. Quality-of-life questionnaires were completed at baseline, as well as biochemical parameters being recorded. Patients were followed up at 3 months, where adherence scores were assessed as well as biochemical parameters and quality of life questionnaires being completed. RESULTS: Sixty patients with CD were prospectively recruited and received either an individual (n = 30) or group clinic (n = 30). A statistically significant reduction in tissue transglutaminase was noted following group clinics (mean 58.5, SD 43.4 U/mL vs mean 13.2, SD 5.7 U/mL, P < 0.01). No significant differences in baseline and follow-up biochemical parameters between one-to-one and group clinics were noted. At follow-up, there was no statistically significant difference between mean gluten-free diet adherence scores (mean 3.1, SD 0.4 vs mean 3.1, SD 0.7, P = 0.66) between one-to-one and group clinics. DISCUSSION: This first study assessing group clinics in CD demonstrates they are as effective as traditional one-to-one clinics, with the added benefits of peer support and greater efficiency, with an estimated 54% reduction of dietetic resources.

38309373	Celiac disease and depressive disorders as nutritional implications related to common factors - A comprehensive review.	Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated disease affecting the small intestine. The only treatment strategy for CD is the gluten-free diet (GFD). One of the more common mental disorders in CD patients is major depressive disorder (MDD). The influence of GFD on the occurrence of MDD symptoms in patients with CD will be evaluated. This diet often reduces nutritional deficiencies in these patients and also helps to reduce depressive symptoms. Both disease entities are often dominated by the same deficiencies of nutrients such as iron, zinc, selenium, iodine, or B and D vitamins. Deficiencies of particular components in CD can favor MDD and vice versa. Gluten can adversely affect the mental state of patients without CD. Also, intestinal microbiota may play an important role in the described process. This work aims to comprehensively assess the common factors involved in the pathomechanisms of MDD and CD, with particular emphasis on nutrient imbalances. Given the complexity of both disease entities, and the many common links, more research related to improving mental health in these patients and the implementation of a GFD would need to be conducted, but it appears to be a viable pathway to improving the quality of life and health of people struggling with CD and MDD. Therefore, probiotics, micronutrients, macronutrients, and vitamin supplements are recommended to reduce the risk of MDD, given that they may alleviate the symptoms of both these disease entities. In turn, in patients with MDD, it is worth considering testing for CD.
37049545	The Role of Diet in Children with Psoriasis: Emerging Evidence and Current Issues.	Psoriasis is an immune-mediated inflammatory systemic disease with skin tropism and chronic relapsing course; it is associated with an increased cardiovascular risk and with many metabolic comorbidities, emerging during childhood in 22-33% of cases. Diet influences the presentation and the clinical course of inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis; in particular, it was shown that a Mediterranean, gluten-free, or low-calorie diet may positively affect disease control in adult patients with psoriasis and adequate pharmacological therapy. These three dietary regimens may play a role also in children with psoriasis. It has been demonstrated that pediatric psoriasis is associated with psychological stress, celiac disease, and obesity, which may be positively influenced by these dietary regimens, respectively. Therefore, the expertise of multiple health figures (gastroenterologists, nutritionists, pediatricians, dermatologists) is required to plan a tailor-made dietary strategy, ensuring good growth, through an adequate intake of essential micro- and macronutrients and, at the same time, impacting the pro-inflammatory biochemical profile and on the associated cardiovascular risk of psoriasis disease.
35980500	Baking Process Effects and Combined Cowpea Flour and Sorghum Bran on Functional Properties of Gluten-Free Cookies.	Gluten-related disorders, including celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity, are growing worldwide. The only treatment for both disorders is a lifelong gluten-free diet. However, gluten-free foods are generally poorer in nutrients, less healthy, and have a high cost. Sorghum and cowpea are gluten-free grains with high levels of phenolic compounds (PC) and a low cost. Their phenolic profile is structurally different; thus, the blend of both can provide synergistic/complementary health benefits to the final product. This study analyzed the effect of baking process and the blend of cowpea flour (CP) and sorghum bran (SB) on the levels of PC, resistant starch (RS), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and antioxidant capacity (AC) of gluten-free cookies. Eleven rice or cowpea cookie formulations were made with or without white sorghum bran (WSB) or black sorghum bran (BSB). Baking increased the extractability of PC, AC, and the NDF of almost all formulations. The PC and AC were, respectively, about twice and 3-5 times higher in cookies containing BSB compared to the others. There was a minor effect of WSB on the PC and AC. Although there were losses, the retention of RS of cookies after the baking process was between 49.8 and 92.7%. Sorghum bran has excellent potential for use as a functional ingredient in healthy food production. The combined CP and SB have great potential to improve the nutritional and functional properties of gluten-free products, especially the PC, RS, and NDF contents.
24227505	Diagnosis and management of refractory celiac disease: a systematic review.	BACKGROUND: Refractory celiac disease is defined by persisting malabsorptive symptoms in spite of a strict gluten free diet for at least 6 to 12 months. Alternatives to gluten free diet seem to be still controversial. AIM: To describe the clinical and epidemiologic aspects of refractory celiac disease, and to identify therapeutic options in this condition. METHODS: Systematic review and critical analysis of observational studies, clinical trials and case reports that focused on diagnosis and management of refractory celiac disease. RESULTS: Refractory celiac disease can be classified as type 1 or type 2 according to the phenotype of intraepithelial lymphocytes. Great complications such as enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma may occur in a subgroup of these patients mainly in refractory celiac disease type 2. Curative therapies are still lacking. CONCLUSION: Refractory celiac disease remains a diagnosis of exclusion. Its prognosis remains still dismal by the absence yet of curative therapies. However, some new treatments seem to hold promise during few cohort-studies.
22673312	Gastrointestinal symptoms and quality of life in screen-detected celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: Active serological screening has proved an effective means of increasing the diagnostic rate in celiac disease. The effects of a long-term gluten-free diet on possible gastrointestinal symptoms and psychological well-being in screen-detected patients have nevertheless remained obscure. METHODS: Abdominal symptoms and quality of life were measured in a large cohort of treated screen-detected celiac adults. Comparisons were made with corresponding symptom-detected patients and with non-celiac controls. Dietary adherence was assessed both by structured interview and by serological testing. RESULTS: In both screen- and symptom-detected celiac groups, 88% of the patients were adherent. On a diet, both screen- and symptom-detected patients reported significantly more gastrointestinal symptoms than non-celiac controls. Those screen-detected patients who reported having no symptoms at the time of diagnosis, also remained asymptomatic during the diet. Despite persistent symptoms, psychological well-being in screen-detected patients was comparable with that in non-celiac controls, whereas the symptom-detected patients showed lower quality of life. CONCLUSION: Long-term treated screen-detected celiac patients, especially women, suffer from gastrointestinal symptoms on a gluten free diet similarly to symptom-detected patients. However, despite a similar frequency of persistent symptoms, the quality of life was unimpaired in the screen found, but remained low in the symptom-detected group.
33198516	The potential benefits of camps for children and adolescents with celiac disease on social support, illness acceptance, and health-related quality of life.	Among N = 165 14-22-year-old bearers of celiac disease (CD), the German-based study examined if participation in camps for children with CD is related to higher CD-related quality of life (CD-QoL); N = 48 of the study participants attended at least one camp. Camp participation was found to be related to higher CD-QoL, an effect mediated by having more friends with CD and by perceiving higher social support. Camp participation was also associated with higher illness acceptance and lower anxiety. Results show the potential benefits of recreational activities in CD treatment, to be further examined in experimental research.
25448145	An unusual ophthalmic finding in Lane-Hamilton syndrome.	Lane-Hamilton syndrome is a rare condition that is characterized by idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis and celiac disease. We report the case of an 18-month-old girl with Lane-Hamilton syndrome who had unilateral pigmentary retinopathy. 
21933881	Psychiatric comorbidities in women with celiac disease.	OBJECTIVE: Although the physical consequences of Celiac Disease are well studied, less is known about co-occurring psychiatric symptoms. This study examines psychiatric risk and comorbidities of women with Celiac Disease, who may be at increased risk for psychiatric symptoms (e.g. depression, and disordered eating behaviours). METHODS: Women (N = 177) with Celiac Disease responded to an extensive web-mediated survey assessing dietary compliance, illness symptoms, psychiatric functioning, and disordered eating. RESULTS: Despite high reported dietary compliance, patients reported marked illness symptoms and impaired quality of life. A substantial minority endorsed symptoms that met criteria for the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders: 37% (n = 65) met the threshold suggesting depression, and 22% (n = 39) for disordered eating. Participants whose symptoms exceeded these clinical thresholds reported greater perceived stress and reduced overall mental health, relative to women below the clinical cutoffs. CONCLUSIONS: Despite largely adhering to a gluten-free diet, a substantial subset of women with Celiac Disease report clinically relevant symptoms of depression and disordered eating; such symptoms are associated with increased psychosocial distress in other domains. These results suggest potential to improve the patient well-being through attention to psychosocial care, in addition to existing dietary recommendations for individuals with Celiac Disease.
25716069	Treatment response in enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma; survival in a large multicenter cohort.	Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL) is a T-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma which is highly associated with celiac disease. The prognosis of EATL has been considered poor and there are no standardized treatment protocols. Here, we evaluate treatment response and survival of EATL patients in a large multicenter cohort. A total of 61 patients diagnosed with EATL were analyzed. Various treatment regimens were applied in EATL during the past fifteen years including either monotherapy consisting of chemotherapy or resection, or combination therapy with both aforementioned regimens whether or not combined with stem-cell transplantation (SCT). Overall, 50/61 patients (82%) died after a median of 7.4 months. One- and five-year overall survival was 40 and 11%, respectively. Median follow-up in the survivors was 26 months. Patients treated with the most aggressive treatment, that is, resection, chemotherapy and autologous SCT, showed the most favourable outcome with complete remission in all patients, the lowest relapse rate and one- and five-year overall survival of 100 and 33%, respectively, although overall survival in this group was not significantly better as compared to patients treated with surgery and chemotherapy. This study indicates that combination treatment is superior compared to monotherapy. Whether or not consolidation therapy with autologous SCT may improve survival needs to be substantiated in a larger randomized international trial.
22760575	Variable activation of immune response by quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) prolamins in celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is an enteropathy triggered by dietary gluten found in wheat, barley, and rye. The current treatment is a strict gluten-free diet. Quinoa is a highly nutritive plant from the Andes, with low concentrations of prolamins, that has been recommended as part of a gluten-free diet; however, few experimental data support this recommendation. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the amount of celiac-toxic prolamin epitopes in quinoa cultivars from different regions of the Andes and the ability of these epitopes to activate immune responses in patients with celiac disease. DESIGN: The concentration of celiac-toxic epitopes was measured by using murine monoclonal antibodies against gliadin and high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits. Immune response was assessed by proliferation assays of celiac small intestinal T cells/interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and production of IFN-gamma/IL-15 after organ culture of celiac duodenal biopsy samples. RESULTS: Fifteen quinoa cultivars were tested: 4 cultivars had quantifiable concentrations of celiac-toxic epitopes, but they were below the maximum permitted for a gluten-free food. Cultivars Ayacuchana and Pasankalla stimulated T cell lines at levels similar to those for gliadin and caused secretion of cytokines from cultured biopsy samples at levels comparable with those for gliadin. CONCLUSIONS: Most quinoa cultivars do not possess quantifiable amounts of celiac-toxic epitopes. However, 2 cultivars had celiac-toxic epitopes that could activate the adaptive and innate immune responses in some patients with celiac disease. These findings require further investigation in the form of in vivo studies, because quinoa is an important source of nutrients for patients with celiac disease.
34418405	Current pharmacological approaches and potential future therapies for Celiac disease.	Celiac Disease (CeD) is estimated to currently affect 2 million Americans in the United States. This autoimmune disorder occurs when the consumption of gluten-based products leads to an inflammatory response in the small intestine. Over time, this inflammatory response permanently damages the villi in the small intestine. Celiac disease patients generally present with fatigue, diarrhea, and weight loss due to the disease. The current gold standard for diagnosing CeD is the endoscopy with duodenal biopsy indicating villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia. No FDA-approved medication exists for the treatment of CeD and the only recommended course to alleviate CeD induced symptoms is to abstain from consuming any gluten-based products. There are several clinical trials actively developing and testing pharmacological approaches to treat CeD. Two of the further advanced clinical trials include AT-1001 (Larazotide acetate) and IMGX-003 (Latiglutenase; formerly known as ALV003) therapies. These drugs aim to alleviate celiac disease-induced symptoms using two different approaches. AT-1001 aims to close the villi's tight junctions, while IMGX-003 acts as a gluten endopeptidase that degrades gluten before being absorbed in the small intestine. This review article summarizes the various preclinical research and clinical trials being conducted and specifies the mechanism by which these drugs function.
37049494	The Impact of Different Types of Rice and Cooking on Postprandial Glycemic Trends in Children with Type 1 Diabetes with or without Celiac Disease.	The aims of this study were to evaluate: (i) the chemical and nutritional composition of rice before and after cooking and (ii) postprandial glycemic impacts in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) after eating two different types of rice ("Gigante Vercelli" white rice and "Artemide" black rice) or white rice cooked "risotto" style or boiled using an advanced hybrid closed loop (AHCL) system (Tandem Control-IQTM). General composition and spectrophotometric analyses of raw and cooked rice were performed. Eight T1D subjects (four males and four females, aged 11 +- 1.4 years), two with celiac disease (CD), using an AHCL system were enrolled. "Gigante Vercelli" white rice cooked as risotto or boiled and boiled "Artemide" rice were prepared by the same cook on two evenings. Continuous glucose monitoring metrics were evaluated for 12 h after meal consumption. Total dietary fiber was higher for both rice types after cooking compared with raw rice. Cooking as risotto increased polyphenols and antioxidants (p < 0.05) in both rice varieties, and total starch decreased after boiling (p < 0.05) in white rice. There was a significant peak in glycemia after consuming risotto and boiled white rice (p < 0.05), while the mean glycemic peak remained <180 mg/dL in individuals eating boiled Artemide rice. There were no significant differences in automatic basal or auto-bolus insulin deliveries by the AHCL according to different types of rice or cooking method. Our findings suggest that glycemic trends are impacted by the different chemical and nutritional profiles of rice but are nevertheless well controlled by AHCL systems.
29851812	Diagnostic challenges of celiac disease in a young child: A case report and a review of the literature.	RATIONALE: Celiac disease is a chronic, immune-mediated, multiorgan disorder that affects susceptible individuals, and it is triggered by gluten and other prolamins. PATIENT CONCERNS: We present the case of a 1-year-old male child, with a history of idiopathic pericardial effusion, admitted in our clinic for severe abdominal bloating, irritability, loss of appetite and intermittent diarrheic stools. The clinical findings were: influenced general status, irritability, distended abdomen, and diffuse abdominal tenderness. DIAGNOSES: The initial laboratory tests revealed anemia, leukocytosis, increased inflammatory biomarkers, high levels of transaminases, and hypoalbuminemia. The stool culture identified an enterocolitis with enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (E. coli). INTERVENTIONS: We initiated antibiotic treatment, substitution therapy with human albumin and probiotics with initial favorable evolution, but after 1 month, the patient was re-admitted for the persistence of intermittent diarrheic stools and abdominal bloating, when we established the diagnosis of cow's milk protein allergy. We initiated diary-free diet. OUTCOMES: Unfortunately, the patient was re-admitted after another 8 months, presenting the same clinical and laboratory findings as during the initial admission. We repeated the serology for celiac disease and we performed an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with duodenal biopsies, which established the diagnosis of celiac disease. After 1 month of gluten-free diet, the patient's evolution improved considerably. LESSONS: Enterocolitis with E. coli could be considered as trigger for CD in our case. The diagnosis of CD in small children can be hindered by an insufficient gluten-exposure, and can lead to a delay in the diagnosis as in the case presented above.
37497810	A dietitian-led coeliac service helps to identify and reduce involuntary gluten ingestion with subsequent reduction in the frequency of repeat endoscopies.	BACKGROUND: Dietitian-led coeliac clinics have the potential to be a cost-effective way of monitoring patients living with coeliac disease (CD). The aim of this service evaluation was to explore the impact of a dietitian-led coeliac clinic on gluten-free diet (GFD) adherence and the frequency of endoscopies with repeat duodenal biopsies. METHODS: Adults with biopsy-proven CD were transferred to a new dietitian-led coeliac clinic where data were collected from medical records and analysed using SPSS. GFD adherence was assessed by a specialist dietitian, specialist nurse, consultant gastroenterologists and a validated GFD adherence questionnaire. Repeat duodenal biopsy findings were compared with the most recent dietitian GFD adherence assessment. Project and ethics approval was granted by the hospital trust and affiliated university. RESULTS: Data from 170 patients (White: 51%, South Asian: 45%) are presented, with most being 35-64 years old (61%). Specialist dietitian assessments identified 67 (39%) of patients were adhering to the GFD, whereas prior gastroenterologist or coeliac nurse assessments identified 122 (72%) (p < 0.001) and the validated GFD adherence questionnaire identified 97 (57%) (p < 0.001). Dietitian assessments identified involuntary gluten consumption in 39/104 (38%) of those who self-reported GFD adherence, consequently avoiding the need for nine endoscopies with repeat duodenal biopsies once patients had received dietary education from the dietitian. On follow-up, within the dietitian-led coeliac clinic, significantly fewer patients consumed gluten involuntarily (14%, p < 0.001). In addition, a reduction in voluntary gluten consumption was observed from three to five to one to two times per month (p < 0.001) in 66 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The dietitian-led coeliac clinic helped to identify involuntary gluten ingestion, avoid repeat endoscopies with duodenal biopsies and was associated with significantly improved GFD adherence.
32546313	Impact of a gluten-free diet on patients with celiac disease, nonceliac gluten sensitivity, and asymptomatic controls. A need for healthier gluten-free foods.	
22566329	[National survey on school lunches and demand of special diets].	INTRODUCTION: It is well known that to improve the feeding of the students it would improve its health and wellbeing, contributing to the reduction of the risk of chronic diseases in adults. In Spain, this is especially important considering the data of prevalence of infantile obesity. OBJECTIVES: To know the number of users of school cafeterias in Spain as well as different considerations on its management, nutritional supervision and the number of special diets served to students with specific requirements due to pathologies or other causes. RESULTS: The II national Survey has been realized on school cafeterias: 7,710 used daily by 678,587 users. They provide near the 2.8% of special diets (allergies 38.9%, other pathologies 23.2%, religious causes 26.7% causes and celiac disease 11.1%). CONCLUSIONS: The numbers of prevalence of obesity and infantile overweight indicate that it is necessary to improve the diet of the students.
29562387	Spastic paraparesis revealing celiac disease.	
27322016	Current and novel therapeutic strategies in celiac disease.	INTRODUCTION: A gluten free diet (GFD) is the only available treatment for celiac disease (CD). However many patients fail to respond fully clinically or histologically. Several surveys highlight the psychosocial implications of adherence to a GFD. Hence, efforts are ongoing to develop therapeutic strategies beyond a GFD. AREAS COVERED: We conducted a search of PubMed and clinicaltrials.gov to extract articles on CD using keywords including 'celiac disease' and 'refractory celiac disease' (RCD) and focused on articles conducting pathophysiologic and therapeutic research in/ex-vivo models and human trials. We highlight novel therapeutics that manipulate these mechanisms including tight junction regulators, glutenases, gluten sequestrants and immunotherapy using vaccines, nanoparticles that may serve as adjuncts to a GFD or more ambitiously to allow for gluten consumption. We also highlight the role of anti-inflammatories, immunosuppressants and monoclonal antibodies in RCD. Expert commentary: Therapeutics including tight junction regulators, glutenases have the potential to be approved for non-responsive CD or as gluten adjuncts. We expect results of various phase 1/2 trials using AMG 714, BL 7010, IgY antibodies to be published. In the interim, off-label use of 5 amino-salicylates, budesonide, nucleoside analogues and newer biologics developed for other inflammatory diseases will be used in RCD.
32316404	Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Gluten-Related Disorders.	Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is frequently associated with celiac disease (CD) and nonceliac gluten/wheat sensitivity (NCGS/NCWS), but epidemiological and pathophysiological aspects are still unclear. Furthermore, a gluten-free diet (GFD) can positively influence IBS symptoms. Methods: A comprehensive online search for IBS related to CD, NCGS and GFD was made using the Pubmed, Medline and Cochrane databases. Results: Although a systematic screening for CD in IBS is not recommended, CD prevalence can be increased in diarrhea-predominant IBS patients. On the other hand, IBS symptoms can be persistent in treated CD patients, and their prevalence tends to decrease on a GFD. IBS symptoms may overlap and be similar to those associated to nonceliac gluten and/or wheat sensitivity. Increased gut permeability could explain the gluten/wheat effects in IBS patients. Finally, a GFD could improve symptoms in a subgroup of IBS patients. Conclusions: The possible interplay between IBS and gluten-related disorders represents a scientifically and clinically challenging issue. Further studies are needed to confirm these data and better clarify the involved pathophysiological mechanisms.
29392873	Gluten-free diet during pregnancy alleviates signs of diabetes and celiac disease in NOD mouse offspring.	BACKGROUND: Gluten-free (GF) diet during pregnancy ameliorates autoimmune diabetes in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse offspring. Due to comorbidity of celiac disease in type 1 diabetes, we hypothesized that GF diet in utero alleviates the humoral and histopathological signs of celiac disease in NOD mice. We aimed to establish the mechanisms behind the diabetes-protective effect of GF diet in utero. METHODS: Breeding pairs of NOD mice were fed a GF or gluten-containing standard (STD) diet until parturition. The offspring were nursed by mothers on STD diet and continued on this diet until ages 4 and 13 weeks. Analyses of serum antitissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) intestine and islet histology, islet transglutaminase (TG) activity, and cytokine expression in T cells from lymphoid organs were performed. RESULTS: GF versus STD diet in utero led to reduced serum anti-tTG titre and increased villus-to-crypt ratio at both ages. Insulitis along with systemic and local inflammation were decreased, but islet TG activity was unchanged in 13-week-old GF mice. These mice had unchanged beta-cell volumes, but increased islet numbers throughout the prediabetic period. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, GF diet administered during pregnancy improves signs of celiac disease and autoimmune diabetes in the offspring. The diabetes-ameliorative effect of GF diet in utero is followed by dampening of inflammation, unchanged beta-cell volume, but increased islet numbers.
34071870	Pandemic Effects and Gluten-Free Diet: An Adherence and Mental Health Problem.	The COVID-19 pandemic has been present for many months, influencing diets such as the gluten-free diet (GFD), which implies daily challenges even in non-pandemic conditions. Persons following the GFD were invited to answer online ad hoc and validated questionnaires characterizing self-perceptions of the pandemic, current clinical condition, dietary characteristics, adherence to GFD, anxiety, and depression. Of 331 participants, 87% experienced shortage and higher cost of food and 14.8% lost their jobs. Symptoms increased in 29% and 36.6% failed to obtain medical help. Although 52.3% increased food preparation at home and purchased alternative foodstuffs, 53.8% had consumed gluten-containing foods. The Health Eating Index was intermediate/"needs improvement" (mean 65.6 +- 13.3 points); in 49.9% (perception) and 44.4% (questionnaire), adherence was "bad". Anxiety and depression scores were above the cutoff in 28% and 40.4%, respectively. Adherence and mental health were strongly related. The likelihood of poor adherence was 2.3 times higher (p < 0.004) in participants declaring that pandemic altered GFD. Those suffering depressive symptoms were 1.3 times more likely to have poor adherence (p < 0.000). Depression and faulty GFD (mandatory for treatment) appear, affecting a high proportion of participants, suggesting that support measures aimed at these aspects would help improve the health condition of people that maintain GFD. Comparisons of data currently appearing in the literature available should be cautious because not only cultural aspects but conditions and timing of data collection are most variable.
37704112	Standardizing Randomized Controlled Trials in Celiac Disease: An International Multidisciplinary Appropriateness Study.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: There is a need to develop safe and effective pharmacologic options for the treatment of celiac disease (CeD), however, consensus on the appropriate design and configuration of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in this population is lacking. METHODS: A 2-round modified Research and Development/University of California Los Angeles Appropriateness Method study was conducted. Eighteen gastroenterologists (adult and pediatric) and gastrointestinal pathologists voted on statements pertaining to the configuration of CeD RCTs, inclusion/exclusion criteria, gluten challenge, and trial outcomes. Two RCT designs were considered, representing distinct clinical scenarios for which pharmacotherapy may be used: (1) trials incorporating a gluten challenge to simulate exposure; and (2) trials evaluating reversal of histologic changes despite attempted adherence to a gluten free diet (GFD). Each statement was rated as appropriate, uncertain, or inappropriate, using a 9-point Likert scale. RESULTS: For trials evaluating prevention of relapse after gluten challenge, participants adherent to a GFD for >=12 months with normal/near-normal-sized villi should be enrolled. Gluten challenge should be FODMAP-free, and efficacy evaluated using histology with a secondary patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure. For trials evaluating reversal of villus atrophy, the panel voted it appropriate to enroll participants with a baseline villus height:crypt depth ratio of <=2, and measure efficacy using a primary histologic endpoint. Guidance for measuring histologic, endoscopic, and PRO outcomes in adult and pediatric patients with CeD are provided, along with recommendations regarding the merits and limitations of different endpoints. CONCLUSION: We developed standardized recommendations for clinical trial design, eligibility criteria, outcome measures, gluten challenge, and disease evaluations for RCTs in patients with CeD.
22922421	Large granular lymphocytic leukemia: a treatable form of refractory celiac disease.	Large granular lymphocyte leukemia (LGL) is characterized by clonal expansion of CD3+ T cells or CD3(-) natural killer cells and frequently is associated with autoimmune diseases. We describe 2 patients with celiac disease who no longer responded to gluten-free diets after they developed T-cell LGL, with intestinal localization of malignant lymphocytes. Flow cytometry phenotyping of isolated intestinal intraepithelial and lamina propria cells eliminated type II refractory celiac disease, identifying large-sized CD8(+)CD57(+) T cells. Treatment with a combination of cyclosporine and methotrexate restored the patients' sensitivity to gluten-free diets. LGL therefore might be a cause of refractory celiac disease that is sensitive to immunosuppressive therapy.
30445682	Beneficial Effect of Oligofructose-Enriched Inulin on Vitamin D and E Status in Children with Celiac Disease on a Long-Term Gluten-Free Diet: A Preliminary Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Nutritional Intervention Study.	Prebiotics have been shown to improve absorption of some nutrients, including vitamins. This pilot study evaluated the effect of the prebiotic oligofructose-enriched inulin (Synergy 1) on fat-soluble vitamins status, parathormone, and calcium-related elements in pediatric celiac disease (CD) patients (n = 34) on a strict gluten-free diet (GFD). Participants were randomized into a group receiving 10 g of Synergy 1 or placebo (maltodextrin) together with a GFD. At baseline and after 3 months of intervention, 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], parathormone, vitamin E and A, calcium, phosphate, magnesium, total protein, and albumin were determined. Concentration of 25(OH)D increased significantly (p < 0.05) by 42% in CD patients receiving Synergy 1 in GFD, whereas no change was observed in placebo. Vitamin D status reached an optimal level in 46% of patients receiving Synergy 1. No significant difference in parathormone, calcium, and phosphate levels was observed. Concentration of vitamin E increased significantly (p < 0.05) by 19% in patients receiving Synergy 1, but not in the placebo. Vitamin A levels were not changed. Supplementation of GFD with Synergy 1 improved vitamin D and vitamin E status in children and adolescents with CD and could be considered a novel complementary method of management of fat-soluble vitamins deficiency in pediatric CD patients.
34019354	[Development of a daily diet for children with celiac disease in municipal pre-school educational institutions].	Improving the quality of nutrition for children with gluten intolerance in preschool institutions is an important state task. Relevant adjustment of the diet enables to reduce the risk of the celiac syndrome. Balanced nutrient composition of diet is necessary for the harmonious growth and development of a child. The aim of the research was to develop specialized diet for children with gluten intolerance and celiac desease in municipal preschool educational institutions. Material and methods. A study of the 10-days full-day menu of children aged 3 to 7 years was carried out. To compose the specialized menu, we used the computational program "MDOU Calculate menu. Universal program for kindergarten". Technological maps of dishes in municipal preschool educational institutions were used. The calculation of the supply of the diet with vitamins, minerals and trace elements and the deviation of the nutritional and energy value of the diet from the recommended daily intake was made. Results. The necessity of developing a specialized diet for children 3-7 years old with a confirmed diagnosis of celiac disease, as well as for children on a gluten-free diet has been substantiated. A specialized daily food ration has been developed, consisting of four meals. Analysis of the nutritional and energy value of the dishes offered in the menu showed the minimum deviation of the obtained indicators from recommended daily intake. The necessity of introducing the developed diet into the system of specialized nutrition in preschool educational institutions has been substantiated. Conclusion. The results of the work indicate that under the conditions of state funding, there is a possibility of adjusting the existing food rations for the full-fledged socialization of children with various diseases.
25944582	Mucosal immunity induced by gliadin-presenting spores of Bacillus subtilis in HLA-DQ8-transgenic mice.	The induction of mucosal immunity requires efficient antigen delivery and adjuvant systems. Probiotic bacterial strains are considered to be very promising tools to address both of these needs. In particular, Bacillus subtilis spores are currently under investigation as a long-lived, protease-resistant adjuvant system for different antigens. Furthermore, a non-recombinant approach has been developed based on the stable adsorption of antigen on the spore surface. In the present study, we explored this strategy as a means of modulating the immune response to wheat gliadin, the triggering agent of celiac disease (CD), an enteropathy driven by inflammatory CD4(+) T cells. Gliadin adsorption was tested on untreated or autoclaved wild-type (wt) and mutant (cotH or cotE) spores. We found that gliadin was stably and maximally adsorbed by autoclaved wt spores. We then tested the immune properties of the spore-adsorbed gliadin in HLA-DQ8-transgenic mice, which express one of the two HLA heterodimers associated with CD. In vitro, spore-adsorbed gliadin was efficiently taken up by mouse dendritic cells (DCs). Interestingly, gliadin-pulsed DCs efficiently stimulated splenic CD4(+) T cells from mice immunised with spore-adsorbed gliadin. Nasal pre-dosing with spore-adsorbed gliadin failed to down-regulate the ongoing cellular response in gliadin-sensitised DQ8 mice. Notably, naive mice inoculated intranasally with multiple doses of spore-adsorbed gliadin developed an intestinal antigen-specific CD4(+) T cell-mediated response. In conclusion, our data highlight the ability of spore-adsorbed gliadin to elicit a T-cell response in the gut that could be exploitable for developing immune strategies in CD. 
30527260	Oat safety for celiac disease patients: theoretical analysis correlates adverse symptoms in clinical studies to contaminated study oats.	Inclusion of oats in a gluten-free (GF) diet can provide whole grain nutritional benefits to celiac disease (CD) patients, but there has been debate regarding oat safety for these individuals. This is because of conflicting research findings, with inconsistencies attributed to varying CD subject's sensitivities to "pure" oats. Clinical trials to date have assumed oats provided to subjects to be lightly contaminated, if at all. This assumption is challenged here since oat's propensity to be "kernel" contaminated with gluten sources like wheat and barley has recently been shown to significantly complicate confirmation of a GF state. We therefore hypothesize that clinical studies may have inadvertently provided pill-like gluten kernels intermittently to study subjects, leading to adverse outcomes that could potentially explain inconsistencies between study conclusions. To test this theory, potential gluten contamination of oats used in a cross-section of 12 important oat feeding studies has been estimated, done according to descriptions of oats used, published contamination rates for various oat types, and study oat dosages. Expected gluten exposures were found to be at levels to elicit clinical effects in a large portion of CD patients, correlating with observed clinical reaction rates in those studies (P value = .0006). Estimated gluten doses were found insufficient, however, to affect morphological outcomes, whereas only 1 study had 1 case. Our analysis provides a new perspective with which to view oat safety study conclusions and justifies new clinical trials using today's higher-purity GF oats to settle the oat safety for CD patient debate.
35031683	The double-edged sword of gut bacteria in celiac disease and implications for therapeutic potential.	Celiac disease (CeD) is an immune-mediated disease, triggered by gluten ingestion, in genetically susceptible individuals. The gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only current treatment for CeD, but is difficult to follow, has high non-adherence rates, and does not always lead to symptomatic or mucosal remission. Microbially-mediated mechanisms have been proposed to contribute to disease pathogenesis, and clinical studies support an association, but mechanistic insight has been difficult to obtain. Recent advances using translational approaches have provided clues to the mechanisms through which bacteria could contribute to CeD pathogenesis. In this review we discuss these bacterially mediated mechanisms, which include the modulation of pathogenic or protective pathways. Targeting these pathways through microbial therapeutics could provide adjuvant therapies to the GFD.
32752175	Current Evidence on the Efficacy of Gluten-Free Diets in Multiple Sclerosis, Psoriasis, Type 1 Diabetes and Autoimmune Thyroid Diseases.	In this review, we summarize the clinical data addressing a potential role for gluten in multiple sclerosis (MS), psoriasis, type 1 diabetes (T1D) and autoimmune thyroid diseases (ATDs). Furthermore, data on the prevalence of celiac disease (CD) and gluten-related antibodies in the above patient groups are presented. Adequately powered and properly controlled intervention trials investigating the effects of a gluten-free diet (GFD) in non-celiac patients with MS, psoriasis, T1D or ATDs are lacking. Only one clinical trial has studied the effects of a GFD among patients with MS. The trial found significant results, but it is subject to major methodological limitations. A few publications have found beneficial effects of a GFD in a subgroup of patients with psoriasis that were seropositive for anti-gliadin or deamidated gliadin antibodies, but no effects were seen among seronegative patients. Studies on the role of gluten in T1D are contradictive, however, it seems likely that a GFD may contribute to normalizing metabolic control without affecting levels of islet autoantibodies. Lastly, the effects of a GFD in non-celiac patients with ATDs have not been studied yet, but some publications report that thyroid-related antibodies respond to a GFD in patients with concomitant CD and ATDs. Overall, there is currently not enough evidence to recommend a GFD to non-celiac patients with MS, psoriasis, ATDs or T1D.
26826905	Celiac disease in a large cohort of children and adolescents with recurrent headache: A retrospective study.	BACKGROUND: The clinical picture of celiac disease is changing with the emergence of subclinical forms and growing evidence reporting associated neurological disorders. AIMS: To establish the prevalence of celiac disease in children suffering from recurrent headache. METHODS: In our retrospective study we collected charts from 1131 children attending our tertiary care Centre for Paediatric Headache over the period 2001-2012. They were screened for celiac disease and positive patients were referred to our Operative Unit for Coeliac disease and confirmed positive children underwent upper endoscopy with multiple duodenal biopsies. Celiac children started a gluten-free diet. RESULTS: 883 children (481 females; median age, 9.8 years, range 3-19) performed celiac disease screening, and among them, 11 children (7 females; median age, 8.2 years, range: 4.8-13.9) were diagnosed with celiac disease. Seven children (5 females, median age, 11.9 years, range: 10.3-13.9) had been diagnosed as celiac prior to the neurological evaluation. The prevalence of celiac disease in our sample is 2.04% vs. 1.2% of the general population (p=0.034). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates, on a large series, that celiac disease prevalence is doubled in patients with chronic headache. Screening for celiac disease could be advised as part of the diagnostic work-up in these paediatric patients, particularly among pharmacological non-responders.
30688709	Is Adherence to a Gluten-Free Diet by Adult Patients With Celiac Disease Influenced by Their Knowledge of the Gluten Content of Foods?	The aim of this study was to investigate adherence to a gluten-free diet and potentially associated factors, focusing on the relationship between adherence and knowledge of the gluten content of foods and of celiac disease in general. A questionnaire was completed by adult patients diagnosed with celiac disease including demographics, dietary practices, sources of information, and attitude to the disease. Their knowledge of disease and gluten-free diet was assessed using a newly developed scale comprising 31 statements on celiac disease in general and foods appropriate in a gluten-free diet. A validated questionnaire was used to measure adherence to diet. One hundred four patients with celiac disease took part in the study, 65% of them reported strictly adhering to a gluten-free diet. Factors associated with adherence were membership of the Italian Celiac Association and receiving support from this association, Internet, and social media. Patients' knowledge regarding celiac disease and gluten-free diet was generally poor: one patient answered all questions correctly. Knowledge of celiac disease and gluten-free diet was strongly and significantly associated with adherence to a gluten-free diet. The association between knowledge of celiac disease and gluten-free diet in patients with celiac disease and their adherence to the diet suggests the promotion of education and behavioral programs.
32575561	Effect of Gluten-Free Diet on Gut Microbiota Composition in Patients with Celiac Disease and Non-Celiac Gluten/Wheat Sensitivity.	Celiac disease (CD) and non-celiac gluten/wheat sensitivity (NCG/WS) are the two most frequent conditions belonging to gluten-related disorders (GRDs). Both these diseases are triggered and worsened by gluten proteins ingestion, although other components, such as amylase/trypsin inhibitors (ATI) and fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs), seem to be involved in the NCG/WS onset. Therefore, the only effective treatment to date is the long-life adherence to a strictly gluten-free diet. Recently, increasing attention has been paid to the intestinal barrier, a dynamic system comprising various components, which regulate the delicate crosstalk between metabolic, motor, neuroendocrine and immunological functions. Among the elements characterizing the intestinal barrier, the microbiota plays a key role, modulating the gut integrity maintenance, the immune response and the inflammation process, linked to the CD and NCG/WS outbreak. This narrative review addresses the most recent findings on the gut microbiota modulation induced by the gluten-free diet (GFD) in healthy, CD and NCG/WS patients.
38474812	Trends in Faecal Zonulin Concentrations in Paediatric Patients with Celiac Disease at Baseline and on a Gluten-Free Diet: Exploring Correlations with Other Faecal Biomarkers.	Celiac disease (CeD) is an autoimmune condition triggered by gluten in genetically predisposed individuals, affecting all ages. Intestinal permeability (IP) is crucial in the pathogenesis of CeD and it is primarily governed by tight junctions (TJs) that uphold the intestinal barrier's integrity. The protein zonulin plays a critical role in modulating the permeability of TJs having emerged as a potential non-invasive biomarker to study IP. The importance of this study lies in providing evidence for the usefulness of a non-invasive tool in the study of IP both at baseline and in the follow-up of paediatric patients with CeD. In this single-centre prospective observational study, we explored the correlation between faecal zonulin levels and others faecal and serum biomarkers for monitoring IP in CeD within the paediatric population. We also aimed to establish reference values for faecal zonulin in the paediatric population. We found that faecal zonulin and calprotectin values are higher at the onset of CeD compared with the control population. Specifically, the zonulin levels were 347.5 ng/mL as opposed to 177.7 ng/mL in the control population (p = 0.001), while calprotectin levels were 29.8 mug/g stool compared to 13.9 mug/g stool (p = 0.029). As the duration without gluten consumption increased, a significant reduction in faecal zonulin levels was observed in patients with CeD (348.5 ng/mL vs. 157.1 ng/mL; p = 0.002), along with a decrease in the prevalence of patients with vitamin D insufficiency (88.9% vs. 77.8%). We conclude that faecal zonulin concentrations were higher in the patients with active CeD compared with healthy individuals or those following a gluten-free diet (GFD). The significant decrease in their values over the duration of the GFD suggests the potential use of zonulin as an additional tool in monitoring adherence to a GFD.
30888750	Hepatitis B virus vaccination and revaccination response in children diagnosed with coeliac disease : a multicentre prospective study.	AIM: This study evaluates hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination response in children with celiac disease (CD). Response in initial non-responders after a single booster vaccination as well as factors influencing HBV vaccination response were evaluated. METHODOLOGY: Anti-hepatitis B surface antibodies (a-HBsAB) were checked in all children with CD and a documented complete HBV vaccination. An a-HBsAB <10 U/L was considered as non-response. A single intramuscular HBV-vaccine booster was advised to all non-responders. Response was checked at the next appointment. RESULTS: 133 children with CD were included, median age of 7.3 years (range 1.7-17.3) and 46 (35%) were male. The age at CD diagnosis was 6.0 years (range 1.1-15.7). HBV non-response was documented in 55% (n=73/133). No other factors were influencing the response. A booster was documented in 34/73 (47 %) initial non-responders (3 refused (4%), 36 (49%) had no follow up). Response after booster vaccination resulted in immunity in 22/34 (65%) and persisting non-response in 12/34 (35%). A single booster is able to reduce non-response from 55% (73/133) to 23% (22/94). CONCLUSION: A significantly lower immune response following HBV vaccination in children with CD was confirmed. A single intramuscular booster vaccination is able to induce a serologic response in two thirds of the initial non-responders. Control of HBV vaccination response has to become part of the follow-up in CD patients.
21539065	[Role of antibodies in celiac disease after one year of treatment to predict the adherence to gluten-free diet].	INTRODUCTION: The celiac disease (CD) is characterized by a permanent sensitivity to gluten. The treatment for this disease is the life-long strict compliance with a gluten-free diet (GFD). The average of compliance with GFD ranges between 15% and 80%. Antibodies' role in the follow up of these patients regarding the adherence to the GFD is not well established. Objective. To determine the relationship between the antibodies for CD and the adherence to the GFD in patients with over a year of treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with CD with a minimum of one year of GFD were prospectively included They were asked to complete a self-survey regarding to the compliance to GFD and the level of adherence was determined: low (no compliance or more than 2 gluten intakes per week), medium (1 or 2 gluten intakes per week or 2 or 3 gluten intakes per month), or high (1 gluten intake per month or less than 3 intakes per year). The follow up was performed by their general practitioners. From one year of GFD onwards, the results of the available antibodies at the time of the last follow up were assessed: antigliadine IgA (AGA) and IgG (AGG), anti-endomysium IgA (EMA) and IgG (EMG), anti-transglutaminase (ATG), and deaminated peptides of gliadine IgA and IgG, considering them as positive or negative. Through an univariate analysis, the above-mentioned antibodies were correlated (independent variables) in order to identify predicting factors of high and low adherence to the GFD (dependent variables). RESULTS: Ninety patients were analyzed, age 43.6 +/- 15.3 years old, 89% women, 58% classic celiacs. The average time of GFD was 7.9 years and 63% had been on a GFD for over 3 years. A 71% of patients (95% CI 69%-80%) showed high adherence to the GFD, and a 67% (95% CI 2%-13%) showed low adherence. GFD of less than 3 years was a determining factor for low adherence [relative risk (RR) 2.41 (95% CI 1.2-2.89)]. The predictive antibodies for GFD high adherence were: (1) negative EMA [RR 1.27 (95% CI 1.03-1.54)], (2) negative ATG [RR 1.62 (95% CI 1.12-2.47)], and (3) all negative requested ones [RR 1.60 (95% CI 1.17-2.18)]. The predictive antibodies for GFD low adherence were: (1) positive AGA [RR 15.5 (95% CI 2.29-105)], (2) positive EMA [RR 10.2 (95% CI 2.19-47.7)], (3) positive ATG [RR 9.63 (95% CI 1.53-63.4)], and 4) all negative requested ones [RR 0.11 (95% CI 0.018-0.71)]. CONCLUSION: After one year of treatment, the negativity of EMA or ATG antibodies had a significant correlation with the high adherence to GFD and the positivity of AGA, EMA or ATG antibodies had a significant correlation with a low adherence.
26901502	Health-related quality of life and determinant factors in celiac disease. A population-based analysis of adult patients in Spain.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) has a negative impact on the health-related quality of life (HRQL) of affected patients. Although HRQL and its determinants have been examined in Spanish CD patients specifically recruited in hospital settings, these aspects of CD have not been assessed among the general Spanish population. METHODS: An observational, transversal study of a non-randomized, representative sample of adult celiac patients throughout all of Spain's Autonomous Regions. Subjects were recruited through celiac patient associations. A Spanish version of the self-administered Celiac Disease-Quality of Life (CD-QOL) questionnaire was used. Determinant factors of HRQL were assessed with the aid of multivariate analysis to control for confounding factors. RESULTS: We analyzed the responses provided by 1,230 patients, 1,092 (89.2%) of whom were women. The overall mean value for the CD-QOL index was 56.3 +- 18.27 points. The dimension that obtained the most points was dysphoria, with 81.3 +- 19.56 points, followed by limitations with 52.3 +- 23.43 points; health problems, with 51.6 +- 26.08 points, and inadequate treatment, with 36.1 +- 21.18 points. Patient age and sex, along with time to diagnosis, and length of time on a gluten-free diet were all independent determinant factors of certain dimensions of HRQL: women aged 31 to 40 expressed poorer HRQL while time to diagnosis and length of time on a gluten-free diet were determinant factors for better HRQL scores. CONCLUSIONS: The HRQL of adult Spanish celiac subjects is moderate, improving with the length of time patients remain on a gluten-free diet.
28451915	Obesity, Metabolic Syndrome, and Cardiovascular Risk in Gluten-Free Followers Without Celiac Disease in the United States: Results from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2009-2014.	BACKGROUND: Despite unclear benefits of gluten-free diets (GFD) in the general population, gluten-free followers without medical indications are driving the market. Few studies have investigated health benefits of GFD in the general population. AIMS: To estimate metabolic and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk profiles among gluten-free followers without celiac disease (CD). METHODS: Data were obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2009-2014. There were 13,523 persons without CD who had GFD information. People with known CVD were excluded. We compared gluten-free followers without CD and the general population by selective metabolic and CVD risk profiles using survey-weighted generalized logistic regression. RESULTS: There were 155 gluten-free followers without CD and CVD, corresponding to a weighted prevalence of 1.3% (3.2 million Americans). Gluten-free followers tended to be women and have a smaller waist circumference and higher HDL cholesterol. They also had a lower BMI with a borderline p value (0.053) and significant self-reported weight loss (-1.33 kg) over one year. Moreover, gluten-free followers were more likely to consider their weight appropriate. There was no statistical difference by age, smoking, hypertension, total cholesterol, triglyceride cholesterol, HbA1c, or fasting glucose. Despite a lower probability of having metabolic syndrome (33.0 vs 38.5%) and lower 10-year CVD risk score (4.52 vs 5.70%) in gluten-free followers, there was no statistical difference. CONCLUSIONS: Although being on a GFD may be beneficial in weight management, there was no significant difference in terms of prevalence of metabolic syndrome and CVD risk score in gluten-free followers without CD.
26287240	Intestinal Microbiota and Celiac Disease: Cause, Consequence or Co-Evolution?	It is widely recognized that the intestinal microbiota plays a role in the initiation and perpetuation of intestinal inflammation in numerous chronic conditions. Most studies report intestinal dysbiosis in celiac disease (CD) patients, untreated and treated with a gluten-free diet (GFD), compared to healthy controls. CD patients with gastrointestinal symptoms are also known to have a different microbiota compared to patients with dermatitis herpetiformis and controls, suggesting that the microbiota is involved in disease manifestation. Furthermore, a dysbiotic microbiota seems to be associated with persistent gastrointestinal symptoms in treated CD patients, suggesting its pathogenic implication in these particular cases. GFD per se influences gut microbiota composition, and thus constitutes an inevitable confounding factor in studies conducted in CD patients. To improve our understanding of whether intestinal dysbiosis is the cause or consequence of disease, prospective studies in healthy infants at family risk of CD are underway. These studies have revealed that the CD host genotype selects for the early colonizers of the infant's gut, which together with environmental factors (e.g., breast-feeding, antibiotics, etc.) could influence the development of oral tolerance to gluten. Indeed, some CD genes and/or their altered expression play a role in bacterial colonization and sensing. In turn, intestinal dysbiosis could promote an abnormal response to gluten or other environmental CD-promoting factors (e.g., infections) in predisposed individuals. Here, we review the current knowledge of host-microbe interactions and how host genetics/epigenetics and environmental factors shape gut microbiota and may influence disease risk. We also summarize the current knowledge about the potential mechanisms of action of the intestinal microbiota and specific components that affect CD pathogenesis. 
33933744	Micronutrient deficiencies in children with coeliac disease; a double-edged sword of both untreated disease and treatment with gluten-free diet.	INTRODUCTION: In coeliac disease (CD) micronutrient deficiencies may occur due to malabsorption in active disease and diminished intake during treatment with a gluten-free diet (GFD). This study assessed the micronutrient status in children with CD at diagnosis and follow-up. METHODS: Fifteen micronutrients were analysed in 106 blood samples from newly diagnosed CD and from patients on a GFD for <6 months, 6-12 months and with longstanding disease (>12 months). Predictors of micronutrient status included: demographics, disease duration, anthropometry, gastrointestinal symptoms, raised tissue transglutaminase antibodies (TGA), multivitamin use and faecal gluten immunogenic peptide (GIP). Micronutrient levels were compared against laboratory reference values. RESULTS: At CD diagnosis (n = 25), low levels in >=10% of patients were observed for: vitamins E (88%), B1 (71%), D (24%), K (21%), A (20%) and B6 (12%), ferritin (79%), and zinc (33%). One year post-diagnosis, repletion of vitamins E, K, B6 and B1 was observed (<10% patients). In contrast, deficiencies for vitamins D, A and zinc did not change significantly post-diagnosis. Copper, selenium and magnesium did not differ significantly between diagnosis and follow-up. All samples for B2, folate, vitamin C (except for one sample) and B12 were normal. A raised TGA at follow-up was associated with low vitamins A and B1 (raised vs normal TGA; vitamin A: 40% vs 17%, p = 0.044, vitamin B1: 37% vs 13%, p = 0.028). Low vitamin A (p = 0.009) and vitamin D (p = 0.001) were more common in samples collected during winter. There were no associations between micronutrient status with GIP, body mass index, height, socioeconomic status, or gastrointestinal symptom. Multivitamin use was less common in patients with low vitamin D. CONCLUSIONS: Several micronutrient deficiencies in CD respond to a GFD but others need to be monitored long-term and supplemented where indicated.
20938724	Galactosylation of serum IgA1 O-glycans in celiac disease.	In celiac disease, gluten ingestion provokes small-bowel mucosal injury and production of IgA autoantibodies against transglutaminase 2 (TG2). It has been suggested that in celiac patients IgA could mediate the transepithelial passage of gluten peptides in a mechanism involving the transferrin receptor. As IgA1 with galactose-deficient O-linked glycans has elevated affinity for the transferrin receptor, we assessed whether total serum IgA1 and IgA1 anti-TG2 autoantibodies in celiac patients are aberrantly glycosylated. We report that males with celiac disease have higher total serum levels of galactose-deficient IgA1 than non-celiac males. Furthermore, O-glycans of the disease-specific TG2 IgA1 autoantibodies in celiac patients exhibited elevated galactose deficiency. A gluten-free diet had no effect on the total serum levels of galactose-deficient IgA1, whereas the amount of galactose-deficient anti-TG2 IgA1 decreased. Thus, the undergalactosylated IgA1 molecules are not pathognomonic for celiac disease, but galactose deficiency in IgA1 could be an aggravating factor.
34444783	Dynamics and Considerations in the Determination of the Excretion of Gluten Immunogenic Peptides in Urine: Individual Variability at Low Gluten Intake.	BACKGROUND: A lifelong strict gluten-free diet is the only available treatment for celiac disease, but total exclusion of gluten is difficult to achieve. The aim of this study was to determine the range of time and the amount of gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) excreted in urine after specific gluten ingestions. METHODS: 20 healthy participants followed the same diet for 12 days in which 50 mg and 2 g of gluten were ingested and all the urinations were collected. GIP were analyzed by lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) tests and quantified using an LFIA reader. RESULTS: GIP were detected in 15% and 95% of participants after 50 mg and 2 g gluten intakes, respectively. The higher frequency and concentration of GIP was found between 6 and 9 h after both gluten ingestions. The ranges of detection were 3-12 h (50 mg) and 0-15 h (2 g). CONCLUSIONS: An increase in the frequency of urine tests may be a suitable approach to avoid false negative results. The use of the LFIA test in three urine samples collected at different times may show a sensitivity of 19.6% for a gluten ingestion like 50 mg, increasing to 93% after 2 g consumption.
28231071	Normalization Time of Celiac Serology in Children on a Gluten-free Diet.	OBJECTIVES: Response to a gluten-free diet (GFD) in children with celiac disease is determined by symptom resolution and normalization of serology. We evaluated the rate of normalization of the transglutaminase (TTG) and antiendomysial (EMA) for children on a GFD after diagnosis. METHODS: Celiac serologies were obtained over 3.5 years after starting a GFD in 228 newly diagnosed children with biopsy-proven celiac disease. Patients were classified into categories based on serology (group A, TTG >=10 x upper limit of normal [ULN] and EMA >= 1:80; group B, TTG >=10 x ULN and EMA <= 1:40; and group C, TTG <10 x ULN) and by severity of histologic injury at diagnosis. RESULTS: In children with the highest serology at diagnosis (group A), 79.7% had an abnormal TTG at 12 months after diagnosis (mean TTG 12 months, 68.8 +- 7.3, normal <20 kU/L). At 2 years, an abnormal TTG persisted in 41.7%. In contrast, only 35% of children with the lowest serology at diagnosis (group C) displayed an abnormal TTG at 12 months (mean TTG 14.3 +- 1.9 kU/L). In those with the most severe mucosal injury, Marsh 3C, 74.2% and 33.2% had an abnormal TTG at 1 and 2 years. CONCLUSIONS: Normalization of celiac serology took >1 year in approximately 75% of GFD-compliant children with the highest celiac serology or most severe mucosal injury at diagnosis. Clinicians must consider serology and histology at diagnosis to properly evaluate response to GFD.
38865028	Celiac Disease, Gluten Sensitivity, and Diet Management.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Celiac disease is a common chronic inflammatory condition of the small bowel triggered by gluten in wheat, rye and barley in the diet. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity presents with symptoms similar to celiac disease with the ingestion of gluten or other components of wheat. In this article, we review challenges presented by a gluten free diet for the treatment of both disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Wheat is ubiquitous in the diet and medications/products. A registered dietitian is mandatory for patient education on the gluten free diet. Naturally gluten free foods provide a healthy diet for those with celiac disease. Whole grains labelled gluten free, including oats, are encouraged in the diet as refined grains may be deficient in fiber, protein, and micronutrients, particularly folate. Gluten contamination is the most common cause of persistent symptoms in celiac disease though shared equipment of food preparation may not be as large a problem as suspected. Most with celiac disease on a gluten free diet will fully recover and gain weight that poses a problem for those overweight to start. The gluten free diet may have a negative impact on quality of life for both celiac patients and their families. Those with hypervigilance of the gluten free diet and avoidance of dining out have the lowest quality of life. The gluten free diet is currently the only effective treatment for celiac disease. A registered dietitian is needed to educate patients on the complexity of the gluten free diet with a goal of healthy eating, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding disordered eating or diet hypervigilance; key to a good quality of life.
30986085	Design and development of a self-microemulsifying drug delivery system of olmesartan medoxomil for enhanced bioavailability.	Olmesartan medoxomil (OM) is a hydrophobic antihypertensive drug with low bioavailability (26%) and is known to have adverse effects such as celiac disease and enteropathy. The purpose of this study was to develop SMEDDS to increase bioavailability and decrease potential side effects of OM. Hydrophilic lipophilic balance was calculated by testing solubility of OM in different oils, surfactants, and cosurfactants to obtain the most suitable combination of SMEDDS. Pseudoternary phase diagram was used to select the better oil/water formulation of SMEDDS. After a test for 3-month stability, dissolution tests and parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA) were conducted to investigate drug solubility and permeability. Biodistribution of fluorescent marked SMEDDS was observed by using in vivo imaging system. The pharmacodynamics of the drug were determined by measuring blood pressure from tails of rats. At the end of the experiment, intestines were examined for adverse effects of OM. Compared with tablet formulation according to the dissolution study, SMEDDS formulation showed 1.67 times improvement in solubility of OM. PAMPA studies suggested a much faster permeability rate for OM SMEDDS compared to the suspension form. Labeled SMEDDS gave 3.96 times stronger fluorescent emission than control dye administered mice in in vivo imaging system (IVIS ) studies, indicating an increased bioavailability. Treating effect of SMEDDS was 3.1 times more efficient compared to suspension in hypertensive rats. It caused neither celiac-like enteropathy nor diarrhea, during 21-day noninvasive blood pressure system (NIBP) assay. Our results suggest that SMEEDS formulation improves dissolution and oral bioavailability of OM while reducing its adverse effects.
25666418	Potential use of cyclodextrin-glycosyltransferase enzyme in bread-making and the development of gluten-free breads with pinion and corn flours.	Gluten-free breads are an alternative for celiacs but are characterized by deficient sensory qualities compared with traditional breads. This work aimed to incorporate a commercial CGTase enzyme and the CGTase produced by Bacillus firmus strain 37 in the production of these breads to overcome these drawbacks. The flours employed were corn and pinion flours, which had the best CD production by CGTase, and exhibited good antioxidant activity, respectively. Rice flour was used as a control. The addition of the CGTase enzyme increased the specific volume and improved the texture of the breads. In the sensory analyses, the best score given by non-celiacs was for bread with pinion and rice flours and CGTase from B. firmus strain 37, while celiacs awarded the best score to the bread with rice flour only and same enzyme. The results demonstrate an improvement in the sensory and technological characteristics of gluten-free breads using the CGTase enzyme. 
34445038	Nutritional Imbalances in Adult Celiac Patients Following a Gluten-Free Diet.	Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic autoimmune disorder of the small intestine, whose only effective treatment is a gluten-free diet (GFD). It is characterized by the atrophy of the intestinal villi that leads to altered nutrient absorption. This study describes the nutritional imbalances which may be found in adults with CD following a GFD. During the first year of treatment, deficiencies will overcome as the intestinal mucosa recovers. Thus, biochemical data will show this progression, together with the decrease in symptoms. In contrast, in the long term, when a strict GFD is followed and mucosal recovery is achieved, analyzing nutrient intake makes more sense. Macronutrient consumption is characterized by its low complex carbohydrate and fiber intakes, and high fat (especially SFA) and sugar intakes. This profile has been related to the consumption of GFP and their nutritional composition, in addition to unbalanced dietary habits. The most notable deficiencies in micronutrients are usually those of iron, calcium and magnesium and vitamin D, E and some of group B. It is necessary to follow up patients with CD and to promote nutritional education among them, since it could help not only to achieve a gluten free but also a balanced diet.
32947787	Gluten-Free Diet in Prisons in Poland: Nutrient Contents and Implementation of Dietary Reference Intake Standards.	The gluten-free diet (GFD) requires special attention from nutritionists due to the potential risk of nutrient deficiencies in its users. This risk may be greater when this type of nutrition is implemented in prisons due to the limited possibilities of external control, a low catering budget for meals, and insufficiently defined recommendations regulating nutrition for prisoners. The aim of the present study was to assess the nutritional value of GFD and regular diet meals served in some Polish prisons and to compare the values to the dietary reference intake (DRI) standards. Using a specialized computer program, 7-day menus of both types of diet provided in 10 prisons were analyzed. The percentage coverage of the DRI was calculated based on the recommendations of the Polish National Food and Nutrition Institute. GFD was characterized by lower average contents of energy and 11 out of 14 essential nutrients, i.e., protein, carbohydrates, dietary fiber, starch, ash, sodium, calcium, iron, zinc, folate, and vitamin B12. The average content of phosphorus, niacin, and riboflavin in the gluten-free diet was higher than that in the regular diet. It was shown that the meals in GFD and the regular diet did not provide the recommended amounts of calcium (38 and 44% DRI, respectively), vitamin D (29 and 30% DRI), vitamin C (86 and 76% DRI), and folate (51 and 56% DRI). In turn, the supply of sodium, phosphorus, copper, and vitamins A and B6 substantially exceeded the recommended levels. The results indicate a need for greater quality control of GFD meals served in catering facilities. It is also necessary to develop legal provisions that will regulate more specifically the nutrition for prisoners in terms of an adequate supply of minerals and vitamins.
21327021	Effects of a gluten-free diet on gut microbiota and immune function in healthy adult humans.	Diet is a major environmental factor influencing gut microbiota diversity and functionality, which might be relevant to subjects following dietary therapies. Celiac disease (CD) is an enteropathy caused by an aberrant immune response to cereal gluten proteins and the only therapy is the adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). In this context, a preliminary study was conducted to establish whether the GFD in itself could modify the composition and immune properties of the gut microbiota. The trial included 10 healthy subjects (30.3 years-old), which were submitted to a GFD over one month. Analysis of fecal microbiota and dietary intake indicated that numbers of healthy gut bacteria decreased, while numbers of unhealthy bacteria increased parallel to reductions in the intake of polysaccharides after following the GFD. Fecal samples of subjects under a GFD, which represent an altered microbiota, also exerted lower immune stimulatory effects on peripheral blood mononuclear cells than those of subjects on a regular gluten-containing diet. This addendum presents further discussion on the rationale behind these findings, limitations of the study and possible consequences of dietary counselling in the care process of celiac disease patients.
29016564	The Role of an IgA/IgG-Deamidated Gliadin Peptide Point-of-Care Test in Predicting Persistent Villous Atrophy in Patients With Celiac Disease on a Gluten-Free Diet.	OBJECTIVES: Mucosal healing is important in celiac disease (CD) for the prevention of complications. However, obtaining duodenal biopsies is invasive, and there is currently no reliable surrogate marker for histological remission in clinical practice. We aimed to assess the role of a point-of-care test (POCT) based on IgA/IgG-deamidated gliadin peptide, in detecting persistent villous atrophy (VA) in CD. METHODS: We prospectively recruited patients with CD attending endoscopy for the assessment of histological remission. All patients had IgA-endomysial (EMA) antibodies, IgA-tissue transglutaminase (TTG) antibodies, and the POCT performed, and completed a validated dietary adherence questionnaire. A gastroscopy was performed in all patients, with four biopsies taken from the second part of the duodenum and one from the duodenal bulb. We compared the diagnostic performance of the surrogate markers against duodenal histology as the reference standard. RESULTS: A total of 217 patients with CD (70% female, age range 16-83 years, median age 53 years) on a gluten-free diet (median duration 6 years) were recruited from 2013 to 2017. Eighty-five (39.2%) patients had persistent VA. The sensitivities of the POCT, TTG, EMA, and the adherence score in detecting VA were 67.1%, 44.7%, 37.7%, and 24.7% respectively (P=0.0005). The combination of the POCT and adherence score only marginally increased the sensitivity to 70.6% (59.7-80.0%). CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity of the POCT was higher than the other surrogate markers in predicting VA. A POCT may provide the additional advantage of an immediate objective assessment of mucosal healing at the time of an office-based follow-up consultation.
29258815	Elevated serum antiphospholipid antibodies in adults with celiac disease.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: An increased incidence of thrombosis is suggested in celiac disease. We explored serum levels of antiphospholipid antibodies in untreated and treated adult celiac disease patients. METHODS: A cohort of 179 biopsy-proven celiac disease patients (89 untreated, 90 on long-term gluten-free diet) and 91 non-celiac controls underwent clinical examination, assessment of celiac serology and enzyme immunoassay testing for anticardiolipin IgG and IgM, prothrombin IgG, and phosphatidylserine-prothrombin IgG and IgM. RESULTS: The level of antiphospholipid antibodies was higher in celiac disease patients compared with controls: anticardiolipin IgG 4.9 (0.7-33.8) vs 2.2 (0.4-9.6) U/ml, antiprothrombin IgG 2.9 (0.3-87.8) vs 2.1 (0.5-187.0) U/ml, antiphosphatidylserine-prothrombin IgG 6.9 (0.0-54.1) vs 2.3 (0.5-15.1) U/ml; p < 0.05 for all. Anticardiolipin IgG, antiprothrombin IgG and antiphosphatidylserine-prothrombin IgG were higher in treated compared with untreated patients. The phenotype of celiac disease at presentation (gastrointestinal symptoms, malabsorption or anemia, and extraintestinal symptoms or screen-detected disease) had no effect on the level of serum antiphospholipid antibodies. CONCLUSION: The serum level of antiphospholipid antibodies is increased in adults with celiac disease. The higher level of antibodies in treated patients suggests that the increase is not gluten-dependent. The prothrombotic role of antiphospholipid antibodies in celiac disease warrants further studies.
28393621	A review on the relationship between gluten and schizophrenia: Is gluten the cause?	INTRODUCTION: Schizophrenia is a chronic disease that possesses various clinical manifestations. It presents rather heterogeneous characteristics with respect to onset type, symptoms, and the course of the disease. Although the lifetime prevalence is as low as 1%, it can cause serious disability. Thus, it is very important to develop efficient treatment methods. In some studies, it is hypothesized that removing gluten from the diet leads to a significant improvement in disease symptoms. Epidemiological studies revealed that the prevalence of celiac disease among schizophrenic patients is almost two times higher than that of the general population. OBJECTIVE: In this review, we evaluate the effects of gluten and celiac disease on the onset of schizophrenia. Efficacy of gluten-free diet applications, antibody response against gluten, and the interaction of the brain-gut axis and the presence of common genetic points are also investigated. METHODS: Without any publication date restriction, Pubmed database searches were made for 'schizophrenia, gluten, gliadin, celiac disease, exorphin, brain-gut axis, psychiatric disorders.' The keywords and the articles about the schizophrenia-celiac disease relationship are included in our review. RESULTS: Several studies presented evidence to suggest that symptoms associated with schizophrenia were minimized when gluten was excluded from patients' diets. Immunological searches revealed that most schizophrenic patients with increased anti-gliadin antibodies did not possess celiac disease; yet, the presence of increased antibodies against gliadin can be the share point of the immunological abnormalities found in both of the diseases. DISCUSSION: There were no consistent results in the clinical, immunological, microbiological, and epidemiological studies that investigated the relationship between schizophrenia and celiac disease. This presents a need for a larger scale study to confirm the presence of this suggested correlation between schizophrenia and celiac disease. The underlying mechanisms between the two diseases should be explored.
28819290	Progress towards non-invasive diagnosis and follow-up of celiac disease in children; a prospective multicentre study to the usefulness of plasma I-FABP.	This prospective study investigates whether measurement of plasma intestinal-fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP), a sensitive marker for small intestinal epithelial damage, improves non-invasive diagnosing of celiac disease (CD), and whether I-FABP levels are useful to evaluate mucosal healing in patients on a gluten-free diet (GFD). Ninety children with elevated tTG-IgA titres and HLA-DQ2/DQ8 positivity were included (study group). Duodenal biopsies were taken, except in those fulfilling the ESPGHAN criteria. Plasma I-FABP levels and tTG-IgA titres were assessed sequentially during six months of follow-up. Eighty children with normal tTG-IgA titres served as control group. In 61/90 (67.8%) of the children in the study group an increased I-FABP level was found; in all these children CD diagnosis was confirmed. Interestingly, in 14/30 (46.7%) children with slightly elevated tTG-IgA titres (<10x upper limit of normal), an increased I-FABP level was found. In all these children the diagnosis of CD was confirmed histologically. After gluten elimination for six weeks I-FABP levels had decreased towards levels in the control group. Measurement of plasma I-FABP, in addition to tTG-IgA, EMA-IgA and HLAtyping, enables non-invasive diagnosing of CD in a substantial number of children, and might therefore be of value in the diagnostic approach of CD.
34210038	Microbiota and Metabolomic Patterns in the Breast Milk of Subjects with Celiac Disease on a Gluten-Free Diet.	The intestinal microbiome may trigger celiac disease (CD) in individuals with a genetic disposition when exposed to dietary gluten. Research demonstrates that nutrition during infancy is crucial to the intestinal microbiome engraftment. Very few studies to date have focused on the breast milk composition of subjects with a history of CD on a gluten-free diet. Here, we utilize a multi-omics approach with shotgun metagenomics to analyze the breast milk microbiome integrated with metabolome profiling of 36 subjects, 20 with CD on a gluten-free diet and 16 healthy controls. These analyses identified significant differences in bacterial and viral species/strains and functional pathways but no difference in metabolite abundance. Specifically, three bacterial strains with increased abundance were identified in subjects with CD on a gluten-free diet of which one (Rothia mucilaginosa) has been previously linked to autoimmune conditions. We also identified five pathways with increased abundance in subjects with CD on a gluten-free diet. We additionally found four bacterial and two viral species/strains with increased abundance in healthy controls. Overall, the differences observed in bacterial and viral species/strains and in functional pathways observed in our analysis may influence microbiome engraftment in neonates, which may impact their future clinical outcomes.
38999756	Celiac Disease, Gluten-Free Diet and Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic autoimmune disorder triggered by the ingestion of gluten-containing food by genetically predisposed individuals. Hence, treatment of CD consists of permanent avoidance of wheat, rye, barley, and other gluten-containing foods. Lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) improves the symptoms of CD, but recent evidence suggests it is also associated with a higher risk for hepatic steatosis and the coexistence or emergence of other cardiometabolic risk factors. Moreover, a higher risk for liver steatosis is also reported by some authors as a potential extraintestinal complication of the CD itself. Recent nomenclature changes designate the association between hepatic steatosis and at least one of five cardiometabolic risk factors as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). An extended network of potentially causative factors underlying the association between MAFLD and CD, before and after dietary therapy is implemented, was recently described. The individualized treatment of these patients is less supported by evidence, with most of the current recommendations relying on empiric clinical judgment. This review focuses on the causative associations between CD and hepatic injury, either as an extraintestinal manifestation of CD or a side effect of GFD, also referring to potential therapeutic strategies for these individuals.
24621303	Low risk of colon cancer in patients with celiac disease.	OBJECTIVE: Celiac disease (CD) has strongly been established as associated with some site-specific gastrointestinal malignancies. On the contrary, according to the few reports available, the risk of colon carcinoma in CD patients has been described similar to that of general population. In this cohort study, we describe the risk of colon carcinoma in a group of Italian celiac patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population included all CD patients diagnosed at the Collaborating Centers of the Italian Registry of CD between 1st January 1982 and 31st December 2006. Upon diagnosis of CD and upon at every subsequent clinical control, the Collaborating Centers filled in a validated form for each CD patient reporting information about demographic data, possible occurrence of a neoplasm and adherence to a gluten-free diet. RESULTS: Out of 1757 celiac patients enrolled, 6 developed a colon carcinoma during the follow-up period (mean: 18.1 years). The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) resulted 0.29 (95% CI=0.07-0.45). Stratifying the risk for the dietary gluten intake, the SIR dropped to 0.07 (95% CI=0.009-0.27) for CD patients with a strict adherence to a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSION: We confirm the previous finding that there is low risk to develop a colon cancer in celiac patients.
21279282	[History of gluten and its effects on celiac disease].	The global prevalence of celiac disease is of one person per 250 inhabitants. The disease is induced by gluten, a peptide contained in wheat, rye and barley that during small intestinal digestion generates smaller peptides. Some of these are resistant to hydrolysis and cross through the epithelium into the mucosa, inducing a cascade of immune reactions leading to the appearance of the disease in susceptible individuals. Gluten appeared as a consequence of agricultural practices initiated 10000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent of southwest Asia. Celiac disease epidemiology is complicated since consumption of gluten differs depending on the origin of populations. Treatment of celiac disease consists of withdrawing gluten from the diet, a task that becomes difficult in the long term. The concept of gluten-free food has changed along time. This article updates the concept of celiac disease, the history of gluten consumption in the world, the characteristics of a gluten free diet and the difficulties to adhere to it.
37049601	The Importance of an Early Evaluation after Establishing a Gluten-Free Diet in Children with Celiac Disease.	A gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only treatment available for celiac disease (CD); hence, it is important to ensure correct adherence to the diet and adequate monitoring of the diet. The present study aims to assess the importance of an early follow-up of celiac patients after diagnosis of the disease, identify the role of stool gluten immunogenic peptides (GIPs) in the assessment of GFD adherence, and analyze possible nutritional imbalances or deficiencies in the GFD. This is a cross-sectional study carried out in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed CD in a tertiary hospital in Spain. Of the 61 patients included, 14% had positive stool GIPS at 4 months after CD diagnosis, Among them, 88% had negative stool GIPS at 9 months after diagnosis, following dietary advice. We found nutritional deficiencies in the GFD, such as vitamin D (with only 27% of patients with adequate intakes), folate, calcium, magnesium, and fiber. Similarly, we found imbalances: excess protein and fat intakes and a high percentage of total daily energy intake came from ultra-processed foods (UPF). These findings emphasize the importance of early follow-up of children after diagnosis of CD. It is also crucial to identify patients with poor GFD compliance based on stool GIPS and analyze GFD nutritional imbalances and deficits. Our findings may contribute to the development of specific strategies for the early follow-up of patients with CD, including appropriate nutritional counselling.
35631231	Long-Term Effect of Gluten-Free Diets on Nutritional Status, Body Composition, and Associated Factors in Adult Saudi Females with Celiac Disease.	This cross-sectional study examines the influence of long-term gluten-free diet (GFD) consumption on nutritional status, body composition, and associated factors in adult Saudi females with celiac diseases (CD). Fifty-one patients who have been diagnosed with CD and have been on GFD for more than 1 year were included in this study where data regarding their dietary pattern, as well as a complete analysis of their anthropometric parameters, vitamins B12 and D levels, and complete blood count (CBC), were collected. Data have shown that all included patients showed a reduced intake in all micro and macro-nutrients, as well as vitamin D, folate, calcium, and iron. However, the vast majority of all measured hematological parameters and blood indices were within the expected reference range. In addition, 51%, 43.1%, and 60.8% of the patients showed low waist/hip ratio (WHR), decreased level of total body fat (BF), and decreased level of visceral fat (VF), respectively, whereas 33.3% were slim. The poor educational level and some psychosocial factors were associated with the poor nutritional status of the patients. In conclusion, the GFD-dependent intake by female patients with CD adversely affects their nutritional intake and anthropometric indices and leads to a deficiency in major nutrients, vitamins, and ions.
25781195	High prevalence of gluten sensitivity in a cohort of patients with undifferentiated connective tissue disease.	OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate if co-morbid conditions as hepatitis C virus infection and celiac disease may be associated to undifferentiated connective tissue disease. METHODS: We studied retrospectively and prospectively 52 patients with diagnosis of undifferentiated connective tissue disease, subdivided, according to Vaz criteria, in systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis and Sjogren's syndrome-like subgroups. Serological markers of celiac disease as anti-gliadin, anti-endomysium and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies were investigated. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy with duodenal biopsy and histological examination was proposed to patients with positive celiac disease serology. In addition antibodies directed to hepatitis C virus and total IgA-antibodies were investigated. RESULTS: Six patients (11,5%) were positive for celiac disease serological tests although two of them were asymptomatic. Four patients underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy, showing total or subtotal villous atrophy at duodenal biopsies. Hepatitis C virus serology was negative in all patients and none had IgA deficiency. 83% of celiac patients showed a scleroderma-like phenotype. We observed a statistically higher incidence of autoimmune symptoms in patients with gluten sensitivity. Fatigue and myalgia regressed early after the beginning of gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort of patients the prevalence of celiac disease was higher than that reported in the general population. We believe that all patients with diagnosis of undifferentiated connective tissue disease, especially those with a systemic sclerosis-like presentation, should be investigated for celiac disease, even in absence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Gluten-free diet should be early recommended to all patients having undifferentiated connective tissue disease and gluten sensitivity.
38443736	A Dedicated Celiac Disease Program Improves Celiac Quality Care Metrics and Short-Term Outcomes in Real Life.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Dedicated multidisciplinary programs in gastroenterology are emerging with the goal to improve care. There is little information about the effects of a celiac disease program on disease-related quality care metrics and outcomes. We aimed to compare quality care metrics, symptom resolution, and serological response among patients diagnosed and treated in a celiac disease program with a standard of care cohort. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study with adult celiac disease patients. We divided patients into two groups: celiac disease patients treated in our program and those treated by gastroenterologists not affiliated with the program (standard of care). We abstracted data from electronical medical records and compared frequency at which guideline-driven quality care metrics were obtained, assessed symptom resolution, and serological response based on IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase levels. RESULTS: We included 340 patients, 120 in the celiac disease program (89 women) and 220 (166 women) in the standard of care. Frequency of quality care metrics implementation in program patients was significantly greater for all variables (p < 0.0005). Diarrhea resolved in 38/46 (82.6%) in the CD program and 63/98 (64.2%) in the standard of care after starting a gluten-free diet (p = .025); bloating also resolved significantly more often in the former (26/34) than the latter (31/58; p = 0.03). Otherwise, there were no significant differences in resolution of clinical symptoms or serological response. CONCLUSION: A celiac disease program improves celiac-related quality care metrics and may improve outcomes such as diarrhea resolution compared to standard of care.
22614110	Burden of illness in screen-detected children with celiac disease and their families.	OBJECTIVES: Because of a variable clinical picture, most children with celiac disease remain unrecognized without active serologic screening. Because, however, many patients are asymptomatic, the justification for screening remains unclear. We assessed health and well-being and the effect of a 1-year gluten-free diet in a nationwide cohort of children with celiac disease detected by screening in at-risk groups. METHODS: A total of 222 newly detected children received a validated questionnaire covering aspects of the burden caused by the undiagnosed celiac disease. After 1 year, adherence to the diet and difficulties attending this, attitudes toward and effects of disease and diet on daily life, and parents' satisfaction with the diagnosis were inquired about. The children's health and parents' concern for it were asked about at diagnosis and on treatment. The outcomes of screen-detected children were compared with those of children diagnosed on the basis of clinical symptoms. RESULTS: Forty-three screen-detected and 88 symptom-detected children responded. Also, 65% of the screen-detected patients experienced symptoms; these, however, being less troublesome and of shorter duration than in symptom-detected subjects. There were no differences between the groups in dietary adherence (71% vs 84% strict diet), management of the diet (80% vs 80%), alleviation of symptoms (78% vs 86%), and improvement in daily life (73% vs 69%), or in satisfaction with the diagnosis (93% vs 88%). Improved health and reduced parental concern were observed in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Screen-detected children with celiac disease can attain satisfactory dietary adherence and benefit from treatment similarly to symptom-detected patients. The results support intensified screening for celiac disease in at-risk children.
24007857	[Lymphocytic duodenosis: etiological study and clinical presentations].	INTRODUCTION: Lymphocytic duodenosis (LD) is a characteristic lesion in the initial phases of celiac disease (CD) but can be associated with many other entities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of distinct causes of LD and possible differences in clinical presentation according to etiology. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed that included 194 patients diagnosed with LD (more than 25 intraepithelial lymphocytes per 100 epithelial cells). A preestablished strategy to evaluate the cause of the disease was followed that included celiac serology (antitransglutaminase antibodies), HLA-DQ2/DQ8 genotypes, diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). Diagnosis of CD was established on the basis of clinical and histological response to a gluten-free diet in patients with positive serology or compatible findings on HLA-DQ2 (at least one of the alleles) or -DQ8 (both alleles) study. RESULTS: The most frequent cause of LD was CD (39%), followed by SBBO (22%), H.pylori (14%), CD and SIBO (12%), and other causes (13%). Most of the patients (83%) had a compatible HLA-DQ2 or -DQ8 genotype. In these patients, the most frequent diagnosis was CD (46%), while in the absence of HLA-DQ2/DQ8, the most frequent diagnoses were SIBO (44%) and H. pylori (22%). CD was the most frequent diagnosis in patients referred for dyspepsia, diarrhea and anemia, while H. pylori was the most frequent diagnosis in patients with abdominal pain. CONCLUSIONS: The most common causes of LD in our environment are CD, followed by SIBO and H. pylori infection.
32887250	Influence of Compliance to Diet and Self-Efficacy Expectation on Quality of Life in Patients with Celiac Disease in Spain.	The purpose of this study is to understand the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with celiac disease (CD) and analyze its main determinants. A transversal descriptive study of 738 patients with celiac disease was carried out. A series of questionnaires were answered related to their HRQoL, adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD), and self-efficacy beliefs among other relevant variables. Regression analyses were carried out in order to explore the predictive variables in adherence to the GFD and HRQoL. A total of 61.2% showed a good HRQoL, and the main predictors of HRQoL were specific self-efficacy, adherence to the diet, risk perception, time since diagnosis, and age. While 68.7% of participants showed good or excellent adherence to the GFD, and the main predictors of adherence were specific self-efficacy, perceived adoption of recommended behaviors, HRQoL and gender. The HRQoL of patients with CD, and adherence to the GFD in Spain, are good. It is the self-efficacy expectation, measured specifically and not generally, which is the best predictor of both adherence and HRQoL. It is necessary to develop programs to improve the HRQoL of patients with CD that focus on improving specific self-efficacy.
29749319	There is need a new insight for celiac disease.	
25050927	Long term follow up of celiac disease-is atherosclerosis a problem?	Celiac disease (CD) is a lifelong condition and it often involves impaired nutrition, wide spectrum of symptoms and it requires constant dietetic treatment. The impact of the gluten-free diet on patients' nutritional status and on the other biochemical parameters is being widely investigated. In this article we looked into particular risk factors that might lead to increased prevalence of atherosclerosis in CD patients, including nutritional status, gluten-free diet, lipids profile and concomitant disease-type 1 diabetes mellitus. Here, we present the current data and research on these risk factors of atherosclerosis with respect to celiac disease. 
26680095	Cryptococcosis Presenting as a Colonic Ulcer in a Kidney Transplant Recipient: A Case Report.	We present a case of a 59-year-old woman with Chagas disease who received a kidney transplant. At month 44 post-transplantation, the patient presented with diarrhea that had persisted for 2 months. Colonoscopy showed a colon ulcer and differential diagnoses included cytomegalovirus, bacteria, or parasite infection; drug-related diarrhea; Crohn's disease; celiac disease; and malignancy. The ulcer tissue was positive for Cryptococcus neoformans. Successful treatment consisted of amphotericin B for 8 days and oral fluconazole (800 mg daily) for 3 months. This case illustrates that a colonic ulcer, although rare, could be cryptococcosis. 
23799417	Craniofacial features of children with celiac disease.	BACKGROUND AND GOALS: Growth retardation is one of the most important signs of childhood celiac disease (CD); however, it is not very well known whether craniofacial growth is also affected. We aimed to carry out a detailed craniofacial morphological study to derive a conclusion on the craniofacial features of children with CD. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Eighty-four 2-16-year-old children with biopsy-proven CD and 84 age-matched and sex-matched healthy children were included. Of these, 37 children (44.0%) had been newly diagnosed and 47 (56.0%) were on a gluten-free diet. Anteroposterior and lateral photographs were evaluated using the Scion Image software program for the measurements of the distances between reference points on the face. RESULTS: Except for nasofrontal angle (nfa), nasolabial angle (nla), pronasale height (prnh), nasal dorsum height (ndh), and nasal radix height (nrh), all measurements were significantly greater in patients compared with controls. In celiac children, all facial proportions except forehead/face height (t-gl/t-gn) and nose length/face height (n-ns/t-gn) were significantly different from those of controls. Except for nla, prnh, ndh, nrh, t-gl/t-gn, face height to total face height ratio (sn-gn/t-gn), n-sn/t-gn, ear length to face height ratio (s-sba/t-gn), and face width to face height ratio (z-z/t-gn), all measurements were statistically different in those on a gluten-free diet and newly diagnosed children. CONCLUSION: Most of the facial measurements and proportions of celiac children were different from those of controls. Our data confirm those of a previous study reporting that the forehead proportion is not altered in childhood CD. Pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these alterations are not clear but disruptions of growth during certain critical periods may be responsible.
30257431	The Availability and Nutritional Adequacy of Gluten-Free Bread and Pasta.	Management of coeliac disease (CD) requires the removal of gluten from the diet. Evidence of the availability, cost, and nutritional adequacy of gluten-free (GF) bread and pasta products is limited. GF flours are exempt from UK legislation that requires micronutrient fortification of white wheat flour. This study surveyed the number and cost of bread and pasta products available and evaluated the back-of-pack nutritional information, the ingredient content, and the presence of fortification nutrients of GF bread and pasta, compared to standard gluten-containing equivalent products. Product information was collected from four supermarket websites. Standard products were significantly cheaper, with more products available than GF (p < 0.05). GF bread products were significantly higher in fat and fiber (p < 0.05). All GF products were lower in protein than standard products (p < 0.01). Only 5% of GF breads were fortified with all four mandatory fortification nutrients (calcium, iron, niacin, and thiamin), 28% of GF breads were fortified with calcium and iron only. This lack of fortification may increase the risk of micronutrient deficiency in coeliac sufferers. It is recommended that fortification legislation is extended to include all GF products, in addition to increased regulation of the nutritional content of GF foods.
21623493	Gluten contamination in the Canadian commercial oat supply.	A growing body of evidence suggests that a majority of people with celiac disease and on a gluten-free diet can safely consume pure oats in moderate amounts; however, previous studies have indicated that the commercial oat supply in other countries, and in Canada to some extent, is contaminated with other grains. This study has confirmed that the commercial oat supply in Canada is heavily contaminated with gluten from other grains. Approximately 88% of the oat samples (n = 133) were contaminated above 20 mg kg(-1) and there were no differences between the oat types tested. Only one gluten-free variety of oats was analysed and it consistently provided negative results in all analyses. It is difficult to determine where the contamination originates, but there are possibilities for cross-contamination in the field, in the transport of the grain, in the storage of the grain, and in the milling and packaging facilities. It is clear from this study that only those products that have been certified 'pure' oats would be appropriate for a gluten-free diet.
22276441	[Liver involvement in celiac disease in children].	UNLABELLED: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune systemic enteropathy triggered by gluten intake in patients with genetic susceptibility, characterized by clinic polymorphism: classic forms, mainly with digestive features, and atypical forms, liver involvement being a part of them. In present, any unknown cytolysis requires screening serologic determinations for CD. AIMS: to assess the presence of liver manifestations in children diagnosed with CD, the outcome of liver function with gluten-free diet (GFD) and also to emphasize the importance of the immunological screening for CD in patients with unknown etiology liver dysfunctions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The trial was formed by 120 patients diagnosed with CD between January 2007 - December 2010 in 2nd and 3rd Pediatric Clinics of "Sf. Maria" Hospital Iasi; liver function was assessed; viral hepatitis and autoimmune hepatitis markers were determined; all patients were given GFD, hepatoprotective agents and antivirals specific to each form of hepatitis; the transaminases level variation was followed in time. RESULTS: 12 of the CD diagnosed patients (10, 14%) had altered liver function at the onset of disease; the only abnormality was the increased transaminases level in 57, 14% of cases; HBsAg was found positive in 33, 33% (4 cases); liver biopsy in one patient evidenced steatosis. The study has shown that 4% of the patients with cryptogenetic hepatitis have a silent form of CD, the serologic screening for AGA, AEA, ATGA being essential for diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: we have to rule out CD in patients with liver disease of unknown etiology, before we consider it as "cryptogenetic"; occurrence of cytolysis in the absence of positive viral markers requires the assessment of screening tests for CD.
30769829	Role of Front-of-Package Gluten-Free Product Labeling in a Pair-Matched Study in Women with and without Celiac Disease on a Gluten-Free Diet.	Gluten-free (GF) product labeling is one of the most important determinants of food product choices by patients with celiac disease, due to the need for following a GF diet. The aim of this study was to assess the role of front-of-package GF product labeling in pair-matched celiac and non-celiac women on a GF diet in a choice experiment (CE). In subgroups of celiac (n = 77) and non-celiac pair-matched respondents on a GF diet, but with no gluten-related diseases diagnosed (n = 77), the influence of front-of package labeling of GF bread on the choice of products was assessed. The labeling assessed in a CE included for all the products crossed grain logotype and additional logotypes of European Union (EU) organic production, "dairy-free" product, wheat starch-free product, quality and vegan product, as well as additional "gluten-free" written information. It was stated that the frequency of selection of products with "gluten-free" written information did not differ between subgroups of celiac and non-celiac respondents, as well as in subgroups stratified by age, body mass index (BMI), place of residence, and economic status. The frequency of selection of products with "vegan" logotype was higher for non-celiac respondents than for celiac ones (p = 0.0011). The frequency of selection of a product with additional logotypes was influenced by BMI and place of residence, but not by age and economic status of assessed women.
21454226	Medical care of girls with Turner Syndrome: where are we lacking?	OBJECTIVE: To characterize the medical care of a large cohort of girls with Turner syndrome with a focus on changes in management since establishment of international consensus guidelines in 2007. METHODS: We reviewed medical records of patients followed up for Turner syndrome between 2000 and 2010. RESULTS: A total of 128 girls aged 13.2 +- 0.5 years were identified. Average age at diagnosis was 4.1 +- 5.1 years. Overall, medical assessments performed included a hearing test in 56%, thyroid screening in 95%, renal ultrasonography in 100%, and echocardiography in 100%. Before 2007, none of the patients had screening performed for celiac disease, dyslipidemia, or liver dysfunction, and none had routine electrocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Since 2007, 63% were screened for celiac disease, 54% for liver abnormalities, and 38% for dyslipidemia. Electrocardiography was performed in 23%, while cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 39%. Although conjugated equine oral estrogen was the main mode of estrogen replacement, a significant increase was noted in the use of transdermal estrogen during the past 2 years compared with that observed in the earlier interval (78% vs 10%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Although changes in medical practice have occurred since establishment of the international Turner syndrome guidelines, screening for associated comorbidities was deficient in greater than 50% of the patients in our study. This is the first study evaluating medical care in a large cohort of pediatric patients with Turner syndrome, and our findings emphasize the need for continual education of all physicians involved in the care of this population.
27900603	Enteropathy-Associated T-Cell Lymphoma.	Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma is a rare neoplasm with uniformly aggressive features that arises from intestinal T-cells. There is strong evidence supporting its association as a dire complication of celiac disease. The clinical presentation can vary from malabsorption and abdominal pain to an acute abdominal emergency. Originally, it was divided into types I and II in World Health Organization (WHO) classification schemes, reflective of epidemiology and differences in clinicopathologic features. The debate over the degree of separation of the two types is ongoing as new data emerges regarding the pathogenetics. The low incidence and variable patient factors are major barriers in conducting clinical trials and establishing standard treatment regimens. Yet, the collective experience demonstrates favorable outcomes with combination chemotherapy followed by an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant in patients who can tolerate such treatment. The prognosis remains dismal; thus, future research studies are warranted to identify effective novel therapies that can improve outcomes in this rare disease entity.
21911773	High prevalence of microvascular complications in adults with type 1 diabetes and newly diagnosed celiac disease.	OBJECTIVE: The implications of celiac disease (CD) in adult patients with type 1 diabetes are unknown, with respect to diabetes-related outcomes including glycemic control, lipids, microvascular complications, quality of life, and the effect of a gluten-free diet (GFD). We identified CD in adults with type 1 diabetes and investigated the effect of a GFD on diabetes-related complications. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a case-control study conducted at a U.K. teaching hospital. Patients with type 1 diabetes aged >16 years (n = 1,000) were assessed for CD. HbA(1c), lipid profile, quality of life, retinopathy stage, nephropathy stage, and degree of neuropathy before and after 1 year on a GFD were assessed. RESULTS: The prevalence of CD was 33 per 1,000 subjects (3.3% [95% CI 2.3-4.6]). At diagnosis of CD, adult type 1 diabetic patients had worse glycemic control (8.2 vs. 7.5%, P = 0.05), lower total cholesterol (4.1 vs. 4.9, P = 0.014), lower HDL cholesterol (1.1 vs. 1.6, P = 0.017), and a higher prevalence of retinopathy (58.3 vs. 25%, P = 0.02), nephropathy (41.6 vs. 4.2%, P = 0.009), and peripheral neuropathy (41.6 vs. 16.6%, P = 0.11). There was no difference in quality of life (P > 0.1). After 1 year on a GFD, only the lipid profile improved overall, but in adherent individuals HbA(1c) and markers for nephropathy improved. CONCLUSIONS: Adults with undetected CD and type 1 diabetes have worse glycemic control and a higher prevalence of retinopathy and nephropathy. Treatment with a GFD for 1 year is safe in adults with type 1 diabetes and does not have a negative impact on the quality of life.
26032154	Predictors and Significance of Incomplete Mucosal Recovery in Celiac Disease After 1 Year on a Gluten-Free Diet.	OBJECTIVES: In celiac disease, a follow-up biopsy taken 1 year after diagnosis is considered important in monitoring histological recovery. In many cases, recovery is incomplete, and the clinical significance of this is poorly understood. We now investigated associated factors and the significance of imperfect histological recovery in patients in whom the follow-up had been completed. METHODS: Two hundred sixty-three biopsy-proven patients were divided into two groups: histological recovery and incomplete recovery after 1 year on gluten-free diet. Serology, laboratory values, bone mineral density, and different clinical variables were measured at diagnosis and after 1 year. Gastrointestinal symptoms and quality of life were assessed by validated questionnaires. Further, long-term follow-up data on mortality, malignancies, and other severe complications were collected. RESULTS: The incomplete recovery group had more severe mucosal damage (P=0.003), higher antibody values (P=0.017), and more signs of malabsorption (P<0.001) at diagnosis. There was no difference in gender, symptoms or quality of life, family history of celiac disease, or comorbidities. At follow-up, there was still a difference in antibodies (P=0.018) and femoral T-scores (P=0.024). Histologically recovered patients showed better dietary adherence, although it was excellent in both groups (97% vs. 87%, P<0.001). There was no difference in long-term outcomes between groups. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of more severe disease in terms of histology, serology, and signs of malabsorption was associated with histological non-response. In patients with high dietary adherence, incomplete villous recovery after 1 year does not affect the clinical response or long-term prognosis. A personalized approach is required to decide the optimal timing of the follow-up biopsy.
30823833	Non-celiac gluten/wheat sensitivity: still more questions than answers.	Non-celiac gluten/wheat sensitivity (NCG/WS) is a syndrome characterized by intestinal and extra-intestinal sym-ptoms elicited by gluten/wheat ingestion in the persons, who are not affected by celiac disease and wheat allergy. Due to the lack of established biomarkers, the diagnosis of NCG/WS is based on the clinical picture, and it is necessary to validate it in well-defined double-blind, placebo-controlled challenge (The Salerno Experts  Criteria). In the article is discussed a current knowledge of NCG/WS in terms of pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment. Key words: gluten - gluten-related disorders - non-celiac gluten/wheat sensitivity - wheat.
24567238	The enthesopathy of celiac patients: effects of gluten-free diet.	Celiac disease (CD) is a gluten-sensitive enthesopathy occurring in genetically predisposed individuals that is caused by a permanent intolerance to gluten. The major environmental factor associated with the risk of developing celiac-related complications is persistent exposure to dietary gluten. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of lower limb enthesopathy in CD patients at first diagnosis compared with CD patients on a gluten-free diet (GFD). Fifty-five untreated CD patients (group A) and 55 CD patients on a GFD from at least 1 year (group B), matched for age and sex, attending gastroenterology outpatient clinic of the University Federico II of Naples, were enrolled in this study. All patients underwent clinical and ultrasonography examination. Among group A, 27 (49.8 %) patients presented at least one entheseal alteration as compared with 15 patients (27.2 %) of group B (prevalence rate ratio 1.83, I.C. 95 % = 0.48-7.01; p < 0.001). The Glasgow ultrasound enthesitis scoring system (GUESS) was significantly higher in patients of group A than in patients of group B. In conclusion, our study shows that enthesopathy is more frequent in untreated CD subjects with positive anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies title, as compared to those on GFD and absence of serum anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies title. 
30342033	Synthetic Neoepitopes of the Transglutaminase-Deamidated Gliadin Complex as Biomarkers for Diagnosing and Monitoring Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease (CeD) has characteristics of an autoimmune disease, such as increased antibody levels to tissue transglutaminase (tTG). However, assays to measure these biomarkers in blood samples do not identify patients with sufficient accuracy for diagnosis or monitoring of CeD. We aimed to discover biomarkers of CeD derived from neoepitopes of deamidated gliadin peptides (DGP) and tTG fragments and to determine if immune reactivity against these epitopes can identify patients with CeD with mucosal healing. METHODS: We analyzed serum samples from 90 patients with biopsy-proven CeD and 79 healthy individuals (controls) for immune reactivity against the tTG-DGP complex (discovery cohort). A fluorescent peptide microarray platform was used to estimate the antibody-binding intensity of each synthesized tTG-DGP epitope. We validated our findings in 82 patients with newly diagnosed CeD and 217 controls. We tested the ability of our peptide panel to identify patients with mucosal healing (based on the histologic analysis) using serum samples from patients with treated and healed CeD (n = 85), patients with treated but unhealed CeD (n = 81; villous atrophy despite a adhering a gluten-free diet), patients with untreated CeD (n = 82) and disease controls (n = 27), villous atrophy without CeD), and healthy controls (n = 217). Data were analyzed using principal component analysis followed by machine learning and support vector machine modeling. RESULTS: We identified 172 immunogenic epitopes of the tTG-DGP complex. We found significantly increased immune reactivity against these epitopes vs controls. In the both cohort, the set of neoepitopes derived from the tTG-DGP complex identified patients with CeD with 99% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Serum samples from patients with untreated CeD had the greatest mean antibody-binding intensity against the tTG-DGP complex (32.5 +- 16.4). The average antibody-binding intensity was significantly higher in serum from patients with treated but unhealed CeD mucosa (15.1 +- 7.5) than in patients with treated and healed CeD mucosa (5.5 +- 3.4) (P < .001). The assay identified patients with mucosa healing status with 84% sensitivity and 95% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: We identified immunogenic epitopes of the tTG-DGP complex, and found that an assay to measure the immune response to epitopes accurately identified patients with CeD, as well as patients with mucosal healing. This biomarker assay might be used in detection and monitoring of patients with CeD.
38604542	How future pharmacological therapies for celiac disease will complement the gluten-free diet.	The only proven treatment for celiac disease is adherence to a strict, lifelong, gluten free diet. However, complete dietary gluten avoidance is challenging and a substantial number of patients do not respond fully, clinically or histologically, despite their best efforts. As celiac disease is common and its central pathophysiology is well elucidated, it has become attractive for drug development to address the limitations of dietary treatment. Most efforts address non-responsive celiac disease, defined as continued symptoms and/or signs of disease activity despite a gluten free diet, including the more severe forms of refractory celiac disease type 1 and 2. An increasing spectrum of therapeutic approaches target defined mechanisms in celiac disease pathogenesis, and some currently advance to phase 2-3 clinical studies. We discuss these approaches in terms of potential efficiency, practicability, safety and need as defined by patients, regulatory authorities, health care providers and payors.
38648685	Celiac disease: Hope for new treatments beyond a gluten-free diet.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the small intestine induced and maintained by gluten ingestion in susceptible individuals. Current treatment consists of strict adherence to a lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD) which is considered safe and effective in the large majority of patients. However, since adherence to a GFD is difficult and has a negative impact on quality of life, an increasing interest in other treatment options has emerged. Moreover, in some individuals a GFD is not sufficiently effective, necessitating alternative treatments. METHODS: By performing a systematic search, we constructed a detailed narrative review. Only treatment options considered relevant and conducted in a phase I, II or III clinical trial were included. RESULTS: Based on the pathophysiology of CD, four major therapeutic approaches can be distinguished: firstly, by focusing on intraluminal gluten detoxification before absorption occurs, secondly, by modulating intestinal permeability and preventing paracellular uptake, thirdly, by enhancing immunological tolerance to gluten and finally, by regulating gluten auto-immunity. CONCLUSIONS: Despite significant efforts, no treatment has yet completed a phase III clinical trial. Future studies will likely focus on the use of supplemental drugs in conjunction to a GFD, with ALV003 and ZED-1227 currently being the most promising therapeutic options.
24578088	Nutritional differences between a gluten-free diet and a diet containing equivalent products with gluten.	The gluten-free (GF) products market represents one of the most prosperous markets in the field of food and beverages in the immediate future. Historically, counselling for celiac disease has focused on the absence of gluten in foods, however the nutritional quality of GF foodstuffs is an important aspect to consider. The aim of the present work was to compare the nutritional composition of the 206 GF rendered products most consumed in Spain, against the composition of 289 equivalent foods with gluten, and to make a comparison between the diet including GF products and the same diet with equivalent products with gluten in a 58 adult celiac population. The results of the present collaborative study pointed out differences in calorie, macronutrient, fiber, sodium, salt and cholesterol content between GF rendered and gluten-containing foodstuffs. Thus, calorie and nutrient intake in a GF diet is different when compared to its equivalent diet with gluten. Following a diet based on GF products could suppose a nutritional imbalance for celiac patients as well as for non-celiacs who follow a diet that includes many GF rendered foodstuffs. 
31544803	Linear growth of children with celiac disease after the first two years on gluten- free diet: a controlled study.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a lifelong disorder with gluten-induced manifestations in different organs especially growth. Gluten free diet (GFD) is required to achieve remission and prevent abnormal growth. Study reports on growth of children with celiac disease on long-term GFD are not consistent. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effect of GFD on growth of children with the classical form of CD (diagnosed by serology and small intestine mucosal biopsy) on log-term GFD (>2 years). METHODS: We studied growth parameters (weight gain/day, BMI and BMI-SDS, height growth velocity, Ht-SDS) and lab data in 30 prepubertal children, aged 7.4+-2.6 years, with CD, who were on GFD since the age of 3.2+-1.6 years of age (>2 years on GFD) for duration of 1 year. The anthropometric data of 30 randomly selected normal, age and sex matched, children were used as control. Lab investigations of CD children included complete blood count (CBC), renal and liver functions (aspartate transaminase - AST, alanine aminotransferase - ALT, and alkaline phosphatase- ALP, serum albumin, fasting blood glucose, vitamin D, and thyroid function and antibodies. RESULTS: The weight gain per day was on average or above, for age and sex, in 27 children and below average in 3. Two out of those 3 children had slow linear growth (decreased Ht-SDS by -0.56 and -0.1, over one year). BMI-SDS was normal in 26/30 patients (>-1.5). BMI-SD changed from -0.36+-1.1 to -0.33+-1.1 during the year of treatment. BMI-SDS decreased in 9 children during the follow up period that was explained by their fast-linear growth (increased Ht-SDS) in seven of them. The Ht-SDS was <-2 in four out of 30 children at the beginning of the study (2 years after being on GFD) and in 2 children after a year of follow-up (catch-up growth). Ht-SDS remained normal or increased in 28/30 children during the year of treatment (-0.38 +-1.2 to -0.22+-1.1), with a positive trend: 0.15+-0.4 SDS. Only one patient crossed down 1 Ht-SDS during the year of follow up, with low weight gain/day and decreased BMI-SDS that can be explained by poor compliance with GFD. Ht-SDS and BMI-SDS increased significantly in the CD group versus controls during the year of follow-up. All patients had normal serum albumin, liver enzyme and hemoglobin levels. 33.3% of patients had low serum ferritin level and 33.3% had a vitamin D deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Most of our children with CD grew normally both in height and weight during GFD. Significant catch-up growth occurred in some of them after 2 years of being on GFD. Those with low BMI-SDS and/or Ht-SDS needed further management, including reinforcement on the importance of GFD and investigations on factors affecting growth pattern. Measuring weight gain /day appears to be a sensitive indicator for monitoring growth in these children. Vitamin D and iron status should be monitored, and deficiencies corrected.
20805461	Case report: Celiac disease masquerading as bone metastasis in a 29-year-old woman.	
22364010	[Reproductive disorders in women with celiac disease: effect of etiotropic therapy].	The study included 132 women (average age 38.5 +/- 1.17 years) with HC observed in the CSRIG from 2000 to 2010. Comparison group consisted of 105 women (average age 38.7 +/- 1.6 years) mainly with functional bowel disorders (irritable bowel syndrome, functional constipation, functional meteorism, inert colon). Take into account the information relating to obstetric and gynecological history, Physical and laboratory signs of malabsorption syndrome (MS), studies of antibodies to alpha-gliadin immunoglobulin (IG), Class A (AHA) and tissue transglutaminase (AtTG). Reproductive disorders in women with celiac disease are significantly more frequently than in women with functional bowel disease. One of the causes of reproductive disorders in patients with HC might be malabsorption disorders of essential nutrients in the small intestine. The presence of reproductive disorders should be considered as a risk factor for celiac disease, so these women should be screened for celiac disease.
24039358	Cardiovascular disease risk factor profiles in children with celiac disease on gluten-free diets.	AIM: To describe the cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in a population of children with celiac disease (CD) on a gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: This cross-sectional multicenter study was performed at Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel (Petach Tiqva, Israel), and San Paolo Hospital (Milan, Italy). We enrolled 114 CD children in serologic remission, who were on a GFD for at least one year. At enrollment, anthropometric measurements, blood lipids and glucose were assessed, and compared to values at diagnosis. The homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance was calculated as a measure of insulin resistance. RESULTS: Three or more concomitant CVD risk factors [body mass index, waist circumference, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, blood pressure and insulin resistance] were identified in 14% of CD subjects on a GFD. The most common CVD risk factors were high fasting triglycerides (34.8%), elevated blood pressure (29.4%), and high concentrations of calculated LDL cholesterol (24.1%). On a GFD, four children (3.5%) had insulin resistance. Fasting insulin and HOMA-IR were significantly higher in the Italian cohort compared to the Israeli cohort (P < 0.001). Children on a GFD had an increased prevalence of borderline LDL cholesterol (24%) when compared to values (10%) at diagnosis (P = 0.090). Trends towards increases in overweight (from 8.8% to 11.5%) and obesity (from 5.3% to 8.8%) were seen on a GFD. CONCLUSION: This report of insulin resistance and CVD risk factors in celiac children highlights the importance of CVD screening, and the need for dietary counseling targeting CVD prevention.
30159724	Development of wheat genotypes expressing a glutamine-specific endoprotease from barley and a prolyl endopeptidase from Flavobacterium meningosepticum or Pyrococcus furiosus as a potential remedy to celiac disease.	Ubiquitous nature of prolamin proteins dubbed gluten from wheat and allied cereals imposes a major challenge in the treatment of celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder with no known treatment other than abstinence diet. Administration of hydrolytic glutenases as food supplement is an alternative to deliver the therapeutic agents directly to the small intestine, where sensitization of immune system and downstream reactions take place. The aim of the present research was to evaluate the capacity of wheat grain to express and store hydrolytic enzymes capable of gluten detoxification. For this purpose, wheat scutellar calli were biolistically transformed to generate plants expressing a combination of glutenase genes for prolamin detoxification. Digestion of prolamins with barley endoprotease B2 (EP-HvB2) combined with Flavobacterium meningosepticum prolyl endopeptidase (PE-FmPep) or Pyrococcus furiosus prolyl endopeptidase (PE-PfuPep) significantly reduced (up to 67%) the amount of the indigestible gluten peptides of all prolamin families tested. Seven of the 168 generated lines showed inheritance of transgene to the T2 generation. Reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography of gluten extracts under simulated gastrointestinal conditions allowed the identification of five T2 lines that contained significantly reduced amounts of immunogenic, celiac disease-provoking gliadin peptides. These findings were complemented by the R5 ELISA test results where up to 72% reduction was observed in the content of immunogenic peptides. The developed wheat genotypes open new horizons for treating celiac disease by an intraluminal enzyme therapy without compromising their agronomical performance.

29974760	[Analysis of bone mineral density in children with celiac disease. Densitometry indications and effect of gluten-free diet].	INTRODUCTION: one of the main extradigestive manifestations of celiac disease is the decrease in bone mineral density (BMD). Bone densitometry performed with DXA is the method of choice for BMD assessment. Indications for its use in celiac children are controversial. OBJECTIVE: analyzing BMD and various clinical-analytical variables in celiac children when diagnosed and after a gluten-free diet. Define a profile of patients who are more likely to present BMD involvement based on several individual characteristics, to perform DXA indications. METHODS: study performed in 24 celiac children (12 boys) (age: 8.7 +- 3.3 years). Their BMD was determined at diagnosis and after a gluten-free diet using DXA. The BMD was compared in each patient in the two moments of the study and at the moment of diagnosis between groups of patients stratified according to severity criteria dependent on clinical, analytical and histological variables. RESULTS: BMD was normal in all patients studied at the time of diagnosis and after treatment, with no difference between the two moments of the analysis. Children who presented symptomatology when diagnosed with celiac disease had lower spine and femur BMD than asymptomatic ones. The calcemia had an inverse correlation with the time of evolution of the disease before its diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: in general, in our setting, the study of bone mineralization in celiac children is not indicated, unless there has been a prolonged clinical course before diagnosis.
39202879	Impact of Incorporating Dried Chaga Mushroom (Inonotus obliquus) into Gluten-Free Bread on Its Antioxidant and Sensory Characteristics.	Gluten-free bread is increasingly popular among individuals with celiac disease, and The incorporation of mushroom flour offers a novel method to enhance its nutritional profile, antioxidant content, and sensory properties. This study aimed to evaluate the antioxidant and sensory characteristics of gluten-free bread with varying amounts of chaga mushroom flour (5%, 10%, 15%, 20%). The total contents of polyphenols and flavonoids were measured using a spectrophotometric method. Antioxidant activity was assessed through DPPH and FRAP methods, while textural properties were evaluated using the TPA test. Bread colour was analysed using the CIELab system, and sensory evaluation was performed by a panel of trained consumers. The results showed that gluten-free bread enriched with chaga flour had increased polyphenol and flavonoid content and enhanced antioxidant activity. The highest levels of polyphenols, flavonoids, DPPH, and FRAP activity were found in bread with 20% chaga. The addition of chaga mushroom significantly affected the bread's hardness, cohesiveness, and chewiness. Specifically, 20% chaga flour had the most pronounced effect on hardness and elasticity, while 15% chaga flour had the greatest impact on chewiness and cohesiveness. The bread's colour darkened with higher chaga concentrations. The results of sensory evaluation showed a negative correlation between consumer preferences and bread fortified with chaga mushroom flour. The overall consumer acceptability score indicates that only a small addition of mushroom flour (up to 10%) can be used to bake gluten-free bread.
32172690	Safety of occasional ingestion of gluten in patients with celiac disease: a real-life study.	BACKGROUND: Gluten-free diet (GFD) decreases the quality of life of celiac disease (CD) patients, who frequently ask to occasionally ingest gluten-containing food. We evaluated CD patients reporting voluntary and occasional transgressions to their GFD. METHODS: From October 2017 to September 2018, the patients reporting occasional and voluntary gluten ingestion (GFD-noncompliant) were prospectively enrolled. These patients underwent clinical examination, blood tests, duodenal biopsy, capsule enteroscopy (CE), and a validated food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) assessing the frequency and quantity of gluten intake. Mortality was calculated and compared to the general population. A group of patients on strict GFD (GFD-adherent) acted as controls. RESULTS: One thousand three hundred seventy-eight CD patients were evaluated during the study period. One hundred nine (8%) reported occasional (weekly or monthly) voluntary ingestion of gluten. The mean gluten intake was 185.2 +- 336.9 g/year, and the duration of their incorrect GFD was 8.6 +- 6.9 years. Among the noncompliant patients, 57% did not present any histological alteration; furthermore, the Marsh score profile was not different between compliant and noncompliant patients. Seventy percent did not present any alteration at CE. Seventy-five percent of patients reported no gastrointestinal symptoms after gluten ingestion. Twenty-three percent of patients in the GFD-noncompliant group presented positive tTG-IgA. No association was found between gluten intake, clinical symptoms, and biomarkers. Mortality was not different between the groups and the general population. CONCLUSIONS: Our results are that in a real-life scenario, a group of CD patients on long-term gluten intake showed no significant clinical symptoms or small bowel damage, thus suggesting that a degree of tolerance towards gluten consumption can be reached.
39190044	Iron deficiency without anemia in children with newly diagnosed celiac disease: 1-year follow-up of ferritin levels, with and without iron supplementation.	Iron deficiency (ID) without anemia is common in children with newly diagnosed celiac disease (CD). We aimed to assess the effect of iron supplementation versus no treatment on ferritin levels in newly diagnosed CD patients with ID adhering to a gluten-free diet (GFD). A retrospective review of children < 18 years, with low ferritin (<= 10 ng/mL) and normal hemoglobin levels diagnosed between 12.2018 and 12.2021. We compared hemoglobin and ferritin levels between patients who received supplemental iron to those who did not. Data, including demographics, laboratory tests, and anthropometrics, were collected at baseline, and at 6 and 12 months following the initiation of the GFD. Adherence to GFD was assessed at each visit. Among 304 children diagnosed during the study period, 43 (14.1%) had iron deficiency anemia and 60 (19.7%) ID without anemia. Among children with ID, 29 (48%) were female, mean age 7.3 +- 3.9 years. Twenty-nine (48%) children received iron supplementation, and 31 (52%) did not. At the 12-month follow-up visit, tissue transglutaminase levels decreased significantly (p < 0.001), from a mean baseline level of 226.6 +- 47.8 to 34.5 +- 46 U/mL in children that received iron supplementation and from 234.2 +- 52.4 to 74.5 +- 88.7 U/mL in non-treated children, with no significant difference between the groups p = 0.22. Ferritin levels increased significantly (p < 0.001), from 9.0 +- 4.7 to 25.2 +- 20.8 ng/mL in patients who received supplementation and from 8.9 +- 3.8 to18.6 +- 9.5 ng/mL in patients who did not, with no significant difference between the groups (p = 0.46). CONCLUSION: Most children with newly diagnosed celiac disease and iron deficiency, who adhere to GFD, will normalize ferritin levels within 12 months without the need of iron supplementation. WHAT IS KNOWN:   Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia are common in newly diagnosed celiac disease.   Improved iron absorption may follow mucosal healing process in patients adhering to a strict gluten-free diet. WHAT IS NEW:   This single-center, retrospective cohort study evaluated the effect of iron supplementation versus no treatment on ferritin levels in children with newly diagnosed celiac disease with iron deficiency adhering to a gluten-free diet.   Most children with newly diagnosed celiac disease and iron deficiency, who adhere to gluten-free diet, will normalize ferritin levels within 12 months without the need of iron supplementation.
21670710	Celiac disease in normal-weight and overweight children: clinical features and growth outcomes following a gluten-free diet.	OBJECTIVES: There are few data on pediatric celiac disease in the United States. The aim of our study was to describe the presentation of celiac disease among children with a normal and an elevated body mass index (BMI) for age, and to study their BMI changes following a gluten-free diet (GFD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred forty-two children (age 13 months-19 years) with biopsy-proven celiac disease, contained in a registry of patients studied at our center from 2000 to 2008, had follow-up growth data available. Patients' height, weight, and BMI were converted to z scores for age and grouped by BMI as underweight, normal, and overweight. Compliance was confirmed using results of serological assays, and data of noncompliant patients were analyzed separately. Data were analyzed during the observation period and were expressed as change in height, weight, and BMI z score per month of dietary treatment. RESULTS: Nearly 19% of patients had an elevated BMI at diagnosis (12.6% overweight, 6% obese) and 74.5% presented with a normal BMI. The mean duration of follow-up was 35.6 months. Seventy-five percent of patients with an elevated BMI at diagnosis decreased their BMI z scores significantly after adherence to a GFD, normalizing it in 44% of cases. Of patients with a normal BMI at diagnosis, weight z scores increased significantly after treatment, and 13% became overweight. CONCLUSIONS: Both normal weight and overweight frequently occur in North American children presenting with celiac disease. A GFD may have a beneficial effect upon the BMI of overweight and obese children with celiac disease.

24882720	Novel therapeutic approaches for celiac disease.	Celiac disease, which mainly affects the small intestine, is the only systemic autoimmune disorder with an identified environmental trigger which is dietary gluten. Lifelong adherence to a strict gluten free diet (GFD) is currently the only accepted treatment. Celiac disease is increasingly diagnosed and the GFD is known to be associated with a large treatment burden. Furthermore, a substantial number of celiac disease patients show an incomplete clinical response to the GFD. These factors have led to demands for the development and testing of novel, non-dietary, therapeutic agents that are both safe and effective. Celiac disease pathogenesis is well elucidated which has greatly aided targeted drug development. Compounds currently being tested in phase II clinical trials include glutenase enzymes (to detoxify gluten) and a tight junction modulator (to reduce access of gluten peptides to lamina propria antigen presenting cells). Other promising approaches include inhibition of the transglutaminase 2 enzyme, blocking antigen presentation by HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8, induction of tolerance, and modulation of the inflammatory response. It is hoped that non-dietary therapy for celiac disease will become available in the coming years and can both reduce the burden of treatment of celiac disease and help patients whose symptoms do not respond completely to the GFD. 
29709462	Faecal high mobility group box 1 in children with celiac disease: A pilot study.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a gluten-related immunological disorder resulting in inflammatory enteropathy. AIMS: We assessed a stool marker of intestinal inflammation, the HMGB1 protein, in children with CD on a gluten free diet (GFD) at baseline and at follow up (FU). METHODS: Thirty-nine children were investigated at diagnosis and at FU. Traditional serum markers of CD (anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysial antibodies) and faecal HMGB1 (by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblotting) were tested. RESULTS: There was a marked increase at baseline in both serum anti-transglutaminase IgA (anti-tTGAs) and faecal HMGB1; the latter being undetectable in controls. A strong correlation occurred between the two markers. At 12-month FU in 24 patients on GFD, HMGB1 decreased in all subjects, yet still being detectable in six children: high anti-tTGAs where evident in three, while the three with normal anti-tTGAs were complaining of intestinal symptoms and reported a low GFD adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Faecal HMGB1 is a valuable marker of intestinal inflammation and may have a role in complementing serology in the management of CD children. Future studies including larger patient cohorts and small bowel mucosa histology will be designed to assess the relationship between faecal HMGB1 levels and duodeno-jejunal histopathology.
37299462	Advances in Understanding the Human Gut Microbiota and Its Implication in Pediatric Celiac Disease-A Narrative Review.	Celiac disease (CD) is a multifactorial disorder, defined by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Both genetic predisposition and dietary exposure to gluten are essential factors in triggering CD. However, there is proof that their presence is necessary, but not sufficient, for disease development. Through gut microbiota modulation, several additional environmental factors have shown their potential role as co-factors in CD pathogenesis. The aim of this review is to illustrate the possible mechanisms that stand behind the gut microbiota's involvement in CD pathogenesis. Furthermore, we discuss microbiota manipulation's potential role as both a preventative and therapeutic option. The available literature provides evidence that even before CD onset, factors including cesarean birth and formula feeding, as well as intestinal infection exposure, amplify the risk of CD in genetically predisposed individuals, due to their influence on the intestinal microbiome composition. Active CD was associated with elevated levels of several Gram-negative bacterial genera, including Bacteroides, Escherichia, and Prevotella, while beneficial bacteria such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria were less abundant. Viral and fungal dysbiosis has also been described in CD, evidencing specific taxa alteration. A gluten-free diet (GFD) may improve the clinical symptoms and duodenal histopathology, but the persistence of intestinal dysbiosis in CD children under a GFD urges the need for additional therapy. Probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbial transplant have demonstrated their efficacy in restoring gut microbiota eubiosis in adult CD patients; however, their efficacy and safety as adjunctive therapies to a GFD in pediatric patients needs further investigation.
24916557	Swedish children with celiac disease comply well with a gluten-free diet, and most include oats without reporting any adverse effects: a long-term follow-up study.	The only known treatment for celiac disease is a gluten-free diet (GFD), which initially meant abstention from wheat, rye, barley, and oats. Recently, oats free from contamination with wheat have been accepted in the GFD. Yet, reports indicate that all celiac disease patients may not tolerate oats. We hypothesized that celiac children comply well with a GFD and that most have included oats in their diet. A food questionnaire was used to check our patients; 316 questionnaires were returned. Mean time on the GFD was 6.9 years, and 96.8% of the children reported that they were trying to keep a strict GFD. However, accidental transgressions occurred in 263 children (83.2%). In 2 of 3 cases, mistakes took place when the patients were not at home. Symptoms after incidental gluten intake were experienced by 162 (61.6%) patients, mostly (87.5%) from the gastrointestinal tract. Small amounts of gluten (<4 g) caused symptoms in 38% of the cases, and 68% reported symptoms during the first 3 hours after gluten consumption. Oats were included in the diet of 89.4% of the children for a mean of 3.4 years. Most (81.9%) ate purified oats, and 45.3% consumed oats less than once a week. Among those who did not consume oats, only 5.9% refrained because of symptoms. General compliance with the GFD was good. Only the duration of the GFD appeared to influence adherence to the diet. Most patients did not report adverse effects after long-term consumption of oats. 
27381303	[Adult Celiac Disease].	Celiac disease is an immune-mediated enteropathy in genetically predisposed individuals, triggered by gluten ingestion. Clinical manifestations include intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms. Affected individuals may also be completely asymptomatic. Nevertheless, an early diagnosis is essential in order to prevent long-term complications. Diagnostic approach involves serologic testing for tissue transglutaminase antibodies followed by duodenal biopsy in case of seropositivity. Until now, the only available treatment consists of a strict glute-free diet. Newer therapeutic strategies are currently being evaluated in clinical trials.
35979168	Pancreatic involvement in celiac disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is well recognized as a systemic, chronic autoimmune disease mainly characterized by gluten-sensitive enteropathy in genetically predisposed individuals but with various extraintestinal features. One of the affected organs in CD is the pancreas, consisting of both endocrine and exocrine alterations. Over the last decades there has been increasing interest in the pancreatic changes in CD, and this has been reflected by a great number of publications looking at this extraintestinal involvement during the course of CD. While pancreatic endocrine changes in CD, focusing on type 1 diabetes mellitus, are well documented in the literature, the relationship with the exocrine pancreas has been less studied. This review summarizes currently available evidence with regard to pancreatic exocrine alterations in CD, focusing on risk of pancreatitis in CD patients, association with autoimmune pancreatitis, prevalence and outcomes of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency in newly diagnosed and gluten-free diet treated CD patients, and the link with cystic fibrosis. In addition, we discuss mechanisms behind the associated pancreatic exocrine impairment in CD and highlight the recommendations for clinical practice.
28810029	Celiac Disease and Nonceliac Gluten Sensitivity: A Review.	IMPORTANCE: The prevalence of gluten-related disorders is rising, and increasing numbers of individuals are empirically trying a gluten-free diet for a variety of signs and symptoms. This review aims to present current evidence regarding screening, diagnosis, and treatment for celiac disease and nonceliac gluten sensitivity. OBSERVATIONS: Celiac disease is a gluten-induced immune-mediated enteropathy characterized by a specific genetic genotype (HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 genes) and autoantibodies (antitissue transglutaminase and antiendomysial). Although the inflammatory process specifically targets the intestinal mucosa, patients may present with gastrointestinal signs or symptoms, extraintestinal signs or symptoms, or both, suggesting that celiac disease is a systemic disease. Nonceliac gluten sensitivity is diagnosed in individuals who do not have celiac disease or wheat allergy but who have intestinal symptoms, extraintestinal symptoms, or both, related to ingestion of gluten-containing grains, with symptomatic improvement on their withdrawal. The clinical variability and the lack of validated biomarkers for nonceliac gluten sensitivity make establishing the prevalence, reaching a diagnosis, and further study of this condition difficult. Nevertheless, it is possible to differentiate specific gluten-related disorders from other conditions, based on currently available investigations and algorithms. Clinicians cannot distinguish between celiac disease and nonceliac gluten sensitivity by symptoms, as they are similar in both. Therefore, screening for celiac disease must occur before a gluten-free diet is implemented, since once a patient initiates a gluten-free diet, testing for celiac disease is no longer accurate. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Celiac disease and nonceliac gluten sensitivity are common. Although both conditions are treated with a gluten-free diet, distinguishing between celiac disease and nonceliac gluten sensitivity is important for long-term therapy. Patients with celiac disease should be followed up closely for dietary adherence, nutritional deficiencies, and the development of possible comorbidities.
22495813	A comparison between lactose breath test and quick test on duodenal biopsies for diagnosing lactase deficiency in patients with self-reported lactose intolerance.	BACKGROUND: A lactose breath test (LBT) is usually used to diagnose lactase deficiency, and a lactose quick test (LQT) has been proposed as a new test on duodenal biopsies to detect this disorder. GOALS: We aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of LBT and LQT and their ability to predict the clinical response to a lactose-free diet in patients with self-reported lactose intolerance. STUDY: Fifty-five patients (age 47 +- 14 y; M/F 15/36) underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and 25g-LBT. Two duodenal biopsies were taken to determine lactase deficiency (normal, mild, or severe) by LQT and to rule out other causes of secondary lactose malabsorption. Patients with a positive LBT and normal LQT also underwent a glucose breath test to exclude small intestinal bacterial overgrowth as a cause of the former result. The severity of gastrointestinal symptoms was measured with a GSS questionnaire, under basal condition and 1 month after a lactose-free diet. RESULTS: Lactose malabsorption was detected in 31/51 patients with LBT and in 37/51 patients with LQT (P = NS). Celiac disease was found in 2 patients. Two LBT+ patients showed a positive glucose breath test for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Eight patients had a mild hypolactasia by LQT and a negative LBT, but they had a significant improvement of symptoms after diet. LQT and LBT were concordant in 83% of cases and predicted the response to a lactose-free diet in 98% and 81% of the cases, respectively (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: LQT is as sensitive as LBT in detecting lactase deficiency; however, it seems to be more accurate than LBT in predicting the clinical response to a lactose-free diet.
22976708	Severe symmetrical facial lipoatrophy in a patient with discoid lupus erythematosus.	Acquired partial lipodystrophy is a rare disorder, and it is characterized by the absence of subcutaneous fat from the face, the neck, the trunk, and the upper extremities. The etiology of acquired partial lipodystrophy includes scleroderma and discoid lupus erythematosus. Literature review reveals studies involving 10 patients until today with lipoatrophy due to or after the onset of discoid lupus erythematosus; all are female patients. We want to report a young male patient with progressive symmetrical facial lipoatrophy. In addition, he has discoid lupus erythematosus and celiac disease. Fat grafting and adjuvant oral coenzyme Q10 tablets (Deka-none; Deka Pharmaceuticals, Istanbul, Turkey) were administered for treatment. To our knowledge, this case involves the first male patient in the literature presenting with symmetrical facial lipoatrophy with very prominent periorbital lipoatrophy and bitemporal hollowing symptoms.
27642442	[Serological tests for celiac disease in Moroccan patients with type 1 diabetes].	Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease frequently associated with type 1 diabetes (T1D). The prevalence of CD in patients with T1D varies from 3 to 6%. The clinical manifestation of CD in patients with T1D is classified as asymptomatic in about half of cases. Our study aims to determine the frequency of anti-tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies (IgA-tTG) and anti-gliadin antibodies (AGA) in patients with type 1 diabetes in order to early recommend jejunal biopsy and establish a gluten-free diet before the onset of clinical signs and complications of celiac disease. Subjects included in this study were patients with T1D and untreated CD who showed no signs of this disease. The detection of IgG tTG, IgG IgA and IgG AAG was performed using Luminex technology. We enrolled 31 patients. The study involved 16 men and 15 women. IgA AAG were positive in 4(13%) patients and IgG were positive in 7(22,5%) patients. IgA tTG were positive in 3(10%) patients and IgG was positive in one (3%) patient. In our study the association of diabetes type 1 with biomarkers of CD is not uncommon hence the importance of systematic screening for type 1 diabetes. The diagnosis of this atypical and silent CD form is important given the risk of serious complications such as malabsorption and gastrointestinal cancers. 
26501877	Quality of Life in Screen-detected Celiac Disease Patients in the United States.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Celiac disease (CD) is increasingly diagnosed through screening of at-risk groups (relatives of individuals and associated autoimmune disorders). The impact of diagnosis and treatment on screen-detected CD patients is poorly studied, particularly in the United States. We therefore compared the quality of life (QOL) between screen-detected and symptom-detected CD patients. METHODS: Patients with a known diagnosis of CD were invited to complete 3 validated survey instruments: the CD Quality of Life (CDQOL), the CD Adherence Test for dietary adherence and the general Psychological General Well-Being index. In addition, demographic details, mode of presentation, and compliance with gluten-free diet (GFD) were assessed. RESULTS: The overall response rate was high at 69%. Of 226 responses received, 211 were eligible for inclusion; the median age was 47, and the median duration of GFD was 4 years. One third of the sample (71, 34%) was screen detected. Of these, 57 (80%) had a relative diagnosed with CD, whereas 14 (20%) had an associated condition. Despite being screen detected, 49 (69%) reported symptoms before diagnosis. GFD adherence was excellent and did not differ between groups. Overall, there were no significant differences between screen-detected and symptom-detected patients with regard to CDQOL, CD Adherence Test, and Psychological General Well-Being scores. CONCLUSIONS: Screen-detected and symptom-detected CD patients do not differ with regard to QOL or disease adherence as measured by validated disease-specific instruments. A high proportion of screen-detected patients reported symptoms before diagnosis, which often improve with GFD.
35225129	Next generation strategies to recover immunological tolerance in celiac disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease that occurs in genetically predisposed individuals following the ingestion of gluten. Its prevalence is rising worldwide. A gluten-free (GF) diet is mandatory for the management of CD. However, several issues persist regarding the nutritional quality of GF products. Importantly, deep knowledge about the pathogenic mechanisms in CD highlights the central role of CD4+ T cell-mediated immunity in CD. Furthermore, intestinal T regulatory cells are functional in CD, but cytokines such as IL-15, produced under inflammatory conditions, hamper their activity. This paves the way for the development of immunomodulatory strategies to the GF diet. From this perspective, microbiological approaches were considered able to modulate the gluten-specific immune response. Interestingly, gliadin peptide-based immunotherapy to abolish the inflammatory CD4+T cell-mediated response has been explored in CD patients. Furthermore, different biotechnological approaches based on the use of chemically/enzymatically modified gluten molecules have been proved effective in different models of CD. However, the choice of the right age in infants to introduce the antigen and thus induce tolerance still remains an important issue to solve. Addressing all these points should help to design an effective intervention strategy for preventing CD.
33825090	Cost, Nutritional Content and Number of Gluten-Free Staple Foods Available in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.	Data has indicated that gluten-free (GF) foods are more expensive and have lower nutritional value than their gluten-containing (GC) counterparts. The aim of the present study was to compare the cost and nutrient content between GF and GC staple foods and determine whether the number and price of GF staple foods differed based on type of store or location within Winnipeg, Canada. Twelve grocery stores (2 chain stores/quadrant;1 local store/quadrant) in the four quadrants (northwest, northeast, southwest, southeast) of Winnipeg were visited to identify GF staple products (bread, flour, cereal, pasta) along with a GC comparator. A total of 819 GF products along with GC comparators were identified. The median cost of GF products ($1.50/100 g) was 131 % greater than that of GC ($0.65/100 g) (p < 0.0001). The greatest difference in cost was between GF and GC flour, with the least difference occurring between GF and GC cereal. GF products were 58, 36 and 100 % lower in iron, protein and saturated fat (p < 0.0001) than their GC comparators, respectively. The number of GF staple products was 370 % higher (p < 0.007) at chain stores than at local stores, whereas store location did not significantly affect the number of GF products available. The greatest difference in number of different GF foods based on store type was for cereals, with the least being for flours. These results confirm that GF staple foods are more expensive and have lower nutritional value (mainly due to lower iron and protein content) compared to GC foods.
30926284	Risk of bacterial pneumonia and pneumococcal infection in youths with celiac disease - A population-based study.	OBJECTIVE: Assess the risk of hospitalizations for bacterial pneumonia or pneumococcal infections, in a cohort of young individuals with celiac disease (CD) compared to matched references. STUDY DESIGN: The cohort consists of 213,635 individuals, born in 1989-2012 and resident in Friuli-Venezia Giulia (Italy). Through pathology reports, hospital discharge records or co-payment exemptions, we identified 1294 CD patients and 6470 reference individuals matched by gender and birth year. We considered hospital admissions for first episodes of bacterial pneumonia and pneumococcal infections. Hazard ratios (HRs) for episodes after CD diagnosis were calculated with Cox regression and odds ratios (OR) for the ones before CD diagnosis with conditional logistic regression. Further analyses were performed on unvaccinated follow-up periods. RESULTS: 14 CD patients (in 9450 person-years) and 42 references (in 48,335 person-years) experienced a first episode of bacterial pneumonia, with an increased risk among CD patients (HR 1.82; 95%CI 0.98-3.35). Risks of bacterial pneumonia were significantly increased before CD diagnosis and especially the year before CD diagnosis (OR 6.00, 95%CI 1.83-19.66). Risks of pneumococcal infections showed a non-significant increase in CD patients. CONCLUSIONS: CD children and youth showed an increased risk of bacterial pneumonia, especially in proximity to CD diagnosis. Anti-pneumococcal vaccination should be recommended to all young CD patients.
34586475	Elevated liver enzymes of newly diagnosed pediatric celiac patients-a prospective-observational study.	Celiac disease clinical presentation is constantly changing. We set to determine the prevalence of elevated transaminases in newly diagnosed celiac patients and to evaluate this sub-group of patients for associated clinical and laboratory findings and assess their natural course of disease following therapeutic diet initiation. We conducted a prospective-observational study of all newly diagnosed pediatric celiac patients, between August 2016 and April 2018, in a pediatric gastroenterology clinic. Clinical data, anthropometrics, and blood test results were recorded at diagnosis and at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively, of follow-up. We compared patients with normal and elevated transaminases at diagnosis. ALT threshold was set at 24 U/l. Of 125 newly diagnosed celiac patients, 31 (24.8%) had elevated ALT at diagnosis; two (1.6%) with over 3 x ULN. Patients with elevated ALT at diagnosis were significantly younger (mean age 5.5 (SD 3.4) vs. 7.3 (SD 3.7) years, p < 0.01) and more commonly presented with diarrhea (32.3% vs. 14.9%, p = 0.03). Eighty percent of patients with elevated ALT levels normalized their ALT within 3 months and all within 1 year. Following gluten-free diet initiation, patients with elevated ALT had similar clinical course, growth, serology normalization rate, and laboratory results, compared to patients with normal ALT over a 1-year follow-up. A single patient was simultaneously co-diagnosed with celiac disease and autoimmune hepatitis.Conclusion: Clinically significant ALT abnormalities are rare among newly diagnosed pediatric celiac patients. Significant elevations failing to normalize on a gluten-free diet should raise concern of a concomitant primary liver disease and warrant further investigations. What is Known:   Elevated liver enzymes may be an extra-intestinal manifestation of celiac disease.   Reported prevalences of ALT elevations among children with a new diagnosis of celiac disease ranges between 5 and 40%. What is New:   ALT elevations are present in 25% of children with a new diagnosis of celiac disease.   Significant elevations (>3 x ULN) are rare (1.6%).   Elevated liver enzymes are associated with earlier age at diagnosis.   The natural history of patients with elevated liver enzymes at diagnosis is comparable to those without.
27979583	Abdominal Pain-Associated Functional Gastrointestinal Disorder Prevalence in Children and Adolescents with Celiac Disease on Gluten-Free Diet: A Multinational Study.	OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that children with celiac disease (CD) on gluten-free diet are at increased risk of abdominal pain (AP) associated-functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). STUDY DESIGN: This was a multinational cross-sectional study performed from 2014 to 2015. Patients 4-18 years of age with CD on gluten-free diet for longer than 6 months were recruited from pediatric CD clinics in US and Italy. Control groups included siblings of children with CD (with normal tissue transglutaminase levels) and unrelated controls. Subjects or parents completed the Questionnaire on Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms-Rome III. RESULTS: Children (n = 289) were recruited (55% US, 45% Italy): 96 children with CD, 96 sibling controls, and 97 unrelated controls. Chronic AP was present in 30 (30.9%) subjects with CD, 22 (22.7%) sibling controls, and 21 (21.6%) unrelated controls (P = .26 patients with CD vs siblings; P = .18 patients with CD vs unrelated; P = .96 siblings vs unrelated). AP-FGIDs were present in 8 (8.2%) subjects with CD, 8 (8.2%) sibling controls, and 2 (2.1%) unrelated controls (P = 1.00 subjects with CD vs sibling controls; P = .06 subjects with CD vs unrelated controls; P = .06 sibling controls vs unrelated controls). CONCLUSION: This multinational study evaluated the prevalence of chronic abdominal pain and AP-FGIDs in the pediatric population with CD. We found that subjects with CD and controls have a similar prevalence of chronic AP and AP-FGIDs. This suggests that not all types of gastrointestinal inflammation result in AP-FGIDs in children.
23536945	[Specific features of rehabilitation in patients with gluten-sensitivity celiac disease].	AIM: To elaborate recommendations for rehabilitation of patients with gluten-sensitivity celiac disease (GCD) on the basis of a long-term follow-up. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Eighty-seven patients with GCD were followed up for as long as 31 years. Of those, 72.4% of the patients kept strictly to their gluten-free diet (GFD) throughout the follow-up; 9.2% did not follow the diet periodically; and 18.4% did not at all. The sera from 71 patients were tested for IgA and IgG anti-gliadin antibodies (AGAb) and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (ATTGAb) at as long as 19-year follow-up. AGAb and ATTGAb were estimated by enzyme immunoassay (IMMCO Diagnostics). All the patients underwent endoscopic and histological examinations of the small bowel mucosa (SBM). RESULTS: To support the validity of keeping to the GFD, the time course of clinical, laboratory, and morphological changes were analyzed in 63 and 24 GFD followers and non-followers, respectively. The GFD non-followers were more frequently found to have diarrheic syndrome, symptoms of malabsorption syndrome, lower serum concentrations of hemoglobin, total protein, iron, and calcium; no SBM structural recovery was seen in any patient. When the GFD was long adhered to, there was also a reduction in detection rates and AGAb and ATTGAb concentrations. CONCLUSION: The adherence to the GFD was ascertained to contribute to fuller rehabilitation in the patients. However, even the patients who had strictly kept to their GFD showed periods of an exacerbation and incomplete SBM structural recovery. Therefore, the rehabilitation system for patients with GCD must involve diagnostic, therapeutic, and organizational measures that promote not only rapid clinical recovery, but also better quality of life in these patients.
23388848	Biomarkers for diagnosis and monitoring of celiac disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder, which damages the small intestine and is caused by ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. The only known effective treatment is a lifelong gluten-free diet. Genetic risk factors have been identified and nearly all patients are HLA-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8 positive. Specific autoantibodies, IgA antitissue transglutaminase-2, antiendomysium, and antideaminated forms of gliadin peptide antibodies, are widely used as diagnostic aids in celiac patients. However, the discovery of new biomarkers may help in the diagnosis and follow-up of the disease. Recently, the molecule REG Ialpha, involved in tissue regeneration, has been proposed as a new biomarker of CD. REG Ialpha expression is increased in the target tissue and in the sera of celiac patients during damage and inflammation, decreasing after gluten-free diet. In this article we review the main biomarkers for diagnosis and monitoring of CD, focusing on the immune response-related mechanisms.
35810780	Regulatory and Clinical Expert Perspective of the 2022 FDA Draft Guidance "Celiac Disease: Developing Drugs for Adjunctive Treatment to a Gluten-Free Diet".	
22094895	Bone health in children with celiac disease assessed by dual x-ray absorptiometry: effect of gluten-free diet and predictive value of serum biochemical indices.	OBJECTIVES: In the present study, we aimed to assess bone status and the effect of gluten-free diet (GFD) in children with celiac disease (CD), and to evaluate the predictive value of standard serum biochemical indices in the diagnosis of bone mineral density (BMD) disturbances. METHODS: Forty-five children at the time of diagnosis of CD (group A, 77.8% girls) and 36 children receiving GFD for >2 years (group B, 75% girls) were included. Sixteen children in group A were reexamined 12 months after initiation of GFD. Serum measurements of biochemical bone health indices and BMD, assessed by dual x-ray absorptiometry, were obtained. RESULTS: Patients after 1 year of receiving GFD had higher BMD z scores compared with baseline (-1.45 +- 0.28 vs -0.61 +- 0.25, respectively, P = 0.004). BMD z scores were significantly lower than expected for the normal population, after 1 (P = 0.03) or at least 2 (P < 0.001) years of receiving GFD. In group B, BMD z score was positively correlated with 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels (P = 0.009). In the repeated measurements group, 25-hydroxy vitamin D differed between pre- and post-GFD (P = 0.018). No biochemical index was capable of predicting an abnormal BMD z score (receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, all of the areas under the curve <0.66). CONCLUSIONS: GFD has a beneficial effect on bone health. Two years receiving diet do not ensure normalization. Biochemical markers are not indicative of BMD disturbances. Dual x-ray absorptiometry should be included in the standard management of children with CD.
26496305	Serological Screening for Celiac Disease in Adult Chinese Patients With Diarrhea Predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome.	Celiac disease (CD) is common in Caucasians, but thought to be rare in Asians. Our aim was to determine the prevalence of CD in Chinese patients with chronic diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D).From July 2010 to August 2012, 395 adult patients with IBS-D and 363 age and sex-matched healthy controls were recruited in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University and Xiaogan Central Hospital in Hubei province, central China. Patients with IBS-D were diagnosed according to the Rome III criteria. Serum Immunoglobulin (IgA/IgG) anti-human tissue transglutaminase (anti-htTG)-deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP) antibodies were measured in a single ELISA (QUANTA Lite h-tTG/DGP Screen). Upper endoscopy with duodenal biopsies and HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genotyping were performed in seropositive subjects and a gluten-free diet was prescribed.Seven IBS-D patients (7/395, 1.77%) and 2 healthy controls (2/363, 0.55%), were positive for anti-htTG/DGP antibodies. Of these 9 cases, 1 was lost to follow-up, 3 were suspected to have CD and 5 were eventually diagnosed as CD with intestinal histological lesions classified as Marsh Type II in 2 and Type III in 3. Of these 5 diagnosed CD patients, 4 (4/395, 1.01%) were from the IBS-D group and 1 (1/363, 0.28%) from the healthy control had asymptomatic CD. Two Type III CD patients with relatively high titers in the serologic assay were homozygous and heterozygous for haplotype HLA-DQA1*03-DQB1*03:03 (HLA-DQ9.3), respectively.In the present study, CD was present in 1.01% of patients with IBS-D and in 0.28% of the control group. We like to suggest that the haplotype HLA-DQA1*03-DQB1*03:03 (HLA-DQ9.3), which is common in Chinese, is a new susceptibility factor for CD in China. Larger screening and genetic studies are needed in the Chinese population of different regions. 
28343108	The effects of modified versus unmodified wheat gluten administration in patients with celiac disease.	Celiac disease (CD) treatment requires a gluten-free diet (GFD), although alternative approaches have been proposed. Modification of gliadin peptides using microbial transglutaminase (mTG) inhibits their ability to induce immune response in vitro. Our aim was to evaluate the safety of mTG-modified wheat flour ingestion in CD patients. Twenty-one CD patients in remission were randomized to receive mTG-modified (n=11) or unmodified (n=10) wheat flour rusks, in double-blind fashion. Monthly, patients completed a symptom questionnaire. Serum anti-tTG, EMA and creatinine levels were monitored. At baseline and after 90days, serum anti-actin antibodies (AAA) were measured and upper endoscopy was performed. Data were analyzed by non-parametric tests. 7/11 patients eating modified rusks and 7/10 patients receiving unmodified rusks completed the study. At baseline, all patients showed negative serum anti-tTG and EMA results. At the end, 2/7 (28.6%) patients ingesting modified and 4/7 (57.1%) patients taking unmodified rusks presented positive serum anti-tTG and EMA results. Creatinine results were unmodified. Moreover, 1/7 (14.3%) patients ingesting modified and 4/7 (57.1%) patients taking unmodified rusks presented villous atrophy. In patients who received unmodified rusks, the AAA levels increased significantly and duodenal anti-tTG levels appeared higher than those measured in patients who ate modified rusks. Abdominal swelling, bloating and nausea were more severe in patients ingesting unmodified rusks than those taking modified rusks. Our results may support larger clinical trials to confirm the enzymatic treatment of wheat flour as an alternative to GFD. Clinicaltrials.gov registration no: NCT02472119.
31115370	Role of anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA+IgG antibodies in detection of potential celiac disease in patients with type 1 diabetes.	BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: : Celiac disease (CD) can exist in various forms in type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients and can remain undetected, leading to severe complications. This study was aimed to evaluate five commercially available anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) ELISA kits with distinct formats for the detection of CD and potential CD in T1D patients. Clinical and demographic profiles of the patients with different disease subsets were also studied. METHODS: : Fifty T1D patients with classical and non-classical symptoms of CD and 100 T1D patients without any symptoms of CD were included in this study. Anti-tTG autoantibody levels were estimated by five ELISA kits followed by histological examination of duodenal biopsy. HLA DQ2-DQ8 and DRB1-DQB1 typing was done, and serum levels for transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 were also estimated. RESULTS: : Assay format detecting anti-tTG IgA antibodies against recombinant antigens along with neopeptides of gliadin was most efficient in the detection of CD in symptomatic patients, and assay format detecting IgA+IgG helped in the detection of potential CD in asymptomatic T1D patients. These findings were supported by histological examination and human leucocyte antigen analysis. Patients with potential CD were found to have markedly deranged glycaemic control parameters and also had significantly raised serum levels of TGF-beta1, (P <0.05) compared to T1D patients. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: : Potential CD can be frequently seen in T1D patients. This can be attributed to the dietary patterns prevalent in the subcontinent and the genetic basis of the disease. Anti-tTG IgA+IgG antibodies can be useful in the detection of these potential CD cases in T1D patients. Early intervention with gluten-free diet can be considered in these patients for better disease management.
30065211	Cognitive Impairment and Celiac Disease: Is Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation a Trait d'Union between Gut and Brain?	Celiac disease is a systemic disorder with multifactorial pathogenesis and multifaceted symptomatology. In response to gluten exposure, a significant part of the general population produces antibodies that have been hypothesized to be deleterious to the brain. Among the well-known neurological manifestations, adult celiac patients often complain cognitive symptoms, ranging from the so-called "brain fog" till an overt dementia. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that can contribute to the assessment and monitoring of celiac patients, even in those without a clear neurological involvement. The studies here reviewed seem to converge on an impaired central motor conductivity and a "hyperexcitable celiac brain" to TMS, which partially reverts back after a long-term gluten restriction. Notably, a clear hyperexcitability is a stably reported feature of both degenerative and vascular dementia. Therefore, given its potential neuroprotective effect, the gluten-free diet should be introduced as early as possible, although the overall response of neurological symptoms (and cognition in particular) is still controversial. Identifying new and possibly modifiable risk factors may be of crucial importance for patients, clinicians, and researchers.
39059931	Pigmented corn as a gluten-free source of polyphenols with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties in CaCo-2 cells.	A high number of varieties from corn (Zea mays L.) have been consumed for long time all over the world, however pigmented varieties are recently gaining renewed attention due to their beneficial effects and polyphenolic content. The natural lack of gluten makes corn suitable for consumption by celiac population, who need to control their inflammatory state through an appropriate gluten-free diet. The biological effects of polyphenols from pigmented corn are poorly investigated in the context of celiac disease. In this work, we analyzed through HPLC-DAD the phenolic composition of two Italian purple and red varieties ("Scagliolo Rosso" and "Rostrato di Rovetta", respectively) comparing their effects in human intestinal epithelial cells (CaCo-2 cells). The possible impact of gastro-intestinal digestion following oral consumption was assessed as well. The phenolic profile showed the presence of phenolic acids in both varieties, while anthocyanins were identified in Scagliolo Rosso only. After simulated digestion, the level of polyphenols did not significantly change and paralleled with an increased scavenging activity. In CaCo-2 cells, stimulated by a proinflammatory cocktail containing gliadin-derived peptides (IL-1beta, IFN-gamma, digested gliadin), pigmented corn extracts inhibited the release of CXCL-10 and sICAM-1, with mechanisms partially ascribed to NF-kappaB impairment. At the same concentration (200 mug/mL), ROS production and catalase depletion were reverted through Nrf-2-independent mechanisms. Our data suggest that polyphenols from pigmented corns might help in controlling the inflammatory and oxidative state of people with celiac disease at intestinal level, at concentrations potentially achievable through a gluten-free diet.
25441597	Predictors of dietary gluten avoidance in adults without a prior diagnosis of celiac disease.	OBJECTIVE: Prior studies have shown that dietary gluten avoidance (DGA) is relatively common in children without previously diagnosed celiac disease (CD), and several clinical predictors of DGA have been found. However, available data on predictors of DGA in adults without diagnosed CD are limited. The aim of this study was to determine the independent predictors of DGA in this population. METHODS: We performed a structured medical record review of 376 patients, ages >= 20 y, who had never been formally diagnosed with CD, presenting for an initial CD evaluation (ICD-9-CM 579.0) between January 2000 and December 2010 at two large Boston teaching hospitals. We collected data including demographic characteristics, medical history, history of CD serology before referral, and self-reported DGA. Predictors of DGA were determined using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Mean age was 47 (SD = 17) years. We found that 41 patients (10.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 7.9-14.5) had avoided gluten at some time in their lives. Most patients had subjective abdominal complaints or bowel movement changes. History of CD seropositivity before referral was noted in 14%. Independent predictors of DGA (P < 0.05) were lactose intolerance (odds ratio [OR], 2.8; 95% CI, 1.1-7.5), food allergy (OR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.04-13.7), and history of positive serology of less-specific CD markers before the referral (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.3-7.9). CONCLUSIONS: Gluten avoidance is common in a clinic population of adults without prior CD diagnosis. The recognized predictors suggest that DGA may associate with conditions presenting with nonspecific gastrointestinal complaints and perhaps with the perceived benefits of DGA among patients with prior history of positive CD serology.
23092006	Sudden loss of cow's milk tolerance in a long-sensitized patient.	The prevalence of food allergy and anaphylaxis in children is reported to be increasing in recent years. Evidence suggests that exposure to large doses of antigen favors the maintenance of tolerance. We report a case of sudden loss of cow's milk tolerance in a long-sensitized girl with celiac disease after a short period of milkless diet. We hypothesize that the continuous intake of high quantities of antigen sustained tolerance despite high levels of specific IgE and that, in the presence of epithelial barrier dysfunction caused by celiac disease, the few weeks of allergen-free diet led to a rapid loss of tolerance.
23763501	Coeliac disease, gluten-free diet and the development and progression of albuminuria in children with type 1 diabetes.	OBJECTIVES: Although a diagnosis of coeliac disease (CD) may be confronting to children with type 1 diabetes and their families, we hypothesize that children with CD have lower urinary albumin excretion, a marker of renal dysfunction. RESEARCH DESIGN: Twenty-four children with type 1 diabetes and biopsy-proven CD, on a gluten-free diet for at least 1 yr, were recruited from a single paediatric diabetes clinic alongside 55 children with type 1 diabetes but without CD matched for age, gender, duration of diabetes, and glycaemic control. RESULTS: Despite comparable diabetes exposure, glycaemic control and nutritional status, children with type 1 diabetes and CD had a lower urinary albumin creatinine ratio than in diabetic subjects without CD (0.9 +- 0.3 mg/mmol vs. 1.6 +- 0.3 mg/mmol; p = 0.01). Participants with CD also showed slower progression in albuminuria over 5-yr of follow-up while a small but significant increase was observed in the children with diabetes alone (1.6 +- 0.3 mg/mmol; follow-up 2.4 +- 0.5 mg/mmol; p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: As urinary albumin excretion is continuously associated with the risk of kidney disease, it is possible to speculate that CD or its management confers a degree of renoprotection. Larger studies are required to test this hypothesis.
31581722	The Pros and Cons of Using Oat in a Gluten-Free Diet for Celiac Patients.	A therapeutic gluten-free diet often has nutritional limitations. Nutritional qualities such as high protein content, the presence of biologically active and beneficial substances (fiber, beta-glucans, polyunsaturated fatty acids, essential amino acids, antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals), and tolerance by the majority of celiac patients make oat popular for use in gluten-free diet. The health risk of long-time consumption of oat by celiac patients is a matter of debate. The introduction of oat into the diet is only recommended for celiac patients in remission. Furthermore, not every variety of oat is also appropriate for a gluten-free diet. The risk of sensitization and an adverse immunologically mediated reaction is a real threat in some celiac patients. Several unsolved issues still exist which include the following: (1) determination of the susceptibility markers for the subgroup of celiac patients who are at risk because they do not tolerate dietary oat, (2) identification of suitable varieties of oat and estimating the safe dose of oat for the diet, and (3) optimization of methods for detecting the gliadin contamination in raw oat used in a gluten-free diet.
32075276	Narrative Review: Nutrient Deficiencies in Adults and Children with Treated and Untreated Celiac Disease.	Nutrient deficiencies are well recognized as secondary consequences of celiac disease (CD) and closely related to the clinical presentation of affected patients. Despite their clinical significance, consensus is lacking on the pattern and frequency of nutrient deficiencies in CD, the usefulness of their assessment at the time of diagnosis and during follow-up. This review aims to provide an overview of nutrient deficiencies among pediatric and adult CD patients at diagnosis and on a gluten-free diet (GFD), and their potential causes in CD. Secondly, we review their impact on CD management strategies including the potential of nutrient supplementation. A search of Medline, Pubmed and Embase until January 2019 was performed. Despite a high variability between the reported deficiencies, we noted that nutrient deficiencies occur frequently in children and adults with CD at diagnosis and during treatment with a GFD. Both inadequate dietary intake and/or diminished uptake due to intestinal dysfunction contribute to nutrient deficiencies. Most deficiencies can be restored with (long-term) treatment with a GFD and/or supplementation. However, some of them persist while others may become even more prominent during GFD. Our results indicate a lack of comprehensive evidence on the clinical efficacy of nutrient supplementation in CD management highlighting the need for further studies.
31331324	Celiac disease: a comprehensive current review.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease remains a challenging condition because of a steady increase in knowledge tackling its pathophysiology, diagnosis, management, and possible therapeutic options. MAIN BODY: A major milestone in the history of celiac disease was the identification of tissue transglutaminase as the autoantigen, thereby confirming the autoimmune nature of this disorder. A genetic background (HLA-DQ2/DQ8 positivity and non-HLA genes) is a mandatory determinant of the development of the disease, which occurs with the contribution of environmental factors (e.g., viral infections and dysbiosis of gut microbiota). Its prevalence in the general population is of approximately 1%, with female predominance. The disease can occur at any age, with a variety of symptoms/manifestations. This multifaceted clinical presentation leads to several phenotypes, i.e., gastrointestinal, extraintestinal, subclinical, potential, seronegative, non-responsive, and refractory. Although small intestinal biopsy remains the diagnostic 'gold standard', highly sensitive and specific serological tests, such as tissue transglutaminase, endomysial and deamidated gliadin peptide antibodies, have become gradually more important in the diagnostic work-up of celiac disease. Currently, the only treatment for celiac disease is a life-long, strict gluten-free diet leading to improvement in quality of life, ameliorating symptoms, and preventing the occurrence of refractory celiac disease, ulcerative jejunoileitis, and small intestinal adenocarcinoma and lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: The present review is timely and provides a thorough appraisal of various aspects characterizing celiac disease. Remaining challenges include obtaining a better understanding of still-unclear phenotypes such as slow-responsive, potential (minimal lesions) and seronegative celiac disease. The identification of alternative or complementary treatments to the gluten-free diet brings hope for patients unavoidably burdened by diet restrictions.
33804221	Wait-and-See Approach or Gluten-Free Diet Administration-The Rational Management of Potential Coeliac Disease.	Potential celiac disease (PCD) is a heterogeneous disease; only some patients develop full celiac disease (CD), characterised by advanced atrophic changes in the small intestine. Few accurate prognostic factors exist for the progression of PCD; therefore, therapeutic decisions should be made on an individual basis in each case. Patients with clinical gastroenterological or parenteral symptoms often benefit from a gluten-free diet, and those left on a diet containing gluten should receive clinical, serological and histopathological supervision.
26799226	Celiac Disease and Drug-Based Therapies: Inquiry into Patients Demands.	BACKGROUND/AIM: Medical research is looking for alternative drug-based options to the gluten-free diet (GFD) for celiac disease. We aimed at evaluating the need for alternative therapies perceived by celiac patients. METHODS: During the 2013 meeting of the Lombardy section of the Italian Celiac Patients Association, adult subjects were invited to fill in a questionnaire investigating their clinical profile in relation to compliance to the diet, quality of life (QOL) as well as their opinion on alternative therapies. RESULTS: Three hundred and seventy two patients (76 m, mean age 41.7 +- 13.9 years) completed the questionnaire. Patients reported a significant improvement in health status (HS) and QOL after the diet was started (p < 0.001). The GFD was accepted by 88% patients, but the need for alternative therapies was reported by 65%. Subjects expressing the need for a drug-based therapy showed a lower increase in QOL (p = 0.003) and HS (p = 0.005) on GFD. The preferred option for an alternative therapy was the use of enzymes (145 subjects), followed by a vaccine (111 subjects). CONCLUSION: The GFD is favorably accepted by most celiac patients. Nevertheless, a proportion of patients pronounce themselves in favor of the development of alternative drugs.
38756445	Salivary interleukin-17A and interleukin-18 levels in patients with celiac disease and periodontitis.	Background: An increased level of interleukin-17A and interleukin-18 in the serum and intestinal mucosa of celiac disease patients reflecting the severity of villous atrophy and inflammation was documented. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the concentrations of salivary-17A, interleukin-1 beta, and interleukin-18 in patients with celiac disease who are on a gluten-free diet, both with and without periodontitis, and to compare these levels with those in healthy individuals. Methods: The study involved 23 participants with serologically confirmed celiac disease (CD) and 23 control subjects. The CD patients had been following a gluten-free diet (GFD) for a minimum of 1 year and had no other autoimmune disorders. The research involved collecting demographic data, conducting periodontal examinations, gathering unstimulated whole saliva, and performing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to measure salivary interleukin-17A, interleukin-1 beta, and interleukin-18 levels. Spearman's correlation analysis was utilized to explore the relationships between CD markers in patients on a GFD and their periodontal clinical findings. Results: The periodontal findings indicated significantly lower values in celiac disease patients adhering to a gluten-free diet compared to control subjects (p = 0.001). No significant differences were found in salivary IL-17A, IL-18, and IL-1B levels between celiac disease patients and control subjects. Nevertheless, the levels of all interleukins were elevated in periodontitis patients in both the celiac and control groups. The IL-1 Beta level was significantly higher in periodontitis patients compared to non-periodontitis patients in the control group (p = 0.035). Significant negative correlations were observed between serum IgA levels and plaque index (r = -0.460, p = 0.010), as well as gingival index (r = -0.396, p = 0.030) in CD patients on a gluten-free diet. Conclusion: Celiac disease patients on gluten-free diet exhibited better periodontal health compared to control subjects. However, increased levels of salivary IL-17A, IL-18 and IL-1B levels were associated with periodontitis. Additionally, serum IgA level was significantly inversely associated with periodontitis clinical manifestations and with salivary inflammatory mediators in CD patients on GFD.
35001079	Detection of gluten immunogenic peptides and the Celiac Disease Adherence Test to monitor gluten-free diet: a pilot study.	Gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) in feces and/or urine have recently been proposed as a sensitive and specific marker to detect ongoing gluten intake. Here, we compared GIP with the Celiac Disease Adherence Test (CDAT), a simple validated self-administered questionnaire that measures adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD). Of 70 subjects (59 women), six were classified as non-adherent by fecal GIP (mean 0.23 microg/g, standard deviation 0.08, range 0.082-0.319), including five classified as non-adherent by CDAT. GFD adherence was significantly higher by GIP than CDAT (p < 0.001). Fecal GIP may be useful as a biomarker for ongoing gluten intake that is not possible to detect with current clinical methods to assess GFD adherence, and may play a role in the management of persistent gastrointestinal symptoms in celiac disease.
38648739	Wheat-Triggered Food Protein-Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome in Celiac Children on Gluten-Free Diet: A New Clinical Association.	INTRODUCTION: The association between food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) and wheat ingestion in children with celiac disease is unknown at this time. METHODS: We present seven cases of children with celiac disease who presented with symptoms of wheat-triggered acute FPIES (a-FPIES). An oral food challenge (OFC) with wheat allergen followed by 4 h of observation was performed. Activation of innate system cells was measured at baseline (T0), during symptoms (Ts), and 4 h after symptom onset (Ts + 4). A panel of human inflammatory cytokines was also performed. RESULTS: All patients reacted to the first allergen dose. Three patients experienced a decrease of 30 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure and tachycardia and required hemodynamic resuscitation. Neutrophilia and a decrease in eosinophil count were evident at 4 h after symptom onset. At 4 h after symptom onset, cytokines (IL-6 and IL-8, and to a lesser degree, IL-10) were elevated. CONCLUSION: In a small sample of celiac patients with wheat exposure in an OFC, symptoms and acute immunological changes in serum inflammatory cytokine profile were consistent with a-FPIES.
33362776	Effects of In Vivo Gluten Challenge on PBMC Gene Expression Profiles in Diet Treated Celiac Disease.	The pathological mechanisms that lead to the onset and reactivation of celiac disease (CD) remain largely unknown. While gluten free diet (GFD) improves the intestinal damage and associated clinical symptoms in majority of cases, it falls short of providing full recovery. Additionally, late or misdiagnosis is also common as CD presents with a wide range of symptoms. Clear understanding of CD pathogenesis is thus critical to address both diagnostic and treatment concerns. We aimed to study the molecular impact of short gluten exposure in GFD treated CD patients, as well as identify biological pathways that remain altered constitutively in CD regardless of treatment. Using RNAseq profiling of PBMC samples collected from treated CD patients and gluten challenged patient and healthy controls, we explored the peripheral transcriptome in CD patients following a short gluten exposure. Short gluten exposure of just three days was enough to alter the genome-wide PBMC transcriptome of patients. Pathway analysis revealed gluten-induced upregulation of mainly immune response related pathways, both innate and adaptive, in CD patients. We evaluated the perturbation of biological pathways in sample-specific manner. Compared to gluten exposed healthy controls, pathways related to tight junction, olfactory transduction, metabolism of unsaturated fatty acids (such as arachidonic acid), metabolism of amino acids (such as cysteine and glutamate), and microbial infection were constitutively altered in CD patients regardless of treatment, while GFD treatment appears to mostly normalize immune response pathways to "healthy" state. Upstream regulator prediction analysis using differentially expressed genes identified constitutively activated regulators relatively proximal to previously reported CD associated loci, particularly SMARCA4 on 19p13.2 and CSF2 on 5q31. We also found constitutively upregulated genes in CD that are in CD associated genetic loci such as MEF2BNB-MEF2B (BORCS8-MEF2B) on 19p13.11 and CSTB on 21q22.3. RNAseq revealed strong effects of short oral gluten challenge on whole PBMC fraction and constitutively altered pathways in CD PBMC suggesting important factors other than gluten in CD pathogenesis.
29247390	Cognitive impairment in celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity: review of literature on the main cognitive impairments, the imaging and the effect of gluten free diet.	Celiac disease (CD) and non celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) can be responsible for neurological complications such as ataxia and peripheral neuropathies but also cognitive impairment. This cognitive involvement is variable in its expression, its duration and its prognosis ranging from transient and reversible subtle involvement to dementia itself. Through this article, we tried to achieve a review of the literature to better understand this topic. Several mechanisms were proposed to explain the deleterious influence of gluten-related pathologies on cognitive functions: nutritional deficiencies, elevation of circulating cytokine levels due to systemic inflammation, low brain serotonin levels... Several types of dementia such as Alzheimer dementia, vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia were reported in association with CD. Memory disorder, acalculia, inattention, visuospatial deficits and executive dysfunction must be sought systematically by a neuropsychological assessment in patients with CD or NCGS. As far as the cognitive impairment is concerned, there is no pathognomonic radiological lesion. Concerning therapeutic management; although its effect is controversial, gluten free diet should be introduced, as early as possible, because of its potentially protective effect.
38742113	Enhancing life with celiac disease: unveiling effective tools for assessing health-related quality of life.	Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune chronic enteropathy provoked by gluten ingestion in genetically predisposed individuals. Considering it s only safe treatment is a lifelong gluten-free diet, the burden of living with the disease becomes evident, as well as the need to assess CD health-related quality of life (HRQOL). This review aims to identify and analyze the instruments used to evaluate the HRQOL of adults with CD. This integrative review using a systematic approach was designed to achieve high scientific standards. Accordingly, the search strategy was developed and executed as recommended by the guideline of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Detailed individual searches were developed to Pubmed, Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. After careful analysis of the papers, 43 studies were included, in which seven instruments were identified: Celiac Disease Questionnaire (CDQ) (n=21), Celiac Disease Specific Quality of Life Instrument (CD-QOL) (n=17), Celiac Disease Assessment Questionnaire (CDAQ) (n=4), CeliacQ-7 (n=1), CeliacQ-27 (n=1), Black and Orfila s self-developed instrument (n=1) and the Coeliac Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire (CDQL) (n=1). The CDQ and CD-QOL were the two most applied instruments. Since the first focuses on the physical and mental symptoms related to the disease and the second focuses on the emotional repercussions of adhering to the GFD treatment for life (dysphoria), the CDQ application is an interesting option for countries that struggle with public policies for CD patients and patients with active CD. The CD-QOL could be used for countries with strict regulations for CD and gluten-free products and populations in remission. When comparing results among different populations, it is preferable to utilize culturally validated instruments, which have been applied across multiple countries, providing greater comparability between study findings.
31402697	Gluten-related disorders: Celiac disease, wheat allergy, and nonceliac gluten sensitivity.	The consumption of gluten-free products is becoming an increased alimentary habit in the general population. The scientific unfounded perception suggesting that the avoidance of gluten would improve health or that gluten could be toxic for humans are fostering medically unjustified adherences to a gluten-free diet. Currently, only patients diagnosed with celiac disease are advised to follow a strict lifelong gluten-free diet. In the same way, patients diagnosed with IgE-mediated wheat allergy must avoid exposure to wheat in any form. In that context, a third disorder, called nonceliac gluten sensitivity, characterized by distress after gluten consumption and in which neither celiac disease nor IgE-mediated allergy plays a role, has gained increased attention in the last years. Although important scientific advances have been made in the understanding of the pathologic mechanisms behind nonceliac gluten sensitivity, this disorder is still a matter of active debate in the scientific community. In the present review, the most recent advances in the immunopathology, diagnostic biomarkers and susceptibility determinants of gluten-related diseases are summarized and discussed. Furthermore, an updated overview of the new potential therapies that are currently underway for the treatment of gluten-related disorders is also provided.
35085750	A large series of true pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysms.	INTRODUCTION: True pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysms (PDAAs) are rare, and prior reports often fail to distinguish true aneurysms from pseudoaneuryms. We sought to characterize all patients who presented to our health system from 2004 to 2019 with true PDAAs, with a focus on risk factors, interventions, and patient outcomes. METHODS: Patients were identified by querying a single health system picture archiving and communication system database for radiographic reports noting a PDAA. A retrospective chart review was performed on all identified patients. Patients with pseudoaneurysm, identified as those with a history of pancreatitis, abdominal malignancy, hepatopancreaticobiliary surgery, or abdominal trauma, were excluded. Continuous variables were compared using t-tests, and categorical variables were compared using Fisher's exact tests. RESULTS: A total of 59 true PDAAs were identified. Forty aneurysms (68%) were intact (iPDAAs) and 19 (32%) were ruptured (rPDAAs) at presentation. The mean size of rPDAAs was 16.4 mm (median size, 14.0 mm; range, 10-42 mm), and the mean size of iPDAAs was 19.4 mm (median size, 17.5 mm; range, 8-88 mm); this difference was not statistically significant (P = .95). Significant celiac disease (occlusion or >70% stenosis) was noted in 39 aneurysms (66%). Those with rupture were less likely to have significant celiac disease (42% vs 78%; P = .017) and less likely to have aneurysmal wall calcifications (6% vs 53%; P = .002). Thirty-seven patients underwent intervention (63%), with eight (22%) undergoing concomitant hepatic revascularization (two stents and six bypasses) due to the presence of celiac disease. Eighteen patients with occluded celiac arteries underwent aneurysm intervention; of those, 11 were performed without hepatic revascularization (61.1%). Those with rPDAAs experienced an aneurysm-related mortality of 10.5%, whereas those with iPDAAs experienced a rate of 5.6%. One patient with celiac occlusion and PDA rupture who did not undergo hepatic artery bypass expired postoperatively from hepatic ischemia. rPDAAs showed a trend toward the increased need for aneurysm-related endovascular or open reintervention, but this was not statistically significant (47% vs 28%; P = .13). CONCLUSIONS: These findings support previous reports that the rupture risk of PDAAs is independent of size, their development is often associated with significant celiac stenosis or occlusion, and rupture risk appears decreased in patients with concomitant celiac disease or aneurysm wall calcifications. Endovascular intervention is the preferred initial treatment for both iPDAAs and rPDAAs, but reintervention rates are high in both groups. The role for hepatic revascularization remains uncertain, but it does not appear to be mandatory in all patients with complete celiac occlusion who undergo PDAA interventions.
37669330	Clinical Features of Children With Serology Negative, Biopsy Positive Celiac Disease.	The prevalence of pediatric serological negative celiac disease (SNCD) is poorly described, with few recognized clinical predictors beyond immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency or reduced gluten intake. The purpose of this retrospective review was to describe the prevalence of SNCD at the Stollery Children's Hospital and identify clinical features to help in recognition of these cases. Patients with a positive biopsy and negative serology (SNCD) were compared to those with positive biopsy and serology. SNCD diagnosis required clinical correlation and either confirmatory genetics or follow up endoscopy on a gluten-free diet. Of the 424 patients who met celiac disease (CD) criteria, 4.7% (n = 20) fulfilled our criteria for SNCD. There was a significant difference in the rates of IgA deficiency between the 2 groups, but no other clinical features were found that allowed for ready identification of SNCD patients.
34909845	THE MANAGEMENT OF DERMATITIS HERPETIFORMIS BY THE GASTROENTEROLOGIST. A SERIES OF CASES.	BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is considered a skin celiac disease (CD). The individuals can be seen by primary care professionals or by dermatologists that could refer the patient to a gastroenterologist. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to investigate the clinical profile of patients diagnosed with DH and referred to a gastroenterologist and evaluate the treatment response. METHODS: We retrospectively studied patients with DH referred to the same gastroenterologist at a private office in Curitiba, Brazil, between January 2010 to December 2019. We included adult patients with a confirmed DH diagnosis. Symptoms, clinical signs, laboratory and histological data, as well as treatment response, were collected. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients were studied (60.6% women, mean age at diagnosis 40.8+-12.61 years). The median delay for DH diagnosis was four years. Skin involvement was mild in 33.3%, moderate in 18.2%, and severe in 48.5%. The more frequent gastrointestinal complaints were abdominal distension (78.8%), flatulence (75.7%), and gastroesophageal reflux (51.5%). Depression and anxiety were observed in 81.8% and anemia in 51.1%. A higher prevalence of bone disorders was associated with higher age at DH diagnosis (P=0.035). Duodenal biopsy showed changes in all patients. Improvement after treatment only with a gluten-free diet (GFD) plus dapsone was verified in 81.2%. CONCLUSION: Patients with DH referred to a gastroenterologist showed a high frequency of gluten intolerance and systemic complaints. Duodenal histological alterations were found in all the cases. The treatment based on GFD plus dapsone was effective in most patients.
32981341	Recent strategies for tackling the problems in gluten-free diet and products.	The gluten-free food market is growing with the increases in the number of people who adhere to gluten-free diet. The noteworthy increase in the number of people following a gluten-free diet may be associated to the diagnosis of many silent and subclinical celiac disease cases, improved knowledge of celiac disease, gluten allergy or gluten sensitivity as well as to popular belief that gluten-free diet is healthier. Despite the increase in the number of people following a gluten-free diet, the lack of awareness and knowledge about gluten-free diet generates problems for non-celiac people who are considering that gluten-free products are healthier as well as for celiac people who have to follow gluten-free diet. Notwithstanding the increasing interest in adopting gluten-free diet, there are still important obstacles affecting the adherence to gluten-free diet. The limited availability, high price of products, insufficient labeling, cross-contamination risk, treatment burden, lack of knowledge and information about celiac disease and about gluten-free diet, psychological factors in celiac patients, the adverse effects of a gluten-free diet and quality defects of gluten-free products are among the major problems that faced by celiac patients. In this perspective, the aim of this review is to provide an overview of important challenges in the maintenance of a strict gluten-free diet that faced by celiac patients during the adherence to gluten-free diet and related approaches have been able for tackling the problems.
34507373	Results from the German registry for refractory celiac disease.	Refractory celiac disease (RCD) refers to a rare subgroup of patients with celiac disease who show clinical signs of malabsorption despite a gluten-free diet. RCD is divided into an autoimmune phenotype (RCD type I) and pre-lymphoma (RCD type II). To reflect the clinical reality in managing this disease in Germany, a national register was established based on a questionnaire developed specifically for this purpose. Between 2014 and 2020, a total of 53 patients were registered. The diagnosis of RCD was confirmed in 46 cases (87%). This included 27 patients (59%) with RCD type I and 19 patients (41%) with RCD type II. A wide range of diagnostic and therapeutic measures was used. Therapeutically, budesonide was used in 59% of the RCD patients regardless of the subtype. Nutritional therapy was used in only 5 patients (11%). Overall mortality was 26% (12 patients) with a clear dominance in patients with RCD type II (9 patients, 47%). In summary, RCD needs to become a focus of national guidelines to increase awareness, establish standards, and thus enable the treating physician to make the correct diagnosis in a timely manner. Moreover, we concluded that when treating such patients, contacting a specialized center is recommended to ensure sufficient management.
34647492	Gastrointestinal microbiome and gluten in celiac disease.	Coeliac disease (CD), also known as gluten sensitive enteropathy, is an autoimmune intestinal disease induced by gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. Gluten is a common ingredient in daily diet and is one of the main environmental factors to induce coeliac disease. Adhering to gluten free diet (GFD) is an effective method for treating CD. Microbiota plays an extremely important role in maintaining human health, and diet is the main factor to regulate the composition and function of gut microbiota. Recent studies have shown that gluten metabolism is closely related to gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbiota. With the increasing prevalence of coeliac disease, there is a need for alternative treatments to GFD. In this review, biological medication of gluten, relationship between gluten and gut microflora, effect of GFD on GIT microflora, and effect of probiotics on CD were reviewed. By analysing the research progress on relationship between gluten and gastrointestinal microbiome in coeliac disease, this review tried to explore the prospective and potential mechanism of microecological agents in treating coeliac disease.
33717063	Anti-Inflammatory and Immunomodulatory Effects of Probiotics in Gut Inflammation: A Door to the Body.	Hosting millions of microorganisms, the digestive tract is the primary and most important part of bacterial colonization. On one side, in cases of opportunistic invasion, the abundant bacterial population inside intestinal tissues may face potential health problems such as inflammation and infections. Therefore, the immune system has evolved to sustain the host-microbiota symbiotic relationship. On the other hand, to maintain host immune homeostasis, the intestinal microflora often exerts an immunoregulatory function that cannot be ignored. A field of great interest is the association of either microbiota or probiotics with the immune system concerning clinical uses. This microbial community regulates some of the host's metabolic and physiological functions and drives early-life immune system maturation, contributing to their homeostasis throughout life. Changes in gut microbiota can occur through modification in function, composition (dysbiosis), or microbiota-host interplays. Studies on animals and humans show that probiotics can have a pivotal effect on the modulation of immune and inflammatory mechanisms; however, the precise mechanisms have not yet been well defined. Diet, age, BMI (body mass index), medications, and stress may confound the benefits of probiotic intake. In addition to host gut functions (permeability and physiology), all these agents have profound implications for the gut microbiome composition. The use of probiotics could improve the gut microbial population, increase mucus-secretion, and prevent the destruction of tight junction proteins by decreasing the number of lipopolysaccharides (LPSs). When LPS binds endothelial cells to toll-like receptors (TLR 2, 4), dendritic cells and macrophage cells are activated, and inflammatory markers are increased. Furthermore, a decrease in gut dysbiosis and intestinal leakage after probiotic therapy may minimize the development of inflammatory biomarkers and blunt unnecessary activation of the immune system. In turn, probiotics improve the differentiation of T-cells against Th2 and development of Th2 cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-10. The present narrative review explores the interactions between gut microflora/probiotics and the immune system starting from the general perspective of a biological plausibility to get to the in vitro and in vivo demonstrations of a probiotic-based approach up to the possible uses for novel therapeutic strategies.
38608449	Potential therapeutic options for celiac Disease: An update on Current evidence from Gluten-Free diet to cell therapy.	Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic autoimmune enteropathy and multifactorial disease caused by inappropriate immune responses to gluten in the small intestine. Weight loss, anemia, osteoporosis, arthritis, and hepatitis are among the extraintestinal manifestations of active CD. Currently, a strict lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only safe, effective, and available treatment. Despite the social burden, high expenses, and challenges of following a GFD, 2 to 5 percent of patients do not demonstrate clinical or pathophysiological improvement. Therefore, we need novel and alternative therapeutic approaches for patients. Innovative approaches encompass a broad spectrum of strategies, including enzymatic degradation of gluten, inhibition of intestinal permeability, modulation of the immune response, inhibition of the transglutaminase 2 (TG2) enzyme, blocking antigen presentation by HLA-DQ2/8, and induction of tolerance. Hence, this review is focused on comprehensive therapeutic strategies ranging from dietary approaches to novel methods such as antigen-based immunotherapy, cell and gene therapy, and the usage of nanoparticles for CD treatment.
27636410	Celiac Disease is Misdiagnosed Based on Serology Only in a Substantial Proportion of Patients.	BACKGROUND: Although the diagnostic process in celiac disease (CeD) has been addressed in several international guidelines, little is known about the actual proceeding in current clinical practice. This study investigated the initial presentation, the diagnostic process, follow-up evaluations, and adherence to a gluten-free diet in CeD patients in a real-life setting in Switzerland from a patient's perspective. METHODS: We performed a large patient survey among unselected CeD patients in Switzerland. RESULTS: A total of 1689 patients were analyzed. The vast majority complained of both gastrointestinal and nonspecific symptoms (71.5%), whereas 1.8% reported an asymptomatic disease course. A total of 35.8% CeD patients were diagnosed by a nongastroenterologist. The diagnostic process differed between nongastroenterologists and gastroenterologists, with the latter more often using duodenal biopsy alone or in combination with serology (94.7% vs. 63.0%) and nongastroenterologists more frequently establishing the diagnosis without endoscopy (37.0% vs. 5.3%, P<0.001). Follow-up serology after 6 months was performed only in half of all patients (49.4%), whereas 69.9% had at least 1 follow-up serology within the first year after diet initiation. About 39.7% had a follow-up endoscopy with duodenal biopsies (after a median of 12 mo; range, 1 to 600 mo). The likelihood of receiving any follow-up examination was higher in patients initially diagnosed by a gastroenterologist. CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of CeD patients are diagnosed by nongastroenterologists. Under the diagnostic lead of the latter, more than a third of the patients receive their diagnosis on the basis of a positive serology and/or genetics only, in evident violation of current diagnostic guidelines, which may lead to an overdiagnosis of this entity.
20951830	Safety for patients with celiac disease of baked goods made of wheat flour hydrolyzed during food processing.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease (CD) is characterized by an inflammatory response to wheat gluten, rye, and barley proteins. Fermentation of wheat flour with sourdough lactobacilli and fungal proteases decreases the concentration of gluten. We evaluated the safety of daily administration of baked goods made from this hydrolyzed form of wheat flour to patients with CD. METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to consumption of 200 g per day of natural flour baked goods (NFBG) (80,127 ppm gluten; n = 6), extensively hydrolyzed flour baked goods (S1BG) (2480 ppm residual gluten; n = 2), or fully hydrolyzed baked goods (S2BG) (8 ppm residual gluten; n = 5) for 60 days. RESULTS: Two of the 6 patients who consumed NFBG discontinued the challenge because of symptoms; all had increased levels of anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies and small bowel deterioration. The 2 patients who ate the S1BG goods had no clinical complaints but developed subtotal atrophy. The 5 patients who ate the S2BG had no clinical complaints; their levels of anti-tTG antibodies did not increase, and their Marsh grades of small intestinal mucosa did not change. CONCLUSIONS: A 60-day diet of baked goods made from hydrolyzed wheat flour, manufactured with sourdough lactobacilli and fungal proteases, was not toxic to patients with CD. A combined analysis of serologic, morphometric, and immunohistochemical parameters is the most accurate method to assess new therapies for this disorder.
37628981	Old and New Adjunctive Therapies in Celiac Disease and Refractory Celiac Disease: A Review.	Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic enteropathy caused by the ingestion of gluten in a genetically susceptible individual. Currently, a gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only recommended treatment. However, unintentional gluten ingestion or a persistent villous atrophy with malabsorption (regardless of a strict GFD) as in the case of Refractory Celiac Disease (RCD) represents a major issue. In this review, we have analysed and discussed data from both randomized controlled trials and observational studies concerning adjunctive therapies as well as novel therapies for the treatment of CD and RCD. The literature search was carried out through Medline and Scopus. In total, 2268 articles have been identified and 49 were included in this review (36 studies resulting from the search strategy and 13 from other sources). Today, GFD remains the only effective treatment, although steroids, mesalamine, and more recently biological therapies have found space in the complex management of RCD. Currently, studies evaluating the effectiveness of novel therapies are still limited and preliminary results have been controversial.
33491958	Persistent Villous Atrophy in De Novo Adult Patients With Celiac Disease and Strict Control of Gluten-Free Diet Adherence: A Multicenter Prospective Study (CADER Study).	INTRODUCTION: A substantial proportion of adult patients with celiac disease on a gluten-free diet exhibit persistent villous atrophy, and inadvertent gluten exposure may be one of the causes. The aim of the present study was to evaluate villous atrophy persistence after 2 years on a gluten-free diet in de novo adult patients with celiac disease with strict control of gluten exposure. METHODS: Symptomatic de novo adult patients with celiac disease were prospectively included. Clinical visits and dietary surveillance were scheduled every 6 months during a 2-year follow-up period. At each visit, fecal samples were collected and stored at -20  C until analysis for gluten immunogenic peptides (f-GIPs). A follow-up duodenal biopsy was performed at 2 years. We evaluated the variables associated with persistent villous atrophy. RESULTS: Seventy-six patients completed the study (36.5 +- 1.6 years, 73% women); persistent villous atrophy was observed in 40 (53%), whereas 72.5% were asymptomatic and 75% had negative serology. Detectable f-GIP >0.08 mug/g in at least 1 fecal sample was seen in 69% of patients. There were no significant differences in the median f-GIP at each visit and median area under the curve over the serial measurements between patients with persistent villous atrophy and those who recovered. On multivariate analysis, only older age was associated with persistent villous atrophy (32% for 16-30 years; 67% for >30 years; P = 0.016). DISCUSSION: The rate of persistent villous atrophy after 2 years was high in adult patients with celiac disease on an intentionally strict gluten-free diet. Low-level ongoing inadvertent gluten exposure could be a contributing factor to persistent villous atrophy.
25683116	Larazotide acetate for persistent symptoms of celiac disease despite a gluten-free diet: a randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease (CeD) is a prevalent autoimmune condition. Recurrent signs and symptoms are common despite treatment with a gluten-free diet (GFD), yet no approved or proven nondietary treatment is available. METHODS: In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we assessed larazotide acetate 0.5, 1, or 2 mg 3 times daily to relieve ongoing symptoms in 342 adults with CeD who had been on a GFD for 12 months or longer and maintained their current GFD during the study. The study included a 4-week placebo run-in, 12 weeks of treatment, and a 4-week placebo run-out phase. The primary end point was the difference in average on-treatment Celiac Disease Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale score. RESULTS: The primary end point was met with the 0.5-mg dose of larazotide acetate, with fewer symptoms compared with placebo by modified intention to treat (n = 340) (analysis of covariance, P = .022; mixed model for repeated measures, P = .005). The 0.5-mg dose showed an effect on exploratory end points including a 26% decrease in celiac disease patient-reported outcome symptomatic days (P = .017), a 31% increase in improved symptom days (P = .034), a 50% or more reduction from baseline of the weekly average abdominal pain score for 6 or more of 12 weeks of treatment (P = .022), and a decrease in the nongastrointestinal symptoms of headache and tiredness (P = .010). The 1- and 2-mg doses were no different than placebo for any end point. Safety was comparable with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Larazotide acetate 0.5 mg reduced signs and symptoms in CeD patients on a GFD better than a GFD alone. Although results were mixed, this study was a successful trial of a novel therapeutic agent targeting tight junction regulation in patients with CeD who are symptomatic despite a GFD. Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01396213.
31383006	A case of checkpoint inhibitor-induced celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have now become standard of care treatment for many malignancies. ICIs are associated with unique immune mediated adverse events (irAEs) due to dysregulation of immune activation. As treatment with ICIs is becoming more common, rare irAEs are also being recognized. Here we report a case of ICI-induced celiac disease. CASE: A 74-year-old Caucasian female with metastatic renal carcinoma received second line nivolumab (anti-PD1 antibody) after initial disease progression on sunitinib. Ipilimumab was added after she failed to respond to six cycles of nivolumab monotherapy. One week after her first cycle of combination treatment, she presented with nausea, vomiting, grade 1 diarrhea, and weight loss. She underwent endoscopy, which showed bile stasis in the stomach, normal appearing stomach mucosa, and nonbleeding erythematous mucosa in the duodenal bulb. Stomach biopsy showed moderate active chronic gastritis. Duodenal biopsy showed moderate chronic active duodenitis with focal neutrophilic cryptitis, mucosal erosions, villous atrophy, mildly increased intraepithelial lymphocytes, and moderate chronic inflammation in the lamina propria pathognomonic of celiac disease. Symptoms improved with gluten-free diet, twice-daily omeprazole and anti-emetics and she was able to continue on treatment. CONCLUSIONS: There has been only one published case reporting ICI-induced celiac disease. Our case report highlights a rare irAE (celiac disease) associated with ICI treatment. It is unclear whether the patient had previously undiagnosed celiac disease or whether ICIs triggered her enteritis. Our patient was able to continue treatment with ICIs with dietary modifications, suggesting correct diagnosis is critical for optimal patient outcome.
23252793	Intakes of nutrients in Italian children with celiac disease and the role of commercially available gluten-free products.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic gluten-sensitive enteropathy. Life-long gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only therapeutic option; however, it may contribute to the consumption of an unbalanced diet. The present study aimed to evaluate the dietary intake of CD affected children on a GFD and compare it with non-celiac children and with Italian nutritional intakes recommendations, as well as evaluate the contribution of commercially available gluten-free products (GFPs). METHODS: Eighteen celiac children, median age 7.6 years, median GFD duration 4.2 years, and 18 non-celiac controls, were enrolled in a cross-sectional age-matched study. Dietary intakes of both groups were collected using a food frequency questionnaire and a 24-hour dietary recall. Nutritional intakes were compared between the group and controls and with Italian dietary reference values. The contribution of GFPs to energy and macronutrient intakes was evaluated. RESULTS: Median energy intake was significantly higher in CD patients than in controls (8961.8 and 5761.0 kJ day(-1); P < 0.001). CD subjects showed higher carbohydrate intakes and lower fat intakes compared to controls. Protein-derived energy did not differ. By contrast to control subjects, energy derived from carbohydrate intakes in CD children met the Italian recommendations. Both children groups showed higher protein and fat intakes than recommended in Italy. GFPs consumption accounted for 36.3% of daily total energy intake. CONCLUSIONS: Intakes of simple sugars, fats and protein exceeded the National recommendations for health. Children with CD had significantly higher energy intakes than controls, although body mass index was comparable across the groups. Lack of nutritional information for GFPs prevented complete dietary analysis of subfractions of fat and micronutrient intakes. This aspect need to be addressed if studies in this field are to be meaningful in the future.
33833484	Non-responsive celiac disease in children on a gluten free diet.	BACKGROUND: Non-responsive celiac disease (NRCD) is defined as the persistence of symptoms in individuals with celiac disease (CeD) despite being on a gluten-free diet (GFD). There is scant literature about NRCD in the pediatric population. AIM: To determine the incidence, clinical characteristics and underlying causes of NRCD in children. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study performed at Boston Children's Hospital (BCH). Children < 18 years diagnosed with CeD by positive serology and duodenal biopsies compatible with Marsh III histology between 2008 and 2012 were identified in the BCH's Celiac Disease Program database. Medical records were longitudinally reviewed from the time of diagnosis through September 2015. NRCD was defined as persistent symptoms at 6 mo after the initiation of a GFD and causes of NRCD as well as symptom evolution were detailed. The children without symptoms at 6 mo (responders) were compared with the NRCD group. Additionally, presenting signs and symptoms at the time of diagnosis of CeD among the responders and NRCD patients were collected and compared to identify any potential predictors for NRCD at 6 mo of GFD therapy. RESULTS: Six hundred and sixteen children were included. Ninety-one (15%) met criteria for NRCD. Most were female (77%). Abdominal pain [odds ratio (OR) 1.8 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-2.9], constipation (OR 3.1 95%CI 1.9-4.9) and absence of abdominal distension (OR for abdominal distension 0.4 95%CI 0.1-0.98) at diagnosis were associated with NRCD. NRCD was attributed to a wide variety of diagnoses with gluten exposure (30%) and constipation (20%) being the most common causes. Other causes for NRCD included lactose intolerance (9%), gastroesophageal reflux (8%), functional abdominal pain (7%), irritable bowel syndrome (3%), depression/anxiety (3%), eosinophilic esophagitis (2%), food allergy (1%), eating disorder (1%), gastric ulcer with Helicobacter pylori (1%), lymphocytic colitis (1%), aerophagia (1%) and undetermined (13%). 64% of children with NRCD improved on follow-up. CONCLUSION: NRCD after >= 6 mo GFD is frequent among children, especially females, and is associated with initial presenting symptoms of constipation and/or abdominal pain. Gluten exposure is the most frequent cause.
30554200	Metabolic Alterations in Celiac Disease Occurring after Following a Gluten-Free Diet.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: Many investigations have demonstrated that changes in body weight are frequent in patients with coeliac disease (CD) after a gluten-free diet (GFD); conversely data on the metabolic syndrome (MS) and hepatic steatosis (HS) are still rare. The aim is to evaluate the prevalence of MS and HS in patients with CD, before and after a GFD. METHODS: One hundred eighty-five coeliac adult patients were enrolled in the study. Diagnosis of MS was made according to the current international criteria including waist circumference (WC), hypertension, reduction of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, hypertriglyceridemia, and hyperglycemia. Body mass index (BMI), hypercholesterolemia, and HS were also assessed. RESULTS: CD patients showed an increased risk of developing both MS and HS after following a GFD. MS was reported in 3.24% of the cases at the time of CD diagnosis and in 14.59% after GFD (p < 0.0001). HS was reported in 1.7% at the time of diagnosis and in 11.1% after GFD (p < 0.0001). With regard to metabolic sub-categories, the prevalence of the increase in WC, hypertension, reduction of HDL cholesterol, hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, and BMI > 25 was significantly higher after GFD compared to baseline at CD diagnosis. CONCLUSION: In CD patients, following a GFD maybe can contribute to the development of MS and HS. Patients should be informed about this possible risk.
34764141	Enteropathies with villous atrophy but negative coeliac serology in adults: current issues.	OBJECTIVE: The differential diagnosis and management of seronegative enteropathies is challenging due to the rarity of these conditions, the overlap of clinical and histopathological features and the current lack of an international consensus on their nomenclature. DESIGN: This is a narrative review providing pragmatic guide on the investigation and clinical management of seronegative enteropathies in adults based on the available literature and our clinical experience. CONCLUSIONS: Seronegative coeliac disease is the most frequent cause among the heterogeneous group of seronegative enteropathies and its diagnosis is confirmed by the clinical and histological response to a gluten-free diet after the exclusion of other causes of villous atrophy. Correct identification and targeted management of seronegative enteropathies is mandatory because of the variation in terms of clinical outcomes and prognosis.
26053324	Effect of a Gluten-Free Diet on Cortical Excitability in Adults with Celiac Disease.	INTRODUCTION: An imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic excitability was observed in de novo patients with celiac disease (CD) in a previous study with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), suggesting a subclinical involvement of GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission in asymptomatic patients. The aim of this investigation was to monitor the eventual changes in the same cohort of patients, evaluated after a period of gluten-free diet. METHODS: Patients were re-evaluated after a median period of 16 months during which an adequate gluten-free diet was maintained. Clinical, cognitive and neuropsychiatric assessment was repeated, as well as cortical excitability by means of single- and paired-pulse TMS from the first dorsal interosseous muscle of the dominant hand. RESULTS: Compared to baseline, patients showed a significant decrease of the median resting motor threshold (from 35% to 33%, p<0.01). The other single-pulse (cortical silent period, motor evoked potentials latency and amplitude, central motor conduction time) and paired-pulse TMS measures (intracortical inhibition and intracortical facilitation) did not change significantly after the follow-up period. Antibodies were still present in 7 subjects. DISCUSSION: In patients under a gluten-free diet, a global increase of cortical excitability was observed, suggesting a glutamate-mediated functional reorganization compensating for disease progression. We hypothesize that glutamate receptor activation, probably triggered by CD-related immune system dysregulation, might result in a long-lasting motor cortex hyperexcitability with increased excitatory post-synaptic potentials, probably related to phenomena of long-term plasticity. The impact of the gluten-free diet on subclinical neurological abnormalities needs to be further explored.
26281336	The hematologic manifestations of pediatric celiac disease at the time of diagnosis and efficiency of gluten-free diet.	BACKGROUND/AIM: To determine the hematologic manifestations at the time of diagnosis of celiac disease in children and the effects of a gluten-free diet on hematologic signs upon follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The records ofpatients with celiac disease who received a follow up examination at the Pediatric Gastroenterology Clinic between June 2006 and June 2013 were retrospectively examined. RESULTS: Ninety-one patients were included in the study. The mean age at diagnosis was 8.1 +- 4.21 years and 59 patients (64.8%) were female. Thirty-two patients (35.2%) had hematologic signs at the time of diagnosis. Anemia (24.2%) was the most common hematologic sign, followed by thrombocytosis (16.5%) and leukopenia (4.4%). The tTG IgA titers were screened in 80 of the 91 patients during diagnosis. Follow-up examinations found that remission for anemia (P = 0.0 17), thrombocytosis (P = 0.039), and decreases in tTG IgA titers (P = 0.034) were more prominent in patients who had followed a strict gluten-free diet. CONCLUSION: Approximately one-third of the celiac disease patients had hematologic manifestations at the time of diagnosis. Remission in hematologic signs and decrease in tTG IgA titers were more prominent in patients who had adhered to a gluten-free diet.
31097786	Pharmaceutically modified subtilisins withstand acidic conditions and effectively degrade gluten in vivo.	Detoxification of gluten immunogenic epitopes is a promising strategy for the treatment of celiac disease. Our previous studies have shown that these epitopes can be degraded in vitro by subtilisin enzymes derived from Rothia mucilaginosa, a natural microbial colonizer of the oral cavity. The challenge is that the enzyme is not optimally active under acidic conditions as encountered in the stomach. We therefore aimed to protect and maintain subtilisin-A enzyme activity by exploring two pharmaceutical modification techniques: PEGylation and Polylactic glycolic acid (PLGA) microencapsulation. PEGylation of subtilisin-A (Sub-A) was performed by attaching methoxypolyethylene glycol (mPEG, 5 kDa). The PEGylation protected subtilisin-A from autolysis at neutral pH. The PEGylated Sub-A (Sub-A-mPEG) was further encapsulated by PLGA. The microencapsulated Sub-A-mPEG-PLGA showed significantly increased protection against acid exposure in vitro. In vivo, gluten immunogenic epitopes were decreased by 60% in the stomach of mice fed with chow containing Sub-A-mPEG-PLGA (0.2 mg Sub-A/g chow) (n = 9) compared to 31.9% in mice fed with chow containing unmodified Sub-A (n = 9). These results show that the developed pharmaceutical modification can protect Sub-A from auto-digestion as well as from acid inactivation, thus rendering the enzyme more effective for applications in vivo.
22830230	[Intolerance of gluten--a new disease or undiagnosed celiac disease].	The prevalence of celiac disease is about 1% in the population and is growing due to the wide use of immunological methods of diagnosis. In recent years, in-depth research of the celiac disease has led not only to an increase in the number of patients with celiac disease, but also to the emergence of a broad spectrum of diseases associated with the ingestion of gluten. In this regard, a new pathology, known as "gluten intolerance or gluten sensitivity", attracted special attention of researchers. Studies in recent years have established that patients with this pathology may have both gastrointestinal symptoms and extraintestinal manifestations. Examinations of such patients usually do not find histological changes of the mucous membrane of the small intestine and autoimmune antibodies (to tissue transglutaminase (tTG) and endomysial (EMA)); however an increased level of gliadin antibodies (AGA) is often observed. Allergy to gluten is also absent. A gluten-free diet for such patients, like in case of the celiac disease, leads to the disappearance of clinical symptoms. Exact criteria for the diagnosis of this nosology have not been identified so far, but most researchers believe that prevalence of "gluten intolerance" is much higher than that of celiac disease.
33795221	Dietary gluten avoidance in Canada: a cross-sectional study using survey data.	BACKGROUND: A gluten-free diet (GFD) is required for the management of some conditions, whereas some Canadians may follow a GFD for discretionary reasons. We sought to estimate the prevalence of Canadians who adhere to a GFD, identify factors associated with adherence to a GFD, and describe and compare the location of food preparation and consumption for those who follow a GFD, those who report no dietary avoidances and those reporting other dietary avoidances. METHODS: We used cross-sectional data from the 2015 Canadian Community Health Survey - Nutrition (n = 20 487). Demographic variables included sex, age group, ethnicity, highest level of household education and income adequacy. The relations between respondent characteristics and report of a GFD were estimated using logistic regression. Respondents were further categorized as avoiding dietary gluten, other dietary avoidances and no dietary avoidances. RESULTS: An estimated 1.9% of Canadians follow a GFD. Women had 2 times higher odds (odds ratio [OR] 2.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32 to 3.27) of reporting a GFD than men. After adjustment for income adequacy, household education, sex, age group and ethnicity, residents of Ontario and Quebec had about half the odds (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.87, and OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.94, respectively) of reporting a GFD compared with residents of Atlantic Canada. Canadians who followed a GFD consumed significantly fewer calories from foods prepared at restaurants than both Canadians who reported no dietary avoidances and those who reported dietary avoidances other than gluten. Canadians following a GFD reported that 2.0% (95% CI 1.1% to 2.9%) of their daily kilocalories were from foods prepared at restaurants, compared with 6.7% (95% CI 5.4% to 7.9%) for Canadians reporting 1 or more dietary avoidances other than gluten, and 6.4% (95% CI 6.0% to 6.9%) for those reporting no avoidances. INTERPRETATION: The estimated 1.9% prevalence of dietary gluten avoidance likely includes individuals with celiac disease, wheat allergies and nonceliac gluten sensitivity, as well as individuals excluding gluten in the management of irritable bowel syndrome or for reasons related to dietary trends. Canadians eating GFDs consume fewer daily calories from restaurant-prepared foods than other Canadians, which may have social implications.
30593798	Plasma Cells Are the Most Abundant Gluten Peptide MHC-expressing Cells in Inflamed Intestinal Tissues From Patients With Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Development of celiac disease is believed to involve the transglutaminase-dependent response of CD4+ T cells toward deamidated gluten peptides in the intestinal mucosa of individuals with specific HLA-DQ haplotypes. We investigated the antigen presentation process during this mucosal immune response. METHODS: We generated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for the peptide-MHC (pMHC) complex of HLA-DQ2.5 and the immunodominant gluten epitope DQ2.5-glia-alpha1a using phage display. We used these mAbs to assess gluten peptide presentation and phenotypes of presenting cells by flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot (ELISPOT) in freshly prepared single-cell suspensions from intestinal biopsies from 40 patients with celiac disease (35 untreated and 5 on a gluten-free diet) as well as 18 subjects with confirmed noninflamed gut mucosa (controls, 12 presumed healthy, 5 undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy, and 1 with potential celiac disease). RESULTS: Using the mAbs, we detected MHC complexes on cells from intestinal biopsies from patients with celiac disease who consume gluten, but not from patients on gluten-free diets. We found B cells and plasma cells to be the most abundant cells that present DQ2.5-glia-alpha1a in the inflamed mucosa. We identified a subset of plasma cells that expresses B-cell receptors (BCR) specific for gluten peptides or the autoantigen transglutaminase 2 (TG2). Expression of MHC class II (MHCII) was not restricted to these specific plasma cells in patients with celiac disease but was observed in an average 30% of gut plasma cells from patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: A population of plasma cells from intestinal biopsies of patients with celiac disease express MHCII; this is the most abundant cell type presenting the immunodominant gluten peptide DQ2.5-glia-alpha1a in the tissues from these patients. These results indicate that plasma cells in the gut can function as antigen-presenting cells and might promote and maintain intestinal inflammation in patients with celiac disease or other inflammatory disorders.
33148252	Health related QoL in celiac disease patients in Slovenia.	BACKGROUND: Measurements of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among celiac disease patients using a validated questionnaire have been lacking in Slovenia. This study aims to measure HRQoL in celiac disease (CD) patients using EQ-5D internationally validated questionnaire and comparing it to the HRQoL of the general population. METHODS: In this cross sectional analysis all of the approximately 2000 members of the Slovenian Celiac Society were invited to take part. We used a 3 step approach for recruitment and data collection. HRQoL was evaluated through the EuroQoL EQ-5D-5L instrument (Slovenian version) and analysed using the ordinal logistic regression. RESULTS: Out of 321 patients who gave their consent, 247 celiac patients were included in the study (77%). 68% of the participants were female and 53% of them lived in an urban setting. Most patients originated from North-East Slovenia, whereas approximately 30% of patients came from other Slovenian regions. The EQ-5D respondents' self-reported health status at the time of the study show that most patients have slight or no problems when living with CD. The duration of the gluten-free diet, academic education and rare (< 1 x year) doctor visits affect EQ-5D in a positive way. On the other hand, higher age and chronic rheumatic disease were negatively associated with EQ-5D also when compared to the general population. CONCLUSION: This is the first Slovenian study to measure the HRQoL of Slovenian CD patients, using an internationally validated questionnaire. The results of our study show that HRQoL is slightly impaired among Slovenian patients with CD. Clinical characteristics are better determinants of their HRQoL than socio-demographic factors. Greater awareness of the impact of CD on patients' HRQoL would improve the holistic management of CD patients.
38019078	Symptom Outcomes of Celiac Disease in Those on a Gluten-free Diet.	GOALS: We aimed to evaluate symptom outcomes in those on a gluten-free diet during the 5 years after diagnosis. BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is common; however, little is known about long-term symptom outcomes. STUDY: We performed a retrospective chart review on individuals with celiac disease followed at a tertiary referral center between 2012 and 2018. To minimize bias, strict inclusion/exclusion criteria were utilized. Only those with definitive biopsy-proven celiac disease, on a gluten-free diet, and with systematic follow-up were included. The standardized care at this center reduced the risk that decisions on testing and follow-up visits were determined by symptom status. Summary statistics were computed and generalized linear models with a logit link were used to associate the proportion of symptomatic visits with various covariates using R statistical programming. RESULTS: Of the 1023 records reviewed, 212 met inclusion/exclusion criteria; 146 (69%) were female and the mean age at diagnosis was 43 (range: 11 to 84 y old). During follow-up, over 50% remained symptomatic, with many having the same symptoms that prompted the diagnosis. The only predictors for remaining symptomatic were female sex and younger age at diagnosis. Abnormal serology during follow-up and small bowel normalization were not predictive. CONCLUSIONS: In individuals with definitive celiac disease with systematic long-term follow-up in a Celiac Clinic, roughly half remained symptomatic despite a gluten-free diet. Many suffer from the same symptoms that prompted the diagnosis of celiac disease. Small bowel healing and abnormal serology in follow-up were not predictive of remaining symptomatic. These findings stress the importance of long-term care in celiac disease.
22117664	Adverse food reactions--an emerging issue for adults.	Adverse reactions to foods are classified according to the presence or absence of involvement of the immune system, which may or may not include the production of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. This review focuses on the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of adverse food reactions, primarily in adults, and excluding celiac disease and lactose intolerance. Reported reactions to foods are often believed to be manifestations of a food allergy; however, IgE-mediated food allergy only affects 1% to 4% of adults, with seafood, tree nuts, peanuts, fruits, and vegetables being the most common triggers. Diagnosis is challenging and most commonly achieved through careful evaluation of clinical history followed by elimination and reintroduction or challenge with the suspected offending food. With acute-onset allergic reactions, estimation of food-specific IgE antibodies is frequently used to confirm or refute the diagnosis. Recent developments, such as single allergen assays, enhance the diagnosis of IgE-mediated food allergy, but the gold standard remains oral food challenge. Despite recent advances in the management of food allergy, including the promotion of oral tolerance, the mainstay of management is still the avoidance of food triggers. Dietary management can be compromised by nutritional inadequacy, accidental exposure, food labeling, and quality of life or adherence issues. It is essential that adults with confirmed food allergy receive optimal nutrition and dietetic support to enable them to manage their condition.
30885882	Benefits From and Barriers to Portable Detection of Gluten, Based on a Randomized Pilot Trial of Patients With Celiac Disease.	Research links diminished quality of life (QOL) to the challenges of a strict gluten-free diet (GFD), the only treatment for celiac disease (CD).1-4 This pilot study assessed the acceptability and feasibility of a portable gluten sensor device (Nima) to promote GFD adherence and QOL.
35064913	Impact of delay in diagnosis in patients with celiac disease: A study of 570 patients at a tertiary care center.	BACKGROUND: The varied presentation of celiac disease (CD) makes it challenging to diagnose it and predisposes to a significant diagnostic delay. We undertook a study to evaluate the effect of delayed diagnosis of CD on its systemic and laboratory manifestations. METHODS: In this retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data (January 2015 to December 2018), patients with CD >= 12 years were evaluated for clinical presentation and laboratory parameters. Based on duration of symptoms at the time of diagnosis, the patients were divided into 2 groups: group 1 (early diagnosis): <= 3 years, group 2 (delayed diagnosis): > 3 years. The two groups were compared for demographic, clinical, laboratory, and histological manifestations. RESULTS: Of the 570 patients, 289 constituted group 1 (early diagnosis) and 281 group 2 (delayed diagnosis). There was no age or sex difference between the two groups and both had comparable body mass index (BMI). Patients in the delayed group had lower rates of diarrhea as initial presentation with lower physician and gastroenterologist consultation and significantly higher rates of anemia, pubertal delay, and menstrual irregularities as well as higher rates of low hemoglobin, low ferritin, low transferrin saturation, and low vitamin D levels. The delayed group also had significantly higher anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody (anti-tTg Ab) titers and higher grades of villous atrophy at presentation. CONCLUSION: Patients with CD with more than 3 years of symptoms, more often have atypical presentation, anemia, pubertal delay, and more advanced histological changes. They also have fewer physician and gastroenterologist consultations. This underlines the need for proper awareness to ensure early diagnosis and treatment.
29401085	Creation of Experience-based Celiac Benchmarks: The First Step in Pretransition Self-management Assessment.	OBJECTIVES: Transition planning for children with chronic disease includes the development of independence in many self-management tasks. Conditions that depend on diet have distinct skill sets not well assessed by the traditional transition-readiness tools. There has been literature that describes age-appropriate skill acquisition for diabetes and food allergy patients. There are, however, no age-appropriate benchmarks established for celiac disease (CD). METHODS: CD experts (including physician, nurse, dietician, social worker, patient, and parent) created a list of celiac-related tasks, which formed the basis of the survey. Patients with CD, and their parents, were recruited from outpatient celiac clinic and support groups, and invited to report the age each task was mastered. RESULTS: Respondents included 204 patients and 155 parents. Mean age was 12 years (standard deviation 4.6) with average of 4 years since diagnosis. The earliest tasks were mastered by a median age of 8 years, such as recognizing GF as gluten-free, eating safely in a shared space and recognizing basic unsafe foods. Describing the effects of eating gluten or explaining CD to a friend or stranger occurred around age 10. Asking about gluten-free preparation in a restaurant, and identifying gluten-free medications or vitamins was mastered around age 12, whereas tasks involved with safe domestic travel or assessing risk in a job environment occurred between 14 and 16. The interquartile range was about 4 years for each question. No significant difference seen between patient and parent reports. CONCLUSIONS: This novel patient-centered celiac skill list may improve anticipatory guidance and accelerate self-management skills.
35291371	Coeliac disease hidden by cryptogenic hypertransaminasaemia in children: a case report.	Celiac disease is a chronic immune-mediated multisystem disorder that may affect several organs. Isolated hypertransaminasemia, with mild or nonspecific histologic changes in the liver biopsy, also known as "celiac hepatitis", is the most frequent presentation of liver injury in celiac disease. Both, histologic changes and liver enzymes reverse to normal after treatment with a gluten-free diet in most patients. Here we report the case of a young boy presenting with asymptomatic and persistent hypertransaminasemia whose etiologic investigation led to the diagnosis of celiac disease that resolved with dietary treatment alone. This case emphasizes the need to screen Celiac disease in patients with cryptogenic hypertransaminasemia, irrespective of the existence of gastrointestinal symptoms. It also exemplifies a particular situation in which a liver biopsy is useful to establish the diagnosis of celiac hepatitis.
31232884	HLA-DQ Genotyping, Duodenal Histology, and Response to Exclusion Diet in Autistic Children With Gastrointestinal Symptoms.	OBJECTIVES: A correlation between autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and gastrointestinal (GI) problems, and a possible link between gluten consumption and ASD have been increasingly reported. Gluten/casein-free diet (GCFD) is often undertaken, with conflicting results. This study aimed at evaluating the distribution of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2/DQ8 typing among patients with ASD with GI symptoms, together with its correlation with duodenal histology and response to GCFD. METHODS: Between 2002 and 2015 all patients with ASD with GI symptoms referred to our outpatient clinic, displaying clinical, laboratory, or ultrasound findings suggestive of organic disease, underwent endoscopy, celiac disease (CD) serum antibodies testing and HLA-DQ2/DQ8 genotyping. Patients were prescribed a 6-month GCFD, and then clinically reassessed. RESULTS: Among 151 enrolled patients, 134 (89%) were negative for CD-specific antibodies; 72 (48%) were positive for HLA-DQ2/DQ8; and 56 (37%) showed duodenal microscopic inflammation. Clinical improvement was observed in non-CD patients irrespective of the rigorous or partial adherence to the diet, being the difference nonstatistically significant. Response to diet was related to the presence of histological duodenal alterations at baseline (odds ratio 11.323, 95% confidence interval 1.386-92.549 for Marsh 2 pattern), but not to HLA-DQ2/DQ8 positivity (odds ratio 1.120, 95% confidence interval 0.462-2.716). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that children with ASD with GI symptoms have a high prevalence of duodenal intraepithelial lymphocytic infiltration, which seems to be linked to a mechanism other than autoimmune response to gluten consumption. Alteration of duodenal histology, but not the HLA-DQ2/DQ8 status, was associated with clinical response to the diet.
32344339	Reinventing the nutraceutical value of gluten: The case of l-theanine-gluten as a potential alternative to the gluten exclusion diet in celiac disease.	Functional foods have created an open environment for the development of new solutions to health-related issues. In celiac disease, there is still no therapeutic alternative other than the observance of a gluten-free diet. In this context, we developed a wheat flour enriched in l-theanine aimed to be a potential alternative to the gluten-free diet. Through microbial transglutaminase-catalysed transamidation of gluten proteins using ethylamine as amine nucleophile, substantial amounts of glutamine residues were converted in theanine residues. Furthermore, using T-cell lines generated from intestinal biopsy specimens of celiac disease patients, this treatment showed the potential to strongly reduce the ability of gluten proteins to stimulate a T-cell-mediated immune response. From a rheological point of view, the functionality of gluten was retained. Considering L-theanine's evidence-based health benefits, a novel functional food is presented here and for celiac disease can be a path towards the development of an alternative to the gluten-free diet.
21415771	Eosinophilic esophagitis: trials and tribulations.	Eosinophilic esophagitis (EE) is a recently recognized form of pan-esophagitis, which is characterized by the presence of at least 15 eosinophils per high power field on esophageal histology. EE is closely associated with atopic disorders and occurs predominantly in male patients. Young children are more likely to be sensitized to food allergens whilst aeroallergen sensitization predominates in older children and adults--a pattern reminiscent of the "atopic march". EE presents with a diverse range of gastrointestinal symptoms, including regurgitation, vomiting, feeding difficulties or refusal in infancy, in addition to dysphagia and food bolus impaction in older children and adults. The diagnosis may also be ascertained incidentally in patients undergoing gastroscopy for other suspected gastrointestinal conditions, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease or celiac disease. Complications mainly relate to subepithelial remodeling and fibrosis which may result in dysmotility, dysphagia and esophageal strictures. The proportion of EE patients at risk of these complications is unknown due to a paucity of data on the natural history of EE. There are only few randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of treatment modalities for EE, which currently either involve food allergen elimination or use of swallowed aerosolized corticosteroids. This article aims to discuss the complex issues of the diagnosis and long-term management that confront clinicians who care for children with EE.
23777610	Clinical utility of retrograde terminal ileum intubation in the evaluation of chronic non-bloody diarrhea.	OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to investigate the frequency and factors involved in the terminal ileum intubation of patients with chronic, non-bloody diarrhea and to compare diagnostic yields of colonoscopy and ileocolonoscopy. METHODS: The medical records of 945 patients undergoing colonoscopy for chronic, non-bloody diarrhea were reviewed. Findings of microscopic colitis, Clostridium difficile colitis, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease or tropical sprue were considered as definitive causes of diarrhea. RESULTS: A total of 689 patients met the diagnosis of chronic, non-bloody diarrhea, in which 370 (53.7%) underwent ileocolonoscopy. Specific histological diagnosis could explain the patient's symptoms in 107 (15.5%) patients. The diagnostic yield were 15.0% in the colonoscopy-only group, 16.9% in the ileocolonoscopy without biopsy group, and 15.5% in the ileocolonoscopy with biopsy group. Of the 19 patients with an abnormal terminal ileal biopsy, six (31.6%) had an otherwise normal colonic appearance which would have been diagnosed as normal if the ileum had not been reached and biopsied. In those with Crohn's disease (n = 7), five had ileocolitis and two had colitis only. A multivariate analysis showed that age of the patients and otherwise normal gross endoscopic results to be the only factors associated with a lower likelihood of ileal intubation by endoscopists. CONCLUSIONS: The ileal intubation rate was 53.7% in our patients with chronic, non-bloody diarrhea. Diagnostic yield of ileocolonoscopy with biopsy in US patients with chronic, non-bloody diarrhea appeared to be low, if the colon side was normal on endoscopy. But this may provide supportive evidence in patients diagnosed with ileocolonic Crohn's disease.
30466678	Who Should Be Gluten-Free? A Review for the General Practitioner.	Historically, a gluten-free diet was recommended only for those with celiac disease or IgE-mediated wheat allergy. With changes in food allergy labeling in the United States and the publication of several best-selling books, gluten-related disorders have come to the forefront of popular culture. As a result, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of gluten-free diet followers, many for nontraditional reasons. As "going gluten-free" has become mainstream, it is imperative that health care providers acquire the knowledge to identify true gluten-related disorders to effectively counsel their patients and minimize potential complications from following such a restrictive diet.
34064541	Celiac Disease-Type Tissue Transglutaminase Autoantibody Deposits in Kidney Biopsies of Patients with IgA Nephropathy.	An association between celiac disease and IgA nephropathy (IgAN) has been suggested. In celiac disease, in addition to circulating in serum, IgA-class tissue transglutaminase (tTG) autoantibodies are deposited in the small bowel mucosa and extraintestinal organs. In this case series of IgAN patients with or without celiac disease, we studied whether celiac disease-type IgA-tTG deposits occur in kidney biopsies. The study included nine IgAN patients, four of them with celiac disease. At the time of the diagnostic kidney biopsy serum tTG autoantibodies were measured and colocalization of IgA and tTG was investigated in the frozen kidney biopsies. Three IgAN patients with celiac disease had IgA-tTG deposits in the kidney even though in two of these the celiac disease diagnosis had been set years later. These deposits were not found in a patient with already diagnosed celiac disease following a gluten-free diet. Of the five non-celiac IgAN patients, three had IgA-tTG deposits in the kidney. We conclude that tTG-targeted IgA deposits can be found in the kidney biopsies of gluten-consuming IgAN patients but their specificity to celiac disease seems limited.
30998982	Gluten Challenge Induces Skin and Small Bowel Relapse in Long-Term Gluten-Free Diet-Treated Dermatitis Herpetiformis.	Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an extraintestinal manifestation of celiac disease causing an itchy, blistering rash. Granular IgA deposits in the skin are pathognomonic for DH, and the treatment of choice is a lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD). Preliminary evidence suggests that there are patients with DH who redevelop gluten tolerance after adherence to a GFD treatment. To evaluate this, we performed a 12-month gluten challenge with skin and small-bowel mucosal biopsy samples in 19 patients with DH who had adhered to a GFD for a mean of 23 years. Prechallenge biopsy was negative for skin IgA and transglutaminase 3 deposits in 16 patients (84%) and indicated normal villous height-to-crypt depth ratios in the small bowel mucosa in all 19 patients. The gluten challenge caused a relapse of the rash in 15 patients (79%) in a mean of 5.6 months; of these 15 patients, 13 had skin IgA and transglutaminase 3 deposits, and 12 had small-bowel villous atrophy. In addition, three patients without rash or immune deposits in the skin developed villous atrophy, whereas one patient persisted without any signs of relapse. In conclusion, 95% of the patients with DH were unable to tolerate gluten even after long-term adherence to a GFD. Therefore, lifelong GFD treatment remains justified in all patients with DH.
30711205	Follow-up of Celiac Disease.	Currently, the only effective treatment for celiac disease is complete removal of gluten from the diet. However, patients need to follow a strict gluten-free diet that results in symptomatic, serologic, and histologic remission in most patients. Histologic remission is usually complete in children, but recovery is slower and more frequently incomplete in adults. When remission has been achieved, yearly follow-up is recommended for adults, children, and adolescents. This article deals with conventional strategies used in order to follow-up patients on treatment and aiming to obtain the best clinical outcome.

34067382	Knowledge of Medical Students and Medical Professionals Regarding Nutritional Deficiencies in Patients with Celiac Disease.	A gluten-free diet provides relief from symptoms for patients with celiac disease, although there is still a risk of nutritional deficiencies. These patients can potentially consume an excessive amount of fat and insufficient amounts of fiber, iron, vitamin D, and calcium. This study aimed to assess the knowledge of medical students and healthcare professionals in Poland regarding nutritional deficiencies and the prevention of such deficiencies in patients with celiac disease who are on a gluten-free diet. Of the 430 survey participants, 46% did not realize the risk of nutritional deficiencies in patients with celiac disease. The knowledge of the participants was lowest regarding the risk of being overweight or obese. Among the healthcare professionals, an acceptable level of correct answers was provided by only 37% of individuals and was highest for the dietitians' group. Our results demonstrate the need to improve the education of healthcare professionals concerning nutrition in patients with celiac disease.
31329915	The development of the gluten free healthy food basket in Cyprus. Is it affordable among low-income adults diagnosed with celiac disease?	BACKGROUND: Gluten free (GF) diets are not only restrictive but also costly. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the acceptability, cost and affordability of a Gluten Free Healthy Food Basket (GFHFB) and further examine whether low-income Cypriots diagnosed with celiac disease (CD) experience food stress. METHODS: GFEtaFBs were constructed for adult women and adult men (+-40 years) diagnosed with CD. Feasibility and acceptability was tested through three focus groups. Affordability was defined as the cost of the GFEtaFB as a percentage of the Guaranteed Minimum Income (GMI). RESULTS: The GFEtaFB was 33.6 and 47 euros/month more expensive compared to the HB (Healthy Basket) for women and men, respectively. The total budget for GF-manufactured products were 27.81 and 28.5% of the total food budget, for women and men, respectively. For low-income people receiving the GMI, the proportion of income that would need to be spent on the GFHFB ranges from around 42 to 60%. CONCLUSIONS: The GFEtaFB is costly and not affordable among low-income Cypriots diagnosed with CD; thus, they are likely to suffer from food stress. As such, the risk of reducing their adherence to a GF diet is high and thus compromises their long-term health.
36537331	Early life gut microbiota: Consequences for health and opportunities for prevention.	The gut microbiota influences many aspects of the host, including immune system maturation, nutrient absorption and metabolism, and protection from pathogens. Increasing evidences from cohort and animal studies indicate that changes in the gut microbiota early in life increases the risk of developing specific diseases early and later in life. Therefore, it is becoming increasingly important to identify specific disease prevention or therapeutic solutions targeting the gut microbiota, especially during infancy, which is the window of the human gut microbiota establishment process. In this review, we provide an overview of current knowledge concerning the relationship between disturbances in the gut microbiota early in life and health consequences later in life (e.g., necrotizing enterocolitis, celiac disease, asthma, allergies, autism spectrum disorders, overweight/obesity, diabetes and growth retardation), with a focus on changes in the gut microbiota prior to disease onset. In addition, we summarize and discuss potential microbiota-based interventions early in life (e.g., diet adjustments, probiotics, prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, environmental changes) to promote health or prevent the development of specific diseases. This knowledge should aid the understanding of early life microbiology and inform the development of prediction and prevention measures for short- and long-term health disorders based on the gut microbiota.
26945703	Human leukocyte antigen typing using buccal swabs as accurate and non-invasive substitute for venipuncture in children at risk for celiac disease.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing is an important step in the diagnostic algorithm for celiac disease (CD) and is also used for screening purposes. Collection of blood is invasive and accompanied with emotional impact especially in children. Genetic technological progress now enables HLA typing from buccal cell samples. This study evaluated the reliability and feasibility of HLA typing for CD-associated HLA polymorphisms using buccal swabs as routine test in high-risk individuals. METHODS: Blood and buccal swabs of 77 children and adolescents with high risk for CD were prospectively collected in this cohort study. Buccal swab collection was performed either by the investigator at the outpatient clinic or by the patient or its parents at home. To evaluate the possibility of self-administration, three families performed the test at home. DNA was extracted using an adapted QIAamp method. Quantity, quality, and purity of DNA were recorded. HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA1, and HLA-DQB1 typing was examined on buccal cell-derived and blood-derived DNA at low and, if necessary, high resolution level, using sequence-specific oligonucleotide and sequence-based typing, respectively. RESULTS: DNA isolation using buccal swabs yielded a good quality and sufficient quantity of DNA to perform HLA-DQ typing in all individuals. HLA typing results on buccal cell-derived DNA were identical to typing on blood-derived DNA, also for the self-administered samples. CONCLUSION: Introduction of the buccal swab test for HLA typing of CD risk in routine diagnostics can omit the current venipuncture and enables self-administration at home. Therefore, the buccal swab test is beneficial for individuals with a clinical suspicion for CD, as well as for screening purposes in high-risk populations.
25946675	Gluten-free diet as a therapeutic approach in psoriatic patients: if yes, when.	Since most of the studies are mainly confined to cases reporting coincidence of psoriasis and celiac disease, the authors want to underline the utility of investigating the possible presence of an underlying celiac disease in normal practice for a better approach to the patient. It is necessary to carry out controlled studies on a large number of patients to evaluate the association between these two diseases and the benefits of a gluten-free diet, even when the intestinal symptomatology is not evident.

30904232	Diet patterns in an ethnically diverse pediatric population with celiac disease and chronic gastrointestinal complaints.	INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease requiring lifelong adherence to the gluten-free diet (GFD). The GFD has significant nutritional limitations which may result in poor diet quality (DQ). We hypothesized that biopsy-proven children with CD (CCD) would have dietary patterns characterized by high saturated fat/simple sugar intake with a low micronutrient density contributing to lower DQ when compared to children with mild-gastrointestinal complaints (GI-CON). In addition, we hypothesized that ethnicity may further impact DQ. METHODS: Socio-demographic (age, CD duration, parent/child ethnicity, education), household characteristics, anthropometric, dietary intake (24-h recalls), gastrointestinal pain and adherence was collected in CCD (n = 243) and GI-CON (n = 148). Dietary patterns were determined using k-mean Cluster Analysis. RESULTS: GI-CON had significantly lower DQ than CCD (p < 0.001). Most CCD and GI-CON (>80%) had dietary patterns characterized by1) Western Diet (Cluster 1: %BMR: 110-150, low DQ, high fat, moderate CHO, high sodium) and 2) High Fat-Western Diet (Cluster 2: %BMR:130-150, low DQ, high Fat, high processed meats, high fat dairy products, CHO. Fewer children (<20%) had Prudent, Lower Fat/High Carbohydrate dietary patterns (% BMR:100-150, higher DQ, lower fat/sodium, higher CHO) with a greater proportion of non-Caucasian CCD consuming a Prudent dietary pattern. Seventy-seven percent and 37.5% of CCD and GI-CON, respectively, did not meet estimated average requirements for folate (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: CCD and GI-CON have predominantly Western dietary patterns with low DQ, particularly GI-CON. Non-caucasian CCD consume more prudent dietary patterns with higher DQ. Nutrition education is warranted to ensure optimal DQ in children with chronic gastrointestinal diseases.
22859651	Quality, microstructure, biochemical and immunochemical characteristics of hypoallergenic pasta.	Celiac disease is an immune-mediated enteropathy, characterized by lifelong intolerance to gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. This study aims to develop hypoallergenic pasta using blends of Triticum durum semolina, 40% of other non-wheat flours and additives. Formulated pasta samples were evaluated for product quality characteristics and also subjected to biochemical analysis. Results showed that cooking loss ranged from 6.9% to 7.4%, which were within the acceptable range of 8%. Color change was low and in vitro protein digestibility of the pasta was found to be insignificant. Pasting characteristics of the hypoallergenic flour showed the increased peak viscosity and decreased gelatinization temperature. The scanning electron microscopy results demonstrated less-affected microstructure of gluten network. Texture profile analysis and descriptive sensory analysis revealed that optimized hypoallergenic pasta with xanthan gum as additive was acceptable and comparable with control. SDS-PAGE pattern showed distinct protein profile and decreased intensity, which was supported by Dot-Blot. In conclusion, the hypoallergenic pasta prepared by replacing T durum flour by 40% of other non-gluten flours could be useful for celiac patients because of its low antigenic activity.
26179550	Prevalence of celiac disease in patients with severe food allergy.	The association between food allergy and celiac disease (CD) is still to be clarified. We screened for CD 319 patients with severe food allergy (IgE > 85 kU/l against food proteins and a history of severe allergic reactions) who underwent specific food oral immunotherapy (OIT), together with 128 children with mild allergy who recovered without OIT, and compared the prevalence data with our historical data regarding healthy schoolchildren. Sixteen patients (5%) with severe allergy and one (0.8%) with mild allergy tested positive for both genetic and serological CD markers, while the prevalence among the schoolchildren was 1%. Intestinal biopsies were obtained in 13/16 patients with severe allergy and in the one with mild allergy, confirming the diagnosis of CD. Sufferers from severe food allergy seem to be at a fivefold increased risk of CD. Our findings suggest that routine screening for CD should be recommended in patients with severe food allergy. 
34433427	The influence of a gluten-free diet on health-related quality of life in individuals with celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: Adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) and food insecurity (FI) may influence health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in individuals with celiac disease (CD). This study aimed to investigate the association between adherence to a GFD, FI, and HRQOL in individuals with CD. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 97 adults (mean age: 34 +- 9 years) diagnosed with CD. The participants were on a GFD for more than 6 months. Sociodemographic characteristics and medical history were assessed. Adherence to a GFD, FI, and HRQOL were assessed using validated questionnaires. RESULTS: Most participants (73%) adhered to a GFD, and 62% were experiencing FI. Individuals with CD faced difficulty in accessing GF foods due to the high cost (90%) and limited availability (79%). The mean overall HRQOL score was 60. Scores on the physical and mental health domains were 69 and 47, respectively. Adherence to a GFD was significantly associated with FI (P = 0.02), while there was no association between adherence to a GFD and HRQOL measures (P > 0.05). Participants facing FI had lower scores in emotional well-being and mental health domains, and overall HRQOL (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study demonstrate that FI influences adherence to a GFD, and that FI is associated with HRQOL in terms of both emotional well-being and mental health.
21987180	Association of celiac disease with aplastic anemia.	The authors report a case of 13-y-old boy who presented with pain in bilateral knee and ankle joints accompanied by petechiae all over the body and hematochezia. On investigation, he had pancytopenia, which on subsequent evaluation revealed aplastic anemia. On investigation for short stature, he was diagnosed as a case of celiac disease. He was started on gluten free diet and the counts improved over 8 mo. Association between aplastic anemia and celiac disease has rarely been reported. To the best of authors' knowledge only 8 adult cases of celiac disease associated with aplastic anemia have been published. This is the first report to suggest an association in children and response to a gluten free diet.
21523258	Collagenous sprue.	Collagenous sprue is a small bowel mucosal lesion that has been historically associated with persistent diarrhea, progressive weight loss and severe malabsorption causing multiple nutrient deficiencies. A severe to variably severe mucosal lesion with distinct subepithelial collagen deposits occurs. Celiac disease has been intimately linked to collagenous sprue and, similar to celiac disease, small bowel ulceration, perforation and lymphoma may complicate the clinical course of collagenous sprue. In collagenous sprue, concomitant collagen deposits may also occur in gastric or colonic mucosal sites (or both), indicating that this unusual mucosal process may be very heterogeneous and far more extensive in the intestinal tract than previously appreciated. Moreover, reports of diagnosis during infancy suggest that the natural history of the disorder could be more prolonged than is currently appreciated. Finally, the collagen deposits, per se, may be due to different causes and, in some, even represent a novel paraneoplastic histopathological marker. Future studies are needed to more precisely define molecular and genetic biomarkers that identify homogeneous groups and permit the development of improved treatment strategies for this increasingly recognized disorder.
25824917	Benefit on health-related quality of life of adherence to gluten-free diet in adult patients with celiac disease.	INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease (CD) affects health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of patients suffering it. The exclusion of gluten from the diet (GFD) improves HRQOL, but involves difficulties in following the diet that could adversely affect HRQOL. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of adherence to the diet on HRQOL of adult CD patients. METHODS: A prospective, cross-sectional, multicenter study of CD patients treated with a GFD for longer than 1 year. Adherence to the GFD was measured using the Morisky scale, and health status using the specific CD-QOL questionnaire and the generic EuroQol-5D questionnaire. RESULTS: 366 patients from 7 hospitals were included: 71.5% of patients reported a perfect treatment adherence, 23.5% unintentional poor adherence and 5% intentional poor adherence. Good adherence to a GFD was related to a higher mean score onthe CD-QOL (75 vs. 68, respectively, p < 0.05) and EuroQol-5D (0.9 vs. 0.8, respectively, p < 0.05). Ease of adherence to a GFD was also related to a better HRQOL (total CD-QOL score of 82 vs. 67 in patients who consider the GFD difficult to follow, p < 0.05). Good symptom control was also related to a better HRQOL (total CD-QOL score of 78 vs. 67 in asymptomatic vs. symptomatic patients, p < 0.01). The worse scored dimension of CD-QOL was related to "inadequate treatment". CONCLUSIONS: In CD, good adherence to a GFD and adequate symptom control result in improved HRQOL. Many patients consider that the lack of therapeutic alternatives to diet worsens their quality of life.
21157327	Advances in celiac disease.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To critically summarize recent research in celiac disease. RECENT FINDINGS: There are new serological markers with potential use not only in the diagnosis of celiac disease but also as important follow-up tools. As our understanding of celiac disease increases with further isolation of nonhuman leukocyte antigen genes and clarification of the intracellular pathways that underlie its pathogenesis, there are new modalities which will not only allow improved risk stratification of individuals but also facilitate the development of novel therapeutic agents. SUMMARY: Small bowel biopsy remains the gold standard for both diagnosis and monitoring. A gluten-free diet currently remains the only treatment option, with potential other options being discovered such as glutenases for predigestion of gluten.
23922469	Comparison of double balloon enteroscopy in adults and children.	AIM: To compare results of double balloon enteroscopy (DBE) procedures in pediatric and adult patients. METHODS: The medical files of patients who underwent DBE at Gazi University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey between 2009 and 2011 were examined retrospectively. Adult and pediatric patients were compared according to DBE indications, procedure duration, final diagnosis, and complications. DBE procedures were performed in an operating room under general anesthesia by two endoscopists. An oral or anal approach was preferred according to estimated lesion sites. Overnight fasting of at least 6 h prior to the start of the procedure was adequate for preprocedural preparation of oral DBE procedures. Bowel cleansing was performed by oral administration of sennosides A and B solution, 2 mL/kg, and anal saline laxative enema. The patients were followed up for 2 h after the procedure in terms of possible complications. RESULTS: DBE was performed in 35 patients (5 pediatric and 30 adult). DBE procedures were performed for abdominal pain, chronic diarrhea, bleeding, chronic vomiting, anemia, and postoperative evaluation of anastomosis. Final diagnosis was diffuse gastric angiodysplasia (n = 1); diffuse jejunal angiodysplasia (n = 1); ulceration in the bulbus (n = 1); celiac disease (n = 1); low differentiated metastatic carcinoma (n = 1); Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (n = 1); adenomatous polyp (n = 1) and stricture formation in anastomosis line (n = 1). During postprocedural follow-up, abdominal pain and elevated amylase levels were noted in three patients and one patient developed abdominal perforation. CONCLUSION: With the help of technological improvements, we may use enteroscopy as a safe modality more frequently in younger and smaller children.
28017844	Is Autoimmunity Infectious? The Effect of Gastrointestinal Viral Infections and Vaccination on Risk of Celiac Disease Autoimmunity.	
27035374	NASPGHAN Clinical Report on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Gluten-related Disorders.	Dietary exclusion of gluten-containing products has become increasingly popular in the general population, and currently ~30% of people in the United States are limiting gluten ingestion. Although celiac disease (CD), wheat allergy (WA), and nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) constitute a spectrum of gluten-related disorders that require exclusion of gluten from the diet, together these account for a relatively small percentage of those following a gluten-free diet, and the vast majority has no medical necessity for doing so. Differentiating between CD, WA, and NCGS has important prognostic and therapeutic implications. Because of the protean manifestations of gluten-related disorders, it is not possible to differentiate between them on clinical grounds alone. This clinical report will compare and contrast the manifestations of gluten-related disorders, emphasize the importance of differentiating between these conditions, discuss initial and subsequent tests needed to confirm the diagnosis, and provide recommendations on treatment and follow-up for each condition.
21835400	Capsule endoscopy in nonresponsive celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: Nonresponsive celiac disease (CD) is defined by persistent or recurrent symptoms, common after treatment with a gluten-free diet (GFD). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the utility of capsule endoscopy (CE) in nonresponsive CD. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Tertiary-care center. PATIENTS: Forty-two consecutive patients with nonresponsive CD and 84 age- and sex-matched CD-free controls who underwent CE were included. In addition, capsules taken after treatment with a GFD were retrospectively evaluated in 30 patients with uncomplicated CD. INTERVENTION: CE. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Diagnostic accuracy of CE for the detection of mucosal abnormalities in nonresponsive CD. RESULTS: Macroscopic features of villous atrophy were detected in 13 of 42 patients (31%) with nonresponsive CD compared with none among 84 CD-free controls and 14 of 30 patients (47%) with uncomplicated CD. Among nonresponsive CD cases, the overall sensitivity and specificity of CE for the detection of any degree of villous atrophy as graded by histology were 56% and 85%, respectively. Single or multiple erosions/ulcerations of the gut were observed in 19% of nonresponsive CD patients, 18% of CD-free controls, and 31% of patients with uncomplicated CD (P = .35). The presence of erosions/ulcerations was associated with increased aspirin/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use in nonresponsive CD (P =.05). Two severe complications (ulcerative jejunitis and adenocarcinoma) were detected by CE in nonresponsive CD. LIMITATIONS: Single-center, retrospective study. CONCLUSIONS: Mucosal abnormalities were observed by CE in patients with both nonresponsive CD and uncomplicated CD. CE can detect severe complications in patients with nonresponsive CD.
28146115	Normal Bone Mineral Density Associates with Duodenal Mucosa Healing in Adult Patients with Celiac Disease on a Gluten-Free Diet.	Impairment of bone mineral density (BMD) is frequent in celiac disease (CD) patients on a gluten-free diet (GFD). The normalization of intestinal mucosa is still difficult to predict. We aim to investigate the relationship between BMD and duodenal mucosa healing (DMH) in CD patients on a GFD. Sixty-four consecutive CD patients on a GFD were recruited. After a median period of a 6-year GFD (range 2-33 years), patients underwent repeat duodenal biopsy and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan. Twenty-four patients (38%) displayed normal and 40 (62%) low BMD, 47 (73%) DMH, and 17 (27%) duodenal mucosa lesions. All patients but one with normal BMD (23 of 24, 96%) showed DMH, while, among those with low BMD, 24 (60%) did and 16 (40%) did not. At multivariate analysis, being older (odds ratio (OR) 1.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-1.18) and having diagnosis at an older age (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.03-1.16) were associated with low BMD; in turn, having normal BMD was the only variable independently associated with DMH (OR 17.5, 95% CI 1.6-192). In older CD patients and with late onset disease, BMD recovery is not guaranteed, despite a GFD. A normal DXA scan identified CD patients with DMH; thus, it is a potential tool in planning endoscopic resampling.
30938127	Randomized controlled trial of a gluten-free diet in patients with schizophrenia positive for antigliadin antibodies (AGA IgG): a pilot feasibility study	Background: Approximately one-third of people with schizophrenia have elevated levels of anti-gliadin antibodies of the immunoglobulin G type (AGA IgG) : a higher rate than seen in healthy controls. We performed the first double-blind clinical trial of gluten-free versus gluten-containing diets in a subset of patients with schizophrenia who were positive for AGA IgG. Methods: In this pilot feasibility study, 16 participants with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who had elevated AGA IgG (>= 20 U) but were negative for celiac disease were admitted to an inpatient unit for a 5-week trial. All participants received standardized gluten-free meals and were randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive a shake containing 10 g of gluten flour or 10 g of rice flour each day. Participants were rated for psychiatric, cognitive and gastrointestinal symptoms at baseline and endpoint. Results: Of the 16 participants, 14 completed the 5-week trial (2 discontinued early for administrative reasons). Compared with participants on the gluten-containing diet, participants on the gluten-free diet showed improvement on the Clinical Global Impressions scale (Cohen d = -0.75) and in negative symptoms (Cohen d = -0.53). We noted no improvement in positive or global cognitive symptoms, but did observe an improvement in attention favouring the gluten-free diet (Cohen d = 0.60). Robust improvements in gastrointestinal adverse effects occurred in the gluten-free group relative to the glutencontaining group. Adverse effects were similar between groups. Limitations: This study was limited by its small sample size; larger studies are needed. Conclusion: This feasibility study suggests that removal of gluten from the diet is associated with improvement in psychiatric and gastrointestinal symptoms in people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.
33852210	[Vaccination in adult patients: shingles vaccines and vaccination in case of anatomical or functional asplenia].	Shingles vaccination and pneumococcal vaccination of patients with celiac disease are among the most recent updates for the vaccination of vulnerable adults, in Switzerland. Shingles and especially post-herpes zoster pain remain an unresolved public health issue. The only vaccine available in Switzerland is very little administered because it is not reimbursed by health insurance companies. A second shingles vaccine is announced for 2022 and should help to reduce the burden of this disease. It has been known for many years that celiac disease is accompanied by hyposplenism in adults. The resulting increased risk of invasive pneumococcal infections justifies, since 2020, a recommendation for vaccination against these encapsulated bacteria.
20883070	Colonoscopic findings in coeliac disease on a gluten-free diet.	BACKGROUND: to date, there are few data on colonoscopic findings in patients with celiac disease, and most of these obtained in patients with iron deficiency anaemia. AIMS: we assessed colonoscopic findings in unselected patients with coeliac disease, since there are no studies available also considering morphological aspects, and there is literature suggestion of increased prevalence of colorectal tumours. MATERIAL AND METHODS: colonoscopies with multiple biopsies were retrospectively analyzed in 42 coeliac disease patients on gluten-free diet above age 40; 16 had clinical or laboratory features of iron deficiency anaemia. Mucosal biopsies were evaluated for the presence of intraepithelial lymphocytes and of mucosal eosinophils, in addition to conventional histologic assessment, and compared with those obtained in 15 controls. RESULTS: macroscopic abnormalities (polyps, diverticula, inflammatory changes) were found in 26% of patients. Microscopic abnormalities (lymphocytic colitis, melanosis coli, rectal histiocytosis) were found in 36% of patients. None of these findings was found in controls. Coeliac disease patients had significantly higher eosinophil score than controls in the right colon, whereas this was not significantly different between groups in the left colon. CONCLUSIONS: colonoscopic findings in coeliac disease on gluten-free diet may reveal significant findings, even in patients without iron deficiency anaemia. There is the need of further studies in larger cohorts of patients to establish whether colonoscopy in these patients may be clinically useful.
30711213	(Outcome) Measure for (Intervention) Measures: A Guide to Choosing the Appropriate Noninvasive Clinical Outcome Measure for Intervention Studies in Celiac Disease.	There is an unmet need for diagnostic and treatment interventions for celiac disease. Both clinical trials and real-world studies require careful selection of clinical outcome measures. Often, neither serology nor histology is an appropriate primary outcome. This article reviews various measures of intestinal function and nutrition, patient-reported outcome measures for symptoms and for health-related quality of life, and measures of sickness burden as they apply to intervention studies for celiac disease. A series of case studies is presented to illustrate key considerations in selecting outcome measures for dietary interventions, pharmacologic interventions, and real-world studies.
33321512	Celiac Disease and Sensitization to Wheat, Rye, and Barley: Should We Be Concerned?	BACKGROUND: Concomitance of celiac disease (CD) and IgE-mediated wheat allergy is described in some case reports. The objective was to evaluate the frequency of sensitization to wheat, rye, barley, and malt in children and adolescents with CD. METHODS: Measurement of serum levels of specific IgE to wheat, rye, barley, and malt (ImmunoCAP; sensitization IgE >=0.35 kUA/L) in CD patients followed in specialized clinics to verify allergy history, general characteristics, small bowel biopsy characteristics, compliance with gluten-free diet (GFD), and occurrence of symptoms in case of noncompliance. RESULTS: We evaluated 74 patients; the median of age and age at diagnosis of CD were 8.6 years (5.0-12.8) and 3.6 years (1.6-7.0), respectively. Median time of GFD was 3.5 years (1.4-5.8). History of asthma occurred in 17.3% of subjects, allergic rhinitis in 13.5%, and AD in 5.4%. Frequency of sensitization was 4% for wheat, 10.8% for rye, 5.4% for barley, and 2.7% for malt. There was no association between wheat sensitization and age at diagnosis, time of GFD, small bowel biopsy characteristics, allergy history, and gluten consumption. There was no relationship between sensitization to wheat and occurrence of immediate symptoms when not complying with GFD. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the frequency of sensitization to wheat, rye, barley, and malt in CD patients was 4, 10.8, 5.4, and 2.7%, respectively. Therefore, to ensure that cutaneous and respiratory contact with wheat is safe, we advise patients with CD to investigate their sensitivity to wheat, rye, and barley because not all patients with CD are allergic to these cereals.
32069238	The effect of celiac disease and gluten-free diet on pubertal development: a two-center study.	Objectives We aimed to assess whether age at menarche and pubertal development (Tanner stage) are related to gluten-free diet (GFD) adherence, hormonal status, micro-nutrient levels and body mass index (BMI) in children with celiac disease (CD). Methods In this two-center, cross-sectional study, CD patients and healthy individuals were studied. CD patients were re-evaluated after 1 year of follow-up. Height, weight, Tanner stage, age at menarche and diet compliance were recorded. Blood samples for anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA (TTG), pituitary gonadotropins, gonadal hormones, prolactin and micronutrients (folate, vitamin B12, vitamin D, ferritin, iron and, iron-binding capacity [IBC]) were assayed. Results Consecutive age- and sex-matched 228 celiac patients (12.92 +- 2.35 years; 67.9% female) and 135 non-celiac healthy individuals (12.77 +- 2.25 years; 65.2% female) were studied. Tanner stage was significantly higher in the control group for both girls and boys (p < 0.05). The mean age at menarche was significantly lower in healthy individuals (13.13 +- 1.01 vs. 12.15 +- 0.97, p < 0.001). By multivariate analysis, GFD adherence, transferrin saturation (sTrf), total IBC (TIBC) and vitamin D status were found to be positively correlated with Tanner stage (p < 0.05). After 1 year, 192 of the CD patients were re-evaluated. GFD compliance was better (TTG levels: 135.59 +- 73.88 vs. 71.53 +- 69.40, p < 0.001) and it was correlated with Tanner stage (r = 0.49, p < 0.01), sTrf (r = 0.66, p < 0.01) and IBC (r = 0.23, p < 0.05). Conclusions Our data show that adequate weight gain, adherence to GFD, sufficient iron and vitamin D status are essential factors for salubrious puberty in CD patients.
23834276	Prevalence of gluten-free diet adherence among individuals without celiac disease in the USA: results from the Continuous National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2009-2010.	OBJECTIVES: Clinical inference suggests the prevalence of non-celiac gluten sensitivity is substantially higher than that of celiac disease in the USA. Unfortunately, there are currently no data supporting these claims. The authors analyzed nationally representative data to estimate the prevalence of adherence to a gluten-free diet among participants without celiac disease and also to characterize the demographics and general health status of these participants. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: The Continuous National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2009-2010 enrolled 7762 individuals representing the civilian, non-institutionalized, US population free of celiac disease. Participants responded to interviewer administered questionnaires regarding current adherence to a gluten-free diet. Prevalence estimates were computed using SAS survey procedures. RESULTS: There were 49 individuals who reported current adherence to a gluten-free diet reflecting a weighted prevalence of 0.548% (95% CI 0.206-0.889). The prevalence of a gluten-free diet was higher in females (0.58%) than males (0.37%), although this was not statistically significant (p = 0.34). Participants reporting a gluten-free diet were older (46.6 vs. 40.5 years, p = 0.005), had higher high-density lipoprotein, lower iron and lower body mass index. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated national prevalence of non-celiac gluten sensitivity is 0.548%, approximately half that of celiac disease. Future studies are merited in order to better understand the population burden of non-celiac gluten sensitivity.

31552781	A Single Institution's Experience of Primary Headache in Children With Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND: Few studies exist examining the frequency of primary headache in children with celiac disease and the impact of a gluten-free diet on primary headache symptomology. This study explores characteristics and frequency of headaches in children with celiac disease and response to gluten-free diet at a single institution. METHODS: Medical records were reviewed for children with celiac disease confirmed by the presence of elevated tissue transglutaminase IgA levels and histologic changes consistent with the diagnosis of celiac disease on small bowel biopsy. Eligible participants were contacted via letter for participation in a phone survey regarding headaches. Phone interviews were conducted 2 weeks after notification and lasted approximately 10 minutes. Headaches were classified according to ICHD-3 criteria. RESULTS: 247 eligible patients or their families were contacted. A total of 132 (53.44%) agreed to participate. One participant was excluded due to insufficient information provided. Overall, 51 of 131 participants had recurrent headache defined as at least 1 episode per month (39%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 31%-47%) and 33 had migraine with or without aura (25%, 95% CI: 18%-33%). Twenty-eight had frequent tension-type headache (22%, 95% CI: 15%-29%). Thirty-two participants noted headaches before a confirmed diagnosis of celiac disease. Twenty-two of 32 participants (68.75%) noticed decreased headache frequency or intensity, or both, after starting the gluten-free diet. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that at least one-third of children and adolescents with celiac disease have recurrent headaches at the time of diagnosis. A gluten-free diet led to improved headache symptomology in a significant number of these patients.
33639838	Symptoms and biomarkers associated with undiagnosed celiac seropositivity.	BACKGROUND: Studies have indicated that underdiagnosis and diagnostic delay are common in celiac disease. Therefore, it is important to increase our knowledge of what symptoms and biomarkers could identify undiagnosed cases of celiac disease. METHODS: We screened for celiac disease antibodies in stored blood samples from 16,776 participants in eight population-based studies examined during 1976-2012. Undiagnosed celiac seropositivity was defined as celiac disease antibody positivity (IgG-deamidated gliadin peptide above 10.0 U/mL and/or IgA-tissue transglutaminase (TTG) or IgG-TTG above 7.0 U/mL) without a known diagnosis of celiac disease in the National Patient Register. In all studies general health symptoms were recorded by participant-completed questionnaire, including self-perceived health, tiredness, headache and gastrointestinal symptoms. Furthermore, blood samples were drawn for analyses of biomarkers e.g. hemoglobin, blood glucose, cholesterol, liver parameters and vitamins. The participants with undiagnosed celiac seropositivity were matched by sex, age and study with four controls among the celiac disease antibody negative participants. RESULTS: We excluded, five participants with known celiac disease, resulting in a population of 16,771 participants. In this population 1% (169/16,771) had undiagnosed celiac seropositivity. There were no statistically significant differences in symptoms between cases and controls. Undiagnosed celiac seropositivity was associated with low blood cholesterol (< 5 mmol/L) and low hemoglobin (< 7.3 mmol/L for women and < 8.3 mmol/L for men). CONCLUSION: In this general population study, undiagnosed cases of celiac seropositivity did not have more symptoms than controls, confirming the diagnostic difficulties of celiac disease and the low prognostic value of symptoms for a diagnosis of celiac disease. Furthermore, decreased levels of cholesterol and/or hemoglobin in the blood were associated with undiagnosed celiac seropositivity.

26022363	Current Management of Pediatric Vitiligo.	Vitiligo is a common inflammatory disorder with worldwide prevalence of 0.4-2 % of the population, with half of cases beginning in childhood. The management of childhood vitiligo should be tailored to avoid negative effects on the overall growth and psychological development of the patient. Therapy of vitiligo in childhood is chosen based on the location of the lesions, lesion age, and extent of lesions in the context of the child's age and the developmental status of the child. There are four age categories in childhood vitiligo: [1] infantile and toddler (rare) (ages 0-3 years), [2] ages 4-8 years, [3] ages 9-12 years, and [4] 13+ years of age, based on developmental stage, psychological maturation, and ability to comply or participate in therapy. These categories are also differentiated psychologically by susceptibility to bullying, self-image development, and personal concern with lesion appearance, which increases with time. Intervention is advisable in cases with facial and leg involvement due to prominence of lesions and cosmetic defect. Medical interventions are largely the usage of topical therapies including corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors, some vitamin therapy (oral and topical vitamin D), and judicious introduction of phototherapy sources based on age and severity. Screening and appropriate subspecialist referral for co-morbidities (e.g., thyroid disease, celiac disease, psychological distress, and vitamin D deficiency) may enhance overall health. Cosmesis and camouflage are generally safe in childhood and have been noted to improve overall quality of life in this grouping. Genetic transmission of vitiligo is minimal at 5-6 % in first-degree relatives. This article reviews the therapeutics of pediatric vitiligo from the perspective of developmental stages and response to therapy.

28221929	Risk of Cross-Contact for Gluten-Free Pizzas in Shared-Production Restaurants in Relation to Oven Cooking Procedures.	To allow celiac patients to have meals out, a growing number of restaurants and pizzas houses that simultaneously provide gluten-free (GF) pizzas and wheat-based (WB) pizzas have recently been opened in Italy. In these restaurants, GF pizzas are prepared with GF raw materials, following procedures that minimize the risk of gluten cross-contact. Here, we evaluate the risk of gluten cross-contact of GF pizzas in relation to the preparation procedures, thus aiming at identifying a safe procedure for cooking GF pizzas. Our results show that, when specific requirements are complied with, the simultaneous cooking of GF and WB pizzas is a procedure as safe as having an oven dedicated to GF pizzas or the alternate cooking of GF and WB pizzas in the same oven.
30963964	Role of Dietary Gluten in Development of Celiac Disease and Type I Diabetes: Management Beyond Gluten-Free Diet.	Gluten triggers Celiac Disease (CD) and type I diabetes in genetically predisposed population of human leukocyte antigen DQ2/DQ8+ and associates with disorders such as schizophrenia and autism. Application of a strict gluten-free diet is the only well-established treatment for patients with CD, whereas the treatment for patients with celiac type I diabetes may be depend on the timing and frequency of the diet. The application of a gluten-free diet in patients with CD may contribute to the development of metabolic syndrome and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and may also lead to a high glycemic index, low fiber diet and micronutrient deficiencies. The alteration of copper bioavailability (deficient, excess or aberrant coordination) may contribute to the onset and progress of related pathologies. Therefore, nutrient intake of patients on a gluten-free diet should be the focus of future researches. Other gluten-based therapies have been rising with interest such as enzymatic pretreatment of gluten, oral enzyme supplements to digest dietary gluten, gluten removal by breeding wheat varieties with reduced or deleted gluten toxicity, the development of polymeric binders to suppress gluten induced pathology.
36499446	Replacing the Burden of the Gluten Free Diet: Then, Now, and the Future.	Without a doubt, a majority of diseases are food-pattern-related. However, one disease stands out as an increasingly more common autoimmune-mediated enteropathy triggered by the ingestion of gluten. Celiac disease (CD) is an old disease, with changing clinical patterns, affecting any age, including infancy and adolescence, and becoming more frequent among the elderly. The gluten-free diet (GFD) has been the sole provider of clinical, serological, and histological improvement for patients with CD for more than seven decades. Nowadays, complete avoidance of dietary gluten is rarely possible because of the wide availability of wheat and other processed foods that contain even more gluten, to the detriment of gluten-free products. Undeniably, there is a definite need for replacing the burdensome GFD. An add-on therapy that could control the dietary transgressions and inadvertent gluten consumption that can possibly lead to overt CD should be considered while on GFD. Nevertheless, future drugs should be able to provide patients some freedom to self-manage CD and increase food independence, while actively reducing exposure and mucosal damage and alleviating GI symptoms. Numerous clinical trials assessing different molecules have already been performed with favorable outcomes, and hopefully they will soon be available for patient use.
27446825	Celiac Disease and Gluten-Free Oats: A Canadian Position Based on a Literature Review.	This paper provides an overview of the latest scientific data related to the safety of uncontaminated oats (<20 ppm of gluten) in the diet of individuals with celiac disease (CD). It updates the previous Health Canada position posted on the Health Canada website in 2007 and a related paper published in 2009. It considers a number of recent studies published between January 2008 and January 2015. While recognizing that a few people with celiac disease seem to be clinically intolerant to oats, this review concludes that oats uncontaminated by gluten-containing cereals (wheat, rye, and barley) can be safely ingested by most patients with celiac disease and that there is no conclusive evidence that the consumption of uncontaminated or specially produced oats containing no greater than 20 ppm gluten by patients with celiac disease should be limited to a specific daily amount. However, individuals with CD should observe a stabilization phase before introducing uncontaminated oats to the gluten-free diet (GFD). Oats uncontaminated with gluten should only be introduced after all symptoms of celiac disease have resolved and the individual has been on a GFD for a minimum of 6 months. Long-term regular medical follow-up of these patients is recommended but this is no different recommendation to celiac individuals on a GFD without oats. 
21695947	[Reproductive disorders in women with celiac disease. Effect of the etiotropic therapy].	UNLABELLED: Violation of reproductive function in patients with celiac disease can manifest as delayed puberty, infertility, amenorrhea, premature menopause, spontaneous abortion, low birth weight. The aim of the study was to establish the frequency and nature of reproductive function violation in patients with CD in the Russian Federation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 132 women (average age 38,5 +/- 1,17 years) with CD observed in CSRIG in the period from 2000 to 2010. Comparison group consisted 105 women (average age 38,7 +/- 1,6 years) with predominantly functional bowel disorders (irritable bowel syndrome, functional constipation, functional bloating, inert colon). Were took into account information regarding obstetric history, physical and laboratory signs of malabsorption syndrome (MS) study of antibodies to alpha-gliadin immunoglobulin (IG) A class (AGA) and tissue transglutaminase (AtTG). RESULTS: The average age of onset of menses was 14,3 +/- 1,4 years, and in the control group - 13,0 +/- 1,3 years (p > 0.05), half of patients with C (43.9%) had menstruation begun at age 15 years and older, while 7.6% of the women--aged 17 and older. In the comparison group menses beginning after 15 years was only at 13.3% of women. In 61.3% of patients with CD was irregular menstrual cycle while in the comparison group such violations were noted in 13.3% (p < 0.001). Prolonged periods of amenorrhea we observed in women with newly diagnosed GC 3 times more likely than the comparison group: 43.9% and 11.4% respectively (p < 0.01). They also had nearly 3 times more likely to occur spontaneous miscarriage: at 46.9% and 14.3% respectively (p < 0.01). The frequency of dead children birth was about the same: 2.3% and 1.9% respectively (p > 0.05). The frequency of reproductive disorders increased with the growth of the severity of MS. In 43% of women after 6-8 months of strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) had disappeared amenorrhea and there were regular menses. Three women of childbearing age, strictly abided the GFD and had a history of repeated spontaneous abortion during the year managed to get pregnant and give birth to healthy full-term baby. CONCLUSIONS: Reproductive disorders in women with celiac disease are significantly more likely than at women with functional bowel disease. One of the reasons of reproductive disorders in patients with CD can be malabsorption of necessary nutrients in the small intestine. The presence of reproductive disorders should be considered as a risk factor for celiac disease, so these women should be screened for celiac disease.
26043918	Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity among Patients Perceiving Gluten-Related Symptoms.	BACKGROUND: Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a recently recognized disorder, characterized by the occurrence of symptoms following gluten ingestion. It is often self-diagnosed by the patient, but should be confirmed by the response to a gluten-free diet, followed by a gluten challenge. Celiac disease (CD) and wheat allergy (WA) must first be ruled out. AIMS: (1) to determine the frequency of visits performed for symptoms self-perceived as gluten-related; (2) to assess in this cohort, the proportion of patients satisfying the diagnostic criteria for NCGS. METHODS: A two-year prospective study including all consecutive patients complaining of gluten-related symptoms. NCGS was diagnosed on the basis of the disappearance of the symptoms within 6 months of a gluten-free diet, followed by their reappearance with the reintroduction of gluten in the diet for 1 month. RESULTS: Three hundred and ninety two patients complaining of gluten-related symptoms were enrolled; 26 of these (6.63%) were affected by CD, 2 (0.51%) by WA and 27 were diagnosed with NCGS (6.88%). The remaining 337 patients (85.96%) did not experience any change of symptoms with a gluten-free diet. The PPV of the gluten-related symptom was found to be 7%. CONCLUSION: Eighty six percent of patients reporting gluten-related symptoms have neither NCGS, nor CD, nor WA. Self-perceived gluten-related symptoms are rarely indicative of the presence of NCGS.
27993525	Nutritional Wheat Amylase-Trypsin Inhibitors Promote Intestinal Inflammation via Activation of Myeloid Cells.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Wheat amylase-trypsin inhibitors (ATIs) are nutritional activators of innate immunity, via activation of the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on myeloid cells. We aimed to characterize the biologic activity of ATIs in various foods and their effect on intestinal inflammation. METHODS: We selected 38 different gluten-containing and gluten-free products, either unprocessed (such as wheat, rye, barley, quinoa, amaranth, soya, lentils, and rice) or processed (such as pizza, pasta, bread, and biscuits). ATIs were extracted and their biological activities determined in TLR4-responsive mouse and human cell lines. Effects of oral ATIs on intestinal inflammation were determined in healthy C57BL/6 mice on a gluten-free or ATI-free diet and in mice given low-level polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid or dextran sodium sulfate to induce colitis. Parameters of innate and adaptive immune activation were determined in duodenum, ileum, colon, and mesenteric lymph nodes. RESULTS: Modern gluten-containing staples had levels of TLR4-activating ATIs that were as much as 100-fold higher than in most gluten-free foods. Processed or baked foods retained ATI bioactivity. Most older wheat variants (such as Emmer or Einkorn) had lower bioactivity than modern (hexaploid) wheat. ATI species CM3 and 0.19 were the most prevalent activators of TLR4 in modern wheat and were highly resistant to intestinal proteolysis. Their ingestion induced modest intestinal myeloid cell infiltration and activation, and release of inflammatory mediators-mostly in the colon, then in the ileum, and then in the duodenum. Dendritic cells became prominently activated in mesenteric lymph nodes. Concentrations of ATIs found in a normal daily gluten-containing diet increased low-level intestinal inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Gluten-containing cereals have by far the highest concentrations of ATIs that activate TLR4. Orally ingested ATIs are largely resistant to proteases and heat, and increase intestinal inflammation by activating gut and mesenteric lymph node myeloid cells.
34009525	Enteropathy-Associated T cell Lymphoma.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma (EATL) is a rare subtype of mature T cell lymphoma. The available literature about this rare type T cell lymphoma is relatively limited. This article provides a summary and review of the available literature addressing this entity in terms of risk factors, pathogenesis, diagnostic, and therapeutic options. RECENT FINDINGS: EATL has two distinct subtypes. Type I EATL, now known as EATL, is closely, but not exclusively linked to celiac disease (CD), and it is primarily a disease of Northern European origin. It accounts for < 5% of peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL). Risk factors for EATL include advanced age, male sex, and most importantly, genetic susceptibility in the form of HLA-DQ2 homozygosity. The pathogenesis of EATL is closely related to celiac disease as it shares common pathogenic features with refractory celiac disease. The gold standard of diagnosis is histological diagnosis. EATL carries an aggressive course and a poor prognosis. Treatment of EATL includes surgery, induction chemotherapy, and consolidation in first complete remission and autologous stem cell transplant. The role of targeted and biologic therapies in newly diagnosed EATL patients along with relapsed, refractory cases is evolving and discussed in this review. EATL is an aggressive peripheral T cell lymphoma with poor overall treatment outcome using currently available therapy options. Clinical trials are considered the best approach for treatment of EATL. Early diagnosis and early referral to specialized centers would be the best way to deal with such patients. Development of new prognostic models and early surgical intervention are warranted. Prevention is where all the efforts should be spent, by counseling patients with CD regarding the importance of adherence to gluten-free diet and development of periodic surveillance programs in celiac disease patients for early detection of pre-lymphoma lesions.
26875096	Bone and Celiac Disease.	More than 50% of untreated patients with celiac disease (CD) have bone loss detected by bone densitometry (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry:DXA). Moreover, patients with CD are more likely to have osteoporosis and fragility fractures, especially of the distal radius. Although still controversial, we recommend DXA screening in all celiac disease patients, particularly in those with symptomatic CD at diagnosis and in those who present risk factors for fracture such as older age, menopausal status, previous fracture history, and familial hip fracture history. Bone microarchitecture, especially the trabecular network, may be deteriorated, explaining the higher fracture risk in these patients. Adequate calcium and vitamin D supplementation are also recommended to optimize bone recovery, especially during the first years of gluten free diet (GFD). If higher fracture risk persists after 1 or 2 years of GFD, specific osteoactive treatment may be necessary to improve bone health.
37381936	Mucin Expression in the Small Bowel of Celiac Disease: A Systematic Review.	BACKGROUND: Mucins, heavily glycosylated glycoproteins, are synthesized by mucosal surfaces and play an important role in healthy and malignant states. Changes in mucin synthesis, expression, and secretion may be a primary event or may be secondary to inflammation and carcinogenesis. OBJECTIVES: To assess current knowledge of mucin expression in the small bowel of celiac disease (CD) patients and to determine possible associations between mucin profile and gluten-free diet. METHODS: Medical literature searches of articles in English were conducted using the terms mucin and celiac. Observational studies were included. Pooled odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. RESULTS: Of 31 articles initially generated by a literature search, 4 observational studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria remained eligible for meta-analysis. These studies included 182 patients and 148 controls from four countries (Finland, Japan, Sweden, United States). Mucin expression was significantly increased in small bowel mucosa of CD patients than in normal small bowel mucosa (odds ratio [OR] 7.974, 95% confidence interval [95%CI] (1.599-39.763), P = 0.011] (random-effect model). Heterogeneity was significant: Q = 35.743, df (Q) = 7, P < 0.0001, I2 = 80.416%. ORs for MUC2 and MUC5AC expression in the small bowel mucosa of untreated CD patients were 8.837, 95%CI 0.222-352.283, P = 0.247 and 21.429, 95%CI 3.883-118.255, P < 0.0001, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of certain mucin genes in the small bowel mucosa of CD patients is increased and may serve as a diagnostic tool and assist in surveillance programs.
37394667	Efficacy of Using Maryland Forceps Versus Electrocoagulation Hooks in RATS Lung Cancer Surgery: A Propensity Score-Matched Study.	BACKGROUND: Here we compare the difference in recent outcomes between the use of Maryland forceps (MF) and electrocoagulation hooks (EH) in robotic-assisted thoracoscopic radical lung cancer resection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyze the clinical data of 247 patients with lung cancer who underwent robotic-assisted thoracoscopic surgery from February 2018 to December 2022. On the basis of the intraoperative use of energy devices, we divided the clinical data into two groups, including 84 cases in the MF group and 163 cases in the EH group, respectively. The patients in the two groups were matched with propensity score matching analysis, and further, the perioperative clinical data of the two groups were compared. RESULTS: Compared with the EH group, patients in the MF group had shorter operative time, lesser intraoperative bleeding, shorter postoperative drainage time, and shorter postoperative hospital stay (P < 0.05). By comparing the intraoperative and postoperative complications in the two groups, it was found that the incidence of intraoperative lymph node fragmentation, the incidence of postoperative celiac disease, and the incidence of postoperative food choking were significantly lower in the MF group than that in the EH group. The increase of CRP, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha levels in the MF group was less than that in the EH group. CONCLUSIONS: The use of MF in robotic-assisted thoracoscopic radical lung cancer surgery is safe and effective, with advantages in lymph node dissection, reduced surgical trauma, and fewer postoperative complications.
38973103	Assessment of autoantibodies associated with intravenous immunoglobulin replacement therapy in children with primary immunodeficiency.	While it is known that immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IgRT) used in the treatment of primary immunodeficiency disorders (PIDs) can lead to the passive transfer of autoantibodies, there is no data indicating that these antibodies can cause clinical symptoms in patients. This study aimed to investigate the presence of autoantibodies and their clinical correlation in patients diagnosed with PIDs receiving IgRT. Paediatric patients who were diagnosed with PIDs, and administered IgRT at our immunology clinic between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2021, were included in the study. The medical records of these patients were retrospectively analysed, and autoantibodies were screened. Autoantibody screening was conducted at least once in 48 cases. Among these cases, 29 cases (60.4%) demonstrated positivity for at least one of the autoantibodies screened in the study. Among these cases, 23 tested positive for anti-TPO, 9 for anti-TG and 2 for both anti-TPO and anti-TG. Only two of these patients were confirmed to have Hashimoto's thyroiditis. In 30 cases, autoantibodies related to Celiac disease (CD) were screened, with at least one being positive in five different cases; CD was not confirmed. The results of our study suggest that passive transfer of autoantibodies to patients with IgRT does not cause any significant clinical findings. In addition, in cases of PID, autoantibodies detected in the blood passed to patients with IgRT can lead to misdiagnosis. Screening for autoantibodies in patients with PID undergoing IgRT may not yield accurate results in terms of detecting autoimmune diseases.
25820446	[Histological diagnosis and complications of celiac disease. Update according to the new S2k guidelines].	Celiac disease is a relatively common immunological systemic disease triggered by the protein gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. Classical symptoms like chronic diarrhea, steatorrhea, weight loss and growth retardation are nowadays relatively uncommon. Diagnostic workup includes serological tests for IgA antibodies against tissue transglutaminase 2 (anti-TG2-IgA) and total IgA and histology of duodenal biopsies. Histomorphological classification should be done according to the modified Marsh-Oberhuber classification. Diagnosis of celiac disease should be based on serological, clinical, and histological findings. The only treatment is a life-long gluten-free diet. Unchanged or recurrent symptoms under gluten-free diet may indicate refractory celiac disease. Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma and adenocarcinomas of the small intestine are known complications of celiac disease. 
27701694	[Celiac disease].	Celiac disease occurs as a result of a T-cell-dependent immune reaction on gluten peptides. It is a complex genetic disorder that is mediated by an unknown number of genes, of which more than 50 have been identified in whole genome association studies. The genetic component helps identify oligosymptomatic or even subclinical celiacs by screening first-degree relatives and patients suffering from other autoimmune diseases. To offer sensitive as well as specific diagnostics for celiac disease (serology and small intestinal histology) some general rules should be followed including performing diagnostics only when patients are on a gluten-containing diet or after an appropriate re-exposition. Established treatment is currently restricted to a gluten-free diet. However, future treatment options might include endopeptidase-mediated inactivation of gluten peptides, stabilization of the epithelial barrier, tissue-transglutaminase inhibition or vaccination.
27941196	Gluten-containing products in the diet of infants in nutritional recommendations - a retrospective view and conclusions for the future.	The discussion on the optimal timing of the introduction of gluten products and their quantity into the diet of infants in order to reduce the risk of the development of undesirable reactions to gluten, including celiac disease, has been going on for years. The aim of this study was to present how the relevant Polish nutritional recommendations in this regard had changed over the last fifty years.
26516737	[Bone and Joint Involvement in Celiac Disease].	Celiac disease (gluten-sensitive enteropathy) is currently regarded as a multisystem autoimmune disorder; its clinical signs and symptoms do not involve merely the gastrointestinal tract but are associated with several other medical specialties, including orthopaedics and traumatology. In orthopaedic and trauma patients, celiac disease should be suspected in the following diagnoses: osteomalacia, premenopausal osteoporosis, post-menopausal osteoporosis more severe than expected and refractory to medication, osteoporosis in men under 55 years of age, recurrent bone fractures in the limbs, large joint arthralgia or arthritis of unclear aetiology, erosive spondyloarthropathy particularly in patients with the history of chronic diarrhoea, anaemia or associated autoimmune disorders (type 1 diabetes mellitus or autoimmune thyreopathy), and in women with secondary amenorrhea or early menopause. The orthopaedist or trauma surgeon should be aware of suspected celiac disease in patients who do not respond adequately to the standard treatment of pain related to the musculoskeletal system, in patients with recurrent fractures of the limb bones and in young patients with suspected secondary osteoporosis. With the use of appropriate screening methods, celiac disease as-yet undiagnosed can be revealed. A long-life gluten-free diet in these patients results in the alleviation of metabolic osteopathy and joint and muscle problems, in reduced requirements of analgesic and antiphlogistic drugs as well as in reduced risks of fracture.
24552675	Alteration of tight junction gene expression in celiac disease.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to characterize the deregulation of epithelial tight junction genes and investigate its reversibility on removal of dietary gluten in small intestinal mucosa in celiac disease (CD). METHODS: The expression levels of 23 genes related to tight junctions were studied in biopsies from 16 patients with active CD and compared with biopsies from the same patients taken after 2 years on gluten-free diet (GFD) and with 16 non-CD controls. RESULTS: Nine genes showed altered expression levels in patients with active disease (CLDN2, PARD6A, ZAK, SYMPK, MYH14, and ACTB were upregulated, whereas MAGI1, TJP1, and PPP2R3A were downregulated). Alterations were reversible after 2 years on treatment, except for PPP2R3A, implicated in the negative control of cell growth and division. At the biological network level, important dysfunctions in several processes within the pathway were observed, including intestinal permeability, apicobasal polarity, and cell proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Our work confirms the involvement of tight junction genes related to permeability, polarity, and cell proliferation in the epithelial destruction observed in CD. Coexpression patterns of several genes support the idea of a common regulatory mechanism that seems to be altered in active CD. In general, GFD normalization confirms the reversibility of the process, except for the constitutive downregulation of PPP2R3A suggestive of a genetic implication. Further studies in proteins and cells or tissues are necessary to confirm these findings.
30592872	[Development and evaluation of efficiency of inclusion of specialized meat semi-finished products in the diet of children and teenager with celiac disease].	The purpose of the study is to evaluate the possibility and effectiveness of inclusion of specialized semi-finished meat products in the gluten-free diet of children and adolescents with celiac disease. In the article the authors present the recipe for a new type of specialized meat semi-finished products - gluten-free dumplings. As ingredients of semi-finished products rice flour, amaranth flour, flax flour, chickpea flour, corn starch, curd whey, beef, poultry, goose fat and other auxiliary ingredients were used. The results of studies of the main quality indicators (nutritional value) of a new specialized meat semi-finished product have been presented. The results of studies of the protein component of the product, related both to protein digestibility (evaluated in vitro) and to the degree of its amino acid balance, confirmed its high biological value. To substantiate the effectiveness of the inclusion of gluten-free dumplings in the diet of patients with celiac disease, clinical approbation has been carried out. In an open, prospective, nonrandomized study, 20 children with celiac disease consumed gluten-free diet for 6 months and more were included. Based on the results of the clinical and serological survey, a group of 13 children aged 7 to 15 years (mean age 9.4+-0.8 years), strictly adherent to a gluten-free diet, was identified. Children received a portion of the cooked product (15-20 dumplings, which amounted to 180-250 g per day) within 1 month. Against the background of strict adherence to the gluten-free diet and a monthly course of dumplings intake, all children and adolescents were noted to have no elevation, and in some cases, a decrease in the level of specific autoantibodies, which is a proof of the absolute safety of the product for patients. The level of anti-tTG IgA decreased from 1.3 (0.5, 2.3) to 0.6 (0.1, 1.3) U/ml (p<0.05), a decrease in the level of anti-DPG IgA from 4.0 (1.1, 5.0) to 1.8 (1.3, 4.1) U/ml (p<0, 05) was also detected. Patients showed a tendency to improve anthropometric indices in the form of a decrease in the lag in the body mass from -0.22+-0.3sigma to 0.01+-0.3sigma and BMI from -0.64+-0.4sigma to -0.52+-0.4sigma (p>0.05). The hematological indices remained unchanged, while iron blood serum indexes on the background of the product intake improved: ferritin concentration increased from 27.4+-3.6 to 37.7+-6.0 mug/l (p<0.05), latent iron binding capacity decreased by 9.6% (p<0.05); total iron binding capacity tended to decrease by 6.4% (p=0.055) with a slight increase in iron transferrin saturation. The data obtained testify a positive effect of a new product intake on quality of a life and improvement of the general condition of patients that gives the basis to recommend the developed dumplings for inclusion in diets of patients with celiac disease.
28753927	Self-Reported Non-Celiac Wheat Sensitivity in High School Students: Demographic and Clinical Characteristics.	BACKGROUND: Non-Celiac Wheat Sensitivity (NCWS) has recently been included among the gluten-related disorders. As no biomarkers of this disease exist, its frequency has been estimated based on self-reported symptoms, but to date no data are available about self-reported NCWS in teenagers. AIM: To explore the prevalence of self-reported NCWS in a group of high school students and to study their demographic and clinical characteristics. METHODS: The study was performed between April 2015 and January 2016 in two high schools of a coastal town in the south of Sicily (Italy). A total of 555 students (mean age 17 years, 191 male, 364 female) completed a modified validated questionnaire for self-reported NCWS. The subjects who self-reported NCWS were then compared with all the others. RESULTS: Seven individuals (1.26%) had an established diagnosis of CD. The prevalence of self-reported NCWS was 12.2%, and 2.9% were following a gluten-free diet (GFD). Only 15 out of 68 (23%) NCWS self-reporters had consulted a doctor for this problem and only nine (14%) had undergone serological tests for celiac disease. The NCWS self-reporters very often had IBS symptoms (44%). CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported NCWS was found to be common in teenagers, with a frequency of 12.2%; the frequency of GFD use was 2.9%, which was much higher than the percentage of known CD in the same population (1.26%). A greater awareness of the possible implications on the part of the subjects involved, and a more thorough medical approach to the study of self-reported wheat-induced symptoms are required.
25051511	Celiac Disease: Ten Things That Every Gastroenterologist Should Know.	There are 10 things that all gastroenterologists should know about celiac disease (CD). (1) The immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase is the single best serologic test to use for the detection of CD. (2) CD can be recognized endoscopically, and water immersion enhances villi detection, although a normal endoscopic appearance does not preclude the diagnosis. (3) It is recommended that 4 biopsies be taken from the second part of the duodenum and 2 bulb biopsies be taken at the 9 o'clock and 12 o'clock positions to maximize the sensitivity for histologic confirmation of CD. (4) Consider serologic testing of first-degree relatives, patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, Down's, Turner's, and Williams' syndromes, as well as those with premature osteoporosis, iron deficiency, abnormal liver biochemistries, and other manifestations of CD. (5) Patients already on a prolonged gluten-free diet (GFD) should be tested for the presence of HLA DQ2 or DQ8, thereby avoiding the need for further evaluation of CD in non-allelic carriers. (6) The basic treatment of CD is a strict, lifelong GFD, enabled by an expert dietitian. (7) Newly diagnosed adults with CD should be assessed for micronutrient deficiencies (iron, B12, folate, zinc, copper), fat soluble vitamin deficiencies (vitamin D), and bone densitometry. (8) All patients diagnosed with CD should have clinical follow-up to ensure response and adherence to a GFD. (9) In those with persistent or relapsing symptoms, the robustness of the original diagnosis should be reviewed, gluten exposure sought, and a systematic evaluation for alternative and associated diseases performed. (10) Evaluate those with refractory disease for malignant transformation. 
32083821	[The role of nutritional factors and food allergy in the development of psoriasis].	Psoriasis is a chronic relapsing disease that affects about 2% of the world's population and leads to medical and social losses. There is evidence of the effect of nutritional factors on the course of psoriasis in modern literature. The aim of the research was to analyze modern domestic and foreign literature on the role of nutritional factors, food allergies and the state of the gastrointestinal tract in the etiopathogenesis of psoriasis Material and methods. The electronic resources were used in preparing the article: the PubMed/MEDLINE portal, "Scientific Electronic Library eLIBRARY.RU". The following filters and keywords were requested: psoriasis and nutrition, food allergies and psoriasis, gastrointestinal manifestations and psoriasis, diet and psoriasis, obesity and psoriasis. Results and discussion. The role of nutrition as a predictor of the development of psoriatic skin rashes and exacerbation of the disease has been discussed. The mechanisms of the positive influence of the correction of metabolic disorders on skin processes in patients with psoriasis have been analyzed. It has been noted that further studies are needed to study the effectiveness of a lowcalorie diet for psoriasis treatment. Particular attention has been paid to the role of food allergy and pathology of the gastrointestinal tract in the etiopathogenesis of psoriatic disease. It is noted that in patients with psoriasis, structural and functional disorders in the gastrointestinal tract are observed, which lead to metabolic changes, endotoxinemia and autosensitization of the body. The role of intolerance to certain foods in the development of psoriasis has been discussed. Most of the available data indicate a high incidence of celiac disease and gluten intolerance in patients with psoriasis, however, information about the effectiveness of a gluten-free diet is controversial. Attention is drawn to the "non-celiac gluten sensitivity" associated with psoriasis, which represents a syndrome of neither allergic nor autoimmune genesis, which is manifested by gluten intolerance and characterized by symptoms similar to celiac disease. An increase in the frequency of occurrence of a high concentration of specific IgE to potato and carrot allergens in patients with psoriasis is noted, which most likely reflects cross-reactions with pollen allergens. An interesting hypothesis is the discussion of a lesion of the gastrointestinal tract in the presence of food allergies in patients with psoriasis, which may be a reflection of the systemic dermatogastrointestinal process and manifest psoriatic rashes on the skin. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory effect associated with adhering to the Mediterranean diet for psoriasis is described in detail. Conclusion. The data presented allow us to consider the role of nutrition in the etiopathogenesis of psoriasis as significant, both from the point of view of the influence of nutritional factors and food allergens, that must be taken into account when prescribing therapeutic nutrition and elimination diet in combination with standard systemic therapy.
31351508	Adalimumab - Safe and Effective Therapy for an Adolescent Patient with Severe Psoriasis and Immune Thrombocytopenia.	Psoriasis has been linked to several comorbidities, including metabolic syndrome, atopy, and celiac disease. However, the association between immune thrombocytopenia and psoriasis has rarely been described. We report the case of an adolescent with severe psoriasis and concomitant immune thrombocytopenia who obtained remission during treatment with adalimumab. Increased concentration of tumor necrosis factor-alpha seems to be a pathogenic linkage and therapeutic target for both diseases.

34984588	Family ties: the impact of celiac disease on children and caregivers.	PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of celiac disease (CD) and the gluten-free diet (GFD) on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in children with CD in the United States using validated measures. We hypothesize that CD negatively impacts the child and caregivers' HRQoL. METHODS: Participants included children with a confirmed diagnosis of CD and their caregivers (n = 246) seen in a CD multidisciplinary clinic. Caregivers completed the Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL) parent-proxy scale to report on their child's HRQoL and the Family Impact Module (FIM), which assesses the impact of caring for a child with a chronic illness. Their children completed the age-appropriate PedsQL. PedsQL and FIM results were compared to published data for children with gastroenterological conditions and a healthy cohort using non-parametric tests. RESULTS: Children with CD reported significantly lower HRQoL than reports from healthy controls across all PedsQL domains (P < 0.001, Cohen d = 0.8), and lower compared to children with other organic gastrointestinal conditions in Social Functioning (P < 0.001, Cohen d = 0.5) and overall Psychosocial Functioning (P < 0.001, Cohen d = 0.3) domains. Results from the caregiver's report on their own HRQoL were significantly worse than that reported by historical controls in the domains of Communication (P < 0.001, Cohen d = 0.3) and Worry (P < 0.001, Cohen d = 0.8), yet similar on all other domains. CONCLUSIONS: In our population, CD is associated with low HRQoL scores for both children and their caregivers. Screening children and families for HRQoL can identify patients and families in need of additional support in this higher-risk population.
30958273	Symptoms Prompting Interest in Celiac Disease and the Gluten-Free Diet: Analysis of Internet Search Term Data.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease, a common immune-based disease triggered by gluten, has diverse clinical manifestations, and the relative distribution of symptoms leading to diagnosis has not been well characterized in the population. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to use search engine data to identify a set of symptoms and conditions that would identify individuals at elevated likelihood of a subsequent celiac disease diagnosis. We also measured the relative prominence of these search terms before versus after a search related to celiac disease. METHODS: We extracted English-language queries submitted to the Bing search engine in the United States and identified those who submitted a new celiac-related query during a 1-month period, without any celiac-related queries in the preceding 9 months. We compared the ratio between the number of times that each symptom or condition was asked in the 14 days preceding the first celiac-related query of each person and the number of searches for that same symptom or condition in the 14 days after the celiac-related query. RESULTS: We identified 90,142 users who made a celiac-related query, of whom 6528 (7%) exhibited sustained interest, defined as making a query on more than 1 day. Though a variety of symptoms and associated conditions were also queried before a celiac-related query, the maximum area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.53. The symptom most likely to be queried more before than after a celiac-related query was diarrhea (query ratio [QR] 1.28). Extraintestinal symptoms queried before a celiac disease query included headache (QR 1.26), anxiety (QR 1.10), depression (QR 1.03), and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (QR 1.64). CONCLUSIONS: We found an increase in antecedent searches for symptoms known to be associated with celiac disease, a rise in searches for depression and anxiety, and an increase in symptoms that are associated with celiac disease but may not be reported to health care providers. The protean clinical manifestations of celiac disease are reflected in the diffuse nature of antecedent internet queries of those interested in celiac disease, underscoring the challenge of effective case-finding strategies.
20967850	Benefit of gluten-free diet in idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis in association with celiac disease.	Lane-Hamilton syndrome refers to the uncommon co-occurrence of idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis and celiac disease (CD). Three children aged between 7 and 14 years with IPH were detected to have co-existing non-diarrheal CD. Institution of gluten-free diet in each of the three children resulted in amelioration of the pulmonary symptoms along with improvement of anthropometric parameters and hemoglobin over a short-term follow-up period of 8-17 months. Inhaled/oral steroids and immunosuppressants could be weaned off after dietary exclusion therapy in each of the three children. Gluten free diet should be instituted in all patients diagnosed with Lane-Hamilton syndrome. It ameliorates both the pulmonary as well as the intestinal symptoms although the precise mechanism of the pulmonary response is as yet unclear.
27446824	Pure Oats as Part of the Canadian Gluten-Free Diet in Celiac Disease: The Need to Revisit the Issue.	The question about recommending pure, noncontaminated oats as part of the gluten-free diet of patients with celiac disease remains controversial. This might be due to gluten cross contamination and to the possible immunogenicity of some oat cultivars. In view of this controversy, a review of the scientific literature was conducted to highlight the latest findings published between 2008 and 2014 to examine the current knowledge on oats safety and celiac disease in Europe and North America. Results showed that regular oats consumed in Canada are largely contaminated. Overall, the consumption of pure oats has been generally considered to be safe for adults and children. However, it appears that some oat cultivars may trigger an immune response in sensitive individuals. Therefore, further long-term studies on the impact of consumption of oats identifying the cultivar(s) constitute an important step forward for drawing final recommendations. Furthermore, a closer and more accurate monitoring of the dietary intake of noncontaminated oats would be paramount to better determine what its actual contribution in the gluten-free diet of adults and children with celiac disease are in order to draw sound recommendations on the safety of pure oats as part of the gluten-free diet.

27447366	Impaired Bone Microarchitecture Improves After One Year On Gluten-Free Diet: A Prospective Longitudinal HRpQCT Study in Women With Celiac Disease.	We have recently identified a significant deterioration of bone microarchitecture in premenopausal women with newly diagnosed celiac disease (CD) using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HRpQCT). The aim of this work was to assess changes in bone microarchitecture after 1 year on a gluten-free diet (GFD) in a cohort of premenopausal women. We prospectively enrolled 31 consecutive females at diagnosis of CD; 26 of them were reassessed 1 year after GFD. They all underwent HRpQCT scans of distal radius and tibia, areal BMD by DXA, and biochemical tests (bone-specific parameters and CD serology) at both time points. Secondary, we compared 1-year results with those of a control group of healthy premenopausal women of similar age and BMI in order to assess whether the microarchitectural parameters of treated CD patients had reached the values expected for their age. Compared with baseline, the trabecular compartment in the distal radius and tibia improved significantly (trabecular density, trabecular/bone volume fraction [BV/TV] [p < 0.0001], and trabecular thickness [p = 0.0004]). Trabecular number remained stable in both regions. Cortical density increased only in the tibia (p = 0.0004). Cortical thickness decreased significantly in both sites (radius: p = 0.03; tibia: p = 0.05). DXA increased in all regions (lumbar spine [LS], p = 0.01; femoral neck [FN], p = 0.009; ultradistal [UD] radius, p = 0.001). Most parameters continued to be significantly lower than those of healthy controls. This prospective HRpQCT study showed that most trabecular parameters altered at CD diagnosis improved significantly by specific treatment (GFD) and calcium and vitamin D supplementation. However, there were still significant differences with a control group of women of similar age and BMI. In the prospective follow-up of this group of patients we expect to be able to assess whether bone microarchitecture attains levels expected for their age.   2016 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

33675212	Significant improvement in bone mineral density in pediatric celiac disease: even at six months with gluten-free diet.	OBJECTIVES: Patients with celiac disease had significantly decreased bone mineral density even in patients with no gastrointestinal symptoms. Only few bone studies are available on pediatric patients with celiac disease. METHODS: Forty-six patients underwent measurement of areal bone mineral density (aBMD) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) before the initiation of gluten-free diet. Anthropometric, laboratory and DXA measurements at baseline and at sixth month of the treatment were compared. RESULTS: The frequency of low aBMD Z-score (<=-1 SDS) in both or any site was found to be 78.2% in this study. Of 16 patients with an aBMD Z-score of <-2 SDS five gained more than 1 SDS, and one gained more than 2 SDS. Nine of 20 patients with an aBMD Z-score of <-1 SDS completely normalized. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study showed that low BMD is common in children with celiac disease at the time of diagnosis and could improve in a short period of six months with a strict gluten-free diet and adequate supplementation of calcium and vitamin D.
20818442	Auto-SCT in refractory celiac disease type II patients unresponsive to cladribine therapy.	Autologous hematopoietic SCT (auto-SCT) has been effective therapy for refractory disease, in both malignancies and severe autoimmune diseases. It seems feasible and safe for refractory celiac disease (RCD) type II, although long-term results have not been evaluated yet. With current therapies, progression into enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL) occurs in 60-80% patients, with a high mortality rate. Therefore, it is important to evaluate new treatment strategies. Between March 2004 and February 2010, 18 RCD II patients were evaluated for auto-SCT preceded by conditioning with fludarabine and melphalan, as a consequence of unresponsiveness to cladribine therapy. Adverse events, survival rate, EATL development and change in clinical, histological and immunological course were monitored. Thirteen patients were transplanted successfully and followed up for >2 years, 4-year survival rate was 66%. Only one patient died because of transplant-related complications. The majority of patients showed an impressive clinical improvement and five a complete histological remission. In five patients, auto-SCT could not be performed; they all died with a median survival of 5.5 months. EATL was observed in one transplanted patient, only after 4 years of follow-up. Auto-SCT after conditioning with high-dose chemotherapy in RCD II patients unresponsive to cladribine therapy is feasible and seems promising.
29469935	Are children with chronic illnesses requiring dietary therapy at risk for disordered eating or eating disorders? A systematic review.	OBJECTIVE: Pediatric chronic illnesses (CI) can affect a child's mental health. Chronic illnesses with treatment regimens that specify a therapeutic diet may place the child at increased risk for disordered eating and specific eating disorders (ED). The aim of this review is to examine the relation between diet-treated CI and disordered eating and to determine the order of onset to infer directionality. Diet-treated CI is hypothesized to precede and to be associated with disordered eating. METHOD: A comprehensive search of empirical articles that examine the relation between diet-treated CI (diabetes, cystic fibrosis, celiac disease, gastrointestinal disorders, and inflammatory bowel diseases) and disordered eating was conducted in Medline and PsycINFO using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A table of the sample's characteristics, ED measures, major pertinent findings, and the onset of CI in relation to ED were provided. RESULTS: Diet-treated CI was associated with disordered eating and ED. Diet-treated CI had onset prior to disordered eating in most studies, except for inflammatory bowel diseases. Disordered eating and unhealthy weight management practices put children at risk for poor medical outcomes. DISCUSSION: Interventions for diet-treated CI require a focus on diet and weight, but may increase the risk for disordered eating. Future research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms that transform standard treatment practices into pathological eating, including characteristics and behaviors of the child, parents/care providers, family, and treatment providers.
23676548	Is dietitian use associated with celiac disease outcomes?	A gluten-free diet (GFD) is the treatment for celiac disease (CD), but due to its complexity, dietitian referral is uniformly recommended. We surveyed patients with CD to determine if dietitian use is associated with quality of life, symptom severity, or GFD adherence. The survey utilized three validated CD-specific instruments: the CD quality of life (CD-QOL), CD symptom index (CSI) and CD adherence test (CDAT). Four hundred and thirteen patients with biopsy-proven CD were eligible for inclusion. The majority (77%) were female and mean BMI was 24.1. Over three-quarters of patients (326, 79%) had seen a dietitian, however, 161 (39%) had seen a dietitian only once. Age, sex, and education level were not associated with dietitian use; nor was BMI (24.6 vs. 24.0, p = 0.45). On multivariate analysis, adjusting for age gender, education, duration of disease, and body mass index, dietitian use was not associated with CD-QOL, CSI, or CDAT scores. Our survey did not show an association between dietitian use and symptom severity, adherence, or quality of life. Delay in diagnosis was associated with poorer outcomes. This is a preliminary study with several limitations, and further prospective analysis is needed to evaluate the benefits and cost-effectiveness of dietitian-referral in the care of celiac disease patients.
21875423	Celiac disease and fulminant T lymphoma detected too late in a 35-year-old female patient: case report.	UNLABELLED: Celiac disease is the most common chronic gastroenterological autoimmune disease characterized by gluten intolerance. The diagnosis of celiac disease and enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma is often made when it is too late.Case report describes a 35-year-old female patient managed for one year under the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease and admitted to our hospital for exacerbation of the underlying disease. However, inflammatory bowel disease was ruled out by diagnostic work-up, while the clinical picture and the findings obtained raised suspicion of lymphoma. The patient's condition was additionally complicated by fulminant course of the disease and ileus. CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of the disease, and follow up of family members are crucial to prevent intestinal lymphoma development.
22129799	The relationship between quality of life and coping strategies of adults with celiac disease adhering to a gluten-free diet.	In the United States, the prevalence of celiac disease has increased from 1 in 4,600 persons to 1 in 133 persons during the past 10 years. Although celiac disease can be managed by strict adherence to a gluten-free diet, dietary management can be challenging. A descriptive, correlational design was used to examine factors and perceived causes that interfere with adherence to a gluten-free diet, identify coping strategies, and examine the relationship between coping strategies and quality of life in 156 adults with a diagnosis of celiac disease. The Psychological General Well-Being Index and the Brief COPE were used to measure the major variables. Results indicated that problems outside the home interfere with dietary adherence. A moderate negative significant relationship (r [154] = -.46, p < .01) was found between quality of life and stress, with 54% of participants reporting a minimal amount of stress. Emotion-focused coping was found to have a significant negative effect on quality of life (H[18] = 56.67, p < .001). Implications for future research should include investigation of cognitive behavioral interventions to decrease the negative effects of stress on quality of life for adults with celiac disease adhering to a gluten-free diet.
28045773	The Association Between Celiac Disease and Eosinophilic Esophagitis: Mayo Experience and Meta-analysis of the Literature.	BACKGROUND: The association between celiac disease (CD) and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) has been the focus of multiple studies with variable results. Both diseases are immune mediated, and dietary triggers play a role in their pathogenesis. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to analyze the risk of EoE in children with CD, assess the magnitude of association between CD and EoE in children, and report the characteristics and outcomes of children with both conditions. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of the Mayo Clinic Electronic medical records between January 1, 1998 and December 31, 2015. Systematic review and meta-analysis of multiple databases was conducted to include studies reporting on the same association. Random-effects model was used to report pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: In this cohort study, of 10,201 children who underwent at least 1 endoscopy, 595 had EoE, and 546 had CD. The risk of having EoE was not increased in children with CD compared to those without CD (OR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.154-0.545). Nine of 10 children improved with gluten-free diet, topical glucocorticosteroid, and/or elimination diet. One child lost to follow-up.Meta-analysis of 5 studies showed similar results (OR, 0.525; 95% CI, 0.364-0.797). A total of 45 cases in the literature had both CD and EoE (mean age, 10 years; 64% boys; majority presenting with abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea). CONCLUSIONS: Based on our cohort and the observational data, the diagnosis of CD in children is not associated with increased risk of EoE.
23556514	Rapid anti-transglutaminase assay and patient interview for monitoring dietary compliance in celiac disease.	OBJECTIVE: The anti-transglutaminase antibodies (anti-tTG) play an important role in monitoring the celiacs' gluten-free diet (GFD). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The authors propose to use the rapid IgA anti-tTG assay based on a whole blood drop to evaluate the compliance to GFD at the clinical ambulatory setting. The rapid test results were compared with those of the conventional ELISA assay and with dietary compliance reported by patients' interview. CONCLUSIONS: The authors showed that anti-tTG rapid test is reliable and easy to perform in the ambulatory setting to evaluate dietary compliance. Moreover, they proved that celiacs' interview is more sensitive than serology in identifying patients who transgress.
21239079	Potential celiac disease in type 1 diabetes: a multicenter study.	AIMS: To describe the prevalence of potential celiac disease (pot-CD) in young patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and characterize their clinical features. METHODS: This cross-sectional multicenter study involved 8717 T1DM patients from 31 Italian centers. Information was collected on the total number of T1DM patients, CD patients and pot-CD patients. The following data were collected on pot-CD patients: gender, age at T1DM diagnosis, age at the first CD serological positivity, presence of CD-related symptoms, presence of other autoimmune disorders and treatment with gluten free diet (GFD). One thousand-three-hundred-sixty-one patients who were positive for CD serology were the control group. RESULTS: CD serological positivity was found in 7.2% T1DM patients. Prevalence of pot-CD was 12.2% (n=77) among CD positive patients: symptoms were present in 12/77; a third autoimmune disorder was found in 15 patients. Prevalence of pot-CD in the control population was 8.4% (n=114; p=0.005). No difference was found with regard to clinical features. Only few symptomatic patients were on GFD both in T1DM and control patients. CONCLUSIONS: A higher prevalence of pot-CD was found in T1DM patients, that may be ascribed to the routine screening, although the influence of genetic factors cannot be excluded.
24481131	Cereal-based gluten-free food: how to reconcile nutritional and technological properties of wheat proteins with safety for celiac disease patients.	The gluten-free diet is, to date, the only efficacious treatment for patients with Celiac Disease. In recent years, the impressive rise of Celiac Disease incidence, dramatically prompted changes in the dietary habit of an increasingly large population, with a rise in demand of gluten-free products. The formulation of gluten-free bakery products presents a formidable challenge to cereal technologists. As wheat gluten contributes to the formation of a strong protein network, that confers visco-elasticity to the dough and allows the wheat flour to be processed into a wide range of products, the preparation of cereal-based gluten-free products is a somehow difficult process. This review focuses on nutritional and technological quality of products made with gluten-free cereals available on the market. The possibility of using flour from naturally low toxic ancient wheat species or detoxified wheat for the diet of celiacs is also discussed.
33321006	Celiac disease and COVID-19 pandemic: should we worry?	BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic especially worries people with chronic diseases the entire world. In this study, the frequency, and clinical course of COVID-19 infection in patients with Celiac disease (CD) were investigated. CD patients' adherence to purchasing gluten free products (GFPs), the strict diet, and how patients' anxiety affects CD symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak were also examined. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A detailed questionnaire was administered by telephone and emailed to the CD patients to determine the status of these patients in obtaining GFPs, and dietary compliance during the COVID-19 pandemic. State and trait anxiety levels of patients were evaluated using the State-trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) scale. Additionally, whether patients with CD were diagnosed with COVID-19, and if diagnosed, their clinical course of the disease were investigated. RESULTS: One hundred and one patients were included in the study. The total number of patients who could obtain GFPs decreased significantly in the pandemic than before the pandemic. The patients' state anxiety index was 40.7+-7.9, and the trait anxiety index was 44.5+-8.5, and all patients were evaluated as mildly anxious. During the pandemic, two female patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: CD patients did not have any additional risk compared to other individuals in terms of becoming infected with COVID-19 for patients under gluten free diet, and these patients will have a similar clinical course as individuals without CD.
27498299	Gluten Intolerance and Neurodevelopmental Disorders: Is Nitric Oxide the Common Biomarker Linking These Conditions?	Cruchet et al. attempt to tease out the myths and facts surrounding the growing popularity of certain dietary approaches in the management of neurodevelopmental disorders, like attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). The authors identify a particular exclusionary-type approach that seeks to eliminate dietary gluten. Although the relationship between celiac disease (CD) and ADHD/ASD is not well established, a repeated clinical feature noted in CD is the elevated levels of nitric oxide in serum and urine. Elevated oxidative stress has also been observed in neurodevelopmental conditions, and the author of this correspondence has been the first to propose that chronic, environmental exposure to the air pollutant, nitrous oxide may contribute to these oxidative stress profiles through neural cholinergic perturbation. Therefore, the purpose of this correspondence is to highlight this biochemical connection between these conditions so as to identify the clinical populations who may realize the greatest benefit of these dietary approaches, while minimizing any potential risk of nutrient deficiencies.
34978602	Newly Diagnosed Celiac Disease and Bone Health in Young Adults: A Systematic Literature Review.	Celiac disease (CD), a gluten-induced autoimmune disease, is associated with low bone mineral density (BMD) among children. Unfortunately, it is often diagnosed in adulthood, which may lead to an increased risk of fragile bones. The aim of this systematic review was to report on BMD status among young adults newly diagnosed with CD, and to examine the effect of a gluten-free diet (GFD), nutritional supplements, such as vitamin D, or antiresorptive medications on BMD recovery. Databases searched were Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library up to July 2nd, 2020. Both observational studies and clinical trials were considered, if patients were newly diagnosed and between 20 and 35 years of age and reported on BMD. We critically appraised the identified studies using ROBINS-I and summarized the findings narratively. Out of 3991 references, we identified 3 eligible studies: one cross-sectional study and two longitudinal studies. In total, 188 patients were included, and the study population consisted primarily of women with an age range between 29 and 37 years old. Compared to healthy controls, our target population had lower BMD. Moreover, a strict GFD may increase BMD during a follow-up period of up to 5 years. Newly diagnosed CD patients aged 20-35 years are at risk of lower BMD. Therefore, it may be crucial to assess BMD at time of diagnosis in young women. Whether the results can be extrapolated to young men is unknown. While strict GFD may improve BMD over time, there is a lack of robust evidence to demonstrate that nutritional supplements or antiresorptive agents are beneficial in the prevention of fragile bones in this age group.
36653177	Diet quality, ultra-processed food consumption, and quality of life in a cross-sectional cohort of adults and teens with celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease (CeD), a common autoimmune condition, requires strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). Adherence to the GFD has been associated with quality of life (QOL). However, there may be other diet-related concerns, such as overall diet patterns, including diet quality or ultra-processed food (UPF) consumption, possibly associated with QOL among people with CeD following a GFD that have not been examined. METHODS: Diet quality was determined based on 24-h diet recalls of a cross-sectional prospectively recruited sample of 80 participants (50 adults and 30 teens) with biopsy-confirmed CeD ('Study Sample') using the Healthy Eating Index and Alternate Mediterranean Diet score. The amount of UPF consumed was assessed using Nova, a food processing classification system. QOL was measured using Celiac Disease-Specific Quality of Life (CDQOL) and Celiac Disease Pediatric-Specific Quality of Life (CDPQOL). The Study Sample's diet patterns were compared with National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) groups (25 adults reporting prior CeD and GFD; 51 adults with new CeD and no GFD; 15,777 adults and 2296 teens without CeD). The relationship of the Study Sample's diet patterns with CDQOL/CDPQOL was assessed using analysis of covariance. RESULTS: The Study Sample's diet patterns were suboptimal but generally favourable compared with all NHANES groups. Compared to Study Adults with the highest tertile of UPF, those with the lowest tertile had significantly higher CDQOL (mean: 67.6 vs. 78.3, p < 0.001). Compared to Study Teens with the lowest tertile of AMED, those with the highest tertile had significantly higher CDPQOL (mean: 67.0 vs. 79.9, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Maintaining high diet quality and minimising UPF may be important for CeD-specific QOL among individuals with CeD maintaining a GFD.
22060617	Bio-physical characteristics of gastrointestinal mucosa of celiac patients: comparison with control subjects and effect of gluten free diet-.	BACKGROUND: Intestinal mucosa is leaky in celiac disease (CD), and this alteration may involve changes in hydrophobicity of the mucus surface barrier in addition to alteration of the epithelial barrier. The aims of our study were i) to compare duodenal hydrophobicity as an index of mucus barrier integrity in CD patients studied before (n = 38) and during gluten- free diet (GFD, n = 68), and in control subjects (n = 90), and ii) to check for regional differences of hydrophobicity in the gastro-intestinal tract. METHODS: Hydrophobicity was assessed by measurement of contact angle (CA) (Rame Hart 100/10 goniometer) generated by a drop of water placed on intestinal mucosal biopsies. RESULTS: CA (mean +- SD) of distal duodenum was significantly lower in CD patients (56  +- 10 )) than in control subjects (69  +- 9 , p < 0.0001), and persisted abnormal in patients studied during gluten free diet (56  +- 9 ; p < 0.005). CA was significantly higher (62  +- 9 ) in histologically normal duodenal biopsies than in biopsies with Marsh 1-2 (58  +- 10 ; p < 0.02) and Marsh 3 lesions (57  +- 10 ; p < 0.02) in pooled results of all patients and controls studied. The order of hydrofobicity along the gastrointestinal tract in control subjects follows the pattern: gastric antrum > corpus > rectum > duodenum > oesophagus > ileum. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the hydrophobicity of duodenal mucous layer is reduced in CD patients, and that the resulting decreased capacity to repel luminal contents may contribute to the increased intestinal permeability of CD. This alteration mirrors the severity of the mucosal lesions and is not completely reverted by gluten-free diet. Intestinal hydrophobicity exhibits regional differences in the human intestinal tract.
22782615	Pulmonary hemosiderosis associated with celiac disease: improvement after a gluten-free diet.	
25075625	A rare association of celiac disease and aplastic anemia: case report of a child and review of literature.	An association between severe aplastic anemia and other autoimmune diseases is rare and has been described in adults for eosinophilic fasciitis, thymomas, systemic lupus erythematosus, and thyroid disorders. Herein we report a patient with celiac disease who was not strictly following a gluten-free diet and presented with progressive pallor, fever, and weakness of 1 month's duration. On investigation, he had pancytopenia, which on subsequent evaluation revealed aplastic anemia. An association between aplastic anemia and celiac disease has rarely been reported. To the best of author's knowledge, only 1 pediatric case of celiac disease associated with aplastic anemia has been published. This is the second report to suggest such an association in children.
30954342	Adults following a gluten-free diet report little dietary guidance in a pilot survey exploring relationships between dietary knowledge, management, and adherence in Nova Scotia, Canada.	The strict nature of a gluten-free diet (GFD) poses a challenge for patient adherence and for clinicians to provide comprehensive client-centered care. Evidence on the relationship between nutrition knowledge, food skills, dietary management, and adherence can guide healthcare professionals counseling patients following this diet. In this explanatory pilot study, a province-wide survey (phase I) with 68 community-dwelling Nova Scotians following a GFD was conducted to investigate relationships between personal, social, and health care factors and dietary adherence using a mixed-methods approach. A sub-sample of 19 survey respondents were interviewed (phase II) to explore contextual experiences related to GFD knowledge, food skills, dietary management, and adherence using a food literacy lens. Here, we report findings from phase I, in which 37 participants with self-reported celiac disease (CD) and 31 participants reporting non-celiac reasons for wheat restriction (NCWR) completed a detailed 41-item online questionnaire. Self-reported data combined for both CD and NCWR respondents showed 76% perceived their health status as good to excellent. Most (62%) reported not receiving GFD advice from a health professional. Respondents with higher frequency of intentional consumption of gluten were more likely to have fewer correct answers to a food label quiz (rho = -0.44; P = .0002). Most participants (75%) made at least one error in identifying gluten-free and gluten-containing foods, which may lead to unintentional gluten consumption and/or unnecessarily restricting safe foods. Findings from this exploratory study suggest patients may lack adequate referrals and support within the health care system and the community, adding to individual challenges of GFD adherence.
28590109	Evaluacion de la oferta de alimentos libres degluten en locales de comida elaborada en la CiudadAutonoma de Buenos Aires.	Celiac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy. The onlyknown treatment consists of a permanent adherence to a strictgluten-free diet, which represents an important challenge forpatients. Objective. To describe the gluten-free processedfood offer in food locals from 3 neighborhoods representativeof high, middle and low economic status in Buenos Aires,Argentina. METHODS: Cross-sectional study. Specially trainedmonitors performed a standardized direct assessment offood locals. Whenever direct observation was not possible,we interviewed the personnel as an indirect assessment. Weclassified dish offer in different categories, and evaluated theprocesses of food elaboration, storage and distribution. RESULTS: We included 112 food locals. Results for neighborhoodsrepresentative of high, middle and low economic status were,respectively: no gluten free dish available in 27.5% (45/62),27.0% (27/37) and 30.8% (9/13), (p = 0.96); adequateelaboration in 17.7%, 13.5% and 7.7%, (p = 0.61); appropriate food storage in 12.9% (8), 13.5% (5) and 7.7%(1); (p = 0.85); adequate distribution in 8.1%, 8.1% and0% (0), (p = 0.56). Conclusion. In 1 out of 4 food localsthere was not even one gluten free dish. In addition, therewas a lack of compliance with safety measures to avoid glutencross-contamination.
35156701	Gluten-free diet - remedy for infertility or dangerous trend?	Association between celiac disease (CD) and infertility has been a point of consideration for many years. There are lots of studies which present contradictory results. It is accepted that women with unexplained infertility have three times higher risk of CD compared to the healthy women. This finding leads to the conclusion that a gluten-free diet (GFD), as the only effective method of treatment CD, is important to improve fertility. It is observed that women diagnosed with CD and treated by GFD, have positive pregnancy outcomes including better effects of assisted reproductive technology (ART). Excluding gluten from diet by women without CD diagnosis could bring adverse outcomes, because the risk of malnutrition if diet is unbalanced. On the other hand, some research show that not only GFD but CD is related to malnutrition which could be the cause of problems with getting pregnant or with termination of pregnancy. Regarding CD influence on women's reproductive system, it is not only connected with unexplained infertility and adverse pregnancy outcomes, but also with delayed menarche, early menopause and decrease of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH). What is more, non-celiac wheat sensitivity affects the reproductive system by increasing risk of menstrual disorders too. The main aim of this paper is presenting scientific facts about the link between gluten elimination and fertility. It is very important to provide patients with reliable fact-checked information in the context of their symptoms.
35208504	Expression of Selected Genes and Circulating microRNAs in Patients with Celiac Disease.	Background and Objectives: Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy with characteristic intestinal alterations. CD occurs as a chronic inflammation secondary to gluten sensitivity in genetically susceptible individuals. Until now, the exact cause of the disease has not been established, which is why new studies have appeared that address the involvement of various genes and microRNAs (miRNAs) in the pathogenesis. The aim of the study is to describe the expression of selected genes (Wnt family member 3, WNT3; Wnt family member 11, WNT11; tumor necrosis factor alpha, TNFalpha; mitogen-activated protein kinase 1, MAPK1; AKT serine/threonine kinase 3, AKT3; phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha, PIK3CA; and cyclin D1, CCND1) and miRNAs (miR-192-5p, miR-194-5p, miR-449a and miR-638) in adult patients with CD. Materials and Methods: In total, 15 patients with CD at diagnosis (newly diagnosed), 33 patients on a gluten-free diet (GFD) for at least 1 year and 10 controls (control) were prospectively included. Blood samples were evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results: The results show that TNFalpha, MAPK1 and CCND1 were significantly overexpressed (p = 0.0249, p = 0.0019 and p = 0.0275, respectively) when comparing the newly diagnosed group to the controls. The other genes studied in CD patients were mostly with high values compared to controls, without reaching statistical significance. Among the miRNAs, the closest to a statistically significant value was miR-194-5p when the newly diagnosed group versus control (p = 0.0510) and GFD group versus control (p = 0.0671) were compared. The DIANA and miRNet databases identified significant functional activity for miR-449a and miR-192-5p and an interconnection of miR-194-5p and miR-449a with CCND1. Conclusions: In conclusion, genes and circulating miRNAs require further studies as they could represent important biomarkers in clinical practice.
31149937	Psychological Comorbidities in Childhood Celiac Disease: A Systematic Review.	OBJECTIVES: Mental health disorders comorbid to chronic illness are associated with higher medical care utilization and costs for adults and children. Celiac disease (CD) has a substantial perceived treatment burden and is associated with higher rates of psychopathology in adults. However, establishing the risk for psychological comorbidities in children with CD is still needed. This study aimed to review existing research on mental health concerns in pediatric CD and propose an initial psychosocial research and clinical agenda. METHODS: Databases, including Scopus and PubMed. Additional publications were accessed and reviewed from the references provided by initially identified publications. Two investigators screened studies using predetermined criteria (peer-reviewed, published in English, electronically available, inclusive of child participants, and examining CD). One investigator initially extracted data, with subsequent review by the second investigator. RESULTS: Twenty-six publications met criteria for the current review (16 case-control, 9 observational, and 1 clinical trial). Publications were heterogeneous in symptoms examined, methodology, and population characteristics. Several studies found elevated risk for psychological comorbidities and poorer quality of life in children with CD. However, many studies were limited by small sample sizes and inconsistent or nonvalidated approaches to measuring psychological symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Many existing studies have found increased prevalence of comorbid CD and psychological symptoms or diagnoses. Therefore, screening for psychological symptoms in CD and also screening for CD in psychological clinic populations is needed. We have identified the importance for further study of mechanisms and risk, and identify preliminary priorities for psychosocial research and clinical care in pediatric CD.
35879335	Population-based screening for celiac disease reveals that the majority of patients are undiagnosed and improve on a gluten-free diet.	The impact of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on screen-detected celiac disease (CD) is currently ambiguous. We aimed to identify the population-based prevalence of undiagnosed adult CD and examine the impact of a GFD on screen-detected CD. In total, 12,981 adults participated in a population-based health study in Tromso, Norway. Participants with increased levels of anti-tissue transglutaminase-2 IgA or anti-deamidated gliadin peptide IgG were invited to undergo gastroduodenoscopy with both histological and immunohistochemical examination of small-bowel biopsies. The prevalence of previously diagnosed CD was 0.37%. Additionally, the prevalence of previously undiagnosed CD was 1.10%. Thus, 1.47% of the population had CD, of whom 75% were previously undiagnosed. A GFD resulted in significant improvements in overall gastrointestinal symptoms, diarrhea, and health-related quality of life, with reduced abdominal discomfort (76%) and improved levels of energy (58%). The large majority of patients with adult CD were undiagnosed and benefited from a GFD with reduced gastrointestinal symptoms and improved health-related quality of life. In clinical practice, there should be a low threshold for CD testing even in the absence of abdominal complaints because most adult patients appear to consider their symptoms a part of their normal state and therefore remain untested and undiagnosed.Trial registration: Clinical Trials. Gov Identifier: NCT01695681.
21336447	[Adult celiac disease: endocrinological and nutritional issues].	Celiac disease is an autoimmune enterophaty induced by the ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. Although historically it was thought that it was an infrequent pediatric disease, now it is know that its prevalence is close to 1% in the general population. It is even higher between patients with some endocrine disorders and nutritional deficits. The use of antitransglutaminase and antiendomisium antibodies and the endoscopical duodenal biopsy are the cornerstones for its diagnosis. The introduction of a gluten-free diet will achieve the normalization of the intestinal mucosa. It will avoid the risk of long term complications and an it will achieve an improvement in quality of life. Medical and dietitian long term follow-up will be important to improve the compliance to the treatment.
24949603	Increased IgA glycoprotein-2 specific antibody titres in refractory celiac disease.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: In most cases celiac disease (CD) is successfully treated with a gluten-free diet (GFD). However, some patients become refractory to the GFD. Refractory CD (RCD) patients have an increased risk for developing enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma and early diagnosis is therefore of importance. Currently, RCD diagnosis relies on endoscopy and adequate serological markers are lacking. Antibodies against glycoprotein-2 (GP2A) were described in Crohn's disease (CrD) and active CD but not in ulcerative colitis (UC), suggesting this is a specific marker for small intestinal lesions. METHODS: Sera obtained from patients visiting our outpatient clinic for routine serological tests for diagnosis and/or follow-up of inflammatory bowel disease (n=78), active CD (n=45), GFD (n=34) and RCD (n=15) were analysed for GP2A titres. RESULTS: Increased GP2A-IgA levels in CrD and active CD as compared to controls (p<0.001) and lack thereof in UC was confirmed. However, we could not confirm the association with small bowel localization within the CrD patient group. Within CD patients, we demonstrated a significant decrease of GP2A-IgA titres upon a GFD and increased levels in RCD patients as compared to patients on a GFD. Although GP2A-IgA was not associated with the degree of villous atrophy, GP2A-IgA levels were able to distinguish RCD patients from GFD patients (ROC AUC=0.79, p=0.002). CONCLUSION: Follow-up of GP2A-IgA titres in CD patients on a GFD may help to identify patients at risk for developing RCD.
22313950	Spectrum of gluten-related disorders: consensus on new nomenclature and classification.	A decade ago celiac disease was considered extremely rare outside Europe and, therefore, was almost completely ignored by health care professionals. In only 10 years, key milestones have moved celiac disease from obscurity into the popular spotlight worldwide. Now we are observing another interesting phenomenon that is generating great confusion among health care professionals. The number of individuals embracing a gluten-free diet (GFD) appears much higher than the projected number of celiac disease patients, fueling a global market of gluten-free products approaching $2.5 billion (US) in global sales in 2010. This trend is supported by the notion that, along with celiac disease, other conditions related to the ingestion of gluten have emerged as health care concerns. This review will summarize our current knowledge about the three main forms of gluten reactions: allergic (wheat allergy), autoimmune (celiac disease, dermatitis herpetiformis and gluten ataxia) and possibly immune-mediated (gluten sensitivity), and also outline pathogenic, clinical and epidemiological differences and propose new nomenclature and classifications.
21523259	Testing for gluten-related disorders in clinical practice: the role of serology in managing the spectrum of gluten sensitivity.	Immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase is the single most efficient serological test for the diagnosis of celiac disease. It is well known that immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase levels correlate with the degree of intestinal damage, and that values can fluctuate in patients over time. Serological testing can be used to identify symptomatic individuals that need a confirmatory biopsy, to screen at-risk populations or to monitor diet compliance in patients previously diagnosed with celiac disease. Thus, interpretation of serological testing requires consideration of the full clinical scenario. Antigliadin tests are no longer recommended for the diagnosis of classical celiac disease. However, our understanding of the pathogenesis and spectrum of gluten sensitivity has improved, and gluten-sensitive irritable bowel syndrome patients are increasingly being recognized. Studies are needed to determine the clinical utility of antigliadin serology in the diagnosis of gluten sensitivity.
27443108	Burning Tongue as Initial Presentation of Celiac Disease in an Elderly Woman: A Case Report.	There are few reports in the literature where celiac disease presents with tongue manifestations, although atypical presentations of celiac disease are not uncommon. This case report highlights an atypical presentation of celiac disease in an elderly female. Our patient presented to clinic with complaints of a burning tongue for the past two years as well as occasional loose stools and fatigue. Work-up revealed iron deficiency anemia, zinc deficiency and an abnormal celiac panel. Complete symptom improvement was noted by 10 weeks into the initiation of a gluten free diet. Celiac disease can present at any age and should be considered as a differential in findings of malabsorption and gastrointestinal symptoms.

39064736	gammadelta+ T-Cells Is a Useful Biomarker for the Differential Diagnosis between Celiac Disease and Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity in Patients under Gluten Free Diet.	BACKGROUND: The differential diagnosis between patients with celiac disease (CD) and non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is difficult when a gluten-free diet (GFD) has been initiated before the diagnostic work-up. Isolated increases in TCRgammadelta+ and celiac lymphogram (increased TCRgammadelta+ plus decreased CD3-) may enable differential diagnosis in this challenging clinical setting. This study evaluated: (1) the accuracy of %TCRgammadelta+ and celiac lymphogram for diagnosing CD before and after GFD and for differentiation with NCGS; (2) TCRgammadelta+ kinetics at baseline and after starting GFD in both CD and NCGS. METHODS: The inclusion criteria were patients with CD (n = 104), NCGS (n = 37), and healthy volunteers (n = 18). An intestinal biopsy for intraepithelial lymphogram by flow cytometry was performed at baseline and after GFD. The optimal cutoff for CD diagnostic accuracy was established by maximizing the Youden index and via logistic regression. RESULTS: %TCRgammadelta+ showed better diagnostic accuracy than celiac lymphogram for identifying CD before and after GFD initiation. With a cutoff > 13.31, the accuracy for diagnosing CD in patients under GFD was 0.88 [0.80-0.93], whereas the accuracy for diagnosing NCGS (%TCRgammadelta+ <= 13.31) was 0.84 [0.76-0.89]. The percentage of TCRgammadelta+ cells showed differential kinetics between CD (baseline 22.7% [IQR, 16.4-33.6] vs. after GFD 26.4% [IQR, 17.8-36.8]; p = 0.026) and NCGS (baseline 9.4% [IQR, 4.1-14.6] vs. after GFD 6.4% [IQR, 3.2-11]; p = 0.022). CONCLUSION: TCRgammadelta+ T cell assessment accurately diagnoses CD before and after a GFD. Increased TCRgammadelta+ was maintained in the long term after GFD in CD but not in NCGS. Altogether, this suggests the potential usefulness of this marker for the differential diagnosis of these two entities in patients on a GFD.
32965317	Anxiety and depression: a study of psychoaffective, family-related, and daily-life factors in celiac individuals.	OBJECTIVE: To identify the prevalence of anxiety and depression and its association with psychoaffective, family-related, and daily-life variables of celiac individuals. METHODS: Crosssectional study, developed with 83 celiac patients in Fortaleza. An instrument was applied with variables grouped in the categories: psychoaffective, family-related, and daily-life. RESULTS: It was found that 52 celiac patients (62.7%) had anxiety and 29 (34.9%) had depression. The clinical conditions found and the number of symptoms increased the chance of anxiety/depression. The predominant factors in those with anxiety were Lack of control of the celiac disease (98.1%), Perceived clinical condition (75.0%), Daily obstacles for maintaining a gluten-free diet (63.4%), and Daily activities (55.8%). In those with depression, there was a higher prevalence of Lack of control of the celiac disease (100.0%), Perceived clinical condition (82.2%), and Daily obstacles for maintaining a gluten-free diet (69.0%). CONCLUSION: Celiac individuals with anxiety and depression frameworks presented a higher frequency of Perceived clinical condition, Insufficient social support (psychoaffective factors) and Daily obstacles for maintaining a gluten-free diet (daily-life factor).
30739797	Chronic Inflammation Permanently Reshapes Tissue-Resident Immunity in Celiac Disease.	Tissue-resident lymphocytes play a key role in immune surveillance, but it remains unclear how these inherently stable cell populations respond to chronic inflammation. In the setting of celiac disease (CeD), where exposure to dietary antigen can be controlled, gluten-induced inflammation triggered a profound depletion of naturally occurring Vgamma4+/Vdelta1+ intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) with innate cytolytic properties and specificity for the butyrophilin-like (BTNL) molecules BTNL3/BTNL8. Creation of a new niche with reduced expression of BTNL8 and loss of Vgamma4+/Vdelta1+ IELs was accompanied by the expansion of gluten-sensitive, interferon-gamma-producing Vdelta1+ IELs bearing T cell receptors (TCRs) with a shared non-germline-encoded motif that failed to recognize BTNL3/BTNL8. Exclusion of dietary gluten restored BTNL8 expression but was insufficient to reconstitute the physiological Vgamma4+/Vdelta1+ subset among TCRgammadelta+ IELs. Collectively, these data show that chronic inflammation permanently reconfigures the tissue-resident TCRgammadelta+ IEL compartment in CeD. VIDEO ABSTRACT.
36986205	Nutritional Considerations in Celiac Disease and Non-Celiac Gluten/Wheat Sensitivity.	A gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only available treatment for celiac disease (CeD), and it may also improve symptoms in non-celiac gluten/wheat sensitivity (NCGWS). In CeD, gluten triggers an immune reaction leading to enteropathy, malabsorption, and symptoms; in NCGWS, the mechanism leading to symptoms is unknown, and neither wheat nor gluten triggers enteropathy or malabsorption. A strict GFD is, therefore, necessary for CeD, but a gluten-restricted diet (GRD) may suffice to achieve symptom control for NCGWS. Regardless of this distinction, the risk of malnutrition and macro- and micronutrient deficiencies is increased by the adoption of a GFD or GRD. Thus, patients with CeD or NCGWS should undergo nutritional assessment and subsequent monitoring, based on evidence-based tools, under the care of a multidisciplinary team involving physicians and dietitians, for the long-term management of their nutrition. This review gives an overview of available nutrition assessment tools and considerations for the nutritional management of CeD and NCGWS populations.
26092417	The Frequency of Epileptiform Discharges in Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND: We studied patients with celiac disease to define the frequency of epileptiform discharges on electroencephalography. METHODS: A total of 307 children with a diagnosis of celiac disease (study group) and 197 age- and sex-matched healthy children as controls (control group) were included in this study. The study group was further divided into newly diagnosed celiac disease patients (n = 216) and patients who were on a gluten-free diet (n = 91) for at least 6 months. Medical histories of all children including age, sex, symptoms, weight, height, physical examination findings, and laboratory data were recorded. All patients underwent an electroencephalograph in a pediatric neurology electroencephalograph laboratory with a 32-channel electroencephalograph for 30 minutes. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were defined to have epileptiform discharges (spike/sharp-wave discharges); 24 (7.8%) of those patients were in the celiac disease group and 1 (0.5%) was in the control group (P = 0.001). Among those 24 patients, 21 (9.7%) were in newly diagnosed celiac disease group and 3 (3.3%) were in the gluten-free diet group (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Patients diagnosed with celiac disease are prone to epileptiform activities on electroencephalography and should be evaluated carefully. Moreover, strict adherence to a gluten-free diet early should be advised in those patients with epileptiform activities because it may effectively decrease the occurrence of epileptiform activities.
30893404	Headache in Patients with Celiac Disease and Its Response to the Gluten-Free Diet.	AIMS: To describe headache characteristics among celiac disease (CD) patients and to analyze the relationship between CD and headache. METHODS: An online survey analyzing the characteristics of headache and its response to the gluten-free diet (GFD) in celiac patients was published on Argentinean Celiac social networks, open to the public to complete. The results were analyzed using chi-square test or Mann-Whitney test accordingly. RESULTS: A total of 1,517 subjects completed the survey, and 866 (55.2%) met the inclusion criteria (headache and CD confirmed with positive biopsy). The subjects were predominantly female (94.5%) and had a median age of 39 +- 11.27 years. Tension-type headache was the most prevalent headache type (52%), followed by migraine without (32.5%) and with aura (15.4%), respectively. Of the included participants, 24% reported headache as the main symptom that resulted in the diagnosis of CD. Following initiation of GFD, headache frequency and intensity improved significantly more in participants with migraine than tension-type headache (P = .02 and P = .013, respectively). Compliance to GFD was higher among subjects with severe manifestations (77% vs 66%, P = .05), and compliant individuals showed a 48% improvement in headache frequency (P = .049). An association between food transgressions and headache was better recognized by migraineurs (P = .02). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that strict compliance to the GFD could improve headache in celiac patients with headache, even in those without gastrointestinal symptoms. This observation could provide an additional factor when convincing patients to follow a GFD, thus reducing the morbidity related to CD.
22898420	Celiac disease: clinical, endoscopic, and histopathologic review.	
25274968	Celiac disease.	On the basis of strong evidence, gastrointestinal symptoms and failure to thrive are classic presentations of celiac disease, but atypical, nongastrointestinal symptoms are also extremely common, particularly in the older child and adolescent. (3)(4)(8). On the basis of some research evidence and consensus, guidelines recommend celiac testing in symptomatic children with typical and atypical symptoms and consideration of testing in those with associated conditions and first-degree relatives of those with celiac disease. (3)(9). On the basis of strong research evidence, measurement of tTG IgA and total serum IgA level has been reported to be the most cost-effective and accurate means of serologic testing for celiac disease and is the test of choice unless the child is younger than 2 years or IgA deficient. (9). On the basis of strong research evidence, children with elevated titers of celiac antibodies or strong clinical suspicion for celiac disease should be referred to a gastroenterologist for upper endoscopy and biopsy. Until this procedure is performed, the child should continue on a diet with ingestion of gluten. (3)(9). On the basis of strong research evidence, all those with a confirmed diagnosis of celiac disease should follow a strict gluten-free diet for life, with avoidance of all foods that contain wheat, barley, and rye ingredients. (3)(4). Referral to a health care professional with specialized knowledge of celiac disease and the gluten-free diet is critical because of the numerous ways, often hidden, in which gluten may be present in the diet and environment.
25968008	The Celiac Disease and Diabetes-Dietary Intervention and Evaluation Trial (CD-DIET) protocol: a randomised controlled study to evaluate treatment of asymptomatic coeliac disease in type 1 diabetes.	INTRODUCTION: Coeliac disease (CD) is an autoimmune condition characterised by gluten-induced intestinal inflammation, and observed at a 5-10 fold greater prevalence in type 1 diabetes. While universal screening for CD in patients with diabetes is frequently advocated, objective data is limited as to benefits on diabetes control, bone health or quality of life related to the adoption of a gluten-free diet (GFD) in the large proportion of patients with diabetes with asymptomatic CD. The Celiac Disease and Diabetes-Dietary Intervention and Evaluation Trial (CD-DIET) study is a multicenter, randomised controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a GFD in patients with type 1 diabetes with asymptomatic CD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Children and adults (8-45 years) with type 1 diabetes will be screened for asymptomatic CD. Eligible patients with biopsy-proven CD will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with a GFD for 1 year, or continue with a gluten-containing diet. The primary outcome will evaluate the impact of the GFD on change in glycated haemoglobin. Secondary outcomes will evaluate changes in bone mineral density, blood glucose variability and health-related quality of life between GFD-treated and the regular diet group over a 1-year period. The study was initiated in 2012 and has subsequently expanded to multiple paediatric and adult centres in Ontario, Canada. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The findings from this study will provide high-quality evidence as to the impact of GFD treatment on glycaemic control and complications in asymptomatic children and adults with CD and type 1 diabetes. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01566110.
29132529	Celiac Disease and Gluten Sensitivity.	Celiac disease is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by gluten that affects genetically predisposed individuals, typically causing intestinal symptoms and malabsorption. Diagnosis requires stepwise evaluation with anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA and histologic analysis of the small bowel. Strict adherence to a gluten-free diet is the primary treatment. Patients with symptoms thought to be related to gluten but without evidence of celiac disease are difficult to diagnose and treat. Consider first advising general nutritional improvements. If symptoms persist, involve a trained dietitian for restrictive diets and consider evaluation for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth or other treatments for irritable bowel syndrome.
23732466	CYP3A4-catalyzed simvastatin metabolism as a non-invasive marker of small intestinal health in celiac disease.	OBJECTIVES: Histological examination of duodenal biopsies is the gold standard for assessing intestinal damage in celiac disease (CD). A noninvasive marker of disease status is necessary, because obtaining duodenal biopsies is invasive and not suitable for routine monitoring of CD patients. As the small intestine is a major site of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) activity and also the location of the celiac lesion, we investigated whether patients with active CD display abnormal pharmacokinetics of an orally administered CYP3A4 substrate, simvastatin (SV), which could potentially be used for noninvasive assessment of their small intestinal health. METHODS: Preclinical experiments were performed in CYP3A4-humanized mice to examine the feasibility of the test. Subsequently, a clinical trial was undertaken with 11 healthy volunteers, 18 newly diagnosed patients with CD, and 25 celiac patients who had followed a gluten-free diet (GFD) for more than 1 year. The maximum concentration (Cmax) of orally administered SV plus its major non-CYP3A4-derived metabolite SV acid (SV equivalent (SVeq)) was measured, and compared with clinical, histological, and serological parameters. RESULTS: In CYP3A4-humanized mice, a marked decrease in SV metabolism was observed in response to enteropathy. In the clinical setting, untreated celiac patients displayed a significantly higher SVeq Cmax (46+-24 nM) compared with treated patients (21+-16 nM, P<0.001) or healthy subjects (19+-11 nM, P<0.005). SVeq Cmax correctly predicted the diagnosis in 16/18 untreated celiac patients, and also the recovery status of all follow-up patients that exhibited normal or near-normal biopsies (Marsh 0-2). All patients with abnormal SVeq Cmax showed a reduction in the value after 1 year of following a GFD. CONCLUSIONS: SVeq Cmax is a promising noninvasive marker for assessment of small intestinal health. Further studies are warranted to establish its clinical utility for assessing gut status of patients with CD.
31370243	Food Neophobia in Celiac Disease and Other Gluten-Free Diet Individuals.	The only treatment currently available to combat celiac disease (CD) is strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD), but there may be various determinants of its adherence, including food neophobia (FN), that is associated with sensory aversions, or fears of negative consequences of eating specific food products, that may be crucial for CD patients following a GFD. The aim of the present study was to analyze food neophobia levels and its determinants in CD patients in comparison with other individuals who follow a GFD based on their own decision. The study was conducted in two independent groups of individuals following a GFD: those diagnosed with CD (n = 101) and those following a GFD based on their own decision (n = 124). Each group was recruited with cooperation from the local CD and GFD societies located in Poland. The FN was assessed using the Food Neophobia Scale (FNS) and compared between groups, as well as the influence of gender, age, body mass index, educational level, place of residence and employment status was assessed. It was stated, that for the individuals following a GFD, CD was the major determinant of FN. The FNS score values were higher (indicating higher food neophobia) for CD individuals (39.4 +- 9.2), than for those following a GFD based on their own decision (33.6 +- 8.7; p < 0.0001) and it was observed both for general group and for sub-groups stratified by assessed variables. Moreover, the indicated variables did not influence the FNS in any of the analyzed groups. The influence of CD with no influence of other variables was confirmed in the regression analysis. It may be concluded that CD is a major contributor to FN, which can be attributed to fear of developing adverse reactions to gluten-contaminated food products, which is more pronounced in CD patients compared to non-CD patients following a GFD based on their own decision.
30201860	Gluten-Free Diet: From Development to Assessment of a Check-List Designed for the Prevention of Gluten Cross-Contamination in Food Services.	Gluten cross-contamination in gluten-free food may jeopardize treatment of celiac patients. Considering the deficit of appropriate instruments to enable the implementation of safe production practices for gluten-free food, this study aimed to evaluate the application of a check-list elaborated for gluten cross-contamination prevention in food services. The instrument was applied in 60 Brazilian food services. Interobserver reproducibility and internal consistency of the check-list were tested. A score classification was created for establishments according to the food contamination risk assessment. Subsequent to the application and statistical analysis, the original instrument was reduced to a 30-item check-list. In the reproducibility analysis, none of the 30 items showed significant divergence among the evaluators (p > 0.05 in the Cochran Q test). The 30-item version of the check-list presented Kuder-Richardson Formula 20 (KR-20) = 0.771, indicating good internal consistency. The proposed classification score is obtained by adding 1 point for each item with an "adequate" response; therefore, the final score may vary between 0 and 30 points. Establishments with up to 15 points exhibit risk of gluten contamination, while establishments with a score above 16 points exhibit low risk of contamination. The check-list displayed good reproducibility and internal consistency, suggesting that it could be a useful gluten contamination control instrument in food services.
33193357	Intestinal Dysbiosis in, and Enteral Bacterial Therapies for, Systemic Autoimmune Diseases.	Recent studies have shown that a number of common autoimmune diseases have perturbations of their intestinal microbiome (dysbiosis). These include: Celiac Disease (CeD), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), Sjogren's Syndrome (SS), and Type 1 diabetes (T1D). All of these have intestinal microbiomes that are different from healthy controls. There have been numerous studies using animal models of single probiotics (monoclonal) or mixtures of probiotics (polyclonal) and even complete microbiota transfer (fecal microbial transfer-FMT) to inhibit or delay the onset of autoimmune diseases such as the aforementioned common ones. However, proportionally, fewer clinical trials have utilized monoclonal therapies or FMT than polyclonal therapies for treating autoimmune diseases, even though bacterial mono-therapies do inhibit the development of autoimmune diseases and/or delay the onset of autoimmune diseases in rodent models of those autoimmune diseases. In this review then, we review the previously completed and currently ongoing clinical trials that are testing bacterial therapies (FMT, monoclonal, and polyclonal) to treat common autoimmune dseases and discuss the successes in using bacterial monotherapies to treat rodent models of these common autoimmune diseases.
24195595	Appropriate nutrient supplementation in celiac disease.	Reduced levels of iron, folate, vitamin B12, vitamin D, zinc, and magnesium are common in untreated celiac disease (CD) patients probably due to loss of brush border proteins and enzymes needed for the absorption of these nutrients. In the majority of patients, removal of gluten from the diet leads to histological recovery and normalization of iron, vitamin, and mineral levels. Iron deficiency anemia is the most common extra-intestinal sign of CD and usually resolves with adherence to a gluten-free diet. However, deficiencies of both folate and vitamin B12 may persist in some patients on a gluten-free diet, thus requiring vitamin supplementation to improve subjective health status. Similarly, exclusion of gluten from the diet does not always normalize bone mineral density; in these cases, supplementation of vitamin D and calcium is recommended. Resolution of mucosal inflammation may not be sufficient to abrogate magnesium deficiency. Since gluten-free cereal products have a lower magnesium content as compared with gluten-containing counterparts, a magnesium-enriched diet should be encouraged in CD patients. In this article we discuss the frequency and clinical relevance of nutrient deficiency in CD and whether and when nutrient supplementation is needed.
22258271	Monitoring of gluten-free diet compliance in celiac patients by assessment of gliadin 33-mer equivalent epitopes in feces.	BACKGROUND: Certain immunotoxic peptides from gluten are resistant to gastrointestinal digestion and can interact with celiac-patient factors to trigger an immunologic response. A gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only effective treatment for celiac disease (CD), and its compliance should be monitored to avoid cumulative damage. However, practical methods to monitor diet compliance and to detect the origin of an outbreak of celiac clinical symptoms are not available. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the capacity to determine the gluten ingestion and monitor GFD compliance in celiac patients by the detection of gluten and gliadin 33-mer equivalent peptidic epitopes (33EPs) in human feces. DESIGN: Fecal samples were obtained from healthy subjects, celiac patients, and subjects with other intestinal pathologies with different diet conditions. Gluten and 33EPs were analyzed by using immunochromatography and competitive ELISA with a highly sensitive antigliadin 33-mer monoclonal antibody. RESULTS: The resistance of a significant part of 33EPs to gastrointestinal digestion was shown in vitro and in vivo. We were able to detect gluten peptides in feces of healthy individuals after consumption of a normal gluten-containing diet, after consumption of a GFD combined with controlled ingestion of a fixed amount of gluten, and after ingestion of <100 mg gluten/d. These methods also allowed us to detect GFD infringement in CD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Gluten-derived peptides could be sensitively detected in human feces in positive correlation with the amount of gluten intake. These techniques may serve to show GFD compliance or infringement and be used in clinical research in strategies to eliminate gluten immunotoxic peptides during digestion. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01478867.
27689204	Serendipity in Refractory Celiac Disease: Full Recovery of Duodenal Villi and Clinical Symptoms after Fecal Microbiota Transfer.	Treatment of refractory celiac disease type II (RCD II) and preventing the development of an enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma in these patients is still difficult. In this case report, we describe a patient with RCD II who received fecal microbiota transfer as treatment for a recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, and remarkably showed a full recovery of duodenal villi and disappearance of celiac symptoms. This case suggests that altering the gut microbiota may hold promise in improving the clinical and histological consequences of celiac disease and/or RCD II. 
21576491	In vivo fluorescence imaging of exogenous enzyme activity in the gastrointestinal tract.	Exogenous enzymes are administered orally to treat several diseases, such as pancreatic insufficiency and lactose intolerance. Due to the proteinaceous nature of enzymes, they are subject to inactivation and/or digestion in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Here we describe a convenient fluorescence-based assay to monitor the activity of therapeutic enzymes in real time in vivo in the GI tract. To establish the proof of principle, the assay was applied to proline-specific endopeptidases (PEPs), a group of enzymes recently proposed as adjuvant therapy for celiac disease (a highly prevalent immunogenetic enteropathy). A short PEP-specific peptide sequence which is part of larger immunotoxic sequences of gluten was labeled with a fluorescent dye and a corresponding quencher. Upon enzymatic cleavage, the fluorescence emission was dequenched and detected with an in vivo imaging system. PEPs originating from Flavobacterium meningosepticum (FM) and Myxococcus xanthus (MX) were evaluated after oral administration in rats. While MX PEP could not cleave the peptide in the stomach, FM PEP showed significant gastric activity reaching 40-60% of the maximal in vivo signal intensity. However, both enzymes produced comparable fluorescence signals in the small intestine. Coadministration of an antacid drug significantly enhanced MX PEP's gastric activity due to increased pH and/or inhibition of stomach proteases. With this simple procedure, differences in the in vivo performance of PEPs, which could not be identified under in vitro conditions, were detected. This imaging assay could be used to study other oral enzymes in vivo and therefore be instrumental in improving their therapeutic efficiency.
24240659	Diversity of oat varieties in eliciting the early inflammatory events in celiac disease.	PURPOSE: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune enteropathy, triggered by dietary gluten. The only treatment is a strict gluten-free diet. Oats are included in the list of gluten-free ingredients by European Regulation, but the safety of oats in CD is still a matter of debate. The present study examined the capability of different oat cultivars of activating the gliadin-induced transglutaminase-2 (TG2)-dependent events in some in vitro models of CD. In addition, we compared this capability with the electrophoresis pattern of peptic-tryptic digests of the proteins of the oat cultivars. METHODS: K562(S) cells agglutination, transepithelial electrical resistance of T84-cell monolayers, intracellular levels of TG2 and phosphorylated form of protein 42-44 in T84 cells were the early gliadin-dependent events studied. RESULTS: The results showed that the Nave oat cultivar elicited these events, whereas Irina and Potenza varieties did not. The ability of a cultivar to activate the above-described events was associated with the electrophoretic pattern of oat proteins and their reactivity to anti-gliadin antibodies. CONCLUSION: We found significant differences among oat cultivars in eliciting the TG2-mediated events of CD inflammation. Therefore, the safety of an oat cultivar in CD might be screened in vitro by means of biochemical and biological assays, before starting a clinical trial to definitely assess its safety.
30287732	Adherence to Gluten-Free Diet in Children with Celiac Disease.	Celiac disease (CD) can only be treated by rigorous life-long gluten-free diet (GFD). The study included 102 mothers and their CD children treated with GFD for at least two years. Frequency and cause of diet failure in children treated at present (54 children) and 10 years ago (48 children) were compared. Dietary adherence was evaluated serologically (tTG), while diet management difficulties were examined by means of a questionnaire. The study shows that one-third of patients fail to follow GFD, more often 10 years ago than now (40% vs. 26%; p < 0.05), mainly children aged 13-18 (54% vs. 40% now; p < 0.05). Younger children (up to 12) are less likely to abandon the diet (27% vs. 8%; p < 0.05). In this age group non-intentional diet failure prevails, while teenagers interrupt their diet intentionally (45% vs. 33%; p = ns (small population of children in this groups)). Currently, the most common causes of teenage diet failure are the absence of symptoms after consuming a small amount of gluten and, even more often, troublesome diet administration. Previously, the absence of peer acceptance prevailed. With this study we found that: 1. In West Pomerania, every fourth CD child does not follow GFD. 2. For years, teenagers have failed to follow GFD due to the absence of symptoms after consuming small amounts of gluten. 3. The incidence of non-intentional failure to follow GFD has significantly decreased over years, which indicates better dietary care.
26217073	Non-celiac gluten sensitivity: Time for sifting the grain.	In the last few years, a new nomenclature has been proposed for the disease induced by the ingestion of gluten, a protein present in wheat, rice, barley and oats. Besides celiac disease and wheat allergy, the most studied forms of gluten-related disorders characterized by an evident immune mechanism (autoimmune in celiac disease and IgE-mediated in wheat allergy), a new entity has been included, apparently not driven by an aberrant immune response: the non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). NCGS is characterized by a heterogeneous clinical picture with intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms arising after gluten ingestion and rapidly improving after its withdrawal from the diet. The pathogenesis of NCGS is largely unknown, but a mixture of factors such as the stimulation of the innate immune system, the direct cytotoxic effects of gluten, and probably the synergy with other wheat molecules, are clues for the complicated puzzle. In addition, the diagnostic procedures still remain problematic due to the absence of efficient diagnostic markers; thus, diagnosis is based upon the symptomatic response to a gluten-free diet and the recurrence of symptoms after gluten reintroduction with the possibility of an important involvement of a placebo effect. The temporary withdrawal of gluten seems a reasonable therapy, but the timing of gluten reintroduction and the correct patient management approach are have not yet been determined. 
34333499	Adult-Onset Autoimmune Enteropathy in an European Tertiary Referral Center.	INTRODUCTION: Adult-onset autoimmune enteropathy (AIE) is a rare cause of severe chronic diarrhea because of small intestinal villous atrophy. We report on patients with adult-onset AIE in an European referral center. METHODS: Retrospective study including patients diagnosed with AIE in the Amsterdam UMC, location VUmc, between January 2003 and December 2019. Clinical, serological, and histological features and response to treatment were reported. The specificity of antienterocyte antibodies (AEA) was evaluated by examining the prevalence of AEA in (i) controls (n = 30) and in patients with (ii) AIE (n = 13), (iii) celiac disease (CD, n = 52), (iv) refractory celiac disease type 2 (n = 18), and (v) enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL, n = 10). RESULTS: Thirteen AIE patients were included, 8 women (62%), median age of 52 years (range 23-73), and 6 (46%) with an autoimmune disease. AEA were observed in 11 cases (85%), but were also found in CD (7.7%), refractory celiac disease type 2 (16.7%), and EATL (20%). Ten patients (77%) were human leukocyte antigen DQ2.5 heterozygous. Total parenteral nutrition was required in 8 cases (62%). Steroids induced clinical remission in 8 cases (62%). Step-up therapy with rituximab, cyclosporine, infliximab, and cladribine in steroid-refractory patients was only moderately effective. Four patients died (31%), but 4 (31%) others are in long-term drug-free remission after receiving immunosuppressive treatment, including 1 patient who underwent autologous stem cell transplantation. DISCUSSION: Adult-onset AIE is a rare but severe enteropathy that occurs in patients susceptible for autoimmune disease. Four patients (31%) died secondary to therapy-refractory malabsorption, while immunosuppressive therapy leads to a long-lasting drug-free remission in one-third of patients.
33230758	A serial SPECT-CT study in a celiac disease patient with cerebellar ataxia and psychiatric symptoms.	Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated systemic disorder triggered by gluten and related prolamins in genetically predisposed individuals. Here, we described a case of a 31-year-old Caucasian woman who exhibited cerebellar and psychiatric dysfunctions. The patient underwent single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT-CT) before and after a gluten-free diet (GFD). There was an improvement in cerebellar perfusion accompanied by a remission of cerebellar manifestations. The maintenance of the psychiatric manifestations was related to the persistence of the hypoperfusion in the frontal lobes. The patient's psychiatric symptoms did not change after 4 months under a GFD in the hospital. To our knowledge, this is the first case that shows the relationship between improvement in cerebellar perfusion and remission of cerebellar clinical manifestations in a CD patient under a GFD.
22889636	Green banana pasta: an alternative for gluten-free diets.	The objective of this study was to develop and analyze a gluten-free pasta made with green banana flour. The study was divided into five steps: preparation/selection, chemical, sensory, technological, and statistical analysis. The modified sample presented greater acceptance (84.5% for celiac individuals and 61.2% for nonceliac) than standard samples (53.6% for nonceliac individuals). There was no significant difference between the modified and the standard samples in terms of appearance, aroma, flavor, and overall quality. The modified pastas presented approximately 98% less lipids. Green bananas are considered a subproduct of low commercial value with little industrial use. The possibility of developing gluten-free products with green banana flour can expand the product supply for people with celiac disease and contribute to a more diverse diet.
22991867	[Future therapeutics in celiac disease].	Celiac disease is a common autoimmune disease affecting 1% of the Western populations. It is an inappropriate immune response, in genetically susceptible patients to dietary wheat, rye, barley and oats. Treatment involves a Lifelong gluten-free diet that predisposes to low compliance due to limited variety, high cost and low palatability, imposing social pressure and affecting quality of life. The result is an urgent need for alternative therapeutic strategies. Based on the growing actual knowledge on the intestinal inflammatory cascade, mucosal immunology and genetics of celiac disease, new attractive potential therapies are emerging. Possibilities include: searching for low immunogenic wheat variants or strains pretreated with enzymes or binders for lower toxicity. Other strategies involve decreasing transepithelial uptake or dampening of the adaptive immune response by transglutaminase inhibitors or blockage of the HLA groove and immune modulation to shift the TH1 to TH2 profile. Developing biological therapy aims to decrease intestinal homing, adhesion and activity of inflammatory cells, counteract the pro-inflammatory cytokines, clonal intestinal T cells or mesenchymal stem cell replacement or mitogenic intestinal repair safety, cost, affordability and clinical effectiveness are of prime concern. Most of the above strategies showed promising results ex-vivo. The future will highlight the in-vivo winner.
33435453	Quantification of Accidental Gluten Contamination in the Diet of Children with Treated Celiac Disease.	A strict gluten-free diet is extremely difficult to maintain. Protracted ingestion of gluten traces (>10 mg/day) is sufficient to cause significant damage in the architecture of the small intestinal mucosa in patients on treatment for celiac disease. The aim of this study was to directly measure the level of contaminating gluten in the daily diet of celiac children following a gluten-free diet. From April 2019 to December 2019, celiac disease children (2-18 years old) on a gluten-free diet for >=6 months were offered to participate in this prospective-observational study. Patients and their caregivers were invited to provide a representative portion (about 10 g) of all meals consumed during a 24-h period. Participants were requested to weigh all ingested food and report items in a 24-h food diary. The gluten content was quantified by the R5 sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Sixty-nine children completed the protocol. Overall, 12/448 (2.7%) food samples contained detectable amounts of gluten; of them, 11 contained 5-20 ppm and 1 >20 ppm. The 12 contaminated food samples belonged to 5/69 enrolled patients. In these 5 children, the daily gluten intake was well below the safety threshold of 10 mg/day. The present findings suggest that in a country characterized by high celiac disease awareness, the daily unintended exposure to gluten of treated celiac children on regular follow-up is very low; reassuringly, the presence of gluten traces did not lead to exceed the tolerable threshold of 10 mg/day of gluten intake in the gluten-free diet.

33741317	Gluten Degradation, Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Tolerability of TAK-062, an Engineered Enzyme to Treat Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Celiac disease (CeD) is an immune-mediated disorder triggered by the ingestion of gluten. Despite adhering to a gluten-free diet (the only management option available to patients with CeD), many patients continue to experience symptoms and intestinal injury. Degradation of immunogenic fractions of gluten peptides in the stomach has been proposed as an approach to reduce toxicity of ingested gluten; however, no enzymes evaluated to date have demonstrated sufficient gluten degradation in complex meals. TAK-062 is a novel, computationally designed endopeptidase under development for the treatment of patients with CeD. METHODS: Pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of TAK-062 100-900 mg were evaluated in a phase I dose escalation study in healthy participants and patients with CeD. Gluten degradation by TAK-062 was evaluated under simulated gastric conditions in vitro and in healthy participants in the phase I study, with and without pretreatment with a proton pump inhibitor. Residual gluten (collected through gastric aspiration in the phase I study) was quantified using R5 and G12 monoclonal antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. RESULTS: In vitro, TAK-062 degraded more than 99% of gluten (3 g and 9 g) within 10 minutes. In the phase I study, administration of TAK-062 was well tolerated and resulted in a median gluten degradation ranging from 97% to more than 99% in complex meals containing 1-6 g gluten at 20-65 minutes postdose. CONCLUSIONS: TAK-062 is well tolerated and rapidly and effectively degrades large amounts of gluten, supporting the development of this novel enzyme as an oral therapeutic for patients with CeD. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03701555, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03701555.).
34066195	Nutritional Status in Spanish Adults with Celiac Disease Following a Long-Term Gluten-Free Diet Is Similar to Non-Celiac.	The only available treatment for celiac disease is life-long gluten exclusion. We conducted a cross-sectional age- and gender-matched study in 64 celiac adults on a long-term (>1 year) gluten-free diet and 74 non-celiac volunteers from Spain, using dietary, anthropometric, and biochemical parameters, as well as assessing bone mineral density and physical activity. Celiac adults had deficient intake (below 2/3 of the recommended intake) for folates, vitamin E, and iodine and low intake of calcium (below 80% of the recommended intake). Iron intake was also below 2/3 of the recommended intake in celiac women. Vitamin D intake was extremely low, and 34% of celiac patients had moderately deficient plasma levels. According to bone mineral density, celiac women may be more prone to osteopenia and osteoporosis. However, we found a perfectly analogous nutritional status scenario in celiac as compared to healthy volunteers, with the dietary deviations found being similar to those of the Spanish population, i.e., both groups followed a high-lipid, high-protein, and low-carbohydrate diet. Values for biochemical parameters were found within the reference ranges. Celiac disease had no influence on body weight, but body fat in celiac patients tended to be higher. According to our results, vitamin D, calcium, folates, vitamin E, iodine, and iron nutritional status should be specifically assessed and monitored in the celiac population.
20940666	Autonomic imbalance in celiac children.	AIM: Involvement of many organs and apparatus such as heart, central and peripheral nervous systems have been reported in celiac disease. Autonomic neuropathy has frequently been reported both in untreated and in gluten free diet (GFD) adult patients and, to our knowledge, has never been investigated in celiac children. The aim of the study was to evaluate autonomic function in children with celiac disease. METHODS: Fifteen children with untreated celiac disease were enrolled. Fifteen healthy children served as controls. None of the patients was diabetic. Central or peripheral neurological diseases, were absent. In all participants, at recruitment and after 24 months of GFD, serum anti-tTG and AEA levels, inflammatory markers, IgG, IgM and IgA anti-ganglioside antibodies, were performed. Heart rate variability indexes were employed to evaluate autonomic system balance. RESULTS: Our results indicate that also children with celiac disease may exhibit an imbalance of the neurovegetative system with a prevailing sympathetic tone, persisting on a GFD. All presented symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation, vomiting, meteorism, regurgitation in whom autonomic dysfunction could be involved, but these symptoms disappeared on gluten free diet. This tend to exclude the prevailing sympathetic tone as a main factor underlying symptoms of celiac disease. CONCLUSION: Children affected by celiac disease exhibit an enhanced sympathetic tone, persisting after 24 months of GFD whereas gastrointestinal and systemic symptoms disappear. The pathogenesis of this phenomenon still remains unclear.
37903705	Impact of Gluten-Free Diet on Anthropometric Indicators in Individuals With and Without Celiac Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.	PURPOSE: Previous studies have found that a gluten-free diet (GFD) may have improve obesity-related factors. For this reason, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the effect of a GFD on anthropometric indicators. METHODS: We performed a systematic search in databases from inception until July 12, 2022. We included all relevant articles that evaluate efficacy of a GFD on anthropometric indicators in patients with and without celiac disease (CD). Random-effects models were applied to combine the data. The main outcomes were then analyzed using weight mean differences (WMDs) and 95% CIs. FINDINGS: A total of 27 articles met the eligible criteria and were included. Pooled results from the random-effects model indicated that the GFD has no significant effect on any of the factors of anthropometry, including weight (WMD, 1.20 kg; 95% CI, -1.16 to 3.55 kg; P = 0.319), body mass index (WMD, 0.70 kg/m2; 95% CI, -0.45 to 1.84 kg/m2; P = 0.233), waist circumference (WMD, 0.92 cm; 95% CI, -1.34 to 3.17 cm; P = 0.497), and body fat (WMD, 1.02%; 95% CI, -0.38% to 2.42%; P = 0.153). The subgroup results indicated that after implementation of a GFD significant increased weight and body fat occurred in patients with compared with without CD. In addition, the effect of this diet on the increase of BMI and body fat in the intervention of more than 48 weeks was significantly higher. IMPLICATIONS: The results of the present study indicate that a GFD can have a significant and beneficial effect on weight and body fat in patients with CD.
37120973	Standard addition method (SAM) in LC-MS/MS to quantify gluten-derived metabolites in urine samples.	A tight adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD), the most effective treatment currently available for celiac disease, is important to reduce symptoms, avoid nutritional deficiencies and improve quality of life in celiac patients. The development of analytical methods allowing detecting gluten exposure due to occasional or involuntary food transgressions could represent a useful tool to monitor patient habits and conditions and prevent long-term complications. The aim of this work was to develop and validate an approach based on the standard addition methodology (SAM) for the detection and quantification of two main metabolites of alkylresorcinols, 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA) and 3-(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl)-propanoic acid (DHPPA), whose presence in urine samples is related to the intake of gluten-containing foods. Analytically, the method consisted of a protein precipitation step followed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. The chromatographic method involved the use of a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) in a direct phase approach; LC-MS/MS analyses were performed in selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode. Manipulation and instrumental errors were normalised using stable isotopic standards (ISs). The SAM approach here described requires less than 1 mL of urine per sample, thus greatly reducing the sample volume needed. Noteworthy, despite the small cohort of samples analysed, our data allowed to identify a potential "threshold" value, around 200 ng/mL for DHBA and 400 ng/mL for DHPPA, to discriminate between a GFD and a gluten rich diet (GRD).
25483467	Safety of AS03-adjuvanted inactivated split virion A(H1N1)pdm09 and H5N1 influenza virus vaccines administered to adults: pooled analysis of 28 clinical trials.	Clinical trials have shown that AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 and A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccines are highly immunogenic, although with an increased reactogenicity profile relative to non-adjuvanted vaccines in terms of the incidence of common injection site and systemic adverse events (AEs). We evaluated pooled safety data from 22,521 adults who had received an AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 or A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza or control vaccine with the purpose to identify medically-attended AEs (MAEs), including subsets of serious AEs (SAEs), potentially immune-mediated diseases (pIMDs), and AEs of special interest (AESI), and to explore a potential association of these AEs with the administration of an AS03-adjuvanted influenza vaccine. For participants who had received an AS03-adjuvanted vaccine, the relative risks (RRs) for experiencing a MAE or a SAE compared to control group (participants who had received a non-adjuvanted vaccine or saline placebo) were 1.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.9; 1.1) and 1.1 (95% CI: 0.9; 1.4), respectively. The overall RRs for experiencing an AESI or a pIMD (AS03-adjuvanted vaccine/control) were 1.2 (95% CI: 0.9; 1.6) and 1.7 (95% CI: 0.8; 3.8), respectively. Thirty-8 participants in the AS03-adjuvanted vaccine group had a pIMD reported after vaccine administration, yielding an incidence rate (IR) of 351.9 (95% CI: 249.1; 483.1) per 100,000 person-years. The estimated IRs in the AS03-adjuvanted vaccine group were greater than the literature reported rates for: facial paresis/VIIth nerve paralysis, celiac disease, thrombocytopenia and ulcerative colitis. These results do not support an association between AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 and A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccines and the AEs collected in the trials included in the analysis. 
39344879	Psychiatric Difficulties in Children with Celiac Disease and the Relationship between Adherence to Treatment and Parental Attitudes.	Our knowledge of the factors related to parenting styles affecting adherence to diet in children with celiac diseases (CDs) and the association between psychiatric difficulties and diet compliance is largely based on limited data. Therefore, our work aims to examine primarily coexisting psychiatric difficulties in children with CD and raising attitudes of their parents and secondarily the relationship among adherence to treatment, psychiatric difficulties, and parental attitudes. Children aged 4-12 years (n = 42) who have been followed up with the diagnosis of CD in a Paediatric Gastroenterology Outpatient Clinic were compared with those of healthy controls (n = 31). One of the parents was asked to fill out the socio-demographic information form, Diet Compliance Form (only the patient group), "Parental Attitude Research Instrument" (PARI) and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire-parent form (SDQ). The scores from "emotional problems," "peer relationship problems," and "total difficulties" areas were statistically significantly higher in the disease group than healthy controls. The average score of SDQ subscales and none of the PARI subscales differed between dietary compliance +/- groups. Significant positive correlations were detected between disease duration and PARI-overprotection/extreme motherhood (r = .421, P = .017) and PARI-strict/hard discipline (r = .368, P = .038) subscales. Clarifying the factors related to parenting that may affect patients' adherence to a gluten-free diet will contribute positively to the course of the disease and the quality of life of patients and their families.
36002677	Bi-directional Relationship Between Celiac Disease and Liver Chemistries: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	AIMS: Previous studies have reported conflicting results regarding prevalence of elevated LC (2-70%) in celiac disease (CD). This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the prevalence of elevated LC at time of CD diagnosis and associated response to GFD. We also report the prevalence of CD in patients with unexplained elevation of LC. METHODS: Studies assessing LC (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) in CD patients were eligible. Studies with < 50 cases or in pediatric populations were excluded. RESULTS: In total, 20 studies assessing prevalence of elevated LC in 4,265 participants with newly diagnosed CD (mean age = 35.6 +- 6.5 years, 69.8% female) were included. Pooled prevalence of elevated LC was 18.7% (95% CI 13.8-24.8; I2 = 95%). Normalization of elevated LC was seen in 83.1% (95% CI 73.4-89.7; I2 = 79%, 11 studies) of patients after GFD. On meta-regression, age at CD diagnosis, gender, and Marsh grading were not associated with elevated LC. Among 979 participants (7 studies) with unexplained elevation of LC, pooled seroprevalence and biopsy-proven CD was 6.4% (95% CI 2.9-10.3, I2 = 71%) and 4.5% (95% CI 2.6-7.7, I2 = 67%), respectively. CONCLUSION: Elevated LC are seen in approximately one-fifth of patients at CD diagnosis with majority normalizing after GFD. Age, gender, and degree of intestinal damage are not predictive of elevated LC. In the appropriate clinical scenario, liver tests should be serially monitored in CD reserving workup for additional causes after a trial of GFD. Patients with unexplained elevation of liver tests should be screened for celiac disease.
29763907	Beyond Irritable Bowel Syndrome: The Efficacy of the Low Fodmap Diet for Improving Symptoms in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases and Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: To evaluate the usefulness of a low FODMAP (Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, and Polyols) diet on patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), non-active inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), and celiac disease (CD) on a gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: Dietetic interventional prospective study. IBS, IBD, and CD subjects were evaluated to check if they fulfilled the Rome III criteria. Each subject was educated to follow a low FODMAP diet after being evaluated by filling out questionnaires that assessed the quality of life (QoL) and symptoms experienced (IBS-SSS and SF-36), and was reevaluated after 1 and 3 months. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-seven subjects were enrolled: 56 with IBS, 30 with IBD, and 41 with CD. IBS-SSS showed that abdominal symptoms improved after 1 and 3 months of diet in all subjects, with significant difference among the 3 groups at T0 (average scores IBS: 293 +- 137, IBD: 206 +- 86, CD: 222 +- 65, p < 0.001), but no difference at T3 (IBS: 88 +- 54, IBD: 73 +- 45, CD: 77 +- 49, p = ns). By analyzing the SF-36 questionnaire, we did not observe any difference between the 3 groups, in terms of response to diet (p = ns), we observed a clinical improvement from T0 to T3 for most of the questionnaire's domains. CONCLUSIONS: A low FODMAP diet could be a valid option to counter -abdominal symptoms in patients with IBS, non-active IBD, or CD on a GFD, and thus, improve their QoL and social -relations.
27480555	[An analysis of clinical features of celiac disease patients in different ethnic].	OBJECTIVE: To summarize the clinical features of different racial patients with celiac disease (CD) and analyze the disease prevalence, diagnosis and treatment in Chinese population. METHODS: All the patients were diagnosed as CD and enrolled in Beijing United Family Hospital between January 2005 and July 2015.Clinical data including nationality, age, symptoms, endoscopic and pathological findings, outcome were collected and compared in patients from different countries. RESULTS: A total of 87 patients were enrolled including 63 Caucasians, 18 Asian patients and 6 Middle East patients.The peak age of disease onset was 40-60 years old.Patients with typical symptoms such as chronic diarrhea and weight loss only accounted for 20.7%(18/87) and 9.2%(8/87) respectively.Some patients presented with nonspecific symptoms such as abdominal pain and bloating [32.2%(28/87)], even constipation [5.7%(5/87)].13.8%(12/87) patients were previously diagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome.The incidence of abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea and constipation between Asians and Caucasians had no statistical significance (P>0.05); but the proportions of weight loss, growth retardation, iron deficiency anemia and dermatitis herpetiformis in Asian group were significantly higher than that in Caucasian group (P<0.05). IgA type of anti-gliadin antibody (AGA), endomysium antibody (EMA) and tissue transglutaminase antibody (tTGA) were dominant autoimmune antibodies in patients with CD, which accounted for 58.6%(51/87), 44.8%(39/87) and 36.8%(32/87) respectively.The endoscopy showed that the lesion of CD was mainly located in small intestine, with reducing severity from the proximal to the distal small intestine.The lesions of duodenal bulb and descending duodenum appeared more significant in Asian group.Accordingly pathological intestinal atrophy and the degree of intraepithelial lymphocytosis were more severe in Asian patients.All 87 cases took the gluten-free diet (GFD). Eighty-one cases received serological follow up and 8 with endoscopic intestinal biopsy.The celiac disease antibodies in 47 patients turned negative from 6-9 months after GFD treatment, while 34 patients turned negative from 12-18 months after GFD.All patients reported disease remission to some extent.After 1 year GFD treatment, the pathology of endoscopic intestinal biopsy in 8 patients showed significant improvement of villous atrophy and lymphocyte infiltration. CONCLUSIONS: CD patients with typical clinical manifestations are not the majority.Serological celiac disease antibodies (AGA, EMA and tTGA) have a high diagnostic value.GFD treatment is effective on majority of celiac patients.Clinical manifestations, endoscopy, intestinal pathology, and response to GFD in Chinese patients are not the same as Caucasians.Clinicians need to pay attention to the differential diagnosis.
21240025	A biopsy is not always necessary to diagnose celiac disease.	OBJECTIVES: Small intestinal histology is the criterion standard for the diagnosis of celiac disease (CD). However, results of serological tests such as anti-endomysium antibodies and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTGA) are becoming increasingly reliable. This raises the question of whether a small intestinal biopsy is always necessary. The aim of the present study was, therefore, to investigate whether a small intestinal biopsy can be avoided in a selected group of patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serology and histological slides obtained from 283 pediatric patients suspected of having CD were examined retrospectively. The response to a gluten-free diet (GFD) in patients with a tTGA level >= 100 U/mL was investigated. RESULTS: A tTGA level >= 100 U/mL was found in 128 of the 283 patients. Upon microscopic examination of the small intestinal epithelium, villous atrophy was found in 124 of these patients, confirming the presence of CD. Three patients had crypt hyperplasia or an increased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes. In 1 patient no histological abnormalities were found. This patient did not respond to a GFD. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients with a tTGA level >= 100 U/mL in whom symptoms improve upon consuming a GFD may not need a small intestinal biopsy to confirm CD.
24933989	[Serum metabolome by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in patients with ulcerative colitis and celiac disease].	Metabolomics is the emerging science of measurement and analysis of metabolome--the complete set of low molecular weight compounds in a cell, tissue, organ or whole organism. One of the aims of metabolomics is to research the response of an organism to a pathophysiological insult by measuring the concentrations of small molecule metabolites in biofluids and tissues and its dynamics. Intestinal microbiota is most probably involved in the development and maintenance of autoimmune inflammation in ulcerative colitis and celiac disease. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC - MS) of serum generates comprehensive metabolic profiles, reflecting integrated human (systemic) and gut microbial metabolism which may be altered in disease states. The aim of this study was to investigate GC - MS-based serum metabolomic profiles in UC and CD patients. Serum metabolic profiles were collected from 75 individuals: 20 patients with mild-moderate active UC, 35 CD patients, and 20 healthy controls (HC). We characterized 84 serum metabolites by use GC-MS. 18 metabolites at least have a combined (human + microbial) origin. In serum of UC patients, phenylacetic acid (PAA), 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (4-HPAA), 3-indolylacetic acid (IAA), succinic acid (SA) and fumaric acid (FA) were the metabolites most prominently increased, whereas 3-phenylpropionic acid (PPA) was significantly decreased. Serum of CD patients showed significant increases in IAA, 3-indolepropionic acid (IPA), SA and FA. Increased serum levels of succinic acid suggest its possible damaging effect on intestinal mucosa especially in ulcerative colitis. Orally administered butyrate + inulin as supplement to mesalazine in UC or gluten free diet in CD was effective in reducing disease activity with a marked improvement of serum metabolomic profiles (including SA reduction) and gut microbiota in both diseases. There were no any adverse events.
23918040	Celiac disease and chronic liver disease: is there a relationship?	Celiac disease is a multisystem disease, and the liver is affected in a subset of patients. We herein present a case series of 25 patients with celiac disease who had evidence of cirrhosis of the liver. We retrospectively reviewed the case records of patients with celiac disease having concomitant cirrhosis. The diagnosis of celiac disease was made on the basis of the modified European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition criteria. Of 25 patients (nine males; mean age 28.8 +- 16.6 years) with celiac disease and cirrhosis, 17 patients presented predominantly with cirrhosis, while 8 presented primarily with celiac disease. Five patients had known cause of cirrhosis (autoimmune hepatitis, three; PBC, one; hepatic venous outflow tract obstruction, one); the remaining 20 were cryptogenic. Gluten-free diet led to improvement in diarrhea and anemia and to a better control of ascites and other features of liver failure. Some patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis have coexistent celiac disease, and they show response to gluten-free diet. Patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis should be screened for celiac disease. 
26438584	Celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity.	Celiac disease is a multisystem immune based disorder that is triggered by the ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. The prevalence of celiac disease has risen in recent decades and is currently about 1% in most Western populations. The reason for this rise is unknown, although environmental factors related to the hygiene hypothesis are suspected. The pathophysiology of celiac disease involves both the innate and adaptive immune response to dietary gluten. Clinical features are diverse and include gastrointestinal symptoms, metabolic bone disease, infertility, and many other manifestations. Although a gluten-free diet is effective in most patients, this diet can be burdensome and can limit quality of life; consequently, non-dietary therapies are at various stages of development. This review also covers non-celiac gluten sensitivity. The pathophysiology of this clinical phenotype is poorly understood, but it is a cause of increasing interest in gluten-free diets in the general population. 
30045167	Autoimmune and Allergic Disorders are More Common in People With Celiac Disease or on a Gluten-free Diet in the United States.	GOALS: We analyzed demographics, lifestyle patterns, and clinical characteristics of people with celiac disease (CD) and people without CD avoiding gluten (PWAG) to better understand associations with medical conditions and consumer behavior. BACKGROUND: Clinical significance of CD and gluten avoidance in the general population is incompletely understood. Recently, a high incidence of CD in adolescents with susceptibility genotypes, similar to other autoimmune or allergic disorders, and regional differences in consumer practices of gluten avoidance were reported. METHODS: Among 22,277 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2009-2014, we identified persons with CD by testing CD serology or by both a health care provider diagnosis and adherence to a gluten-free diet. Similarly, PWAG were defined as adherent to a gluten-free diet without a CD diagnosis. Consumer behavior and characteristics of both groups, CD and PWAG were compared with those without these conditions, using survey-weighted generalized logistic regression. RESULTS: Participants with CD considered nutrition very important when grocery shopping and tended to have more constipation and thyroid disease. PWAG tended to spend more money on groceries, purchase organic foods, and check food labels more frequently during grocery shopping. They also reported having more food allergies, asthma, and thyroid disease. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that CD and PWAG share comorbidities of autoimmune nature. PWAG had more autoimmune/allergy-related disorders that may be associated with non-celiac gluten sensitivity a self-justifiable reason to be on the diet.
33079752	"ASKing" the Right Questions About Screening for Celiac Disease.	ABSTRACT: Make a distinction between investigating symptoms and screening for disease. Understand the performance characteristics of a test for those with symptoms and for screening those without symptoms, whether at elevated risk or average risk of disease. Positive test results require patient education and follow-up. Importantly, screening should be advantageous to an individual, and disease treatment should be in their interest. The practical application of these principles in relation to population-based Celiac disease screening may be difficult, as a large Colorado study has found.

24705698	Clinical utility of celiac disease-associated HLA testing.	BACKGROUND: Negative predictive value (NPV) of celiac disease (CD)-related human leukocyte antigens (HLA) DQ2 and DQ8 approaches 100 % in individual patients. However, studies evaluating its exclusionary utility in patient groups are lacking. AIM: We aim to assess the performance of HLA testing when applied to patient groups with varying characteristics and propose evidence-based recommendations for its clinical use. METHODS: Demographic and clinical information was recorded in patients undergoing HLA testing. Using predetermined criteria, patients were classified as CD, non-CD, or indeterminate. Diagnostic yield of HLA testing was defined as the percentage of patients in whom CD could be excluded based on negative HLA test. RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty-six patients underwent testing for CD-related HLA DQ2 and DQ8. 102 (100 non-CD, 2 CD) patients tested HLA negative for a 98 % NPV and 39 % diagnostic yield. Diagnostic yield was highest (60 %) in patients with intraepithelial lymphocytosis plus normal IgA tissue transglutaminase antibody (IgA-tTG) and lowest in patients with positive IgA-tTG plus villous atrophy (0 %). CD was diagnosed in two HLA-negative patients, who carried half of DQ2.5 trans genotype. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic yield of CD-related HLA testing varies widely depending on clinical indication. HLA testing is a practical and valuable test for most patients in whom initial evaluation for CD is inconclusive. A negative HLA result usually obviates the need for further celiac testing including endoscopy and gluten challenge. Rarely, in patients reported as HLA negative, half of HLA DQ2.5 (cis or trans) is sufficient for development of CD.
26267424	Quality of Life and Gastrointestinal Symptoms in Long-Term Treated Dermatitis Herpetiformis Patients: A Cross-Sectional Study in Finland.	BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease. Both conditions are treated with a restrictive life-long gluten-free diet (GFD). Treated celiac disease patients have been shown to have more severe gastrointestinal symptoms and inferior quality of life compared with healthy controls, but evidence regarding quality of life in DH is lacking. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate whether long-term GFD-treated DH patients suffer from persistent gastrointestinal symptoms and if they experience a drawdown in quality of life. METHODS: Gastrointestinal symptoms and quality of life were assessed in 78 long-term GFD-treated DH patients using the validated Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale, Psychological General Well-Being and Short Form 36 Health Survey questionnaires. The findings were compared with 110 healthy controls, population-based reference values and 371 treated celiac disease controls. RESULTS: The median age of the DH patients at the time of the study was 57 years, and 51 % were male. Significant differences in gastrointestinal symptoms or quality of life were not detected when treated DH patients were compared with healthy controls, but treated DH patients had less severe gastrointestinal symptoms and increased quality of life compared with celiac disease controls. Female DH patients had more severe gastrointestinal symptoms and reduced vitality compared with male DH patients. The presence of skin symptoms and the adherence to or duration of GFD did not have any influence on gastrointestinal symptoms or quality of life. CONCLUSION: We conclude that long-term GFD-treated DH patients do not suffer from the burden of dietary treatment and have a quality of life comparable to that of controls.
32599449	Nutritional management of celiac crisis in an elderly adult: A case report of the rare presentation of celiac disease in a 75-y-old woman.	In adults, a very uncommon presentation of celiac disease (CD) is a celiac crisis, a life-threatening and severe form of the disease having a dramatic onset with diarrhea and metabolic acidosis with electrolyte and fluid imbalance. Treatment of celiac crisis requires a gluten-free diet; however, the risk for refeeding syndrome (RFS) should be considered in patients showing marked malabsorption symptoms and important unintentional weight loss. Therefore, to avoid metabolic and potentially fatal complications of re-nutrition, nutritional management is crucial for a safe recovery after a celiac crisis. This review reports the rare onset of celiac crisis in a 75-y-old woman presenting with severe malnutrition resulting in >40% weight loss in 3 mo, after a period of severe diarrhea and vomiting. She arrived at the hospital showing electrolyte imbalance, hypoalbuminemia, lower limb edema, multiple bowel movements (>10/d) with steatorrhea, sarcopenia with profound asthenia, hyporexia due to intolerance to any food, and vomiting after meals. After being diagnosed with CD, the first approach was a gluten-free diet, which demonstrated only small and slow improvements of gastrointestinal symptoms. Therefore, a second approach was parenteral nutrition (PN) support that dramatically helped the patient's recovery. Here we describe the nutritional management during the inpatient stay for clinical stabilization and the following outpatient visits during and after the support with PN, until the patient's complete recovery to a regular follow-up.
22994063	[The organization of comprehensive rehabilitation of the children presenting with inflammatory intestinal diseases and celiacia under the conditions of a health resort].	In this study we report the experience with the provision of rehabilitative services for the children presenting with long-standing chronic diseases of the digestive organs (ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, celiac disease) based at a regional health resort. The possibility of comprehensive rehabilitation was substantiated with the contribution by non-medical specialists including a psychologist, social worker, and educator. A number of organizational problems related to rehabilitation logistics and scientific support have been successfully solved. Standard programs comprising the mechanisms of comprehensive rehabilitation and methods for the evaluation of its effectiveness are proposed.
28370110	Steady, dynamic and structural deformation (three interval thixotropy test) characteristics of gluten-free Tarhana soup prepared with different concentrations of quinoa flour.	Celiac disease is among the most important health problems and the most important feature of this disease is its being the only lifelong food allergy. To overcome this problem, some gluten-free and starch based food products have been generally introduced to the market; however, these products are starch based with low nutritive value. Therefore, it is important to enrich such products for individuals who are obliged to be nourished by gluten-free diet. In this study, wheat flour was replaced with quinoa flour (QF) in the production of tarhana. The objective of this work was to investigate the steady shear, viscoelastic and deformation and recovery properties (applying three interval thixotropy test (3ITT)) of gluten-free tarhana soups prepared with different concentrations of QF (40%, 50%, and 60%). It was found that the soups fitted well (R2  > 0.99) Ostwald de Waele model and exhibited shear thinning behavior. Besides, elastic properties dominated the viscous properties. Although the maximum deformation and recovery were determined at 40% concentration level, minimum deformation and recovery properties were specified at 60% concentration level. The results suggest that QF can be used in gluten-free tarhana formulations to enhance rheological properties. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Malnutrition is currently widespread in many areas of the world. Therefore, it must be focused on the cheap, but nutritious plant protein and mineral sources, such as legume and cereals. Several recent studies have showed the successful formulation of pseudocereal containing cereal based products. Tarhana is a traditional fermented food made of mainly a mixture cereal and yoghurt. Tarhana or tarhana-like products have been enriched or replaced with cereal and pseudocereal. In this research, the applicability of QF in traditional tarhana production were investigated. As a result, it is advisable to replace wheat flour with QF in products such as tarhana, couscous, noodle and pasta formulation for nutritional and sensory properties enrichment. The results suggest that QF can be used in gluten-free tarhana formulations to enhance rheological properties.
36597078	Extra-intestinal manifestations of Celiac disease in children: their prevalence and association with human leukocyte antigens and pathological and laboratory evaluations.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease caused by gluten intake. Traditionally CD was believed to be a disease of the gut, although a wide range of extra-intestinal manifestations (EIM) was recognized. The exact prevalence of EIM and the associated risk factors have not been well studied. AIM: We aimed to assess the prevalence of EIM in children with CD and their association with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing, and pathological and laboratory indices. METHOD: We conducted a cross-sectional study on children and adolescents with a definite diagnosis of CD. They were followed in the main Celiac Clinic of Southern Iran. RESULTS: We included 204 children who were visited between 2012 and 2017. Nearly 85% of them were positive for HLA-DQ2 and 40.6% for HLA-DQ8. The most prevalent intestinal complaints reported were abdominal pain (42.6%) and chronic constipation (19.1%). Failure-to-thrive (32.7%), iron deficiency anemia (25%), short stature (20.5%), and eczema (18.6%) were the most common EIMs. However, failure-to-thrive and short stature were presented at significantly younger ages, whereas those patients with concomitant type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) were significantly older. We also found significant relationships between autoimmune thyroid disease and HLA-DQ5, and the presence of headaches with HLA-DQ7. The prevalence of HLA types of DQ2, DQ8, DQ6, and DQ7 significantly varied among different Marsh groups. Patients who were positive for HLA-DQ8, were significantly older, taller, and weightier. No significant association was found between HLA types and any of the gastrointestinal symptoms, anti-tTG and compliance to gluten free diet. Moreover, there were no statistically significant differences detected between the presence of each individual EIM, the level of IgA anti-tTG, sex, and Marsh typing. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the presence of EIM in CD and their associated factors. We show the potential role of HLA typing in some EIMs, which may shed light for future studies.
30725059	[Characterization of celiac disease in chilean public hospitals].	INTRODUCTION: The worldwide prevalence of celiac disease (CD) is ~1% of the population. In Chile, the National Health Survey 2009-2010 showed a serological prevalence in individuals older than 15 years of 0.76% (IgA-tTG2), which corresponded in Concepcion to 0.6%. OBJECTIVE: Determine cli nical characteristics, search, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of CD in the two public hospitals in Concepcion that have a Gastroenterology Department. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Descriptive study. Data were collected from electronic medical records (CIE10 code) and medical records of patients youn ger than 18 years of age, assessed for CD during 2010 - 2016 from two public hospitals in the city of Concepcion, Chile. Cases whose diagnostic protocol met the ESPGHAN 2012 criteria (confirmation with intestinal biopsy), 207 out of 216 identified patients met the inclusion criteria. The nutritional status was classified according to age group (in children under five years old by WHO 2006 and in children between five and 18 years old by WHO 2007). The Z-score (Z) was calculated using the WHO Anthro software (in children under five years old) and WHO Anthro Plus software (in those between five and 18 years old). Antiendomysial antibodies were assessed by immunofluorescence test in cuts of the esophagus of mono, IgA and IgG anti-transglutaminase antibodies via ELISA, as well as serum IgA. RESULTS: CD was confirmed by duodenal biopsies in 33.8% of the patients. IgA-tTG was identified in 70% and IgG-tTG in 52.9%, although only two patients had IgA deficiency. The main reasons for consultation were gastrointestinal (80%) and/or referral by an endocrinologist (45.7%). The main clinical presentation was gastrointestinal, with diarrhea (71.4%). 17.1% of the patients had Down syndrome (DS), 11.4% short stature, and 5.7% had type 1 diabetes mellitus. At diagnosis, the obesitymalnutrition ratio (Z-score BMI) was 2:1 and 6.8% of the patients were obese. One year after diagnosis, in 26 patients without DS, the frequency of eutrophic patients decreased from 65.4% to 42.3%, increasing overweight from 23.1% to 34.6% and obesity from 0 to 7.7%. CONCLUSIONS: In Con cepcion, endocrinologists conduct a significant and successful active search of CD, being responsible for 47.3% of the diagnoses. The high proportion of overweight/obese patients is consistent with the phenomenon currently described in Chile and other countries.
21553065	Primary hyperparathyroidism revealed by gluten-free diet in a woman with celiac disease.	
25022269	Isotretinoin use and celiac disease: a population-based cross-sectional study.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: Isotretinoin, a vitamin A analogue, can promote a pro-inflammatory milieu in the small intestine in response to dietary antigens. We hypothesized that oral isotretinoin exposure would increase the risk of celiac disease (CD). METHODS: We contacted all 28 pathology departments in Sweden, and through biopsy reports identified 26,739 individuals with CD. We then compared the prevalence of ever using oral isotretinoin to the prevalence in 134,277 matched controls through conditional logistic regression. Data on isotretinoin exposure were obtained from the national Swedish Prescribed Drug Registry. As the only indication for isotretinoin use in Sweden is acne, we also examined its relationship to CD. Data on acne were obtained from the Swedish Patient Registry. RESULTS: Ninety-three individuals with CD (0.35 %) and 378 matched controls (0.28 %) had a prescription of isotretinoin. This corresponded to an odds ratio (OR) of 1.22 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.97-1.54]. Risk estimates were similar in men and women, and when we restricted our data to individuals diagnosed after the start of the Prescribed Drug Registry. Restricting our analyses to individuals diagnosed aged 12-45 years did not influence the risk estimates (OR 1.38, 95 % CI 0.97-1.97). Meanwhile, having a diagnosis of acne was positively associated with CD (OR 1.34, 95 % CI 1.20-1.51). CONCLUSIONS: This study found no association between isotretinoin use and CD, but a small excess risk of CD in patients with a diagnosis of acne.
30513876	Are Gluten-Free Diets More Nutritious? An Evaluation of Self-Selected and Recommended Gluten-Free and Gluten-Containing Dietary Patterns.	Gluten-free (GF) eating patterns are frequently perceived to be healthier than gluten-containing (GC) ones, but there has been very little research to evaluate this viewpoint. The effect of GF eating patterns on dietary composition was assessed using two independent approaches. One approach compared macronutrients and typical shortfall nutrients between MyPlate example menus developed with either GC or equivalent GF foods. In this analysis, the GF menus were significantly lower in protein, magnesium, potassium, vitamin E, folate, and sodium (p = 0.002-0.03), with suggestive trends towards lower calcium and higher fat (p = 0.06-0.08). The second approach was a meta-analysis of seven studies comparing information on the nutrient intakes of adults with celiac disease following a GF diet with control subjects eating a GC diet, and differences were evaluated using paired t-tests or Wilcoxon Signed rank tests. In this analysis, consuming a GF diet was associated with higher energy and fat intakes, and lower fiber and folate intakes compared to controls (p < 0.001 to p = 0.03). After adjusting for heterogeneity and accounting for the large mean effect size (-0.88 +- 0.09), the lower fiber remained significant (p < 0.001). These combined analyses indicate that GF diets are not nutritionally superior except for sodium, and in several respects are actually worse.
37554764	Effect of gluten-free diet on autoimmune thyroiditis progression in patients with no symptoms or histology of celiac disease: a meta-analysis.	Background: Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is the most common autoimmune disease. HT may be associated with nonthyroidal autoimmune diseases, including celiac disease (CD) or other gluten-related conditions (GRC). In the last years, interest about gluten-free diet (GFD) has increased for its supposed extraintestinal anti-inflammatory effect; thus, many patients with HT initiate GFD on their own. Objectives: The aim of this meta-analysis is to examine all available data in literature about the effect of a GFD on TgAb, TPOAb, TSH, FT4, and FT3 levels in patients with HT and no symptoms or histology of CD. Methods: The study was conducted according to MOOSE (Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology). The search was performed on databases PubMed and Scopus. The last search was performed on 7 February 2023. Quality assessment was performed. Meta-analyses were performed using the random-effect model. Hedges' g was used to measure the effect size (ES). Statistical analyses were performed using StataSE 17. Results: The online search retrieved 409 articles, and 4 studies with a total of 87 patients were finally included for quantitative analysis. The risk of bias was generally low. The mean period of GFD was almost 6 months. The meta-analyses showed reduction in antibody levels with ES: -0.39 for TgAb (95% CI: -0.81 to +0.02; p = 0.06; I2 = 46.98%) and -0.40 for TPOAb (95% CI: -0.82 to +0.03; p = 0.07; I2 = 47.58%). TSH showed a reduction with ES: -0.35 (95% CI: -0.64 to -0.05; p = 0.02; I2 = 0%) and FT4 showed an increase with ES: +0.35% (95% CI: 0.06 to 0.64; p = 0.02; I2 = 0%). FT3 did not display variations (ES: 0.05; 95% CI: -0.38 to +0.48; p = 0.82; I2 = 51%). The heterogeneity of TgAb, TPOAb, and FT3 data was solved performing sub-analyses between patients with or without GRC (TgAb p = 0.02; TPOAb p = 0.02; FT3 p = 0.04) and only for FT3, performing a sub-analysis between patients taking and not taking LT4 (p = 0.03). Conclusion: This is the first meta-analysis investigating the effect of GFD on HT. Our results seem to indicate a positive effect of the gluten deprivation on thyroid function and its inflammation, particularly in patients with HT and GRC. However, current lines of evidence are not yet sufficient to recommend this dietary approach to all patients with a diagnosis of HT.
26496241	Prevalence and Characteristics of Duodenal Villous Atrophy in Renal Transplant Patients Presenting With Persistent Diarrhea in a Developing Country.	OBJECTIVES: Persistent diarrhea is a common complication after solid-organ transplant, including kidney transplant. Data on duodenal villous atrophy as a cause of persistent diarrhea in renal transplant recipients are scarce. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective analysis of 207 patients who received renal transplants from 2009 to 2012 with persistent diarrhea and who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and duodenal biopsies. Duodenal biopsies were examined for duodenal villous atrophy. Age, sex, transplant duration, and drugs were compared between patients with and without duodenal villous atrophy. After exclusion of known causes of duodenal villous atrophy, a 3-month course of antibiotics was given and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 207 renal transplant recipients, 104 patients (49.8%) displayed duodenal villous atrophy. Of these, 92 (88.5%) were male patients. The mean age of patients with duodenal villous atrophy was 34.9 +- 10.3 years. The mean onset of persistent diarrhea in DVA-positive patients posttransplant was 2.16 +- 0.8 years. Celiac disease serology was positive in 18 (17.3) patients. Giardiasis was demonstrated in 11 patients (10.7%), whereas immunoproliferative small intestinal disease was shown in 7 patients (6.8%). The remaining 68 patients (65.38%) received antibiotics, with 50 recipients (74.6%) showing complete response, although 13 of these patients (26%) relapsed. Among the remaining 18 patients (26.47%), 9 (50%) had other causes and 9 (50%) had no cause found. Isoniazid prophylaxis showed statistically significant negative association with duodenal villous atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: Duodenal villous atrophy is highly prevalent in renal transplant recipients irrespective of age, sex, and posttransplant duration. We found tropical sprue, giardiasis, immunoproliferative small intestinal disease, and celiac disease to be important causes of duodenal villous atrophy. Therefore, duodenal biopsy is recommended in renal transplant recipients with persistent diarrhea.
31953154	Nutrition Assessment, Interventions, and Monitoring for Patients with Celiac Disease: An Evidence Analysis Center Scoping Review.	The objectives of this scoping review were to identify and characterize studies examining nutrition assessment, interventions, and measures to monitor gluten-free diet (GFD) adherence/compliance in patients with celiac disease (CD). An electronic literature search of four databases (Cochrane Database for systematic reviews, CINAHL, Embase, and Ovid MEDLINE) was conducted to identify articles examining nutrition care in CD individuals. Except for narrative review, grey literature, and case study/report, all types of peer-reviewed articles published between January 2007 and August 2018 were eligible. There were a total of 10,823 records; 10,368 were excluded during the first round of screening due to irrelevancy and/or duplication. Of the 455 full-text articles that were assessed, 292 met the criteria and were included. Most of the studies were observational studies (n=212), followed by experimental trials (n=50), evidence-based practice guideline (EBPG)/report/statement (n=16), and systematic review (SR) (n=14). Nine original studies examined assessment, focusing mainly on different tools/ways to assess GFD adherence. The majority of the included original articles (n=235) were in the nutrition intervention category with GFD, oats, and prebiotics/probiotics as the top-three most studied interventions. There were eight SRs on GFD and five on oats. One SR and 21 original studies investigated the effectiveness of different measures to monitor GFD adherence/compliance. Although recent CD EBPGs were identified, different methods with varying levels of rigor, in terms of literature search and assessment of evidence strength, were used. Based on this scoping review, interventions focused on gluten-free diet and oats have been significantly covered by either SRs or EBPGs. Studies related to prebiotics/probiotics and education program/counseling focused interventions, as well as assessment, in CD patients have increased in recent years. Thus, it might be beneficial to conduct SRs/EBPGs focused on these topics to guide practitioners.
34797778	Plasma IL-2 and Symptoms Response after Acute Gluten Exposure in Subjects With Celiac Disease or Nonceliac Gluten Sensitivity.	INTRODUCTION: Treated patients with celiac disease (CeD) and nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) report acute, transient, incompletely understood symptoms after suspected gluten exposure. To determine whether (i) blinded gluten exposure induces symptoms, (ii) subjects accurately identify gluten exposure, and (iii) serum interleukin-2 (IL-2) levels distinguish CeD from NCGS subjects after gluten exposure. METHODS: Sixty subjects (n = 20 treated, healed CeD; n = 20 treated NCGS; n = 20 controls) were block randomized to a single, double-blind sham (rice flour) or 3-g gluten challenge with 72-hours follow-up. Twelve serial questionnaires (100 mm visual analog scale; pain, bloating, nausea, and fatigue) and 10 serial plasma samples were collected. Mucosal permeability was assessed using both urinary lactulose-13C mannitol ratios and endoscopic mucosal impedance. RESULTS: Thirty-five of 40 (83%) subjects with CeD and NCGS reported symptoms with gluten (8 CeD, 9 NCGS) and sham (9 CeD, 9 NCGS) compared with 9 of 20 (45%) controls after gluten (n = 6) and sham (n = 3). There was no significant difference in symptoms among groups. Only 2 of 10 subjects with CeD and 4 of 10 NCGS identified gluten, whereas 8 of 10 subjects with CeD and 5 of 10 NCGS identified sham. A significant plasma IL-2 increase occurred only in subjects with CeD after gluten, peaking at 3 hours and normalizing within 24 hours postchallenge despite no significant intestinal permeability change from baseline. DISCUSSION: Symptoms do not reliably indicate gluten exposure in either subjects with CeD or NCGS. IL-2 production indicates a rapid-onset gluten-induced T-cell activation in CeD despite long-standing treatment. The effector site is unknown, given no increased intestinal permeability after gluten.

21794776	[Anti-transglutaminase, antigladin and ultra purified anti-gladin antibodies in patients with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis].	UNLABELLED: Celiac disease (CD) is an enteric disease caused by dietary gluten in individuals with genetic predisposition. One of the clinical manifestations of CD is the peripheral arthritis that may simulate RA. OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of anti-gliadin (aGL), anti-tissue transglutaminase (aTGT) and ultra purified anti-gliadin (AGLU) antibodies in patients with RA. METHODS: Cross-sectional study. We included consecutive patients diagnosed as RA (ACR). Demographic and clinical data was registered by direct interview and serum levels of aGL, aTGT y aGLU were determined using ELISA. RESULTS: Eighty-five RA patients were included; 87% were women. Mean age was 44+-12 years, mean disease duration 12 +-9 years. aGL IgG antibodies were positive in 16 patients, IgA aGL antibodies in 29 patients, aGLU in 14 patients and only one patient had aTGT. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible that CD may be the correct diagnosis in a patient with polyarthritis, even if the patient meets the ACR criteria for RA. In other words, CD should be considered among the differential diagnoses in a patient with poly-arthritis.

25529703	Influence of dietary components on Aspergillus niger prolyl endoprotease mediated gluten degradation.	Celiac disease (CD) is caused by intolerance to gluten. Oral supplementation with enzymes like Aspergillus niger propyl-endoprotease (AN-PEP), which can hydrolyse gluten, has been proposed to prevent the harmful effects of ingestion of gluten. The influence of meal composition on AN-PEP activity was investigated using an in vitro model that simulates stomach-like conditions. AN-PEP optimal dosage was 20 proline protease units (PPU)/g gluten. The addition of a carbonated drink strongly enhanced AN-PEP activity because of its acidifying effect. While fat did not affect gluten degradation by AN-PEP, the presence of food proteins slowed down gluten detoxification. Moreover, raw gluten was degraded more efficiently by AN-PEP than baked gluten. We conclude that the meal composition influences the amount of AN-PEP needed for gluten elimination. Therefore, AN-PEP should not be used to replace a gluten free diet, but rather to support digestion of occasional and/or inadvertent gluten consumption. 
24854294	Effect of tiger nut-derived products in gluten-free batter and bread.	Tiger nut is a tuber used to produce tiger nut milk that yields a high quantity of solid waste, which can be dried and used as fiber source. The objective of this paper was to evaluate the quality of gluten-free bread formulated with different tiger nut-derived products in order to substitute soya flour (which is an allergen ingredient) and, at the same time, increase the use of tiger nut-derived products. Four gluten-free formulations based on corn starch and containing tiger nut milk, tiger nut milk by-product, tiger nut flour, or soya flour (as reference formulation) were studied. Tiger nut milk increased G' of gluten-free batter and rendered breads with the softest crumb (502.46 g +- 102.05), the highest loaf-specific volume (3.35 cm(3)/g +- 0.25), and it was mostly preferred by consumers (61.02%). Breads elaborated with tiger nut flour had similar characteristics than soya flour breads (except in color and crumb structure). The addition of tiger nut milk by-product resulted in a hard (1047.64 g +- 145.74) and dark (L(*)  = 70.02 +- 3.38) crumb bread, which was the least preferred by consumers. Results showed that tiger nut is a promising ingredient to formulate gluten-free baked products. 
32126832	Folate content of gluten-free food purchases and dietary intake are low in children with coeliac disease.	The lack of mandated folate enrichment of gluten-free (GF) grains in Canada has been suspected to contribute to suboptimal folate intake among children suffering from Celiac disease (CD). Children with CD on the gluten-free diet (GFD) face nutrient imbalances (higher fat/sugar, lower folate) from processed GF foods. The study objective examined folate intake in children with CD and folate content of household food purchases. Households collected food receipts for 30 days to assess folate content. Folate-rich foods were defined as >=60 microg dietary folate equivalent (DFE)/100g. Two 24-hour recalls assessed children's intake. Households (n = 73) purchased >17,000 food items. Median child age was 10.5 y (IQR: 8.4-14.1). GF folate-rich foods represented <15% of all household food purchases and 69% of children had low folate intakes. Folate-rich foods consumed included legumes/GF-breakfast cereals. These represented 5% of GF-food purchases/intake. Few were fortified with folate. Findings highlight the need for mandated GF folate food fortification policy.
34053062	Gut Microbiota, the Immune System, and Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes.	Gut microbiota, the largest microbial community living in the human body, exerts a variety of metabolic, structural, and functional actions. In particular, it is essential for the full immune system development and maturation, as demonstrated by studies on germ-free animals, showing immune impairment at different levels. Gut microbiota shapes the immune responses by promoting immune tolerance toward food antigens and commensals in the steady state. This process is orchestrated by a complex network of both microbial and human cells and molecular mediators. Microbiota eubiosis is fundamental in establishing a correct balance between tolerance and immunity. Contrarily, microbiota dysbiosis is correlated with alterations in the immune balance, as evidenced in intestinal pathologies characterized by aberrant immune responses, such as inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease, in which either break of tolerance against commensals or microbial dysbiosis is reported. On the other hand, a role for gut microbiota in stimulating the cytotoxic immune response in contexts of immunosuppression, like the ones featuring tumors and vaccinations, is emerging. The bifaceted role of gut microbiota in the delicate balance between tolerance and immunity could be exploited in order to develop pioneering therapeutic strategies, complementary to the pharmacological ones, thus representing a field worthy of further studies specifically focused on this topic.

32686439	A comparison of the nutritional profile and price of gluten-free products and their gluten-containing counterparts available in the Spanish market.	INTRODUCTION: Background: to date, gluten-free (GF) diet is the only treatment available for individuals with celiac disease. Both individual and collective food intake assessments are a challenge because a food composition database of GF products (GFPs) is lacking. Objectives: to describe the process of developing a food composition database of GFPs, and to compare the nutritional profile and price of some GFPs and non-GFPs. Methods: initially, a total of 216 brands of GFPs marketed in Spain were recorded. Nutritional information was collected from nutritional labels and product fact sheets that had been provided by food companies or collected first-hand by researchers. Then, the nutritional profile and price of the cereal and cereal byproducts foodstuff groups, including 19 types of products, were compared. Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS statistical program (22.0 edition; SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Results: a total of 2,247 GFPs from 126 different foodstuff brands were included in the food composition database of GFPs (CELIAC-BASE). We classified these products into 14 foodstuff groups. The protein content of the GFPs studied was significantly lower, and the price was higher, than that of their non-GFP counterparts. Some, but not all, GFPs had a higher content of fat and sugar, and a lower content of dietary fiber as compared to their non-GFP counterparts. Some GFPs were up to 6 times more expensive than the corresponding non-GFPs. Conclusions: CELIAC-BASE is a pioneering tool for dietitians. Many GFPs have poor nutritional profiles and should be consumed only occasionally in a balanced GF diet.
22237879	Celiac disease, wheat allergy, and gluten sensitivity: when gluten free is not a fad.	As the gluten-free diet (GFD) gains in popularity with the general public, health practitioners are beginning to question its real health benefits. For those patients with celiac disease (CD), the GFD is considered medical nutrition therapy, as well as the only proven treatment that results in improvements in symptomatology and small bowel histology. Those with wheat allergy also benefit from the GFD, although these patients often do not need to restrict rye, barley, and oats from their diet. Gluten sensitivity is a controversial subject, where patients who have neither CD nor wheat allergy have varying degrees of symptomatic improvement on the GFD. Conditions in this category include dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and neurologic diseases such as gluten-sensitive ataxia and autism. It is important for patients and healthcare practitioners to understand the differences between these conditions, even though they may all respond to a GFD. Patients with CD can experience comorbid nutrition deficiencies and are at higher risk for the development of cancers and other autoimmune conditions. Those with wheat allergy and gluten sensitivity are thought not to be at higher risk for these complications. Defining the symptoms and biochemical markers for gluten-sensitive conditions is an important area for future investigations, and high-quality, large-scale randomized trials are needed to prove the true benefits of the GFD in this evolving field.
39339667	Dietary Adherence to Recommendations among a Cohort of Adults and Teens with Celiac Disease Maintaining a Gluten-Free Diet Compared to a Nationally Representative Sample: A Cross-Sectional Study.	Celiac disease (CeD) is a common autoimmune condition, with a prevalence of ~1%. Currently, a gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only treatment option. Due to fortification rules excluding gluten-free products in the United States of America (U.S.A.), understanding the nutritional adequacy of a GFD is important for promoting optimal health among those with CeD. Cross-sectional examination of multiple 24 h dietary recalls from a study sample of 50 adults and 30 teens with CeD was used to determine nutritional adequacy and excesses according to U.S.A. recommendations. The results were compared with those of 15,777 adults and 2296 teens from a nationally representative sample not reporting CeD, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2009-2014. Compared with NHANES, our study population was more at risk of low folate and carbohydrate (adults) consumption, and of excessive niacin and vitamin A (teens), as well as saturated and total fat consumption (adults). Overall, though, compared with NHANES, our study participants had similar nutrient concerns but fewer nutritional imbalances, with some notable exceptions. In addition to maintaining a GFD, individuals with CeD should be counseled to maintain a balanced diet and to pay attention to nutrient-dense foods. Special attention should be given to teens in providing dietary counseling to potentially mitigate the risk of future morbidity.
25573639	Celiac disease and bone health: just gluten free diet?	Not available. 
29799889	[Perception of following gluten-free diet and adherence to treatment in pediatric patients with celiac disease].	INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic immune-mediated enteropathy present in ~1% of population. Gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only treatment for this condition and the main limitation of its efficacy is the lack of adherence. OBJECTIVE: To assess factors influencing adherence to GFD in pediatric patients and measure the concordance between serological results and a nutritional adhe rence questionnaire. PATIENTS AND METHODS: celiac patients younger than 18 years of age, diagnosed CD following ESPGHAN criteria, on GFD for at least 6 months and consulting at Hospital Roberto del Rio, Santiago, in 2008-2016, were assessed. Clinical presentation, nutritional evaluation and fac tors related to adherence to treatment (diet) were registered. A subsample answered Biaggi's nutri tional questionnaire. RESULTS: Of 65 evaluated patients, 44% and 30,1% adhered to GFD according to blood autoantibodies (TTG and EMA) and the adherence questionnaire, respectively. "Age at debut" (p = 0.049), "perception of following GFD correctly" (p = 0.002) and "behavior in social events" (p = 0.005) were significantly associated with adherence to GFD. There was concordance between serological test and Biagi's questionnaire (p = 0.0001). DISCUSSION: Adherence to GFD was lower than reported in literature. Intervention of some of the identified variables associated with adherence may help improving follow-up of celiac patients, especially those that due to diverse situations cannot measure their antibodies periodically.
24445568	Gastrointestinal effects of eating quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) in celiac patients.	OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease is an enteropathy triggered by dietary gluten found in wheat, rye, and barley. Treatment involves a strict gluten-free diet (GFD). Quinoa is a highly nutritive plant from the Andes that has been recommended as part of a GFD. However, in-vitro data suggested that quinoa prolamins can stimulate innate and adaptive immune responses in celiac patients. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the in-vivo effects of eating quinoa in adult celiac patients. METHODS: Nineteen treated celiac patients consumed 50 g of quinoa every day for 6 weeks as part of their usual GFD. We evaluated diet, serology, and gastrointestinal parameters. Furthermore, we carried out detail histological assessment of 10 patients before and after eating quinoa. RESULTS: Gastrointestinal parameters were normal. The ratio of villus height to crypt depth improved from slightly below normal values (2.8:1) to normal levels (3:1), surface-enterocyte cell height improved from 28.76 to 29.77 mum and the number of intra-epithelial lymphocytes per 100 enterocytes decreased from 30.3 to 29.7. Median values for all the blood tests remained within normal ranges, although total cholesterol (n=19) decreased from 4.6 to 4.3 mmol/l, low-density lipoprotein decreased from 2.46 to 2.45 mmol/l, high-density lipoprotein decreased from 1.8 to 1.68 mmol/l and triglycerides decreased from 0.80 to 0.79 mmol/l. CONCLUSIONS: Addition of quinoa to the GFD of celiac patients was well tolerated and did not exacerbate the condition. There was a positive trend toward improved histological and serological parameters, particularly a mild hypocholesterolemic effect. Overall, this is the first clinical data suggesting that daily 50 g of quinoa for 6 weeks can be safely tolerated by celiac patients. However, further studies are needed to determine the long-term effects of quinoa consumption.
22647800	Impact of an active patient education program on gastrointestinal symptoms in women with celiac disease following a gluten-free diet: a randomized controlled trial.	Despite living with a gluten-free diet, Swedish women with celiac disease report a higher rate of gastrointestinal symptoms than women without the disease. This study was designed to assess the impact of active patient education on gastrointestinal symptoms in women with a gluten-free diet. A total of 106 Swedish women, aged 20 years or older, with celiac disease on a gluten-free diet for a minimum of 5 years took part in a randomized controlled trial. The intervention group (n = 54) underwent a 10-session educational program, "Celiac School," based on problem-based learning. Controls (n = 52) were sent information regarding celiac disease at home. The outcome measure was gastrointestinal symptoms at 10 weeks and 6 months after intervention, assessed with the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale. After 10 weeks of "Celiac School," the participating women reported significant improvements that remained 6 months later (p = .029). The controls did not improve significantly. A comparison of the development of scores, from baseline to 10 weeks, could not demonstrate a significant difference in the overall index between the 2 groups but showed a significant improvement concerning 1 of its components, namely the index reflecting Abdominal Pain (p = .007). Intervention methods should be refined to reach an even more pronounced effect.
24066466	[An update on celiac disease].	Celiac disease is a well-known entity in pediatrics and pediatric gastroenterology that is now also frequently encountered in the adult population. Apart from typical symptoms, celiac disease can present with a wide range of manifestations that are sometimes atypical, scarce or purely extraintestinal. Serologic and genetic testing are useful tools in case of low clinical probability in the early diagnostic algorithm. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy remains the mainstay to confirm the diagnosis especially in atypical clinical presentations. Complications are rare but can be severe. Although gluten-free diet often leads to complete recovery, compliance is not universal and alternative treatment strategies are under investigation.
38147608	Celiac Disease: Promising Biomarkers for Follow-Up.	Celiac disease is a common gastroenterological illness. Current diagnostics of the disease are based on serological markers and histology of duodenal biopsies. Hitherto, a strict gluten-free diet is the only effective treatment and is necessary for good control of the disease. Serological tests in current use have very high specificity and sensitivity for diagnostics, but in follow-up they have some limitations. Their levels do not accurately reflect mucosal healing, and they are unable to detect minimal transgressions in the diet. This problem is significant in patients with IgA deficiency, and there exist no robust follow-up tools for monitoring these patients' adherence to treatment. For their follow-up, we currently use IgG-based tests, and these antibodies persist for a long time even when a patient has stopped consuming gluten. More accurate and specific biomarkers are definitely needed. Adherence to a gluten-free diet is essential not only for intestinal mucosa healing and alleviation of symptoms but also for preventing complications associated with celiac disease. Here, we summarize current evidence regarding noninvasive biomarkers potentially useful for follow-up not only of patients with IgA deficiency but for all patients with celiac disease. We describe several very promising biomarkers with potential to be part of clinical practice in the near future.
29773507	The value and significance of 25(OH) and 1,25(OH) vitamin D serum levels in adult coeliac patients: A review of the literature.	Within the wide spectrum of symptoms and alteration of systems that characterizes CeD, several studies indicate a low-level of vitamin D, therefore recent guidelines suggest its evaluation at the time of diagnosis. This review examines the data from existing studies in which vitamin D has been assessed in CeD patients. Our review indicates that most of the studies on vitamin D in adult CeD report a 25 (OH) vitamin D deficiency at diagnosis that disappears when the patient goes on a gluten-free diet, independently of any supplementation. Instead, when the calcitriol, the active 1,25 (OH) vitamin D form, was evaluated, it resulted in the normal range at the time of CeD diagnosis. A strict and lifelong gluten-free diet can help recover vitamin D level without any supplementation.
23083987	Management of celiac disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is an enteropathy-induced immune response that occurs on exposure to toxic gluten in the diet and is reversible once gluten is withdrawn. A gluten-free diet is the preferred treatment for CD and leads to reversal of villous atrophy. Counseling, nutritional support, and follow-up are vital aspects in CD management. The pickup rate of CD has improved with the availability of serologic tests, and this has led to a reduction in morbidity in treated CD cases. Managing CD can potentially prevent or cure some of the associated conditions, such as neurologic complications, nutritional deficiencies, and osteoporosis.
24885375	An Italian prospective multicenter survey on patients suspected of having non-celiac gluten sensitivity.	BACKGROUND: Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is still an undefined syndrome with several unsettled issues despite the increasing awareness of its existence. We carried out a prospective survey on NCGS in Italian centers for the diagnosis of gluten-related disorders, with the aim of defining the clinical picture of this new syndrome and to establish roughly its prevalence compared with celiac disease. METHODS: From November 2012 to October 2013, 38 Italian centers (27 adult gastroenterology, 5 internal medicine, 4 pediatrics, and 2 allergy) participated in this prospective survey. A questionnaire was used in order to allow uniform and accurate collection of clinical, biochemical, and instrumental data. RESULTS: In total, 486 patients with suspected NCGS were identified in this 1-year period. The female/male ratio was 5.4 to 1, and the mean age was 38 years (range 3-81). The clinical picture was characterized by combined gastrointestinal (abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea and/or constipation, nausea, epigastric pain, gastroesophageal reflux, aphthous stomatitis) and systemic manifestations (tiredness, headache, fibromyalgia-like joint/muscle pain, leg or arm numbness, 'foggy mind,' dermatitis or skin rash, depression, anxiety, and anemia). In the large majority of patients, the time lapse between gluten ingestion and the appearance of symptoms varied from a few hours to 1 day. The most frequent associated disorders were irritable bowel syndrome (47%), food intolerance (35%) and IgE-mediated allergy (22%). An associated autoimmune disease was detected in 14% of cases. Regarding family history, 18% of our patients had a relative with celiac disease, but no correlation was found between NCGS and positivity for HLA-DQ2/-DQ8. IgG anti-gliadin antibodies were detected in 25% of the patients tested. Only a proportion of patients underwent duodenal biopsy; for those that did, the biopsies showed normal intestinal mucosa (69%) or mild increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes (31%). The ratio between suspected NCGS and new CD diagnoses, assessed in 28 of the participating centers, was 1.15 to 1. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective survey shows that NCGS has a strong correlation with female gender and adult age. Based on our results, the prevalence of NCGS seems to be only slightly higher than that of celiac disease.
32348008	Facilitators and barriers to adherence to gluten-free diet among adults with celiac disease: a systematic review.	BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease (CD) is a chronic, autoimmune disease that prevents individuals from processing gluten, leading to adverse health effects. People with CD should adhere to a gluten-free diet (GFD); however, adherence rates are well below optimal in adults with CD, ranging between 42% and 91%. To date, limited evidence is available on the nature and magnitude of factors that affect adherence to GFD. The present study aimed to develop a systematic review that critically appraises and synthesises evidence on facilitators and barriers that affect adherence to GFD among adults with CD. METHODS: Four databases were searched (Ovid Medline, CINAHL, PsychInfo and Embase) using variant keywords to identify empirical studies meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria. A coding scheme was developed to extract relevant information from each article. RESULTS: Forty articles were included. Grounded in the bioecological theory of development, we synthesised the facilitators and barriers in the literature into a social ecological model with multiple levels: system, community, organisational, interpersonal and individual. The studies varied by design and level of evidence; only one randomised trial was identified. The most significant facilitators include (% of studies): increased education (22.5%); increased knowledge of a GFD (20%); increased intention/self-regulatory efficacy (17.5%); and coeliac association membership (12.5%). The most significant barriers include: lower knowledge of CD (35%); restaurant/supermarket shopping (30%); poor patient education from practitioner (17.5%); and low intention/motivation to adhere to a GFD (17.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Improving knowledge of a GFD, becoming a member of a coeliac association, and improving practitioners' abilities to educate patients on CD will create opportunities for improved adherence to GFD among adults with CD.
37282444	Complementary and alternative medicine use and its association with medication adherence in inflammatory bowel disease and other gastrointestinal diseases.	Background: The use of complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs) has been embedded in populations for decades. In this study, we aimed to determine the rate of their usage among inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients and their association with adherence to conventional therapies. Methods: In this cross sectional, survey-based study, IBD patients' (n=226) adherence and compliance were evaluated using the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-8. A control sample of 227 patients with other gastrointestinal diseases was included to compare trends of CAM use. Results: Crohn's disease represented 66.4% of those with IBD, with a mean age of 35 +- 13.0 years (54% males). The control group had either chronic viral hepatitis B, gastroesophageal reflux disease, Celiac disease, or other non-IBD diseases, with a mean age of 43.5 +- 16.8 years (55% males). Overall, 49% of patients reported using CAMs (54% in IBD group and 43% in the non-IBD group, P =0.024). Across both groups, the most used CAMs were honey (28%) and Zamzam water (19%). There was no significant association between the severity of the illness and use of CAMs. Patients who used CAMs had a lower adherence to conventional therapies vs. those who did not use CAMs (39% vs. 23%, P =0.038). Using the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-8, low adherence to medications was reported in 35% of the IBD group vs. 11% of non-IBD group (P = 0.01). Conclusion: In our population, patients with IBD are more likely to use CAMs and are less adherent to medications. Furthermore, the use of CAMs was associated with a lower adherence rate to conventional therapies. Consequently, further studies assessing the causes associated with the use of CAMs and nonadherence to conventional therapies should be explored and interventions designed to mitigate nonadherence.
22119616	High tissue-transglutaminase antibody level predicts small intestinal villous atrophy in adult patients at high risk of celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: Duodenal biopsy may be unnecessary to confirm celiac disease in patients with high tissue-transglutaminase antibody level. AIMS: To define a cut-off value of tissue-transglutaminase antibody with high positive likelihood ratio for duodenal atrophy in patients with suspected celiac disease. METHODS: We retrospectively identified 945 patients with suspected celiac disease and classified according to the method used for tissue-transglutaminase antibody assay: Group A (n=393, Eu-tTG  Eurospital), Group B (n=263; Eu-tTG  Eurospital) and Group C (n=289; Celikey  Phadia). Duodenal histology was graded according to Marsh. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive likelihood ratio were used to evaluate cut-off points of tissue-transglutaminase antibody as predictor of villous atrophy. RESULTS: 100% specificity and   positive likelihood ratio for duodenal atrophy was observed at a cut-off value of tissue-transglutaminase antibody 5 times higher than the upper limit of normal. CD diagnosis was confirmed by concordance with antiendomysial antibodies, and by reduction of t-TG titre in all patients and improvement of duodenal histology in 80% during gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: Tissue-transglutaminase antibody level 5-folds the upper limit of normal is 100% specific for duodenal atrophy and using this cut-off biopsy could by avoided in 1/3 of patients. Diagnostic criteria of celiac disease in adults need revision.
27552857	Alterations in Diets of Patients With Nonceliac Gluten Sensitivity Compared With Healthy Individuals.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: There is evidence that food components beyond gluten cause symptoms in patients with gluten sensitivity without celiac disease (nonceliac gluten sensitivity [NCGS]). We investigated the diets and nutritional characteristics of patients with NCGS. METHODS: We performed a prospective observational study of 29 patients with NCGS seen at the outpatient clinic for celiac disease and other food intolerances of the University of Salerno in Italy from September 2015 through April 2016. Our study also included 37 control subjects. An experienced dietitian administered a validated food frequency questionnaire (from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition) to collect information on amounts of common foods consumed. Patients and control subjects also completed the Eating Attitudes Test for diet-related disorders. Patients with NCGS completed the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory 2-I questionnaire. Differences in frequencies between patients and control subjects were calculated using chi-square test, whereas differences between continuous variables were calculated using Student t test. All tests were 2-tailed with significance level set at P < .05. RESULTS: Comparing the mean value of food daily eaten, we found that patients with NCGS ate smaller amounts of bread, rice, pasta, and cheese than control subjects. The patients ingested lower mean amounts of carbohydrates (P < .001), proteins (P = .001), fiber (P = .002), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (P = .01). More patients with NCGS than control subjects reported avoiding fruit, vegetables, milk, and dairy products, as well as snacks and mixed spices that are traditionally considered unsafe for people with gastrointestinal symptoms. Seven patients and 3 control subjects with scores >=20 on the Eating Attitudes Test were invited for a psychological consultation; it did not confirm the presence of altered eating behaviors. Patients with NCGS had scores >65 from the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, indicating a high level of concern for their health. CONCLUSIONS: In an observational study, we found that patients with NCGS eat different foods than healthy individuals; patients consume lower levels of proteins, carbohydrates, fiber, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Their diets should be routinely analyzed and possibly corrected to avoid nutritional deficiencies.
24445753	Health-related quality of life in children and adolescents with celiac disease: patient-driven data from focus group interviews.	PURPOSE: Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease requiring constant management with a gluten-free diet (GFD). Little is known about how CD impacts on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in children and adolescents, and how they feel about and cope with CD and GFD. This qualitative study explores the impact of CD and GFD on HRQOL in everyday living of children and adolescents. METHODS: In focus group interviews, we investigated HRQOL in children and adolescents with CD in order to identify patient concerns in living with CD and on a GFD. Seven focus groups were formed with 23 children/adolescents and 3 parents. Interviews were transcribed verbatim. Grounded theory approach was applied to analyse the interviews. RESULTS: CD had varying impact on the children and adolescents HRQOL. Two major categories emerged with importance for HRQOL in children and adolescents with CD, having CD (constructed from the six subcategories: symptoms, the diagnosis-process, self-perception, awareness of CD, social and emotional impact of CD, and thoughts about the future) and coping with CD (constructed from the two subcategories: coping with food and coping with social situations). The complexity of coping with CD in social situations that involve food is presented in a flowchart. CONCLUSIONS: Children and adolescents showed large diversity in how much impact CD has on their HRQOL. Different ways of coping with CD and GFD were identified. Findings will be used to generate a patient-driven disease-specific questionnaire to measure HRQOL in children and adolescents with CD.
24394748	Increase in neuroendocrine cells in the duodenal mucosa of patients with refractory celiac disease.	OBJECTIVES: Several immune-mediated gastrointestinal disorders, including celiac disease (CD), are associated with neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia. However, neuroendocrine cells have never been explored in refractory CD (RCD). METHODS: Serial duodenal sections from 17 patients with RCD (6 type 1 and 11 type 2), 16 uncomplicated CD patients before and after gluten-free diet, 14 patients with potential CD, 27 patients with non-CD villous atrophy, i.e., common variable immunodeficiency (n=12), Whipple's disease (n=10) and giardiasis (n=5), and 16 healthy subjects were processed for the immunohistochemical detection of chromogranin A (CgA), serotonin, and somatostatin. Mucosal tryptophan hydroxylase (TpH)-1 and serotonin-selective reuptake transporter (SERT) transcripts were measured by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Serum CgA and 24-h urine 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) were assessed. Biopsies from treated CD patients were cultured with serotonin or peptic tryptic digest of gliadin (PT-gliadin), and interferon (IFN)-gamma was detected by ELISA in culture supernatants. RESULTS: Epithelial cells positive for CgA and serotonin, but not somatostatin, were significantly increased in RCD. Raised mucosal transcripts of TpH-1, but not SERT, were found in RCD. On biopsies from treated CD patients, serotonin upregulated IFN-gamma production at levels comparable to those induced by PT-gliadin. Serum CgA, but not urine 5-HIAA, was increased in RCD. No significant difference was found between RCD type 1 and type 2 in terms of neuroendocrine cells, mucosal TpH-1 transcripts, and serum CgA. CONCLUSIONS: Serotonin-producing neuroendocrine cells are increased in RCD mucosa. IFN-gamma upregulation induced by serotonin suggests that this monoamine may have a role in sustaining the local inflammatory response in CD.
24831843	Tolerogenic effect of mesenchymal stromal cells on gliadin-specific T lymphocytes in celiac disease.	BACKGROUND AIMS: Celiac disease is caused by a dysregulated immune response toward dietary gluten, whose only treatment is a lifelong gluten-free diet. We investigated the effects of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) on gliadin-specific T cells, which are known to induce intestinal lesions, in view of a possible use as new therapy. METHODS: Bone marrow-derived MSCs and gliadin-specific T-cell lines were obtained from allogeneic donors and mucosal specimens of celiac patients, respectively. The immunosuppressant effect of MSCs was evaluated in terms of proliferative response and interferon (IFN)-gamma production upon gliadin stimulation of long-term T-cell lines; the immunomodulant effect was assessed in terms of apoptotic rate, immunophenotype and cytokine profile of short-term T-cell lines generated in the presence of MSCs. Different MSC:T-cell ratios were applied, and statistics were performed as appropriate. RESULTS: MSCs inhibited both proliferative response and IFN-gamma production of long-term T-cell lines in a dose-dependent manner while limiting the expansion of short-term T-cell lines by increasing the apoptotic rate. Moreover, a reduction of the CD4(+) population and expansion of the regulatory FoxP3+ subset were found in T-cell lines cultured with MSCs, in which a significant decrease of interleukin (IL)-21, IFN-gamma and IL-10 paralleled by an upregulation of transforming growth factor-beta1, IL-6 and IL-8 were observed. Finally, an increase of the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity was found, possibly playing a key role in mediating these effects. CONCLUSIONS: MSCs exert potent immunomodulant effects on gliadin-specific T cells, which may be exploited for future therapeutic application in celiac disease.
26838490	Impact of a gluten-free diet on bone mineral density in celiac patients.	BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis (OP) is a metabolic bone illness that may complicate celiac disease (CD). It can lead to devastating consequences because of low bone mass and fragility fractures. PURPOSE: To study the OP prevalence in a group of Brazilian patients with CD and the value of a gluten free diet (GFD). METHODS: Retrospective study of celiac female patients from a single University Center followed with bone densitometries. Results from densitometry made at first visit were compared with a second study after a median time of 5 years. During this period, patients were submitted to a GFD according to orientations from special program training. Calcium and vitamin D were prescribed to those patients who did not reach the minimal daily requirement through diet. RESULTS: Forty-one celiac female patients, mean age 46.1 +- 14.8 years, were included. The prevalence of osteopenia at first visit was 56.1% and that of osteoporosis 29.2%. Osteoporosis was associated with longer disease duration (p = 0.01). The second densitometry was performed in a median time of 5 years (range 1 to 13 years) and disclosed 58.9% osteopenia and 28.2% osteoporosis. The GFD improved bone mass, mainly at (of) spine (comparison of T score with p = 0.03 and of bone mass in g/cm2 with p = 0.02), but it was not sufficient to reduce the number of osteopenic (p = 0.9) and osteoporotic patients (p = 0.4). During the follow up period 25% of osteoporotic patients developed low impact fractures. CONCLUSION: Bone health is notably impaired at baseline in CD patients, especially in those with a diagnostic delay. A GFD modestly improved bone mass density with low impact fractures occurring in one third of patients during the follow up period.
20736938	Morphometric evaluation of duodenal biopsies in celiac disease.	OBJECTIVES: The Marsh classification is a semiquantitative method for the diagnosis and monitoring of changes in duodenal biopsies in celiac disease. We have explored the possibility that quantitative changes in villous area and crypt length (morphometry) may provide better information on changes in duodenal morphology, particularly after the introduction of a gluten-free diet. METHODS: We measured villous height, apical and basal villous widths, and crypt length in 57 adults with celiac disease and 83 control subjects. Villous area was calculated as a trapezoid approximation. Serial changes in villous area and crypt length were determined at regular intervals for up to 4 years after the introduction of a gluten-free diet. Morphometric changes were also correlated with Marsh grade, self-reported adherence to a gluten-free diet, and changes in celiac serology. RESULTS: The gluten-free diet resulted in a progressive increase in villous area and a progressive decrease in crypt length. Morphometric improvement reached a plateau after 6-12 months with mean villous area attaining a value approximately half that of control subjects. Morphometric data were more sensitive than Marsh grade. Improvement in morphometric indices was significantly associated with the disappearance of anti-endomysial IgA antibody but not with dietary compliance. CONCLUSIONS: Morphometry is a sensitive way to document changes in duodenal biopsies in celiac disease. In adults treated with a gluten-free diet, it is uncommon for villous area to return to values observed in control subjects, but morphometric improvement is associated with the disappearance of anti-endomysial IgA antibody.
33518167	All Things Gluten: A Review.	Gluten is a common dietary component with a complex protein structure. It forms incomplete products of digestion, which have the potential to mount an immune response in genetically predisposed individuals, resulting in celiac disease. It also has been linked with nonceliac gluten sensitivity and irritable bowel syndrome due to wheat allergy. A gluten-free diet is an effective treatment of these conditions; however, it can lead to micronutrient and mineral deficiencies and a macronutrient imbalance with higher sugar and lipid intake. Recent popularity has led to greater availability, but increasing cost, of commercially available gluten-free products.
21787224	An update on the diagnostics of celiac disease.	In celiac disease, highly sensitive and specific serum endomysial and transglutaminase 2 antibody tests are widely used in identifying patients for diagnostic endoscopy and small-bowel biopsy. In addition, the recently developed deamidated gliadin peptide antibody tests show promise in celiac disease diagnostics. In view of these apparent problems attending the diagnostic gold standard, gluten-induced small-bowel mucosal villous atrophy with crypt hyperplasia, other diagnostic approaches beyond conventional histology have been introduced. Furthermore, the diagnostic criteria for celiac disease are currently under revision with an eye also to noninvasive diagnostic strategies.
29216605	Gluten peptides drive healthy and celiac monocytes toward an M2-like polarization.	Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by ingested gluten in genetically susceptible individuals and sustained by both adaptive and innate immune responses. Recent studies in murine macrophages demonstrated that the activation of arginase (ARG) metabolic pathway by gluten peptides contributes to the modulation of intestinal permeability in vitro. Here we characterize the effects of gluten on arginine metabolism and cell polarization in human monocytes from both healthy and CD subjects; both a simplified enzymatic digestion of gliadin and a physiological digestion of whole wheat have been tested. Results indicate that gluten digests induce the onset of an M2-like phenotype in activated macrophages; more precisely, both isoforms of arginase, ARG1 and ARG2, are induced likely due to the inhibition of mTOR and the consequent induction of C/EBPbeta transcription factor. These effects are independent from the origin of gluten as well as from the digestive protocol employed; moreover, no statistical difference can be evidenced between healthy and CD patients, excluding a diverse predisposition of CD monocytes to gluten-triggered polarization with respect to healthy immune cells. Overall, the present findings sustain a role for arginase pathway in the immune response elicited by human monocytes toward ingested gluten that, hence, deserves particular attention when addressing the pathogenesis of CD.
23458849	A randomized controlled trial of an online intervention to improve gluten-free diet adherence in celiac disease.	OBJECTIVES: To test the effectiveness of an interactive online intervention to improve gluten free diet adherence in adults with celiac disease. METHODS: A Randomized controlled trial was conducted. A total of 189 adults with biopsy-confirmed celiac disease were recruited and randomized to receive the intervention (n=101) or to a waitlist control condition (n=88). Post-intervention data was available for 70 intervention and 64 waitlist participants. Three month follow-up data was obtained for 46/50 completers from the intervention group. The primary outcome measure was gluten-free diet adherence. Secondary outcomes were gluten-free diet knowledge, quality of life and psychological symptoms. RESULTS: Results were based on intention-to-treat analyses. The intervention group evidenced significantly improved gluten-free diet adherence, and gluten-free diet knowledge following the treatment period relative to the waitlist control group. The change in knowledge did not contribute to the change in adherence. These improvements were maintained at 3-month' follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The online program was effective in improving adherence and represents a promising resource for individuals with celiac disease who are struggling to achieve or maintain adequate gluten free diet adherence.
28067823	Biomarkers to Monitor Gluten-Free Diet Compliance in Celiac Patients.	Gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only treatment for celiac disease (CD). There is a general consensus that strict GFD adherence in CD patients leads to full clinical and histological remission accompanied by improvement in quality of life and reduced long-term complications. Despite the importance of monitoring the GFD, there are no clear guidelines for assessing the outcome or for exploring its adherence. Available methods are insufficiently accurate to identify occasional gluten exposure that may cause intestinal mucosal damage. Serological tests are highly sensitive and specific for diagnosis, but do not predict recovery and are not useful for follow-up. The use of serial endoscopies, it is invasive and impractical for frequent monitoring, and dietary interview can be subjective. Therefore, the detection of gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) in feces and urine have been proposed as new non-invasive biomarkers to detect gluten intake and verify GFD compliance in CD patients. These simple immunoassays in human samples could overcome some key unresolved scientific and clinical problems in CD management. It is a significant advance that opens up new possibilities for the clinicians to evaluate the CD treatment, GFD compliance, and improvement in the quality of life of CD patients.
29102613	Fructan, Rather Than Gluten, Induces Symptoms in Patients With Self-Reported Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Non-celiac gluten sensitivity is characterized by symptom improvement after gluten withdrawal in absence of celiac disease. The mechanisms of non-celiac gluten sensitivity are unclear, and there are no biomarkers for this disorder. Foods with gluten often contain fructans, a type of fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols. We aimed to investigate the effect of gluten and fructans separately in individuals with self-reported gluten sensitivity. METHODS: We performed a double-blind crossover challenge of 59 individuals on a self-instituted gluten-free diet, for whom celiac disease had been excluded. The study was performed at Oslo University Hospital in Norway from October 2014 through May 2016. Participants were randomly assigned to groups placed on diets containing gluten (5.7 g), fructans (2.1 g), or placebo, concealed in muesli bars, for 7 days. Following a minimum 7-day washout period (until the symptoms induced by the previous challenge were resolved), participants crossed over into a different group, until they completed all 3 challenges (gluten, fructan, and placebo). Symptoms were measured by Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale Irritable Bowel Syndrome (GSRS-IBS) version. A linear mixed model for analysis was used. RESULTS: Overall GSRS-IBS scores differed significantly during gluten, fructan, and placebo challenges; mean values were 33.1 +- 13.3, 38.6 +- 12.3, and 34.3 +- 13.9, respectively (P = .04). Mean scores for GSRS-IBS bloating were 9.3 +- 3.5, 11.6 +- 3.5, and 10.1 +- 3.7, respectively, during the gluten, fructan, and placebo challenges (P = .004). The overall GSRS-IBS score for participants consuming fructans was significantly higher than for participants consuming gluten (P = .049), as was the GSRS bloating score (P = .003). Thirteen participants had the highest overall GSRS-IBS score after consuming gluten, 24 had the highest score after consuming fructan, and 22 had the highest score after consuming placebo. There was no difference in GSRS-IBS scores between gluten and placebo groups. CONCLUSIONS: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of individuals with self-reported non-celiac gluten sensitivity, we found fructans to induce symptoms, measured by the GSRS-IBS. Clinicaltrials.gov no: NCT02464150.
27644734	Fecal Gluten Peptides Reveal Limitations of Serological Tests and Food Questionnaires for Monitoring Gluten-Free Diet in Celiac Disease Patients.	OBJECTIVES: Treatment for celiac disease (CD) is a lifelong strict gluten-free diet (GFD). Patients should be followed-up with dietary interviews and serology as CD markers to ensure adherence to the diet. However, none of these methods offer an accurate measure of dietary compliance. Our aim was to evaluate the measurement of gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) in stools as a marker of GFD adherence in CD patients and compare it with traditional methods of GFD monitoring. METHODS: We performed a prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter study including 188 CD patients on GFD and 84 healthy controls. Subjects were given a dietary questionnaire and fecal GIP quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Serological anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) IgA and anti-deamidated gliadin peptide (anti-DGP) IgA antibodies were measured simultaneously. RESULTS: Of the 188 celiac patients, 56 (29.8%) had detectable GIP levels in stools. There was significant association between age and GIP in stools that revealed increasing dietary transgressions with advancing age (39.2% in subjects >=13 years old) and with gender in certain age groups (60% in men >=13 years old). No association was found between fecal GIP and dietary questionnaire or anti-tTG antibodies. However, association was detected between GIP and anti-DGP antibodies, although 46 of the 53 GIP stool-positive patients were negative for anti-DGP. CONCLUSIONS: Detection of gluten peptides in stools reveals limitations of traditional methods for monitoring GFD in celiac patients. The GIP ELISA enables direct and quantitative assessment of gluten exposure early after ingestion and could aid in the diagnosis and clinical management of nonresponsive CD and refractory CD. Trial registration number NCT02711397.
28580502	In Vitro Bioavailability of Calcium, Magnesium, Iron, Zinc, and Copper from Gluten-Free Breads Supplemented with Natural Additives.	The aim of this study was to measure the content of calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, and copper and determine the bioavailability of these ingredients in gluten-free breads fortified with milk and selected seeds. Due to the increasing prevalence of celiac disease and mineral deficiencies, it has become necessary to produce food with higher nutritional values which maintains the appropriate product characteristics. This study was designed for gluten-free breads fortified with milk and seeds such as flax, poppy, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds or nuts, and flour with amaranth. Subsequently, digestion was performed in vitro and the potential bioavailability of the minerals was measured. In the case of calcium, magnesium, iron, and copper, higher bioavailability was observed in rice bread, and, in the case of copper and zinc, in buckwheat bread. This demonstrated a clear increase in bioavailability of all the minerals when the bread were enriched. However, satisfactory results are obtained only for the individual micronutrients.
24583059	Glutenase ALV003 attenuates gluten-induced mucosal injury in patients with celiac disease.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Gluten ingestion leads to small intestinal mucosal injury in patients with celiac disease, necessitating strict life-long exclusion of dietary gluten. Despite adherence to a gluten-free diet, many patients remain symptomatic and still have small intestinal inflammation. In this case, nondietary therapies are needed. We investigated the ability of ALV003, a mixture of 2 recombinant gluten-specific proteases given orally, to protect patients with celiac disease from gluten-induced mucosal injury in a phase 2 trial. METHODS: We established the optimal daily dose of gluten to be used in a 6-week challenge study. Then, in the intervention study, adults with biopsy-proven celiac disease were randomly assigned to groups given ALV003 (n = 20) or placebo (n = 21) together with the daily gluten challenge. Duodenal biopsies were collected at baseline and after gluten challenge. The ratio of villus height to crypt depth and densities of intraepithelial lymphocytes were the primary end points. RESULTS: A daily dose of 2 g gluten was selected for the intervention study. Sixteen patients given ALV003 and 18 given placebo were eligible for efficacy evaluation. Biopsies from subjects in the placebo group showed evidence of mucosal injury after gluten challenge (mean villus height to crypt depth ratio changed from 2.8 before challenge to 2.0 afterward; P = .0007; density of CD3(+) intraepithelial lymphocytes changed from 61 to 91 cells/mm after challenge; P = .0003). However, no significant mucosal deterioration was observed in biopsies from the ALV003 group. Between groups, morphologic changes and CD3(+) intraepithelial lymphocyte counts differed significantly from baseline to week 6 (P = .0133 and P = .0123, respectively). There were no statistically significant differences in symptoms between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Based on a phase 2 trial, the glutenase ALV003 appears to attenuate gluten-induced small intestinal mucosal injury in patients with celiac disease in the context of an everyday gluten-free diet containing daily up to 2 g gluten. Clinicaltrial.gov, NUMBERS: NCT00959114 and NCT01255696.
36281172	Diagnostic dilemma of celiac disease presenting with weight loss and secondary amenorrhea: A case report.	RATIONALE: Celiac disease (CD) is autoimmune enteropathy affecting the proximal small intestinal mucosa. It is caused by insensitivity to gluten, a protein predominantly presented in wheat. CD is classically associated with gastrointestinal symptoms. The non-classic clinical presentation of CD can present with other organ involvement. Non-human leukocyte antigens genes are associated with atypical forms. PATIENTS CONCERN: We reported a case of 30-year-old female who presented with progressive pallor, amenorrhea, and unexplained weight loss with generalized body weakness. Her body mass index was 20. The patient was having no other systemic manifestations. DIAGNOSIS: This paper reports a case of a female patient having CD without its typical features. Her laboratory evaluation revealed microcytic anemia. Anti-TTg IgA and Anti-TTG IgG antibodies were raised, ferritin and folate were low, and there was mild hyperbilirubinemia. However, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and serum estradiol levels were normal. She was diagnosed with a case of anemia resulting from malabsorption caused by CD. INTERVENTIONS: A management plan was devised based on a strict gluten-free diet. The patient received supplements containing folates, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamins A, D, E, B6, and B12. OUTCOMES: After 3 months of treatment with strict gluten-free diet patient showed remarkable improvement. Her hemoglobin level raised with weight gain. Her normal menstrual cycle was restored with complete resolution of symptoms at 1 year follow-up. LESSONS: The pathogenesis of the atypical CD is multifactorial, but impaired uptake of micronutrients from the duodenum is the most likely cause, even if other common features of classical forms, such as bloating and diarrhea, are absent. Lack of awareness about atypical forms may lead to under-diagnoses of the disease. The physicians should consider the atypical presentations of CD to avoid the under-diagnoses of this multisystem disorder.
26917496	Refractory coeliac disease a reality: views from Pakistan.	Refractory coeliac disease (RCD) is described as persistence or recurrence of signs and symptoms of malabsorption with small-intestinal villous atrophy despite being on a strict gluten-free diet (GFD) for more than 12 months. RCD is a diagnosis of exclusion. There are two types of RCD, based upon the immunohistochemical features (presence of intraepithelial lymphocytes), response to treatment and prognosis. The treatment of RCD includes GFD and immunosuppressive agents. We hereby present a case of refractory celiac disease type II in a young man who later went on to develop Addisonian crisis and did not survive.
29594339	Obesogenic habits among children and their families in response to initiation of gluten-free diet.	Initiation of a lifelong, gluten-free diet (GFD) in children with celiac disease (CD) influences the child's life in many ways. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of GFD on the child and his/her family's eating habits and lifestyle behaviors. To study this, we asked children and their parents completed the Family Eating and Activity Habits Questionnaire (FEAHQ) at the time of diagnosis of CD and at least 6 months after initiation of GFD and a questionnaires assessing symptoms related to CD and adherence to the GFD diet. We analyzed questionnaires from 40 children with CD and their families. There were 21 females, ranging in age from 4 to 15.7 years (median age 7.4 years+-2.8 years). The control group comprised 15 healthy children. After initiation of GFD the family ate more junk food including snacks and candies (p = 0.05), with the significant change reported by children and fathers (p = 0.001 and 0.03 respectively). All family members in the control group had significantly less snacks. Parents and children reported a significant increase in obesogenic eating styles, such as eating from the cooking pot and eating while doing other activities (mothers, p = 0.001; fathers, 0.02; and children, 0.02 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that initiation of GFD in children with CD leads to changes in eating habits and staple food eating that may lead to a more obesogenic environment. Care givers, pediatricians, gastroenterologists, and dieticians alike should be aware of these implications and educate families towards a healthier lifestyle and diet beyond the GFD itself. What's Known:   Gluten-free diet has been shown to affect various psychosocial aspects of children with celiac disease.   Obesity and celiac are associated. What is New:   Initiation of gluten-free diet led to increased eating of junk food both in the patient and his/her family.   After initiation of GFD pro-obesogenic eating habits is increased.
33705679	Celiac disease antibody levels reflect duodenal mucosal damage but not clinical symptoms.	OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate, in a real-world population, whether the histological and clinical phenotype differ at baseline and during follow-up in patients with high and low CD (celiac disease) antibody titers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study cohort consisted of 96 consecutive patients diagnosed to have CD during the years 2010-2018. The clinical parameters, symptoms and laboratory results were registered and histomorphometry was analyzed from the available duodenal biopsies taken during the primary and follow-up esophageal-gastricduodenoscopies. Patients having immunoglobulin A transglutaminase antibody (tTG-ab) levels above 70 U/mL were classified as high titer patients. RESULTS: Measured by the villous-crypt ratio, the duodenal mucosa was more severely damaged in the high tTG-ab group than in the low tTG-group at baseline (n = 70, 0.61 +- 0.63 vs. 1.02 +- 0.87, p = .003) and during the follow-up when the patients were on gluten-free diet (n = 27, 1.80 +- 0.72 vs. 2.35 +- 0.64, p = .041). Interestingly, the high tTG-ab group members had fewer gastrointestinal symptoms at baseline than those in the low tTG-ab group (43% vs. 68%, p = .013) but lower vitamin D levels (68 +- 34 nmol/L vs. 88 +- 29 nmol/L, p = .034) and more often microcytosis (28% vs. 10%, p = .040). During the follow-up, these differences were no longer detected. CONCLUSIONS: At baseline, CD patients with high tTG-ab have more severe duodenum injury and signs of malabsorption but fewer symptoms. After gluten-free diet has been initiated, the mucosal healing in the high tTG-ab group is prolonged, but symptoms and signs of malabsorption recover equally in both groups.
37273133	Transition of Care in Celiac Disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is a gluten related disorder which affects all age-groups and occurs in genetically susceptible population after introduction of gluten in diet. The worldwide prevalence of CD is ~1% and it is higher in certain "at-risk groups". The clinical features are variable, ranging from classical diarrhea to an asymptomatic state. Diagnosis requires serology and duodenal histology although a non-biopsy diagnosis is recommended by European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) for a select group of children. Treatment of CD is with a life-long strict gluten free diet (GFD) along with correction of nutritional deficiencies. Regular follow-up to assess compliance and efficacy of GFD is mandatory. Non-responsive CD needs evaluation by a specialist as it can be due to incorrect diagnosis, poor dietary compliance, coexisting conditions like small bowel bacterial overgrowth, pancreatic insufficiency etc. and lastly, refractory CD. Most patients diagnosed as CD in childhood receive no medical or dietary supervision after transition to adulthood and nearly a third are non-compliant to GFD. No requirement of medications, patient's perception of understanding GFD and absence of symptoms with intermittent non-compliance leads to neglect of care after transition. Poor dietary adherence leads to nutritional deficiencies, osteoporosis, fertility issues and risk of malignancy. It is mandatory that the patients know about CD, need of strict GFD, regular follow-up, disease complications, and are capable of communicating with the health-care personnel before transition. Formulating a phased transition care program with joint pediatric and adult clinics is required for a successful transition and improving the long-term outcome.
37364982	Persistent villous atrophy predicts development of complications and mortality in adult patients with coeliac disease: a multicentre longitudinal cohort study and development of a score to identify high-risk patients.	OBJECTIVE: Persistent villous atrophy (pVA) in coeliac disease (CD) despite a gluten-free diet (GFD) has unclear meaning. We aimed to (i) study the relationship between pVA and long-term outcomes and (ii) develop a score to identify patients at risk of pVA. DESIGN: This is a multicentre retrospective-prospective study consisting of a study cohort (cohort 1) and an external validation cohort (cohort 2) of patients with biopsy-proven CD diagnosed between 2000 and 2021. Cohort 1 was used to (i) compare long-term outcomes between patients with and without pVA (Marsh >=3a) at follow-up biopsy and (ii) to develop a score to evaluate the risk of pVA, which was validated in cohort 2. RESULTS: Of 2211 patients, 694 (31%) underwent follow-up duodenal biopsy and were included in the study cohort (491F, 44+-16 years). 157/694 (23%) had pVA. Risk of complications (HR 9.53, 95% CI 4.77 to 19.04, p<0.001) and mortality (HR 2.93, 95% CI 1.43 to 6.02, p<0.01) were increased in patients with pVA. A 5-point score was developed and externally validated (receiver operating characteristic area under the curve 0.78, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.89) to stratify patients by risk of pVA: low (0-1 points, 5% pVA), intermediate (2 points, 16% pVA) and high (3-5 points, 73% pVA). Predictors for pVA used in the score were age at diagnosis >=45 years (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.21 to 3.34, p<0.01), classical pattern of CD (OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.28 to 3.58, p<0.01), lack of clinical response to GFD (OR 2.40, 95% CI 1.43 to 4.01, p<0.001) and poor GFD adherence (OR 48.9, 95% CI 26.1 to 91.8, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Risk of complications and mortality were increased in patients with pVA. We developed a score to identify patients at risk of pVA and in need of histological reassessment and closer follow-up.
37257483	Endocrinological, immunological and metabolic features of patients with Fabry disease under therapy.	OBJECTIVES: Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal disorder caused by decreased or absent alpha galactosidase enzyme. The enzyme deficiency leads to progressive accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb-3) and its deacetylated form lyso-Gb3 in various tissue lysosomes that results in primarily lysosomal deterioration and subsequently mitochondrial, endothelial, and immunologic dysfunctions. METHODS: The endocrinological, metabolic, immunological and HLA status of 12 patients were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 11 patients (91.6 %) had immunologic and/or endocrinologic abnormalities. fT4, anti-TPO, and anti-TG levels were increased in 1, 2, and 2 patients, respectively. Three patients had elevated proinflammatory cytokines. ANA profile, p-ANCA and c-ANCA were positive in 1, 1, and 2 patients, respectively. Tissue transglutaminase antibody was negative in all patients however P5 was diagnosed with Celiac disease at the age of 12 and on gluten free diet. All patients had distinct types of HLA apart from 2 patients with anti-TG and anti-TPO positive and there was no relationship between the HLA types and the autoimmunity biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: FD may have impact on endocrinologic and immunologic abnormalities even in the patients under ERT, therefore prevalence of these abnormalities may be higher in ERT naive patients. However, apparently, they are less likely to cause clinical symptoms. Certain HLA alleles may contribute to the direct impact of immunological pathogenesis in FD by developing abnormal autoimmune biomarkers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating HLA status of FD patients; therefore further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanism of action.
27161492	Delayed gastric emptying does not normalize after gluten withdrawal in adult celiac disease.	Objective Delayed gastric emptying has been frequently detected in patients with untreated celiac disease. According to several studies, gluten withdrawal showed to be effective in normalizing the gastric emptying rate. The aim of this study was to evaluate the gastric emptying rate of solids in patients with celiac disease before and after a gluten-free diet. Methods Twelve adult patients with celiac disease (age range 20-57 years) and 30 healthy controls (age range 30-54 years) underwent a (13)C-octanoic acid breath test to measure gastric emptying. Half emptying time (t1/2) and lag phase (tlag) were calculated. After at least 12 months of a gluten-free diet, celiac patients underwent a new (13)C-octanoic acid breath test. A symptom score was utilized to detect dyspeptic and malabsorption symptoms in all the patients. Results The gastric motility parameters, t1/2 and tlag, were significantly longer in patients than in controls. On a gluten-free diet, surprisingly, the gastric emptying did not normalize despite an improvement of symptom score. No significant correlation between abnormal gastric emptying and specific symptom patterns, anthropometric parameters or severity of histological damage was found. Conclusions This finding supports the hypothesis that gluten-driven mucosal inflammation might determine motor abnormalities by affecting smooth muscle contractility or impairing gut hormone function. The persistence of these abnormalities on a gluten free diet suggests the presence of a persistent low-grade mucosal inflammation with a permanent perturbation of the neuro-immunomodulatory regulation. 
35902684	Rotavirus vaccination is not associated with incident celiac disease or autoimmune thyroid disease in a national cohort of privately insured children.	Rotavirus infection is a potential trigger for autoimmune diseases, and previous reports note associations between rotavirus vaccination and type 1 diabetes. In this report, we examine the association between rotavirus vaccination and autoimmune diseases associated with type 1 diabetes: celiac disease and autoimmune thyroiditis. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using de-identified claims data (Optum Clinformatics  Data Mart). Eligible infants were born between 2001 and 2018 and continuously enrolled from birth for at least 365 days (n = 2,109,225). Twenty-nine percent (n = 613,295) of infants were born prior to the introduction of rotavirus vaccine in 2006; 32% (n = 684,214) were eligible for the vaccine but were not vaccinated; 9.6% (n = 202,016) received partial vaccination, and 28.9% received full vaccination (n = 609,700). There were 1379 cases of celiac disease and 1000 cases of autoimmune thyroiditis. Children who were born prior to the introduction of rotavirus vaccine in 2006 had lower risk of celiac disease compared to unvaccinated children born after 2006 (hazard ratio [HR] 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59, 0.85). However, children who were partially vaccinated (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.73, 1.11) or fully vaccinated (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.88, 1.21) had similar risk to eligible, unvaccinated children. Risk of autoimmune thyroiditis was similar by vaccination status. We conclude that rotavirus vaccination is not associated with increased or decreased risk for celiac disease or autoimmune thyroiditis.
22493548	Celiac disease: management of persistent symptoms in patients on a gluten-free diet.	AIM: To investigate all patients referred to our center with non-responsive celiac disease (NRCD), to establish a cause for their continued symptoms. METHODS: We assessed all patients referred to our center with non-responsive celiac disease over an 18-mo period. These individuals were investigated to establish the eitiology of their continued symptoms. The patients were first seen in clinic where a thorough history and examination were performed with routine blood work including tissue transglutaminase antibody measurement. They were also referred to a specialist gastroenterology dietician to try to identift any lapses in the diet and sources of hidden gluten ingestion. A repeat small intestinal biopsy was also performed and compared to biopsies from the referring hospital where possible. Colonoscopy, lactulose hydrogen breath testing, pancreolauryl testing and computed tomography scan of the abdomen were undertaken if the symptoms persisted. Their clinical progress was followed over a minimum of 2 years. RESULTS: One hundred and twelve consecutive patients were referred with NRCD. Twelve were found not to have celiac disease (CD). Of the remaining 100 patients, 45% were not adequately adhering to a strict gluten-free diet, with 24 (53%) found to be inadvertently ingesting gluten, and 21 (47%) admitting non-compliance. Microscopic colitis was diagnosed in 12% and small bowel bacterial overgrowth in 9%. Refractory CD was diagnosed in 9%. Three of these were diagnosed with intestinal lymphoma. After 2 years, 78 patients remained well, eight had continuing symptoms, and four had died. CONCLUSION: In individuals with NRCD, a remediable cause can be found in 90%: with continued gluten ingestion as the leading cause. We propose an algorithm for investigation.
29787419	A locus at 7p14.3 predisposes to refractory celiac disease progression from celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: Approximately 5% of patients with celiac disease (CeD) do not respond to a gluten-free diet and progress to refractory celiac disease (RCD), a severe progression that is characterized by infiltration of intraepithelial T lymphocytes. Patients with RCD type II (RCDII) show clonal expansions of intraepithelial T lymphocytes that result in a poor prognosis and a high mortality rate through development of aggressive enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma. It is not known whether genetic variations play a role in severe progression of CeD to RCDII. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed the first genome-wide association study to identify the causal genes for RCDII and the molecular pathways perturbed in RCDII. The genome-wide association study was performed in 38 Dutch patients with RCDII, and the 15 independent top-associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants (P<5x10) were replicated in 56 independent French and Dutch patients with RCDII. RESULTS: After replication, SNP rs2041570 on chromosome 7 was significantly associated with progression to RCDII (P=2.37x10, odds ratio=2.36) but not with CeD susceptibility. SNP rs2041570 risk allele A was associated with lower levels of FAM188B expression in blood and small intestinal biopsies. Stratification of RCDII biopsies based on rs2041570 genotype showed differential expression of innate immune and antibacterial genes that are expressed in Paneth cells. CONCLUSION: We have identified a novel SNP associated with the severe progression of CeD to RCDII. Our data suggest that genetic susceptibility to CeD might be distinct from the progression to RCDII and suggest a role for Paneth cells in RCDII progression.
31706435	Turner syndrome and osteoporosis.	Turner syndrome is one of the most common sex chromosomal anomalies, characterized by the complete or partial loss of one X chromosome. Females with Turner syndrome are characterized by skeletal abnormalities, short stature and primary ovarian insufficiency. The aim of this narrative review was to identify the underlying mechanisms of osteoporosis in Turner syndrome, summarize its clinical manifestations and provide suggestions regarding the management of osteoporosis. Girls and women with Turner syndrome have lower bone mineral density and a higher fracture rate than healthy individuals. The most important risk factors for osteoporosis are inadequately treated primary ovarian insufficiency, followed by intrinsic bone abnormalities. Comorbidities that further increase the risk of osteoporosis include vitamin D deficiency, celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease. In addition, hearing problems can predispose to falls. Early initiation of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) at the age of 11-13 years, prompt titration to the adult dose after 2 years and long-term follow-up to ensure compliance with HRT are the cornerstones of osteoporosis prevention in women with Turner syndrome.
26327210	Health-Related Quality of Life in Spanish Children With Coeliac Disease.	OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to assess health-related quality of life (HRQOL) using the Coeliac Disease Dutch Questionnaire (CDDUX) in Spanish children with coeliac disease. METHODS: The CDDUX was cross-culturally adapted according to international consensus guidelines. HRQOL was assessed in coeliac members of the Madrid Coeliac Association ages 8 to 18 years using the adapted CDDUX. Cronbach alpha coefficient was determined as a measure of intraquestionnaire reliability and intraclass correlation coefficients as a measure of reliability between scores awarded by children and parents. Demographic and clinical variables associated with HRQOL were also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 1602 children of 3122 registered Madrid Coeliac Association members ages 8 to 18 years were invited to participate. The questionnaire was completed by 480 families (30%): 214 only by parents, 214 by parents and their children, and 52 only by children. Cronbach alpha coefficient for the total score for parents was 0.90, and for children 0.88 (0.75-0.90 by scales). Mean total (standard deviation [SD]) HRQOL scores in children and parents were 55.5 (SD 12.7) and 53.89 (SD 12.19), respectively, with no differences detected in paired comparisons between the 2 groups. Significantly worse HRQOL scores were recorded in children showing a nonclassical clinical presentation, in those not adhering to treatment and in those reporting difficulties in following the diet. CONCLUSIONS: The CDDUX questionnaire emerged as reliable for use in Spanish children with celiac disease. Overall, both children and parents felt the disease had no substantial negative impacts on patient HRQOL.
25876505	[Food allergy:definitions, prevalence, diagnosis and therapy].	Food allergy is phenotypically an extremely heterogeneous group of diseases affecting multiple organs, sometimes in an isolated way, sometimes simultaneously, with the severity of reactions ranging from mild and local to full-blown anaphylaxis. Mechanistically, it is defined as a Th2-driven immune disorder in which food-specific IgE antibodies are at the basis of immediate-type adverse reactions. The sites of sensitization and symptoms do not necessarily overlap. Food allergy, which is the theme of this paper, is often confused with other adverse reactions to food of both animmune (e.g., celiac disease) and non-immune (e.g., lactose intolerance) nature. To reliably diagnose food allergy, a careful history (immediate-type reactions) needs to be complemented with demonstration of specific IgE (immune mechanism) and confirmed by an oral challenge. Co-factors such as exercise, medication, and alcohol may help trigger food allergy and further complicate accurate diagnosis. Where food extract-based diagnostic tests are poorly correlated to symptom severity, new generation molecular diagnostics that measure IgE against individual food allergens provide clinicians and patients with more reliable symptom severity risk profiles. Molecular diagnostics also support establishing whether food sensitization originates directly from exposure to food or indirectly (cross-reactivity) from pollen sensitization. Epidemiological surveys have indicated that allergy to peach primarily originates from peach consumption in Europe, whereas in China it is the result of primary sensitization to mugwort pollen, in both cases mediated by an allergen molecule from the same family. Epidemiological surveys give insight into the etiology of food allergy, the size of the problem (prevalence), and the risk factors involved, which together support evidence-based strategies for prevention. Over the past decade, food allergy has increased in the affluent world. Economic growth and urbanization in upcoming economies are likewise expected to lead to increased prevalence of food allergies, sometimes to different foods due to dietary habits. Molecular allergology and biotechnology now offer the possibility to combat the increasing burden of food allergy by developing safe immunotherapies for food allergy, using hypoallergenic mutant recombinant molecules. The first clinical trials to evaluate such approaches are underway. Last but not least, the identification and clinical risk characterization of a more and more complete list of food allergens additionally provides the allergenicity risk assessment of genetically modified foods a firmer basis. 
27131408	Is it gluten-free? Relationship between self-reported gluten-free diet adherence and knowledge of gluten content of foods.	OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between self-reported adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) and the ability to determine correctly the appropriateness of particular foods in a GFD. METHODS: Persons with celiac disease were recruited through clinics and support groups. Participants completed a questionnaire with items related to GFD information sources, gluten content of 17 common foods (food to avoid, food allowed, and food to question), GFD adherence, and demographic characteristics. Diagnosis was self-reported. RESULTS: The 82 respondents (88% female) had a median of 6 y GFD experience. Most (55%) reported strict adherence, 18% reported intentional gluten consumption and 21% acknowledged rare unintentional gluten consumption. Cookbooks, advocacy groups, and print media were the most commonly used GFD information sources (85-92%). No participant identified correctly the gluten content of all 17 foods; only 30% identified at least 14 foods correctly. The median score on the Gluten-Free Diet Knowledge Scale (GFD-KS) was 11.5 (interquartile ratio, 10-13). One in five incorrect responses put the respondent at risk of consuming gluten. GFD-KS scores did not correlate with self-reported adherence or GFD duration. Patient advocacy group members scored significantly higher on the GFD-KS than non-members (12.3 versus 10.6; P < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Self-report measures which do not account for the possibility of unintentional gluten ingestion overestimate GFD adherence. Individuals who believe they are following a GFD are not readily able to correctly identify foods that are GF, which suggests ongoing gluten consumption may be occurring, even among patients who believe they are "strictly" adherent. The role of patient advocacy groups and education to improve outcomes through improved adherence to a GFD requires further research.
27529713	Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in a patient with celiac disease.	
32133597	Oats as a Safe Alternative to Triticeae Cereals for People Suffering from Celiac Disease? A Review.	Oats represent a promising alternative to small-grain cereals from Triticeae group (wheat, barley, rye) for persons suffering from any form of gluten intolerance, especially celiac disease (CD), since oat-specific prolamins avenins reveal generally lower gluten content and immunoreactivity. Recent studies on avenin molecular structure revealed large genetic variability in avenin sequences affecting the spectrum of gluten peptides produced by hydrolases in human digestive tract. The aim of the present review is to summarise recent knowledge obtained in laboratory studies focused on the effect of avenin-derived peptides on reactivity of crucial components of human immune system such as dendritic cells (DC) and T-cells. The other part of the review summarises the results of clinical studies with CD patients including oat products in their diet. Since different clinical studies revealed contradictory results regarding potential safety of oats for CD patients, the focus has to be directed at genetic variability in oat avenins. Identification of avenin isoforms with minimum CD immunoreactivity will open up ways leading to designing novel oat cultivars suitable for CD patients. Knowledge on immunoreactivity of gluten peptides together with breeding new oat cultivars revealing minimum avenin immunoreactivity with respect to CD as well as application of food processing technologies leading to gluten content reduction should result in development of gluten-free oats safe for celiacs.
32418261	Gluten-free diet impact on dynamics of pancreatic islet-specific autoimmunity detected at celiac disease diagnosis.	OBJECTIVE: Almost 6% of celiac disease (CD) patients at diagnosis are positive for at least one of the main pancreatic islet autoantibodies that characterize type 1 diabetes (T1D). Few information, dated back to almost two decades ago, exist as to whether a gluten-free diet (GFD) could reduce the islet-specific autoimmunity detected in patients at CD diagnosis. Aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of GFD on 31 patients who presented islet-specific autoimmunity at CD diagnosis. METHODS: CD patient sera collected at diagnosis and throughout the GFD were analyzed for the main humoral autoantibodies so far identified in T1D, directed against one or more among insulin, glutamic-acid decarboxylase, tyrosine-phosphatase 2, and zinc cation-efflux transporter autoantigens. RESULTS: GFD (median duration 39 months) was associated to a decrease or disappearance of the islet-specific autoantibodies in 71% of CD patients. Almost 80% of the patients who became autoantibody-negative during the GFD were positive for only one of the islet-specific autoimmune markers at CD diagnosis, with none of them developing diabetes. Conversely, 80% of the CD patients positive at diagnosis for >=2 islet-specific autoantibodies were still positive after more than two years of GFD, with 25% of them developing T1D. CONCLUSIONS: Various factors appear to influence, individually or in combination, the effects of the GFD on pancreatic islet-specific autoimmune response detected at CD diagnosis. These factors include the number of diabetes autoantibodies found at CD diagnosis, the adherence to the GFD, its duration and an asymptomatic clinical presentation of CD.
33327648	Prototype Gluten-Free Breads from Processed Durum Wheat: Use of Monovarietal Flours and Implications for Gluten Detoxification Strategies.	In this investigation, we reported the production of prototype breads from the processed flours of three specific Triticum turgidum wheat genotypes that were selected in our previous investigation for their potential low toxic/immunogenic activity for celiac disease (CD) patients. The flours were subjected to sourdough fermentation with a mixture of selected Lactobacillus strains, and in presence of fungal endoproteases. The breads were characterized by R5 competitive enzyme linked immunosorbent assay in order to quantify the residual gluten, and the differential efficacy in gluten degradation was assessed. In particular, two of them were classified as gluten-free (<20 ppm) and very low-gluten content (<100 ppm) breads, respectively, whereas the third monovarietal prototype retained a gluten content that was well above the safety threshold prescribed for direct consumption by CD patients. In order to investigate such a genotype-dependent efficiency of the detoxification method applied, an advanced proteomic characterization by high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry was performed. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first proteomic investigation which benefitted, for protein identification, from the full sequencing of the Triticum turgidum ssp. durum genome. The differences of the proteins' primary structures affecting their susceptibility to hydrolysis were investigated. As a confirmation of the previous immunoassay-based results, two out of the three breads made with the processed flours presented an exhaustive degradation of the epitopic sequences that are relevant for CD immune stimulatory activity. The list of the detected epitopes was analyzed and critically discussed in light of their susceptibility to the detoxification strategy applied. Finally, in-vitro experiments of human gastroduodenal digestion were carried out in order to assess, in-silico, the toxicity risk of the prototype breads under investigation for direct consumption by CD patients. This approach allowed us to confirm the total degradation of the epitopic sequences upon gastro-duodenal digestion.
35745182	Adherence to Gluten-Free Diet Restores Alpha Diversity in Celiac People but the Microbiome Composition Is Different to Healthy People.	Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease with the destruction of small intestinal villi, which occurs in genetically predisposed individuals. At the present moment, a gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only way to restore the functionality of gut mucosa. However, there is an open debate on the effects of long-term supplementation through a GFD, because some authors report an unbalance in microbial taxa composition. METHODS: For microbiome analysis, fecal specimens were collected from 46 CD individuals in GFD for at least 2 years and 30 specimens from the healthy controls (HC). Data were analyzed using an ensemble of software packages: QIIME2, Coda-lasso, Clr-lasso, Selbal, PICRUSt2, ALDEx2, dissimilarity-overlap analysis, and dysbiosis detection tests. RESULTS: The adherence to GFD restored the alpha biodiversity of the gut microbiota in celiac people but microbial composition at beta diversity resulted as different to HC. The microbial composition of the CD subjects was decreased in a number of taxa, namely Bifidobacterium longum and several belonging to Lachnospiraceae family, whereas Bacteroides genus was found to be more abundant. Predicted metabolic pathways among the CD bacterial communities revealed an important role in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis. CONCLUSIONS: CD patients in GFD had a non-dysbiotic microbial composition for the crude alpha diversity metrics. We found significant differences in beta diversity, in certain taxon, and pathways between subjects with inactive CD in GFD and controls. Collectively, our data may suggest the development of new GFD products by modulating the gut microbiota through diet, supplements of vitamins, and the addition of specific prebiotics.
27830928	Oral iron absorption test with ferrous bisglycinate chelate in children with celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an immunologically-mediated enteropathy resulting in small-bowel mucosal villous atrophy with crypt hyperplasia. Iron malabsorption is usually observed in CD. Only few studies investigated oral iron absorption in subjects with gastrointestinal diseases and Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA), using the oral iron absorption test (OIAT). We considered useful to investigate the OIAT, using ferrous bisglycinate chelate (FBC), in patients with CD at diagnosis or on gluten free diet (GFD) from at least 1 year. METHODS: A total of 25 patients with CD (3-18 years old) and iron depletion, at diagnosis of CD (N.=12) or on GFD from at least 12 months (N.=13), were considered. Serum iron was evaluated at baseline (T0) and after 3 hours (T1) from the oral iron ingestion. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 21.0 software for Mac. RESULTS: OIAT was well tolerated by all patients. An important increase of the serum iron at T1, of at least twice the baseline values, occurred in all patients except in one (P value <0.0005). CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated good efficacy of the FBC, not only in patients with CD on GFD but also in children with newly diagnosed CD with the characteristic intestinal lesions.
23448408	Trace gluten contamination may play a role in mucosal and clinical recovery in a subgroup of diet-adherent non-responsive celiac disease patients.	BACKGROUND: Patients with persistent symptoms and/or villous atrophy despite strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) have non-responsive celiac disease (NRCD). A subset of these patients has refractory celiac disease (RCD), yet some NRCD patients may simply be reacting to gluten cross-contamination. Here we describe the effects of a 3-6 month diet of whole, unprocessed foods, termed the Gluten Contamination Elimination Diet (GCED), on NRCD. We aim to demonstrate that this diet reclassifies the majority of patients thought to have RCD type 1 (RCD1). METHODS: We reviewed the records of all GFD-adherent NRCD patients cared for in our celiac center from 2005-2011 who were documented to have started the GCED. Response to the GCED was defined as being asymptomatic after the diet, with normal villous architecture on repeat biopsy, if performed. RESULTS: Prior to the GCED, all patients were interviewed by an experienced dietitian and no sources of hidden gluten ingestion were identified. 17 patients completed the GCED; 15 were female (88%). Median age at start of the GCED was 42 years (range 6-73). Fourteen patients (82%) responded to the GCED. Six patients met criteria for RCD prior to the GCED; 5 (83%) were asymptomatic after the GCED and no longer meet RCD criteria. Of the 14 patients who responded to the GCED, 11 (79%) successfully returned to a traditional GFD without resurgence of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The GCED may be an effective therapeutic option for GFD-adherent NRCD patients. Response to this diet identifies a subgroup of patients, previously classified as RCD1, that is not truly refractory to dietary treatment. Preventing an inaccurate diagnosis of RCD1 avoids immunotherapy. Most patients are able to return to a traditional GFD without return of symptoms.
31898646	Health related quality of life among Saudi children and adolescents with celiac disease.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by gluten ingestion in genetically susceptible individuals. This study reports on the quality of life (QOL) of Saudi children and adolescents with CD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a case control study that included Saudi patients with CD, aged 9-18 years, who attended CD Clinic at KAU between February 2017 and July 2018. The study was conducted using the Short-Form (SF-36) questionnaire for all candidates, CD-specific QOL questionnaire for the CD patients group, and CD screen questionnaire for the control group. RESULTS: Overall, 354 subjects were studied (111 CD patients and 243 control). Female subjects constituted 56.8% of both patient and control groups. In the generic SF-36 questionnaire, QOL was comparable between patients and controls in all domains except for the general health domain, which showed difference in favor of the controls (55.01 +- 26.41 and 62.96 +- 18.16, P = 0.005). We also found that males have lower QOL scores in the domains comprising health change (P = 0.02), physical functioning (P = 0.04, role functioning/emotional and emotional well-being (P = 0.049). The CD-specific QOL showed excellent and good scores for 79.3% of patients overall in the tested domains. Patients with poor adherence showed poor QOL in all generic (SF-36) domains but not in CD-specific domains. CONCLUSION: The HRQOL for Saudi CD children on GFD is generally comparable to the healthy control with exception of the general health domain. Adherence to the GFD improves the generic (SF-36) QOL domains.
32453819	Osteoporosis in Premenopausal Women: A Clinical Narrative Review by the ECTS and the IOF.	CONTEXT: Consensus regarding diagnosis and management of osteoporosis in premenopausal women (PW) is still lacking due to few studies carried out in this population. DESIGN: The European Calcified Tissue Society and the International Osteoporosis Foundation convened a working group to produce an updated review of literature published after 2017 on this topic. RESULTS: Fragility fractures in PW are rare and mostly due to secondary osteoporosis (ie, in presence of an underlying disease such as hormonal, inflammatory, or digestive disorders). In absence of another disorder, low bone mineral density (BMD) together with fragility fractures qualifies as idiopathic osteoporosis. In contrast, low BMD alone does not necessarily represent osteoporosis in absence of bone microarchitectural abnormalities. BMD increases in PW with osteoporosis when the underlying disease is treated. For example, in celiac disease, an increase of 9% in radius trabecular volumetric density was achieved after 1 year of gluten-free diet, while anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha improved BMD in PW with inflammatory bowel diseases. In amenorrhea, including anorexia nervosa, appropriately delivered estrogen replacement therapy can also improve BMD. Alternatively, antiresorptive or anabolic therapy has been shown to improve BMD in a variety of conditions, the range of improvement (3%-16%) depending on skeletal site and the nature of the secondary cause. No studies were powered to demonstrate fracture reduction. The effects of bisphosphonates in childbearing women have been scantly studied and caution is needed. CONCLUSION: The majority of PW with osteoporosis have an underlying disease. Specific therapy of these diseases, as well as antiresorptive and anabolic drugs, improve BMD, but without evidence of fracture reduction.
31603739	A case of celiac disease with type I enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma in a Japanese male patient.	A 45-year-old Japanese male patient who was diagnosed with celiac disease (CeD) developed type I enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL). In 2013, the patient was admitted to our hospital with worsening of diarrhea and weight loss. Pathological examination of biopsy specimens from the duodenum and ileum led to a diagnosis of suspected EATL. A previous total colonoscopy (TCS) indicated villous atrophy in the terminal ileum. The patient was changed to a gluten-free diet, and the nutritional status gradually improved. In September 2014, he experienced acute right lower abdominal pain. He underwent urgent surgery, and a perforation was identified in the ileum. A diagnosis of type I EATL was made following histopathological examination. After eight courses of CHOP therapy, the patient entered complete remission. TCS and esophagogastroduodenoscopy with magnifying narrow-band imaging performed in 2015 identified villous regrowth in the distal ileum and duodenum. Capsule endoscopy also found villous regrowth in the entire small intestine. To our knowledge, this is the first case of type I EATL following CeD with villous atrophy before EATL occurrence in a Japanese HLA-DQ2 carrier. The possibility of type I EATL occurring after CeD should be recognized, although CeD is quite rare in Japan.
22732896	Navigating the gluten-free diet in college.	Factors that affect adherence to the gluten-free diet (GFD) are reported in children and adults; however, there is little data regarding young adults. The objective of the present study is to explore adherence challenges experienced by young adults in college. Responses from the online survey (N = 50), interview (N = 21), and focus group (N = 7) indicate students were motivated to adhere but experience challenges related to dining services and social situations. Dining services from 6 colleges reported a variety of accommodations for students with celiac disease, but request increased student involvement. Tools and strategies that facilitate communication between students and dining services may improve adherence.
37024737	Maladaptive Food Attitudes and Behaviors in Individuals with Celiac Disease and Their Association with Quality of Life.	BACKGROUND: The only treatment for celiac disease (CeD) is strict lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). In some individuals the demands of a GFD may contribute to maladaptive eating attitudes and behaviors that impair quality of life (QOL). The Celiac Disease Food Attitudes and Behaviors (CD-FAB) is an easily administered and scored 11-item tool querying potentially maladaptive food attitudes and behaviors resulting from beliefs around gluten exposures and food safety. OBJECTIVES: To assess the usefulness of the CD-FAB in establishing the presence of maladaptive food attitudes and behaviors among adults with CeD and to explore the relationship between these attitudes and behaviors and other factors including QOL, anxiety, depression, CeD symptoms and personality traits. METHODS: The study is a cross-sectional pilot of 50 adults (mean age 29.6 years) with biopsy-proven CeD who followed a GFD for at least one year and had no self-reported eating disorder diagnosis. High scores on the CD-FAB tool suggest higher disordered eating attitudes and beliefs. RESULTS: Compared to lower scores (mean 20.2), higher (worse) CD-FAB scores (mean 54.5) were positively associated with recency of diagnosis, number of CeD-related gastrointestinal symptoms, and the personality trait of neuroticism. Higher CD-FAB scores were statistically and clinically significantly associated with diminished QOL (p < 0.001). The relationship with anxiety and depression was less clear but trended in the expected direction. CONCLUSION: The CD-FAB may be a useful tool for dietitians who wish to monitor maladaptive food attitudes and behaviors among their CeD patients, especially in the first-year post-diagnosis.
21370728	Eosinophilic esophagitis, celiac disease, and immunoglobulin E-mediated allergy in a 2-year-old child.	Celiac disease, eosinophilic esophagitis, and urticaria are 3 manifestations of food allergy with different pathogenic mechanisms. We report the case of a 2-year-old child with digestive symptoms, slow growth, and severe asthma. The results of skin prick tests were positive to several foods. Endoscopy revealed eosinophilic esophagitis and celiac disease. Treatment consisted of a gluten-free diet and a 1-month course of oral corticosteroids. Endoscopy and biopsy findings were normal at 5 years of age. A gluten-free diet is the basis of treatment of celiac disease, but the role of an elimination diet in eosinophilic esophagitis is not well established. Our patient also developed urticaria when exposed to milk and egg.We present, to our knowledge, the first report of a patient with celiac disease, eosinophilic esophagitis, and immediate-type immunoglobulin E-mediated food allergy.
35921776	Celiac disease: New therapies on the horizon.	Celiac Disease (CeD) is a chronic intestinal disease which occurs in 0.7-1.4% of the global population. Since the discovery of gluten as its disease-inducing antigen, CeD patients are treated with a gluten-free diet which is effective but has limitations for certain groups of patients. Accordingly, over the past few years, there is a growing interest in alternative treatment options. This review summarizes emerging pharmacological approaches, including tolerance induction strategies, tissue transglutaminase inhibition, gluten degradation, and inhibition of interleukin (IL)-15.
29710789	Daily Intake of Milk Powder and Risk of Celiac Disease in Early Childhood: A Nested Case-Control Study.	Milk powder and gluten are common components in Swedish infants' diets. Whereas large intakes of gluten early in life increases the risk of celiac disease in genetically at-risk Swedish children, no study has yet evaluated if intake of milk powder by 2 years of age is associated with celiac disease. A 1-to-3 nested case-control study, comprised of 207 celiac disease children and 621 controls matched for sex, birth year, and HLA genotype, was performed on a birth cohort of HLA-DR3-DQ2 and/or DR4-DQ8-positive children. Subjects were screened annually for celiac disease using tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies (tTGA). Three-day food records estimated the mean intake of milk powder at ages 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months. Conditional logistic regression calculated odds ratios (OR) at last intake prior to seroconversion of tTGA positivity, and for each time-point respectively and adjusted for having a first-degree relative with celiac disease and gluten intake. Intake of milk powder prior to seroconversion of tTGA positivity was not associated with celiac disease (OR = 1.00; 95% CI = 0.99, 1.03; p = 0.763). In conclusion, intake of milk powder in early childhood is not associated with celiac disease in genetically susceptible children.
27720243	Quality of Life in Type 1 Diabetes and Celiac Disease: Role of the Gluten-Free Diet.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate quality of life (QoL) and glycemic control in youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and celiac disease vs T1D only. We hypothesized that QoL scores would be lower in youth with T1D and celiac disease and those nonadherent to the gluten-free diet (GFD). STUDY DESIGN: This case control study included 35 youth with T1D and 35 with T1D  and  celiac disease matched for age, sex, diabetes duration, and hemoglobin A1c level. QoL was assessed in participants and parents using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Generic Core Scale, Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Diabetes Module. and the General Well-Being Scale; youth with T1D and celiac disease also completed the celiac disease-specific DUX questionnaire and parents completed the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Family Impact Scale. Questionnaires were scored from 0 to 100; higher scores indicate better QoL or well-being. Scores were compared between T1D vs T1D with celiac disease, with subgroup analysis by GFD adherence vs nonadherence and therapy (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion vs multiple daily injections). RESULTS: Youth with T1D  and celiac disease reported similar generic and diabetes-specific QoL to T1D only. GFD nonadherent vs adherent youth reported lower diabetes-specific QoL (mean score 58 vs 75, P = .003) and lower general well-being (57 vs 76, P = .02), as did their parents (50 vs 72, P = .006), and hemoglobin A1c was higher (9.6% vs 8.0%, P = .02). Youth with T1D  and  celiac disease using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion vs multiple daily injections had similar generic and diabetes-specific QoL and A1C (8.6 vs 8.2%, P = .44), but were less happy having to follow a lifelong diet (59 vs 29, P = .007). CONCLUSIONS: Youth with T1D  and celiac disease who do not adhere to the GFD have lower QoL and worse glycemic control. Novel strategies are required to understand and improve adherence in those with both conditions.
36730234	Gluten-free diet adherence in children with screening-detected celiac disease using a prospective birth cohort study.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease has an increasing incidence worldwide and is treated with lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet. We aimed to describe gluten-free diet adherence rates in children with screening-identified celiac disease, determine adherence-related factors, and compare adherence to food records in a multinational prospective birth cohort study. METHODS: Children in The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young study with celiac disease were included. Subjects had at least annual measurement of adherence (parent-report) and completed 3-day food records. Descriptive statistics, t-tests, Kruskal-Wallis tests and multivariable logistic and linear regression were employed. RESULTS: Two hundred ninety (73%) and 199 (67%) of subjects were always adherent to a gluten-free diet at 2 and 5 years post celiac disease diagnosis respectively. The percentage of children with variable adherence increased from 1% at 2 years to 15% at 5 years. Children with a first-degree relative with celiac disease were more likely to be adherent to the gluten-free diet. Gluten intake on food records could not differentiate adherent from nonadherent subjects. Adherent children from the United States had more gluten intake based on food records than European children (P < .001 and P = .007 at 2 and 5 years respectively). CONCLUSION: Approximately three-quarters of children with screening-identified celiac disease remain strictly adherent to a gluten-free diet over time. There are no identifiable features associated with adherence aside from having a first-degree relative with celiac disease. Despite good parent-reported adherence, children from the United States have more gluten intake when assessed by food records. Studies on markers of gluten-free diet adherence, sources of gluten exposure (particularly in the United States), and effects of adherence on mucosal healing are needed.
36094456	Gluten-free grains: Importance, processing and its effect on quality of gluten-free products.	Gluten-enteropathy affects a significant number of people, making gluten a major concern in the food industry. With medical advancements, the diagnosis of allergies is becoming easier, and people who are allergic to gluten are recommended a complete gluten-free diet. Since wheat provides a major part of the energy and nutrition in the diet, its elimination affects nutrition intake of allergic population. Food scientists are working to formulate products using protein-rich gluten-free grains with quality attributes at par with gluten-containing products. Focused research has been done to provide nutrition and a variety of food to people suffering from gluten-related disorders. Efforts are being made to remove the gluten from the wheat and other gluten-containing grains, while applying different processing/treatments to enhance the properties of gluten-free grains. Hence, the present review summarizes the importance, processing, and products of different gluten-free grains. It also highlights the digestibility of gluten-free grains with clinical trials and gluten elimination strategies for gluten-containing grains.
35820710	Burden of persistent symptoms in treated coeliac disease: cause, aftermath or merely association?	
33218785	Non-classical clinical presentation at diagnosis by male celiac disease patients of older age.	BACKGROUND: . In a biopsy-proven adult celiac disease (CeD) cohort from the Netherlands, male patients were diagnosed with CeD at significantly older ages than female patients. OBJECTIVES: To identify which factors contribute to diagnosis later in life and whether diagnostic delay influences improvement of symptoms after starting a gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: . We performed a questionnaire study in 211 CeD patients (67:144, male:female) with median age at diagnosis of 41.8 years (interquartile range: 25-58) and at least Marsh 2 histology. RESULTS: . Classical symptoms (diarrhea, fatigue, abdominal pain and/or weight loss) were more frequent in women than men, but sex was not significantly associated with age at diagnosis. In a multivariate analysis, a non-classical presentation (without any classical symptoms) and a negative family history of CeD were significant predictors of older age at diagnosis (coefficients of 8 and 12 years, respectively). A delay of >3 years between first symptom and diagnosis was associated with slower improvement of symptoms after start of GFD, but not with sex, presentation of classical symptoms or age at diagnosis. CONCLUSION: . Non-classical CeD presentation is more prevalent in men and is associated with a diagnosis of CeD later in life. Recognizing CeD sooner after onset of symptoms is important because a long diagnostic delay is associated with a slower improvement of symptoms after starting a GFD.
31810336	Gluten Detection Methods and Their Critical Role in Assuring Safe Diets for Celiac Patients.	Celiac disease, wheat sensitivity, and allergy represent three different reactions, which may occur in genetically predisposed individuals on the ingestion of wheat and derived products with various manifestations. Improvements in the disease diagnostics and understanding of disease etiology unveiled that these disorders are widespread around the globe affecting about 7% of the population. The only known treatment so far is a life-long gluten-free diet, which is almost impossible to follow because of the contamination of allegedly "gluten-free" products. Accidental contamination of inherently gluten-free products could take place at any level from field to shelf because of the ubiquity of these proteins/grains. Gluten contamination of allegedly "gluten-free" products is a constant threat to celiac patients and a major health concern. Several detection procedures have been proposed to determine the level of contamination in products for celiac patients. The present article aims to review the advantages and disadvantages of different gluten detection methods, with emphasis on the recent technology that allows identification of the immunogenic-gluten peptides without the use of antibodies. The possibility to detect gluten contamination by different approaches with similar or better detection efficiency in different raw and processed foods will guarantee the safety of the foods for celiac patients.
30711208	Nonceliac Wheat Sensitivity: An Immune-Mediated Condition with Systemic Manifestations.	Non-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCWS) is characterized by gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms following the ingestion of gluten-containing cereals in subjects without celiac disease or wheat allergy. The identity of the molecular triggers in these cereals responsible for the symptoms of NCWS remains to be delineated. Recent research has identified a biological basis for the condition, with the observation of systemic immune activation in response to microbial translocation that appears to be linked to intestinal barrier defects. Ongoing research efforts are aimed at further characterizing the etiology, mechanism, and biomarkers of the condition.
34227075	COVID-19 in celiac disease: a multicentric retrospective cohort study.	OBJECTIVE: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder, characterized by increased susceptibility to bacterial and viral infections. Therefore, the CD patients could be exposed to an increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2, a virus for which the WHO declared a pandemic status in March 2020. This study aims to investigate the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in CD patients, to assess the impact of CD on the risk of contracting this virus. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective multicentric cohort study evaluated 542 celiac patients, who answered a questionnaire concerning both the underlying disease (adherence to the gluten-free diet, residual symptoms) and the possible SARS-CoV-2 infection (swab outcome, presence and characteristics of symptoms and type of treatment received), referring to the period between 20th January 2020 and 27th October 2020. RESULTS: Five patients (0.92%) tested positive; of these, 2 were asymptomatic and 3 developed symptoms of COVID-19. The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in CD patients was not significantly different from the general population. The ratio of positive/diagnostic swabs tends to be higher in CD patients than in the general population (IR: 0.15; 0.06; p=0.06), whereas the number of subjects who performed the swab in this group is significantly lower (IR: 0.06; 0.15; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Although CD patients are more susceptible to infections, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in our sample was not significantly different from the general population. However, the positive/diagnostic swabs ratio seems to be higher, probably also due to the lower number of patients tested.
26134988	Administration of Bifidobacterium breve Decreases the Production of TNF-alpha in Children with Celiac Disease.	BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence suggests that not only genetics, but also environmental factors like gut microbiota dysbiosis play an important role in the pathogenesis of celiac disease (CD). AIM: The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of two probiotic strains Bifidobacterium breve BR03 and B. breve B632 on serum production of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10 (IL-10) and pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in children with CD. METHODS: The study was a double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial that included 49 children with CD on gluten-free diet (GFD) randomized into two groups and 18 healthy children in the control group. The first group (24 children with CD) daily received B. breve BR03 and B632 (2 x 10(9) colony-forming units) and the second group (25 children with CD) received placebo for 3 months. RESULTS: TNF-alpha levels were significantly decreased in the first group after receiving B. breve for 3 months. On follow-up, 3 months after receiving probiotics, TNF-alpha levels increased again. Children with CD who were on GFD for less than 1 year showed similar baseline TNF-alpha levels as children who were on GFD for more than 1 year. IL-10 levels were in all groups of patients below detection level. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotic intervention with B. breve strains has shown a positive effect on decreasing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha in children with CD on GFD.
21969282	Duodenal ulceration in a patient with celiac disease and plasminogen I deficiency: coincidence or cofactors?	Celiac disease (CD) is a gluten-dependent inflammatory disease of the small bowel that affects up to 1% of the worldwide population. Despite severe mucosal abnormalities including total villous atrophy and autoantibody deposition, duodenal ulcer is not a feature of CD. However, a recent study found an elevated rate of peptic ulcer disease in patients with CD. Plasminogen deficiency (PLD) is an autosomal recessive disease that causes pseudomembranous lesions in different organs, but gastrointestinal involvement is rare. Here we report the case of a 6-year-old girl who had a sudden onset of hematemesis caused by duodenal ulcer. On the basis of mucosal atrophy, elevated celiac antibody levels, decreased plasminogen serum activity, and homozygous missense mutation R216H in the plasminogen gene, CD and PLD were diagnosed. This report is, to our knowledge, the first description of the 2 entities, and results of our double-immunofluorescent studies also suggest that both diseases may have a role in the ulceration process. Excessive amounts of fibrin deposition due to PLD caused the distortion of the vessels and was responsible for the unusual celiac immunoglobulin A and tissue transglutaminase 2 in vivo binding pattern. On the basis of this result, patients with CD and unknown cause of gastrointestinal ulcer may require investigation for PLD.
34524598	Long-Term Adherence to a Gluten-Free Diet and Quality of Life of Celiac Patients After Transition to an Adult Referral Center.	BACKGROUND: Modalities for the transition to adult care of celiac patients diagnosed during childhood/adolescence and their impact on long-term adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD-A), quality of life (QOL) and maintenance of follow-up in adulthood are unknown. AIMS: To evaluate whether timing of transition affects long-term GFD-A, QOL, and continuity of follow-up in adulthood and to identify predictors of long-term GFD-A. METHODS: Clinical and demographic data about pediatric care and adult follow-up at our center were retrospectively collected from clinical notes of celiac patients diagnosed during childhood/adolescence and then referred to our tertiary center. QOL and adult long-term GFD-A were prospectively evaluated with validated questionnaires. These parameters were studied by means of univariate and multivariate statistical analysis. RESULTS: 183 patients (130F, mean age at diagnosis 7.6 +- 5.8 years) were enrolled. Median age at transition to adult care was 20 years (IQR 17-25). There was no relationship between age at transition to adult care, long-term GFD-A, QOL, and continuity of follow-up. GFD-A tended to improve overall from pediatric care to adult referral (OR 2.92, 95% CI 1.13-7.87, p = 0.02) and also throughout adult follow-up (OR 9.0, 95% CI 4.2-19.7, p < 0.01). On multivariable logistic regression analysis, classical symptoms at diagnosis of celiac disease (p = 0.02) and good GFD-A at adult referral (p < 0.01) predicted good long-term GFD-A, while being lost to follow-up predicted poorer long-term GFD-A (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical characteristics can guide development of personalized strategies for implementing long-term GFD-A and ensure maintenance of regular follow-up in celiac patients diagnosed in childhood/adolescence and transitioning to adult care.
28223722	To screen or not to screen? Celiac antibodies in liver diseases.	Celiac disease (CD) is a systemic immune-mediated disorder triggered by dietary gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. The typical symptoms are anemia, diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss, and abdominal pain. CD has been reported in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis, primary biliary cholangitis, autoimmune hepatitis, aminotransferase elevations, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, portal hypertension and liver cirrhosis. We evaluate recommendations for active screening for CD in patients with liver diseases, and the effect of a gluten-free diet in these different settings. Active screening for CD is recommended in patients with liver diseases, particularly in those with autoimmune disorders, steatosis in the absence of metabolic syndrome, noncirrhotic intrahepatic portal hypertension, cryptogenic cirrhosis, and in the context of liver transplantation. In hepatitis C, diagnosis of CD can be important as a relative contraindication to interferon use. Gluten-free diet ameliorates the symptoms associated with CD; however, the associated liver disease may improve, remain the same, or progress.
30671907	Exit Gluten-Free and Enter Low FODMAPs: A Novel Dietary Strategy to Reduce Gastrointestinal Symptoms in Athletes.	Exercise-associated physiological disturbances alter gastrointestinal function and integrity. These alterations may increase susceptibility to dietary triggers, namely gluten and a family of short-chain carbohydrates known as FODMAPs (fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols). A recent surge in the popularity of gluten-free diets (GFDs) among athletes without celiac disease has been exacerbated by unsubstantiated commercial health claims and high-profile athletes citing this diet to be the secret to their success. Up to 41% of athletes at least partially adhere to a GFD diet, with the belief that gluten avoidance improves exercise performance and parameters influencing performance, particularly gastrointestinal symptoms (GIS). In contrast to these beliefs, seminal work investigating the effects of a GFD in athletes without celiac disease has demonstrated no beneficial effect of a GFD versus a gluten-containing diet on performance, gastrointestinal health, inflammation, or perceptual wellbeing. Interestingly, the subsequent reduction in FODMAPs concurrent with the elimination of gluten-containing grains may actually be the factors affecting GIS improvement, not gluten. Pre-existent in the gastrointestinal tract or ingested during exercise, the osmotic and gas-producing effects of variably absorbed FODMAPs may trigger or increase the magnitude of exercise-associated GIS. Research using FODMAP reduction to address gastrointestinal issues in clinically healthy athletes is emerging as a promising strategy to reduce exercise-associated GIS. Applied research and practitioners merging clinical and sports nutrition methods will be essential for the effective use of a low FODMAP approach to tackle the multifactorial nature of gastrointestinal disturbances in athletes.
34960101	Oral Consumption of Bread from an RNAi Wheat Line with Strongly Silenced Gliadins Elicits No Immunogenic Response in a Pilot Study with Celiac Disease Patients.	Celiac disease (CD) is a genetically predisposed, T cell-mediated and autoimmune-like disorder caused by dietary exposure to the storage proteins of wheat and related cereals. A gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only treatment available for CD. The celiac immune response mediated by CD4+ T-cells can be assessed with a short-term oral gluten challenge. This study aimed to determine whether the consumption of bread made using flour from a low-gluten RNAi wheat line (named E82) can activate the immune response in DQ2.5-positive patients with CD after a blind crossover challenge. The experimental protocol included assessing IFN-gamma production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), evaluating gastrointestinal symptoms, and measuring gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) in stool samples. The response of PBMCs was not significant to gliadin and the 33-mer peptide after E82 bread consumption. In contrast, PBMCs reacted significantly to Standard bread. This lack of immune response is correlated with the fact that, after E82 bread consumption, stool samples from patients with CD showed very low levels of GIP, and the symptoms were comparable to those of the GFD. This pilot study provides evidence that bread from RNAi E82 flour does not elicit an immune response after a short-term oral challenge and could help manage GFD in patients with CD.
26606684	Adverse Effects of Wheat Gluten.	Man began to consume cereals approximately 10,000 years ago when hunter-gatherers settled in the fertile golden crescent in the Middle East. Gluten has been an integral part of the Western type of diet ever since, and wheat consumption is also common in the Middle East, parts of India and China as well as Australia and Africa. In fact, the food supply in the world heavily depends on the availability of cereal-based food products, with wheat being one of the largest crops in the world. Part of this is due to the unique properties of wheat gluten, which has a high nutritional value and is crucial for the preparation of high-quality dough. In the last 10 years, however, wheat and gluten have received much negative attention. Many believe that it is inherently bad for our health and try to avoid consumption of gluten-containing cereals; a gluten-low lifestyle so to speak. This is fueled by a series of popular publications like Wheat Belly; Lose the Wheat, Lose the Weight, and Find Your Path Back to Health. However, in reality, there is only one condition where gluten is definitively the culprit: celiac disease (CD), affecting approximately 1% of the population in the Western world. Here, I describe the complexity of the cereals from which gluten is derived, the special properties of gluten which make it so widely used in the food industry, the basis for its toxicity in CD patients and the potential for the development of safe gluten and alternatives to the gluten-free diet. 
24772506	[Significance of a method for determination of deamidated gliadin peptide in the diagnosis of celiac disease].	AIM: To define the value of a new enzyme immunoassay in determining the level of anti-deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP) antibodies (Abs) in the diagnosis of celiac disease. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty-four patients treated at the Department of Intestinal Pathology, Central Research Institute of Gastroenterology, were examined. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was employed to determine Abs to tissue transglutaminase (tTG) and DGP of the IgA and IgG classes in the sera of all the patients. The diagnosis of celiac disease was verified by the histological examination of small bowel mucosa biopsy specimens. RESULTS: The examinees were divided into 3 groups: 1) 27 patients first diagnosed with celiac disease; 2) 40 patients keeping a gluten-free diet (GFD); 3) 57 patients with other gastrointestinal diseases (a comparison group). In the patients first diagnosed with celiac disease, the detection rate of elevated titers of anti-tTG and anti-DGP Abs in the IgA class was equal and constituted 92.5%; that in the IgG class was 96.2 and 55.5%, respectively. The comparison group showed an increase in the DGP levels in the IgA and IgG classes in 4 (7%) patients and a rise in tTG concentrations in the IgA and IgG classes was seen in only 2 (3.5%) patients. CONCLUSION: In the patents first diagnosed with celiac disease, the detection rate of elevated levels of anti-DGP Abs in the IgA and IgG classes is 92.5 and 96.2%, respectively, and significantly indifferent from that of IgA and IgG anti-tTG Abs. The patients keeping GFD displayed a reduction in anti-DGP Abs. The high detection rate of IgA anti-DGP Abs in the patients first diagnosed with celiac disease allows this method to be recommended for immunological diagnosis of this disease in adults.
37608439	A Clinician's Guide to Gluten Challenge.	Gluten challenge is an essential clinical tool that involves reintroducing or increasing the amount of gluten in the diet to facilitate diagnostic testing in celiac disease (CD). Nevertheless, there is no consensus regarding the applications of gluten timing, dosing, and duration in children. This review aims to summarize the current evidence, discuss practical considerations, and proposes a clinical algorithm to help guide testing in pediatric patients. Childhood development, social circumstances and long-term health concerns must be considered when identifying a candidate for gluten challenge. Based on previous studies, the authors suggest baseline serology followed by a minimum of 3-6 grams of gluten per day for over 12 weeks to optimize diagnostic accuracy for evaluation of CD. A formal provider check-in at 4-6 weeks is essential so the provider and family can adjust dosing or duration as needed. Increasing the dose of gluten further may improve diagnostic yield if tolerated, although in select cases a lower dose and shorter course (6-12 weeks) may be sufficient. There is consensus that mild elevations in celiac serology (<10 times the upper limit of normal) or symptoms, while supportive are not diagnostic for CD. Current North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition guidelines recommend histologic findings of intraepithelial lymphocytosis, crypt hyperplasia, and villous atrophy as the accurate and most appropriate endpoint for gluten challenge.
24695571	ACG releases guideline on diagnosis and management of celiac disease.	
36602836	American College of Gastroenterology Guidelines Update: Diagnosis and Management of Celiac Disease.	This guideline presents an update to the 2013 American College of Gastroenterology Guideline on the Diagnosis and Management of Celiac Disease with updated recommendations for the evaluation and management of patients with celiac disease (CD). CD is defined as a permanent immune-mediated response to gluten present in wheat, barley, and rye. CD has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations that resemble a multisystemic disorder rather than an isolated intestinal disease, and is characterized by small bowel injury and the presence of specific antibodies. Detection of CD-specific antibodies (e.g., tissue transglutaminase) in the serum is very helpful for the initial screening of patients with suspicion of CD. Intestinal biopsy is required in most patients to confirm the diagnosis. A nonbiopsy strategy for the diagnosis of CD in selected children is suggested and discussed in detail. Current treatment for CD requires strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) and lifelong medical follow-up. Most patients have excellent clinical response to a GFD. Nonresponsive CD is defined by persistent or recurrent symptoms despite being on a GFD. These patients require a systematic workup to rule out specific conditions that may cause persistent or recurrent symptoms, especially unintentional gluten contamination. Refractory CD is a rare cause of nonresponsive CD often associated with poor prognosis.
34067622	Iron Deficiency Anemia in Celiac Disease.	The iron absorption process developsmainly in the proximal duodenum. This portion of the intestine is typically destroyed in celiac disease (CD), resulting in a reduction in absorption of iron and subsequent iron deficiency anemia (IDA). In fact, the most frequent extra-intestinal manifestation (EIM) of CD is IDA, with a prevalence between 12 and 82% (in relation with the various reports) in patients with new CD diagnosis. The primary treatment of CD is the gluten-free diet (GFD), which is associated with adequate management of IDA, if present. Iron replacement treatment historically has been based on oral products containing ferrous sulphate (FS). However, the absorption of FS is limited in patients with active CD and unpredictable in patients on a GFD. Furthermore, a poor tolerability of this kind of ferrous is particularly frequent in patients with CD or with other inflammatory bowel diseases. Normalization from anemic state typically occurs after at least 6 months of GFD, but the process can take up to 2 years for iron stores to replenish.

21139574	Involvement of CD40-CD40 ligand in uncomplicated and refractory celiac disease.	OBJECTIVES: Cognate interaction between CD40 on antigen-presenting cells and CD40 ligand (CD40L) on T cells is a crucial costimulatory signal in T-cell activation. In this study, we investigated CD40-CD40L expression in the duodenum of uncomplicated and refractory celiac disease patients, and explored the ex vivo effects of CD40L blockade on cytokine production and the T-helper cell type 1-specific transcription factor T-bet. METHODS: CD40L and colocalization of CD40 with the dendritic cell markers CD11c and CD123 were investigated by confocal microscopy on tissue sections of duodenal biopsy samples obtained from 14 uncomplicated celiac patients before and after 12 months of gluten-free diet, 5 refractory celiac patients, and 12 controls. CD40 was also analyzed by flow cytometry on single cell suspension of mucosal biopsies. Treated celiac biopsies were stimulated with peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin (PT-gliadin) with or without an anti-CD40L-neutralizing antibody. Interferon (IFN)-gamma and interleukin (IL)-17 were measured by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). T-bet, CD40, and CD40L were determined by immunoblotting. RESULTS: CD40 and CD40L expression was higher in uncomplicated untreated and refractory celiac patients than in controls; the expression returned to normal after gluten-free diet in uncomplicated patients. Flow cytometric analysis confirmed that most CD40(+) cells were dendritic cells. The addition of the anti-CD40L antibody to treated celiac biopsies significantly inhibited the PT-gliadin-induced production of IFN-gamma and IL-17, and mucosal T-bet. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the CD40-CD40L pathway has a key role in celiac disease. Disruption of CD40-CD40L interaction may offer a therapeutic alternative in refractory celiac disease.
23601438	Prevalence and causes of abnormal liver function in patients with coeliac disease.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Coeliac disease patients frequently display mild elevation of liver enzymes and this abnormality usually normalizes after gluten-free diet. To investigate the cause and prevalence of altered liver function tests in coeliac patients, basally and after 1 year of gluten-free diet. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from 245 untreated CD patients (196 women and 49 men, age range 15-80 years) were retrospectively analysed and the liver function tests before and after diet, as well as associated liver pathologies, were assessed. RESULTS: Overall, 43/245 (17.5%) patients had elevated values of one or both aminotransferases; the elevation was mild (<5 times the upper reference limit) in 41 (95%) and marked (>10 times the upper reference limit) in the remaining 2 (5%) patients. After 1 year of gluten-free diet, aminotransferase levels normalized in all but four patients with HCV infection or primary biliary cirrhosis. CONCLUSIONS: In coeliac patients, hypertransaminaseaemia at diagnosis and the lack of normalization of liver enzymes after 12 months of diet suggest coexisting liver disease. In such instance, further evaluation is recommended to exclude the liver disease. Early recognition and treatment of coeliac disease in patients affected by liver disease are important to improve the liver function and prevent complications.
22612745	Autoimmune diseases in gastroenterology.	There are several different diseases in gastroenterology with an important role of immunological mechanisms in their pathogenesis. We know autoimmune diseases with immunological reactions against liver or pancreatic tissue. In addition there are diseases like chronic inflammatory bowel diseases representing inappropriate immunological reactions followed by inflammation and tissue destruction. The research of the last decade has contributed significantly to the understanding of the pathogenesis of diseases based on immunological mechanisms and consequently to the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting molecules. Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases, autoimmune hepatitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, autoimmune pancreatitis, and celiac disease are the most important diseases with immunological pathogenesis in Gastroenterology. Especially in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease with immunosuppressive drugs and monoclonal antibodies new preparations are used in therapy. Autoimmune pancreatitis was characterized as an own entity in the last years. Therefore, this review will focus on these diseases.
22620264	Future treatment strategies for celiac disease.	INTRODUCTION: Ingestion of dietary gluten in wheat, rye and barley by celiac patients leads to small-bowel mucosal villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia and massive inflammation, often coupled with clinical symptoms and signs. Currently, the only effective treatment is a strict life-long gluten-free diet excluding all gluten-containing food products. In view of the extremely restricted nature of the diet, new treatment options would clearly be desirable. AREAS COVERED: The improved understanding of celiac disease pathogenesis has enabled researchers to suggest alternative strategies to treat the disorder. This review covers current approaches toward developing an appropriate drug and discusses the possible problems associated with these approaches. EXPERT OPINION: Phase II clinical trials are already ongoing to test the efficacy of novel alternative treatments for celiac disease. Before any of the candidates can enter Phase III trials, however, researchers must develop novel reliable non-invasive surrogate markers for intestinal injury and disease activity which also accurately reflect patient-related outcomes. Any novel medication for celiac disease should be as effective and safe as the gluten-free diet, and this constitutes a challenge for drug development. It is thus likely that the first medication entering the market will be supplementary to rather than substitute the gluten-free diet.
27367722	Supplementation of Reduced Gluten Barley Diet with Oral Prolyl Endopeptidase Effectively Abrogates Enteropathy-Associated Changes in Gluten-Sensitive Macaques.	Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder that affects approximately three million people in the United States. Furthermore, non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) affects an estimated additional 6% of the population, e.g., 20 million in the U.S. The only effective treatment of CD and NCGS requires complete removal of gluten sources from the diet. While required adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) is extremely difficult to accomplish, efforts to develop additional supportive treatments are needed. To facilitate these efforts, we developed a gluten-sensitive (GS) rhesus macaque model to study the effects of novel therapies. Recently reported results from phase one of this project suggest that partial improvement-but not remission-of gluten-induced disease can be accomplished by 100-fold reduction of dietary gluten, i.e., 200 ppm-by replacement of conventional dietary sources of gluten with a mutant, reduced gluten (RG) barley (lys3a)-derived source. The main focus of this (phase two) study was to determine if the inflammatory effects of the residual gluten in lys3a mutant barley grain could be further reduced by oral supplementation with a prolylendopeptidase (PE). Results reveal that PE supplementation of RG barley diet induces more complete immunological, histopathological and clinical remission than RG barley diet alone. The combined effects of RG barley diet and PE supplementation resulted in a further decrease of inflammatory mediators IFN-gamma and TNF secretion by peripheral lymphocytes, as well as decreased plasma anti-gliadin and anti-intestinal tissue transglutaminase (TG2) antibodies, diminished active caspase production in small intestinal mucosa, and eliminated clinical diarrhea-all comparable with a gluten-free diet induced remission. In summary, the beneficial results of a combined RG barley and PE administration in GS macaques may warrant the investigation of similar synergistic approaches. 
21245600	Celiac disease in children and adolescents at a singe center in Saudi Arabia.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy, induced by gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. The objective of this study was to describe the clinical pattern of CD in children from the western region of Saudi Arabia. DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective, hospital-based. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included children with a biopsy-proven diagnosis of CD made between September 2002 and July 2007. Children were admitted to the endoscopy unit for a small-bowel biopsy if they had gastrointestinal symptoms suggestive of CD or if they were positive for a CD-antibody screen performed for the high-risk groups. RESULTS: Eighty children were identified with a diagnosis of CD. Their mean (SD) age was 9.6 (4.9) years (range, 0.5-18 years). There were 44 (55%) female patients. Forty-one (51%) patients were detected during screening of high-risk groups, while 39 (49%) patients had classical symptoms of malabsorption. The screening also detected asymptomatic patients. Of 65 patients tested, 11 (17%) had elevated liver function tests, which reverted to normal after introduction of a gluten-free diet (GFD) except in one case. Seventy-three (91%) patients were positive for anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies, 18 (23%), for IgG anti-gliadin antibodies; and 46 (58%), for IgA anti-gliadin antibodies. Forty-one (56%) patients showed good adherence to GFD as assessed by dietary history and the decline in anti-tTG level. CONCLUSION: CD may present with classical symptoms or be identified through screening programs. Growth and laboratory abnormalities usually improve after introduction of a GFD. Adherence to a GFD remains a problem; therefore, thorough assessment and counseling at the time of diagnosis and ongoing care are crucial.
29701659	The Effect of Depressive Symptoms on the Association between Gluten-Free Diet Adherence and Symptoms in Celiac Disease: Analysis of a Patient Powered Research Network.	BACKGROUND: The prevalence of depression in celiac disease (CD) is high, and patients are often burdened socially and financially by a gluten-free diet. However, the relationship between depression, somatic symptoms and dietary adherence in CD is complex and poorly understood. We used a patient powered research network (iCureCeliac ) to explore the effect that depression has on patients' symptomatic response to a gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: We identified patients with biopsy-diagnosed celiac disease who answered questions pertaining to symptoms (Celiac Symptom Index (CSI)), GFD adherence (Celiac Dietary Adherence Test (CDAT)), and a 5-point, scaled question regarding depressive symptoms relating to patients' celiac disease. We then measured the correlation between symptoms and adherence (CSI vs. CDAT) in patients with depression versus those without depression. We also tested for interaction of depression with regard to the association with symptoms using a multiple linear regression model. RESULTS: Among 519 patients, 86% were female and the mean age was 40.9 years. 46% of patients indicated that they felt "somewhat," "quite a bit," or "very much" depressed because of their disorder. There was a moderate correlation between worsened celiac symptoms and poorer GFD adherence (r = 0.6, p < 0.0001). In those with a positive depression screen, there was a moderate correlation between worsening symptoms and worsening dietary adherence (r = 0.5, p < 0.0001) whereas in those without depression, the correlation was stronger (r = 0.64, p < 0.0001). We performed a linear regression analysis, which suggests that the relationship between CSI and CDAT is modified by depression. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with depressive symptoms related to their disorder, correlation between adherence and symptoms was weaker than those without depressive symptoms. This finding was confirmed with a linear regression analysis, showing that depressive symptoms may modify the effect of a GFD on celiac symptoms. Depressive symptoms may therefore mask the relationship between inadvertent gluten exposure and symptoms. Additional longitudinal and prospective studies are needed to further explore this potentially important finding.

32708019	Persistent Iron Deficiency Anemia in Patients with Celiac Disease Despite a Gluten-Free Diet.	Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by intolerance to dietary gluten in genetically predisposed subjects. Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a common sign in CD, being the only abnormality in approximately 40% of celiac patients. A multifactorial etiology leads to IDA in CD. The two main causes are the villous atrophy of the mucosa at the site of iron absorption (the duodenum) and the resulting inflammation, which triggers the mechanism that leads to the anemia of chronic disease. Until now, it has been unclear why some patients with CD continue to have IDA despite a careful gluten-free diet (GFD) and the normalization of villous atrophy. Furthermore, some celiac patients are refractory to oral iron supplementation despite the healing of the mucosa, and they thus require periodic intravenous iron administration. The Marsh classification evaluates the degree of inflammation and villous atrophy, but it does not assess the possible persistence of ultrastructural and molecular alterations in enterocytes. The latter was found in CD in remission after adopting a GFD and could be responsible for the persistently reduced absorption of iron and IDA. Even in non-celiac gluten sensitivity, anemia is present in 18.5-22% of patients and appears to be related to ultrastructural and molecular alterations in intestinal microvilli. It is possible that a genetic component may also play a role in IDA. In this review, we evaluate and discuss the main mechanisms of IDA in CD and the possible causes of its persistence after adopting a GFD, as well as their therapeutic implications.

36401140	High Prevalence of Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders in Celiac Patients with Persistent Symptoms on a Gluten-Free Diet: A 20-Year Follow-Up Study.	BACKGROUND: Ongoing symptoms in treated celiac disease (CD) are frequent and are commonly thought of as being due to infractions to a gluten-free diet (GFD) or complications. AIMS: To study the etiology and natural history of clinically relevant events (CREs) throughout follow-up and identify predictors thereof to guide follow-up. METHODS: CREs (symptoms/signs requiring diagnostic/therapeutic interventions) occurring in celiac patients between January-2000 and May-2021 were retrospectively collected between June and September 2021 and analysed. RESULTS: One-hundred-and-eighty-nine adult patients (133 F, age at diagnosis 36 +- 13 years, median follow-up 103 months, IQR 54-156) were enrolled. CREs were very common (88/189, 47%), but hardly due to poor GFD adherence (4%) or complications (2%). Interestingly, leading etiologies were functional gastrointestinal disorders (30%), reflux disease (18%) and micronutrient deficiencies (10%). Age at diagnosis >= 45 years (HR 1.68, 95%CI 1.05-2.69, p = 0.03) and classical pattern of CD (HR 1.63, 95%CI 1.04-2.54, p = 0.03) were predictors of CREs on a multivariable Cox model. At 5 years, 46% of classical patients >= 45 years old at diagnosis were event-free, while this was 62% for non-classical/silent >= 45 years, 60% for classical < 45 years, and 80% for non-classical/silent < 45 years. CONCLUSIONS: CREs occurred in almost half of CD patients during follow-up, with functional disorders being very common. New follow-up strategies for adult CD may be developed based on age and clinical pattern at diagnosis.
22989466	Endocrine disorders in childhood and adolescence. Natural history of subclinical hypothyroidism in children and adolescents and potential effects of replacement therapy: a review.	OBJECTIVE: Subclinical hypothyroidism (SH) is quite common in children and adolescents. The natural history of this condition and the potential effects of replacement therapy need to be known to properly manage SH. The aim of this review is to analyze: i) the spontaneous evolution of SH, in terms of the rate of reversion to euthyroidism, the persistence of SH, or the progression to over hypothyroidism; and ii) the effects of replacement therapy, with respect to auxological data, thyroid volume, and neuropsychological functions. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Cochrane, and EMBASE (1990-2012) and identified 39 potentially relevant articles of which only 15 articles were suitable to be included. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: SH in children is a remitting process with a low risk of evolution toward overt hypothyroidism. Most of the subjects reverted to euthyroidism or remained SH, with a rate of evolution toward overt hypothyroidism ranging between 0 and 28.8%, being 50% in only one study (nine articles). The initial presence of goiter and elevated thyroglobulin antibodies, the presence of celiac disease, and a progressive increase in thyroperoxidase antibodies and TSH value predict a progression toward overt hypothyroidism. Replacement therapy is not justified in children with SH but with TSH 5-10 mIU/l, no goiter, and negative antithyroid antibodies. An increased growth velocity was observed in children treated with levothyroxine (l-T(4); two articles). l-T(4) reduced thyroid volume in 25-100% of children with SH and autoimmune thyroiditis (two studies). No effects on neuropsychological functions (one study) and posttreatment evolution of SH (one study) were reported.
33432477	Dermatitis Herpetiformis: An Update on Diagnosis and Management.	Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), presenting with an intense itch and blistering symmetrical rash, typically on the elbows, knees, and buttocks, is a cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease. Though overt gastrointestinal symptoms are rare, three-fourths of patients with DH have villous atrophy in the small bowel, and the rest have celiac-type inflammatory changes. DH affects mostly adults and slightly more males than females. The mean age at onset is about 50 years. DH diagnosis is confirmed by showing granular immunoglobulin A deposits in the papillary dermis. The DH autoantigen, transglutaminase 3, is deposited at the same site in tightly bound immune complexes. At present, the DH-to-celiac disease prevalence is 1:8. The incidence of DH is decreasing, whereas that of celiac disease is increasing, probably because of improved diagnostics. In DH, the treatment of choice for all patients is a gluten-free diet (GFD) in which uncontaminated oats are allowed. At onset, most patients need additional dapsone to rapidly control the rash and itching. Dapsone can be stopped after a mean of 2 years, and a strict lifelong GFD alone is required. Dietary adherence offers an excellent long-term prognosis for patients with DH, with a normal quality of life and all-cause mortality.
31935859	Changes in Age at Diagnosis and Nutritional Course of Celiac Disease in the Last Two Decades.	The frequency of celiac disease (CD) has increased along time, with relevant changes reported in geographical variations, clinical presentation and nutritional repercussions. In recent years, some celiac patients are presenting overweight/obesity, but it is unclear how frequent this is and to what extent undernutrition remains a concern. This is relevant because CD tends to be overlooked in overweight patients. With this in mind, we assessed age at diagnosis, clinical characteristics and nutritional status of 155 celiac patients diagnosed between 1994-2017 in four pediatric hospitals in Santiago, Chile. Since 2003, the number of patients diagnosed has increased (p < 0.0033), coinciding with antitransglutaminase and antiendomysial antibodies becoming available to public health systems. In 2000, 4.5% of patients were asymptomatic at diagnosis, suggesting that active search is not routinely applied. Gastrointestinal symptoms plus failure to thrive were significantly more frequent under 2 years (p = 0.0001). Nutritional status has improved at diagnosis and during follow up, but undernutrition remains more frequent in children <2 and <5 years (p < 0.002 and p < 0.0036, respectively). Overweight at diagnosis was reported in 2002 and obesity in 2010. After initiating treatment, since 2010, patients changing from undernourishment to overweight has sometimes been observed after only 6 months on a gluten-free diet.
30293993	First Degree Relatives of Patients with Celiac Disease Harbour an Intestinal Transcriptomic Signature that Might Protect them from Enterocyte Damage.	INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease (CeD) is an autoimmune enteropathy which affects approximately 0.7% of the global population. While first-degree relatives (FDR) of patients with CeD have a 7.5% risk of developing enteropathy, many remain protected. Therefore, intestinal mucosa of FDR might have protective compensatory mechanisms against immunological injury. We have explored the protective mechanisms that may be active in intestinal mucosa of FDR. METHODS: Intestinal mucosal biopsies (4-5 pieces) from treatment naive patients with CeD (n = 12), FDR (n = 12) (anti-tTG negative) and controls (n = 12) (anti-tTG negative) were obtained from each individual and subjected to microarray analysis using HT-12-v4 Human Expression BeadChips (Illumina). Differential gene expression analysis was carried out among CeD, FDR and controls; and resulting gene lists were analyzed using gene ontology and pathway enrichment tools. RESULTS: Patients with CeD, FDR and control groups displayed significant differential gene expression. Thirty seven genes were upregulated and 372 were downregulated in the intestinal mucosa of FDR in comparison to CeD and controls. Pseudogenes constituted about 18% (315/1751) of FDR differentially expressed genes, and formed "clusters" that associated uniquely with individual study groups. The three study groups segregated into distinct clusters in unsupervised (PCA) and supervised (random forests) modelling approaches. Pathways analysis revealed an emphasis on crypt-villous maintenance and immune regulation in the intestinal mucosa of FDR. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that the intestinal mucosa of celiac FDR consist of a unique molecular phenotype that is distinct from CeD and controls. The transcriptomic landscape of FDR promotes maintenance of crypt-villous axis and modulation of immune mechanisms. These differences clearly demonstrate the existence of compensatory protective mechanisms in the FDR intestinal mucosa.

21946447	[Vaccination and celiac disease: results of a retrospective study].	AIM: Human leucocyte antigen (HLA) system plays an essential role in the human immune system activity and the expression of some specific HLA antigens could modify the immune response to vaccinations. Celiac disease is included among the diseases associated to specific HLA profiles, principally characterized by the expression of the HLA DQ2 antigen. METHODS: Our study was a retrospective study, leaded on a group of celiac children, with the object to evaluate their immunological response to both obligatory and recommended vaccinations in childhood. It was a retrospective study, including 66 patients affected by celiac disease, between 3 and 15 years of age, and a control group of 50 children of the same age. All patients performed both obligatory and recommended vaccinations as indicated in the Italian standard regimen for vaccinations. The immunologic response to each vaccine was analysed and compared in the two groups. Moreover, authors also studied the immunologic response to vaccines in celiac children comparing patients whose diagnosis was made before 18 months of age with those whose disease was diagnosed after 18 months of age. RESULTS: Our results showed that in celiac patients the immunological response to vaccine is similar to that one found in general population, except for HBV vaccine. CONCLUSION: The evaluation of immunological response to HBV vaccine should be regularly effectuated in celiac children and revaccination should be recommended.
24490653	Celiac disease: the search for adjunctive or alternative therapies.	Celiac disease is a widespread disorder caused by intolerance to gluten, a common protein in food. Currently, a life-long gluten-free diet is the only available treatment for patients with celiac disease. However, adherence to gluten-free diet is difficult due to the widespread use of wheat-derived gluten in the food industry. Therefore, there is a pressing need for the development of novel non-dietary therapies. In this article, we will review several promising strategies focusing on reducing gluten immunogenicity or sequestering to gluten prevent its uptake by the intestinal epithelium. Other possible treatment strategies that will be reviewed include the suppression of the adaptive immune response, permeability modulation and the use of systemic T-cell or cytokine blockers. 
34068001	Influence of Mediterranean Diet Adherence and Physical Activity on Bone Health in Celiac Children on a Gluten-Free Diet.	We aimed to assess the influence of the Mediterranean Diet adherence and physical activity (PA) on body composition, with a particular focus on bone health, in young patients with celiac disease (CD). The CD group (n = 59) included children with CD with a long (>18 months, n = 41) or recent (<18 months, n = 18) adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). The non-celiac group (n = 40) included non-celiac children. After adjusting for potential confounders, the CD group showed lower body weight (p = 0.034), lean mass (p = 0.003), bone mineral content (p = 0.006), and bone Z-score (p = 0.036) than non-celiac children, even when the model was further adjusted for adherence to a GFD for at least 18 months. Among CD children, spending greater time in vigorous physical activity was associated with higher lean mass (p = 0.020) and bone mineral density with evidence of statistical significance (p = 0.078) regardless of the time they followed a GFD. In addition, a greater Mediterranean Diet adherence was associated with a higher bone Z-score (p = 0.020). Moreover, lean mass was strongly associated with bone mineral density and independently explained 12% of its variability (p < 0.001). These findings suggest the importance of correctly monitoring lifestyle in children with CD regarding dietary habits and PA levels to improve lean mass and, consequently, bone quality in this population.
26318181	Profound Reversible Hypogammaglobulinemia Caused by Celiac Disease in the Absence of Protein Losing Enteropathy.	When patients with hypogammaglobulinemia are encountered, a vigorous search should be undertaken for secondary treatable causes. Here we describe the first case of a patient with severe asymptomatic hypogammaglobulinemia where the underlying cause was undiagnosed celiac disease. A strict gluten free diet resulted in resolution of her mild long-standing abdominal symptoms and correction of her hypogammaglobulinemia. There was corresponding improvement in her duodenal histology and normalisation of her celiac serology. Protein losing enteropathy was unlikely to have been the mechanism of her profound hypogammaglobulinemia, as her albumin was within the normal range and she had a normal fecal alpha 1 antitrypsin level. Application of the Ameratunga et al. (2013) diagnostic criteria was helpful in confirming this patient did not have Common Variable Immunodeficiency Disorder (CVID). Celiac disease must now be considered in the differential diagnosis of severe hypogammaglobulinemia. There should be a low threshold for undertaking celiac serology in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia, even if they have minimal symptoms attributable to gut disease. 
25586360	[Clinical analysis of gluten-related disease].	OBJECTIVE: To explore the diagnosis and treatment of gluten-related disorders (GRD). METHODS: Anti-gliadin antibodies(AGA), anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibody, deamidated gliadin peptides (DGP) antibody and serum specific IgG antibodies of 14 kinds of intolerable food were tested in people who developed chronic diarrhea after the intake of gluten diet. HLA-DQ2, HLA-DQ8 and intestinal endoscopic multiple biopsies would be performed further in patients with positive coeliac disease (CD)-specific serology. Gluten free diet was given to patients with positive CD-specific serology.One patient received prednisone (30 mg/d and diminished 5 mg/w). RESULTS: Nine patients were confirmed with celiac disease (CD) and four cases were suspected non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) in 13 patients with positive serologic tests. Twelve cases received effective therapy. In CD group, 6 cases were accompanied with comorbidities mainly autoimmune diseases and osteoporosis. The positive rates of AGA and tTG antibody were 9/9 and 2/9 respectively in the CD group, while tTG antibody in the NCGS group were both negative.Endoscopic intestinal biopsy was performed in all 13 cases. Plasma cell proliferation and lymphocyte infiltration in the lamina propria without villus atrophy were identified in 4 cases, representing chronic inflammation of the small intestine. Villus atrophy was detected in 9 cases. Two patients with NCGS ingested gluten after 4 and 6 months of gluten-free diet respectively, and the number of bowel movements increased 1-2 times per day. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of CD is mainly based on serologic tests and characteristic of histological features. CD may be companied by other autoimmune diseases or metabolic disease of bone. Lifelong adherence to a gluten free diet is the most basic and effective therapy.
27571100	Persistent Intraepithelial Lymphocytosis in Celiac Patients Adhering to Gluten-Free Diet Is Not Abolished Despite a Gluten Contamination Elimination Diet.	The gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only validated treatment for celiac disease (CD), but despite strict adherence, complete mucosal recovery is rarely obtained. The aim of our study was to assess whether complete restitutio ad integrum could be achieved by adopting a restrictive diet (Gluten Contamination Elimination Diet, GCED) or may depend on time of exposure to GFD. Two cohorts of CD patients, with persisting Marsh II/Grade A lesion at duodenal biopsy after 12-18 months of GFD (early control) were identified. Patients in Cohort A were re-biopsied after a three-month GCED (GCED control) and patients in Cohort B were re-biopsied after a minimum of two years on a standard GFD subsequent to early control (late control). Ten patients in Cohort A and 19 in Cohort B completed the study protocol. There was no change in the classification of duodenal biopsies in both cohorts. The number of intraepithelial lymphocytes, TCRgammadelta+ (T-Cell Receptor gamma delta) T cell and eosinophils significantly decreased at GCED control (Cohort A) and at late control (Cohort B), compared to early control. Duodenal intraepithelial lymphocytosis persisting in CD patients during GFD is not eliminated by a GCED and is independent of the length of GFD. [NCT 02711696]. 
29948993	Prevalence of celiac disease among pediatric patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis and effect of gluten-free-diet.	BACKGROUND: Liver involvement in celiac disease (CD) is classified into autoimmune and cryptogenic. The association between CD and autoimmune liver diseases like autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis is well-established; however, the data on patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis, particularly from India, are scanty. So we did this study to find the prevalence of CD in patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis. METHODS: This was a prospective observational study, involving children of less than 18 years old attending Pediatric and Gastroenterology clinic with a diagnosis of cryptogenic cirrhosis. The patients were evaluated for CD and divided into two groups: chronic liver disease (CLD) with CD, and CLD without CD. Both the groups were followed up for 6 months. CLD with CD group was treated with gluten-free-diet (GFD) and CLD without CD group was followed up without any specific intervention except standard care of CLD. RESULTS: Out of 84 patients, 11 (13.1%) were diagnosed as CLD with CD. There was an improvement in hemoglobin levels, liver function tests, and Child-Pugh score after initiation of GFD in CLD with CD group. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of CD in cryptogenic cirrhosis was 13.1%. Screening for CD is recommended for cryptogenic cirrhosis. Hepatic functions improve with a GFD in CD patients with cirrhosis.
36234700	Safety Assessment of Foods and Drinks Consumed by People on a Gluten-Free Diet.	Naturally gluten-free foods and processed foods that do not contain information about the potential presence of gluten in them pose a hypothetical threat to people with food allergies and celiac disease. Patients who should follow a strict gluten-free diet do not always do so. Therefore, the aim of this research was to analyze certified "gluten-free" and naturally gluten-free products without labeled "may contain gluten" information in terms of their content of gluten proteins. The enzyme immunoassay AgraQuant Gluten G12 ELISA test kit was used for the analysis. Of all the products used in the research, only 5.8% were found to contain gluten above 20 ppm. Only one product labeled "gluten-free" was contaminated with gluten at 79.3 ppm (cider cake). In addition, our research also examined the gluten content of commercial beers containing barley malt not labeled as "gluten-free". Research has shown that 60% of samples are not safe for those on a strict gluten-free diet. Our research clearly shows that many manufacturers, although they do not monitor their products for the presence of gluten in them, offer safe products, although they cannot be recommended in a gluten-free diet. Therefore, there is a strong need to increase the frequency of testing by food manufacturers for the presence of gluten in their products, so that the number of products approved for people on a gluten-free diet continues to increase.
37049456	The Role of Gluten in Gastrointestinal Disorders: A Review.	Gluten is only partially digested by intestinal enzymes and can generate peptides that can alter intestinal permeability, facilitating bacterial translocation, thus affecting the immune system. Few studies addressed the role of diet with gluten in the development of intestinal inflammation and in other gastrointestinal disorders. The aim of this narrative review was to analyse the role of gluten in several gastrointestinal diseases so as to give a useful overview of its effectiveness in the prevention and management of these disorders.
30778350	Protective Effects of Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Signaling in Celiac Disease Mucosa and in Poly I:C-Induced Small Intestinal Atrophy Mouse Model.	Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a transcription factor activated by a large number of natural and synthetic agents, modulates the activity of immune cells in the gut and represents an important link between the environment and immune-mediated pathologies. In this study, we investigated the role of AhR in celiac disease (CD), a gluten-driven enteropathy. AhR expression was evaluated in intestinal biopsies taken from patients with CD and controls by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. AhR was also analyzed in ex vivo organ cultures of duodenal biopsies taken from inactive CD patients incubated in presence or absence of peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin. IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, granzyme B, and perforin expression was evaluated in anti-CD3/CD28-activated intestinal lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) and intestinal intra-epithelial cells (IEL) of active CD patients cultured in the presence or absence of the AhR agonist 6-formylindolo(3, 2-b)carbazole (Ficz). Finally, the protective role of AhR was evaluated in a mouse model of poly I:C-driven small intestine damage. AhR RNA transcripts were reduced in active CD samples as compared to inactive CD and normal controls. Flow cytometry confirmed such results and showed a reduction of AhR in both IEL and LPMC of active CD patients. The addition of a peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin to ex vivo organ cultures of duodenal biopsies taken from inactive CD patients reduced AhR expression. Treatment of CD IEL and LPMC with Ficz reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines, granzyme B and perforin. Mice injected with Ficz were protected against poly I:C-induced intestinal lesions. Our findings suggest that defective AhR-driven signals could contribute to amplify pathogenic responses in the gut of CD patients.
31608661	The effect of self-efficacy expectations in the adherence to a gluten free diet in celiac disease.	Objective: To analyse the effect of general and specific self-efficacy on the adherence to a gluten free diet (GFD) in patients with celiac disease along with the effect of other relevant variables.Design: 271 patients with celiac disease participated in this transversal descriptive study and completed a series of questionnaires regarding adherence (CDAT), general self-efficacy (GSES) and specific self-efficacy (Celiac-SE) and quality of life (CD-Qol), among others.Main Outcome Measures: Dependent variable was adherence to the Gluten Free Diet (GFD). Main independent variables were general self-efficacy, specific self-efficacy and quality of life. Model tests were conducted using regression analysis.Results: 71.9% of patients show an excellent or good adherence to the diet. Higher levels of adherence are positively associated to a high expectancy of specific self-efficacy, to the perceived adoption of recommended behaviours, risk perception and better quality of life (these variables accounted for 36.4% of the variance in the adherence to a GFD, p < .001).Conclusions: Specific self-efficacy rather than general has a predictive value in adherence to a GFD. Therefore, we need to develop and transculturally adapt new instruments to assess specific self-efficacy. Celiac-SE has proved to be a useful scale for this objective.
32022573	Duodenal lymphogram as a complementary tool in the diagnosis of celiac disease in adults.	INTRODUCTION: celiac disease (CD) patients have a specific pattern of lymphocytic infiltrate in the duodenal mucosa. Flow cytometry is a complementary tool for the diagnosis of CD, which allows the quantification and characterization of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) by what is commonly called a lymphogram. Here we describe our experience with this technique in the diagnosis of CD in adult patients. METHODS: lymphograms from 157 patients performed in our center between 2009 and 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. Fourteen patients had a previous diagnosis of CD and followed a gluten-free diet (GFD), 21 had a new diagnosis of CD and the remaining were considered as non-celiac. The association of the lymphogram results (total IELs, CD3- lymphocytes and TcRgammadelta lymphocytes) with the CD diagnosis, compliance with the GFD, time since diagnosis and IgA anti-TG2 titer were determined. RESULTS: the area under the ROC curve of TcRgammadelta lymphocytes for CD patients varied between 0.86 and 0.86. The percentage of TcRgammadelta lymphocytes in GFD-treated patients was lower; 12 (8.5) vs 20.5 (8.7), p = 0.0153. However, it remained high compared to non-CD; 12 (8.5) vs 6.7 (6), p = 0.135. The time since diagnosis and IgA anti-TG2 titer correlated with the lymphogram results. Helicobacter pylori infection and treatment with angiotensin receptor antagonist 2 (ARA2) were associated with differences in the lymphogram results in patients without CD. CONCLUSIONS: the duodenal lymphogram is a reliable complementary tool in adults for the diagnosis of CD. However, compliance and duration of the GFD and other factors may condition its diagnostic capacity.
30098695	Celiac disease is not more prevalent in patients undergoing in vitro fertilization and does not affect reproductive outcomes with or without treatment: a large prospective cohort study.	OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence of celiac disease in the infertile population undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) and assess outcomes. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: A single infertility center from January 2016 to March 2017. PATIENT(S): Women 18-45 years of age participating in IVF. INTERVENTION(S): Patients had serum tissue transglutaminase (tTG) and endomysial (EMA) IgA testing to screen for celiac disease and completed a 10-question "yes or no" survey to assess their medical history, previous testing, dietary habits, and pertinent symptoms. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): IVF cycle outcomes were compared between seronegative and seropositive patients. RESULT(S): Of 1,000 patients enrolled, 995 completed serologic screening and 968 underwent oocyte retrieval. Eighteen patients screened positive for both tTG and EMA (1.8%) and 10 additional patients (1.0%) screened positive for one of the two antibodies. The number of mature oocytes retrieved, fertilization rates, and blastulation rates were equivalent between seronegative and seropositive patients. There were 987 patients who completed the questionnaire (98.7%), and 84 reported being gluten free (8.5%). Those who reported being gluten free were no more likely to be antibody positive than the general population. Furthermore, a low-gluten diet was not associated with markers of ovarian reserve, oocytes retrieved, fertilization, blastulation, sustained implantation and pregnancy loss rates. CONCLUSION(S): The prevalence of seropositive celiac disease was consistent with that of the general population (2.8%). Patients who were seropositive for celiac disease-related antibodies had outcomes equivalent to seronegative patients, and patients with a gluten-free diet did not have improved outcomes.
24518796	Early microbial markers of celiac disease.	BACKGROUND AND GOALS: Seroreactivity against the Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ASCA), Pseudomonas fluorescens-associated sequence (I2), and Bacteroides caccae TonB-linked outer membrane protein (OmpW) has been detected in celiac disease patients with small-bowel mucosal atrophy. Levels of these antibodies decrease during a gluten-free diet, but their functions and time of appearance in celiac disease are not known. We aimed to search for evidence of possible microbial targets of the immune responses in the early-stage celiac disease patients who showed normal small-bowel mucosal architecture at the time of the first investigations, but later on a gluten-containing diet developed mucosal atrophy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-four cases with proven early-stage celiac disease and normal mucosal morphology were enrolled. Patients' sera were tested for celiac disease antibodies against tissue transglutaminase (tTG-ab), endomysium, and for microbial antibodies against I2, OmpW, and ASCA IgG and IgA isotypes in both at the time of diagnosis and while on a gluten-free diet. RESULTS: Thirty-four (77%) of 44 patients with early-stage celiac disease had elevated serum antibodies to one or more of the antibodies ASCA, I2, and OmpW. Furthermore, 5 of 6 cases negative for both tTG-ab and endomysium showed positivity for the microbial markers. Seroreactivity to ASCA IgA, ASCA IgG, and OmpW decreased significantly during gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: Seroreactivity to different microbial antigens is evident already in patients with early-stage celiac disease. ASCA antibodies seem to be gluten-dependent. The results indicate that the microbial targets might have a role in the early development of celiac disease.
32558265	Gluten-Free Diet in IBD: Time for a Recommendation?	Patients and providers alike are highly interested in identifying potentially useful dietary interventions in the management of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). This review examines the clinical associations of celiac disease (CeD), non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), and IBD with a focus on available data of the therapeutic efficacy of gluten-free diet (GFD) or low-gluten-containing diets in the therapy of IBD. There is a strong association between CeD and microscopic colitis, but the prevalence of CeD among IBD patients is similar to that of the general population. Interestingly, in cross-sectional studies nearly one-third of IBD patients report a diagnosis of NCGS, and many follow a GFD. Although animal studies have shown that gluten ingestion may promote intestinal inflammation and increase intestinal permeability, there have been no prospective studies evaluating the role of a GFD in the induction and maintenance of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Several cross-sectional reports suggest that a GFD may improve symptoms in IBD patients, but due to a lack of high-quality prospective clinical studies, current data do not support the universal use of a GFD in IBD.
29142467	Non-celiac gluten sensitivity: All wheat attack is not celiac.	Currently, 1% of the United States population holds a diagnosis for celiac disease (CD), however, a more recently recognized and possibly related condition, "non-celiac gluten sensitivity" (NCGS) has been suggested to affect up to 6% of the United States public. While reliable clinical tests for CD exist, diagnosing individuals affected by NCGS is still complicated by the lack of reliable biomarkers and reliance upon a broad set of intestinal and extra intestinal symptoms possibly provoked by gluten. NCGS has been proposed to exhibit an innate immune response activated by gluten and several other wheat proteins. At present, an enormous food industry has developed to supply gluten-free products (GFP) with GFP sales in 2014 approaching $1 billion, with estimations projecting sales to reach $2 billion in the year 2020. The enormous demand for GFP also reflects a popular misconception among consumers that gluten avoidance is part of a healthy lifestyle choice. Features of NCGS and other gluten related disorders (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome) call for a review of current distinctive diagnostic criteria that distinguish each, and identification of biomarkers selective or specific for NCGS. The aim of this paper is to review our current understanding of NCGS, highlighting the remaining challenges and questions which may improve its diagnosis and treatment.
29880966	Celiac Disease and Fecal Microbiota Transplantation: A New Beginning?	
37952478	Polysomnographic profile in children diagnosed with celiac disease before starting on a gluten free diet.	STUDY AIMS: The study assessed the presence of sleep abnormalities in children who had recently been diagnosed with celiac disease (CD) and not started a gluten free diet (GFD). The children's polysomnographic profiles were also characterized and further compared with healthy children of the same age. METHODS: This prospective cross-sectional study involved 46 pediatric subjects (aged 1-19 years) who had recently been diagnosed with CD and not started a GFD. The control group consisted of 32 healthy children (aged 2-17 years). All children underwent anthropometric measurement, laboratory testing and standard overnight observation with in-laboratory video-PSG. The study and control group were divided into subgroups according to the subjects' median ages (8.1 years): celiac children aged less than 8.1 years (n = 23) and more than 8.1 years (n = 23), healthy children less aged than 8.1 years (n = 16) and more than 8.1 years (n = 16). RESULTS: No significant differences in the basic demographic and anthropometric parameters between the celiac and control group were observed. Significantly prolonged sleep latency (SOL) was evident in the celiac subjects (21.89 +- 20.77 min. vs. 10.99 +- 7.94 min, p = 0.02), with a probability of prolonged SOL of 4.23-fold greater (OR = 4.23; 95 % CI 1.1-16.22) than the healthy controls, especially in the subgroup of older celiac patients. No significant differences in the sleep period time (SPT), total sleep time (TST), wake during sleep (WASO), sleep efficiency (SE) and sleep stage distribution and cyclization were found. The respiratory rates during sleep indicated a significantly greater incidence of the central apnea-hypopnea index (CAHI) (0.54 +- 0.78 vs. 0.18 +- 0.24, p = 0.03) with a 3.16-fold greater probability of pathological CAHI (OR = 3.16; 95 % CI 1.02-9.77) than the control group. An increased incidence of CSA in the subgroup of younger celiac patients compared to younger healthy controls was especially evident. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of our study suggest a difference in sleep architecture and an increased incidence of CSA in children with untreated CD, but additional research is required to verify the results.
29616378	Diagnosis of Celiac Disease: Taking a Bite Out of the Controversy.	Celiac disease is a common autoimmune disorder of the small intestine, triggered by an immunological response to the gluten present in wheat, barley, and rye in individuals who are genetically at risk. A key to reducing the complications of this disease is early diagnosis, preferably in childhood, and consuming a lifelong gluten-free diet once diagnosis is confirmed. Yet, the diagnosis of celiac disease is often considerably delayed, exposing patients to needless suffering and morbidity. It is also difficult to confirm histologically if dietary gluten has been restricted prior to obtaining a diagnostic biopsy, a significant problem given the current growing popularity of gluten-free diets. Furthermore, failure to understand or follow current guidelines means physicians may recommend patients commence the gluten-free diet before initiating referral to a gastroenterologist. Finally, adding further confusion, pediatric guidelines in Europe support a diagnosis based on serology rather than on histology, whereas those based in North America do not. The purpose of this review is to discuss these issues and other controversies in the diagnosis of celiac disease and to consider ways to optimize diagnosis across the lifespan.
39067614	New developments in celiac disease treatments.	Celiac disease (CeD), an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten, affects around 1% of the global population. Standard treatment is a strict gluten-free diet (GFD), which poses significant challenges due to dietary restrictions, cross-contamination and subsequent persistent intestinal inflammation. This underscores the need for new treatment options addressing the complex pathophysiology of CeD. Recent research focuses on developing drugs that target intestinal barrier regeneration, gluten peptide modification, immune response alteration, and gut microbial ecosystem modulation. These approaches offer potential for more effective management of CeD beyond GFD. Gluten-independent treatments may be particularly relevant under the FDA's draft guidance for CeD, which emphasizes drug development as an adjunct to GFD for patients with ongoing signs and symptoms of CeD despite strict GFD.
27472272	Symptoms and biomarkers associated with celiac disease: evaluation of a population-based screening program in adults.	OBJECTIVES: To identify possible early predictors (symptoms and biomarkers) of celiac disease, compare symptoms before and after screening, and evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of serologic screening for celiac disease in an adult Danish population. METHODS: This cross-sectional population-based study was based on the 5-year follow-up of the Health2006 cohort, where 2297 individuals were screened for celiac disease; 56 were antibody positive and thus invited to clinical evaluation. Eight were diagnosed with biopsy-verified celiac disease. A follow-up questionnaire was sent to antibody-positive individuals 19 months after the clinical evaluation to obtain information on their symptoms and their experience with participation in the screening. RESULTS: Before screening, participants subsequently diagnosed with celiac disease did not differ from the rest of the population with respect to symptoms, but had significantly lower total cholesterol. Tissue transglutaminase IgA antibodies with a cut-off of 10 U/ml had a positive predictive value of 88%. The majority of participants were satisfied with their participation in the screening program. Individuals with celiac disease were generally satisfied with having been diagnosed and 71% felt better on a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSION: There were no differences in the prevalence of symptoms between participants with and without screening-detected celiac disease, confirming that risk stratification in a general population by symptoms is difficult. The majority of participants diagnosed with celiac disease felt better on a gluten-free diet despite not reporting abdominal symptoms before diagnosis and participants in the clinical evaluation were generally satisfied with participation in the screening program.
24225846	Health-related quality of life in children with celiac disease: a study based on the Critical Incident Technique.	Celiac Disease (CD) is a chronic autoimmune disease triggered by dietary gluten. Gluten avoidance, which is the only available treatment for CD, could impact on quality of life of children with CD. We present the results of a qualitative study on the emotional impact of gluten free diet (GFD) on the everyday life of children affected with CD. We investigated 76 celiac patients aged 2-18 years (average age: 9.5 years). By using the Critical Incident Technique (CIT), we defined emotions related to difficulties and awkward situations experienced by the patients. Written answers to open-ended questions from either children (older than 8 years) and parents (children younger than 8 years) were analyzed qualitatively. We found 80 dilemmas experienced in three different arenas (food situations at school, meals at home, meals outside) and characterized lived experiences of children with CD in everyday life (specific emotions, difficulties in relationships and in management of daily life). Children with CD experience strong emotions related to the GFD, permeating several aspects of everyday life. These dilemmas may be missed by a conventional, questionnaire-based approach to the psycho-social consequences of CD treatment. 
23674144	Dermatitis herpetiformis.	Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an autoimmune, pleiomorphic, papulovesicular disorder associated with celiac disease and gluten sensitivity. DH is characterized by subepidermal bullae on hematoxylin and eosin staining and granular immunoglobulin A deposits in the dermal papillae using the direct immunofluorescence method. Antibodies to tissue transglutaminase and epidermal transgulatminase can be measured serologically, although biopsy is still required for definitive diagnosis of DH. Gluten free diet (GFD) is the first-line therapeutic approach that can alleviate both cutaneous and intestinal manifestations of this condition, while dapsone and sulfones target the skin eruption only. Combined therapy with GFD and dapsone is an initial treatment of choice to control the cutaneous manifestations of DH. This article will provide a comprehensive review of DH, including its epidemiology, clinical and pathological findings, diagnostic evaluation, and management.
24464413	Dramatic improvement of parkinsonian symptoms after gluten-free diet introduction in a patient with silent celiac disease.	
30978535	Nonceliac Gluten and Wheat Sensitivity.	Non-celiac gluten and/or wheat sensitivity (NCGS) is thought to be an immune-mediated reaction to gluten or other components of wheat (eg, fructans or amylase trypsin inhibitors) with intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms which improve once gluten and/or wheat is eliminated from the diet and after a diagnosis of celiac disease and wheat allergy have been excluded with appropriate testing. However, there is a great deal of skepticism within the scientific community questioning the existence of NCGS as a distinct clinical disorder. There are no strict diagnostic criteria and a placebo-controlled rechallenge trial has been recommended for diagnosis. In research settings, a double-blind placebo-controlled rechallenge trial has been recommended for diagnosis. There are limited studies estimating the prevalence of NCGS using this study design. The existing studies have variable results likely due to the lack of a uniform diagnostic criterion, a great deal of dependence on the patient's perception of symptoms and a large nocebo effect in existing studies. In clinical practice, a single blind placebo-controlled rechallenge trial has been recommended for diagnosis. The pathogenesis of NCGS is unclear and there is no known biomarker or diagnostic histologic lesion for this condition. It is important to adopt a multidisciplinary team approach to patients with suspected NCGS with involvement of the primary care doctor, gastroenterologist, pathologist and nutritionist who may play an important role in diagnosis and treatment. There may especially be a role in elimination of food containing high quantity of both gluten and fructans. Furthermore, patients should be educated on the nutritional implications of consuming a long-term gluten-free diet.
22149550	Celiac disease in pediatric patients with autoimmune hepatitis: etiology, diagnosis, and management.	Celiac disease (CD) is defined as a permanent intolerance to ingested wheat gliadins and other cereal prolamins, occurring in genetically susceptible people. Persistent elevation of serum aminotransferase activity is expression of liver damage related to CD, which occurs in two distinctive forms. The most frequent is a mild asymptomatic liver injury, with a moderate increase of serum aminotransferase activities and a mild inflammatory portal and lobular infiltrate on liver biopsy (celiac hepatitis), reversible on a gluten-free diet (GFD). More rarely, severe and progressive inflammatory liver damage, induced by an autoimmune process and identified as autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), can develop and it is generally unaffected by gluten withdrawal. Surveys that included only pediatric patients report a wide range of prevalence of CD in AIH of 11.5-46% (mean 21.5%). CD and AIH share selected combinations of genes coding for class II human leukocyte antigens, which could explain their coexistence. Increased intestinal permeability and circulation of anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) have also been considered as further potential causes of liver damage in CD patients. tTG in the liver and in other extraintestinal tissues could modify other external- or self-antigens and generate different neo-antigens, which are responsible for liver injury in patients with CD. Patients with AIH represent a population at high risk for developing CD; screening for CD should be integrated into the diagnostic routine of all patients with AIH, with or without gastrointestinal manifestations, before starting immunosuppressive treatments. The only currently available treatment for CD is the GFD and the supportive nutritional care for iron, calcium, and vitamin deficiencies. Due to the difficulties of a GFD, in the past decade researchers have become increasingly interested in therapeutic alternatives to continuous or intermittent use of a GFD in patients with CD. Interventions addressed to correct the defect in the intestinal barrier are currently at the most advanced stage of clinical trials. The impact of a GFD on the outcome of AIH is not clear but it seems to be ineffective in the treatment of AIH. The early detection and treatment of CD, however, may prevent progression to end-stage liver failure.
34495570	Pathogenic T Cells in Celiac Disease Change Phenotype on Gluten Challenge: Implications for T-Cell-Directed Therapies.	Gluten-specific CD4+ T cells being drivers of celiac disease (CeD) are obvious targets for immunotherapy. Little is known about how cell markers harnessed for T-cell-directed therapy can change with time and upon activation in CeD and other autoimmune conditions. In-depth characterization of gluten-specific CD4+ T cells and CeD-associated (CD38+ and CD103+ ) CD8+ and gammadelta+ T cells in blood of treated CeD patients undergoing a 3 day gluten challenge is reported. The phenotypic profile of gluten-specific cells changes profoundly with gluten exposure and the cells adopt the profile of gluten-specific cells in untreated disease (CD147+ , CD70+ , programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)+ , inducible T-cell costimulator (ICOS)+ , CD28+ , CD95+ , CD38+ , and CD161+ ), yet with some markers being unique for day 6 cells (C-X-C chemokine receptor type 6 (CXCR6), CD132, and CD147) and with integrin alpha4beta7, C-C motif chemokine receptor 9 (CCR9), and CXCR3 being expressed stably at baseline and day 6. Among gluten-specific CD4+ T cells, 52% are CXCR5+ at baseline, perhaps indicative of germinal-center reactions, while on day 6 all are CXCR5- . Strikingly, the phenotypic profile of gluten-specific CD4+ T cells on day 6 largely overlaps with that of CeD-associated (CD38+ and CD103+ ) CD8+ and gammadelta+ T cells. The antigen-induced shift in phenotype of CD4+ T cells being shared with other disease-associated T cells is relevant for development of T-cell-directed therapies.
30453686	Gluten-Free Diet in Celiac Disease-Forever and for All?	The gluten-free diet is the only effective treatment available for celiac disease. However, it is difficult to adhere to and a closer look on the diet's implementation and indications reveals several ambiguities: Not only is there controversy on the threshold of gluten that can be tolerated in the frame of a strict gluten-free diet, but it is also unclear whether the gluten-free diet is an appropriate treatment in patient subgroups with asymptomatic or potential celiac disease. Reports from a number of research groups suggest that a certain proportion of patients may effectively develop tolerance to gluten and thus become suitable for gluten reintroduction over time. In this review, we set out to create an overview about the current state of research as regards the definition of a strict gluten-free diet in terms of the gluten thresholds considered tolerable and the indication for a gluten-free diet in the absence of histological abnormalities or symptoms. Furthermore, we discuss the concept that a gluten-free diet must be followed for life by all patients.
33233787	The Diverse Potential of Gluten from Different Durum Wheat Varieties in Triggering Celiac Disease: A Multilevel In Vitro, Ex Vivo and In Vivo Approach.	The reasons behind the increasing prevalence of celiac disease (CD) worldwide are still not fully understood. This study adopted a multilevel approach (in vitro, ex vivo, in vivo) to assess the potential of gluten from different wheat varieties in triggering CD. Peptides triggering CD were identified and quantified in mixtures generated from simulated gastrointestinal digestion of wheat varieties (n = 82). Multivariate statistics enabled the discrimination of varieties generating low impact on CD (e.g., Saragolla) and high impact (e.g., Cappelli). Enrolled subjects (n = 46) were: 19 healthy subjects included in the control group; 27 celiac patients enrolled for the in vivo phase. Celiacs were divided into a gluten-free diet group (CD-GFD), and a GFD with Saragolla-based pasta group (CD-Sar). The diet was followed for 3 months. Data were compared between CD-Sar and CD-GFD before and after the experimental diet, demonstrating a limited ability of Saragolla to trigger immunity, although not comparable to a GFD. Ex vivo studies showed that Saragolla and Cappelli activated immune responses, although with great variability among patients. The diverse potential of durum wheat varieties in triggering CD immune response was demonstrated. Saragolla is not indicated for celiacs, yet it has a limited potential to trigger adverse immune response.
25110430	Capsule endoscopy: Present status and future expectation.	Video capsule endoscopy (CE) since its introduction 13 years back, has revolutionized our approach to small intestinal diseases. Obscure gastrointestinal bleed (OGIB) continues to be the most important indication for CE with a high sensitivity, specificity as well as positive and negative predictive values. It is best performed during ongoing bleed or immediately thereafter. Overt OGIB has a higher diagnostic yield than occult OGIB. However, even in iron deficiency anemia, CE is emerging as important investigation after initial negative work up. In suspected Crohn's disease (CD), CE has been shown superior to traditional imaging and endoscopic technique and should be considered after a negative ileocolonoscopy. Although CE has also been used for evaluating established CD, a high capsule retention rate precludes its use ahead of cross-sectional imaging. Celiac disease, particularly where gastro-duodenoscopy cannot be performed or is normal, can also be investigated by CE. Small bowel tumor, hereditary polyposis syndrome, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs induced intestinal damage are other indications for CE. Capsule retention is the only significant adverse outcome of CE and occurs mostly in presence of intestinal obstruction. This can be prevented by use of Patency capsule prior to CE examination. Presence of cardiac pacemaker and intracardiac devices continue to be relative contraindications for CE, though data do not suggest interference of CE with these devices. Major limitations of CE today include failure to control its movement from outside, inability of CE to acquire tissue for diagnosis, and lack of therapeutic help. With ongoing interesting and exciting developments taking place in these areas, these issues would be solved in all probability in near future. CE has the potential to become one of the most important tools in diagnostic and possibly in the therapeutic field of gastrointestinal disorder. 
36096056	Micronutrient deficiencies are frequent in adult patients with and without celiac disease on a gluten-free diet, regardless of duration and adherence to the diet.	OBJECTIVES: The only treatment for celiac disease (CD) is a strict gluten-free diet (GFD). Nutritional deficiencies are common in CD; however, how this is influenced by the presence of symptoms, duration of CD, and compliance of GFD is less clear. The objective of this study was to compare nutritional deficiencies in patients with CD to those of nonceliac populations on a GFD. The secondary outcomes were to compare deficiencies in short- (<2 y) versus long-term (>=2 y) GFD, and in those with persistent symptoms versus asymptomatic. METHODS: We included patients seen at the McMaster Celiac Clinic from June 2018 to August 2020. GFD adherence was assessed with the Celiac Dietary Adherence Test, and CD serology, vitamins, and trace minerals were measured in blood samples. We enrolled 221 patients, including 182 patients with CD and 39 controls. RESULTS: Overall, 103 of 182 patients with CD (56.6%) were following a GFD for >2 y and 119 patients (69.2%) were symptomatic. The most common micronutrient deficiencies were zinc (48.3%), ferritin (16.9%), and vitamin D (33.3%). There were no differences in micronutrient deficiencies between patients with CD and nonceliac controls, short- and long-term GFDs, or those strictly compliant with GFD and those who were fairly compliant (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that nutrient deficiencies may be related more to GFD nutritional inadequacy rather than malabsorption.
29287928	Making All Medications Gluten Free.	Gluten is found in food containing wheat, rye, and barley, and it may be introduced into medicines through the use of starch or any modified form of starch derived from these grains. The ingestion of gluten poses serious health hazards to people with celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity, and they must avoid the oral ingestion of gluten. In 2011, the Food and Drug Administration solicited information and public comments on 'gluten in drug products.' However, the 'final rule' that the Agency issued in 2013 involved only the voluntary 'gluten-free' labeling of food, and it did not include drug products. In this commentary, we are proposing that all drug products can and should be made gluten free. This is especially important since there is currently a global trade in medicines, and patients and health care providers do not know whether a product is gluten free or not unless they are labeled as such. All drug products can be made gluten free as there are many alternatives to gluten-containing starch that can be used as excipients during their formulation. Global collaborative efforts of regulatory agencies, pharmaceutical companies, and excipient manufacturers will be needed to implement a gluten-free medication policy and new regulatory guidelines.

26096570	Diagnosis of Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity (NCGS): The Salerno Experts' Criteria.	Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity (NCGS) is a syndrome characterized by intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms related to the ingestion of gluten-containing food, in subjects that are not affected by either celiac disease or wheat allergy. Given the lack of a NCGS biomarker, there is the need for standardizing the procedure leading to the diagnosis confirmation. In this paper we report experts' recommendations on how the diagnostic protocol should be performed for the confirmation of NCGS. A full diagnostic procedure should assess the clinical response to the gluten-free diet (GFD) and measure the effect of a gluten challenge after a period of treatment with the GFD. The clinical evaluation is performed using a self-administered instrument incorporating a modified version of the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale. The patient identifies one to three main symptoms that are quantitatively assessed using a Numerical Rating Scale with a score ranging from 1 to 10. The double-blind placebo-controlled gluten challenge (8 g/day) includes a one-week challenge followed by a one-week washout of strict GFD and by the crossover to the second one-week challenge. The vehicle should contain cooked, homogeneously distributed gluten. At least a variation of 30% of one to three main symptoms between the gluten and the placebo challenge should be detected to discriminate a positive from a negative result. The guidelines provided in this paper will help the clinician to reach a firm and positive diagnosis of NCGS and facilitate the comparisons of different studies, if adopted internationally. 
37556743	EATING HABITS AND NUTRITIONAL STATUS OF PATIENTS WITH CELIAC DISEASE IN SOUTH BRAZIL.	 Most patients with celiac disease from South Brazil do not consume gluten.  Patients with celiac disease are more careful about gluten cross-contamination in their homes than in restaurants.  Patients with celiac disease from South Brazil have adopted good eating habits with a balanced gluten-free diet.  Nutritional status improved after diagnosis of celiac disease according to body mass index. Background - Celiac disease is defined as a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the small intestine in genetically predisposed people, triggered by exposure to gluten. The only treatment for celiac disease to date is a lifelong gluten-free diet. Eating habits of celiacs play an important role in their nutritional status.Objective - To evaluate the eating habits and nutritional status of patients with celiac disease in Rio Grande do Sul.Methods - This is a cross-sectional study with patients diagnosed with celiac disease residing in Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil) over 18 years of age. An online questionnaire was applied with calls through social networks and also by the Associacao dos Celiacos do Brasil - Rio Grande do Sul Section. Sociodemographic data, history of celiac disease, general medical history, reported weight and height and food consumption data (SISVAN food frequency questionnaire and general questions) were collected. Results - The sample consisted of 142 individuals with a mean age of 39.75+-11.5 years, 94.4% were women and 93% were white. The patients showed care regarding a gluten-free diet, with the majority not ingesting gluten (82.2%) and being careful regarding cross-contamination by gluten in their homes (85.9%) and in restaurants (62, 4%). Most patients also had good eating habits, with frequent consumption of fruits, vegetables, meats, eggs and low frequency of processed foods and fats. Body weight before and after the diagnosis of celiac disease did not show significant changes (62.3+-13.8 versus 63.6+-11.7 kg; P=0.147); however, there was an improvement in the classification of nutritional status by body mass index (malnourished: 11.6% before versus 2.3% after; P=0.016). Conclusion - Most celiac disease patients in this study have good eating habits with a balanced gluten-free diet and improved nutritional status after diagnosis according to body mass index classification.
24266248	[Celiac disease--the chameleon among the food intolerances].	Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder resulting from gluten intolerance and is based on a genetically predisposition. Symptoms occur upon exposure to prolamin from wheat, rye, barley and related grain. The pathogenesis of celiac disease has not yet been sufficiently elucidated but is being considered as an autoimmune process. At its core are the deamidation of prolamin fragments, the building of specific antibodies and the activation of cytotoxic T-cells. The immunological inflammatory process is accompanied by structural damages of the enterocytes (villous atrophy, colonization and crypt hyperplasia). The symptoms and their extent depend on the type of the celiac disease; classic and non-classic forms are being distinguished (atypical, oligosymptomatic, latent and silent celiac disease). Characteristics of the classic presentation are malabsorption syndrome and intestinal symptoms such as mushy diarrhea and abdominal distension. The diagnosis of celiac disease is based on four pillars: Anamnesis and clinical presentation, serological evidence of coeliac specific antibodies (IgA-t-TG; IgA-EmA), small intestine biopsy and improvement of symptoms after institution of a gluten-free diet. The basis of the therapy is a lifelong gluten-free diet, i. e. wheat, rye, barley, spelt, green-core, faro-wheat, kamuth and conventional oats as well as food items obtained therefrom. Small amounts of up to 50 mg gluten per day are usually tolerated by most patients; amounts of > or = 100 mg/day lead mostly to symptoms. Gluten-free foods contain < or = 20 ppm or 20 mg/kg (Sign: symbol of the 'crossed ear' or label 'gluten-free'). At the beginning of the therapy the fat and lactose intake may need to be reduced; also the supplementation of single micronutrients (fat-soluble vitamins, folic acid, B12, iron, and calcium) may be required. Alternative therapies are being developed but have not yet been clinically tested.
35815825	Review article: Becoming and being coeliac-special considerations for childhood, adolescence and beyond.	Classically considered a disease of early childhood characterised by malabsorption and failure to thrive, coeliac disease is now recognised to arise in genetically susceptible individuals at any age. Although permissive HLA genotypes are the strongest predictor of coeliac disease, they are not sufficient. Several prospective cohort studies enrolling genetically at-risk infants have investigated the role of potential triggers of coeliac disease autoimmunity, such as timing of gluten introduction, viral infections and dietary patterns. Much less is known about triggers of coeliac disease in adulthood. Better understanding of factors leading to coeliac disease may be helpful in the management of those with potential coeliac disease (elevated serum celiac antibodies without villous atrophy in the small intestine), many of whom initiate a gluten-free diet without demonstration of villous atrophy. There are a range of clinical presentations of celiac disease in childhood and patterns of coeliac serology, including fluctuation and spontaneous reversion on a gluten-containing diet, vary. There is a current debate over best strategies to manage adults and children with potential coeliac disease to avoid over-treatment and under-treatment. Childhood and adolescence carry unique issues pertaining to the diagnosis and management of coeliac disease, and include nutrition and growth, rescreening, repeat biopsy, dietary adherence concerns and transition to adult care. In conclusion, while coeliac disease has similar pathogenesis and general clinical manifestations in paediatric and adult populations, diagnostic and management approaches need to adapt to the developmental stages.

26184290	Gluten Psychosis: Confirmation of a New Clinical Entity.	Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a syndrome diagnosed in patients with symptoms that respond to removal of gluten from the diet, after celiac disease and wheat allergy have been excluded. NCGS has been related to neuro-psychiatric disorders, such as autism, schizophrenia and depression. A singular report of NCGS presenting with hallucinations has been described in an adult patient. We report a pediatric case of a psychotic disorder clearly related to NCGS and investigate the causes by a review of literature. The pathogenesis of neuro-psychiatric manifestations of NCGS is unclear. It has been hypothesized that: (a) a "leaky gut" allows some gluten peptides to cross the intestinal membrane and the blood brain barrier, affecting the endogenous opiate system and neurotransmission; or (b) gluten peptides may set up an innate immune response in the brain similar to that described in the gut mucosa, causing exposure from neuronal cells of a transglutaminase primarily expressed in the brain. The present case-report confirms that psychosis may be a manifestation of NCGS, and may also involve children; the diagnosis is difficult with many cases remaining undiagnosed. Well-designed prospective studies are needed to establish the real role of gluten as a triggering factor in neuro-psychiatric disorders. 
31277328	Micronutrients Dietary Supplementation Advices for Celiac Patients on Long-Term Gluten-Free Diet with Good Compliance: A Review.	Background and objective: Often micronutrient deficiencies cannot be detected when patient is already following a long-term gluten-free diet with good compliance (LTGFDWGC). The aim of this narrative review is to evaluate the most recent literature that considers blood micronutrient deficiencies in LTGFDWGC subjects, in order to prepare dietary supplementation advice (DSA). Materials and methods: A research strategy was planned on PubMed by defining the following keywords: celiac disease, vitamin B12, iron, folic acid, and vitamin D. Results: This review included 73 studies. The few studies on micronutrient circulating levels in long-term gluten-free diet (LTGFD) patients over 2 years with good compliance demonstrated that deficiency was detected in up to: 30% of subjects for vitamin B12 (DSA: 1000 mcg/day until level is normal, then 500 mcg), 40% for iron (325 mg/day), 20% for folic acid (1 mg/day for 3 months, followed by 400-800 mcg/day), 25% for vitamin D (1000 UI/day or more-based serum level or 50,000 UI/week if level is <20 ng/mL), 40% for zinc (25-40 mg/day), 3.6% of children for calcium (1000-1500 mg/day), 20% for magnesium (200-300 mg/day); no data is available in adults for magnesium. Conclusions: If integration with diet is not enough, starting with supplements may be the correct way, after evaluating the initial blood level to determine the right dosage of supplementation.

23478246	Liver steatosis in celiac disease: the open door.	Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common disease of unknown origin characterized by histological features similar to alcoholic-like liver injury but in the absence of significant alcohol intake. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease refers to a spectrum of diseases of the liver ranging from simple steatosis (i.e., fatty infiltration of the liver) to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (i.e., steatosis with inflammation and hepatocyte necrosis) to cirrhosis. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is frequently associated with disorders such as insulin resistance, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia and protein-calorie malnutrition. However, in a subgroup of NAFLD patients, the true relevant cause remains undetermined. Celiac disease (CD) is a common immune-mediated disorder and develops in genetically susceptible subjects after the ingestion of gluten proteins. Celiac disease has been found in about 10% of patients with unexplained abnormal liver tests, and in about 3.5% of patients with NAFLD as the only manifestation of the disease. The frequency of subclinical or silent presentations in older children and adults highlights the importance of CD screening in patients with unexplained chronic abnormal liver function tests and NAFLD without any specific etiology. The pathogenesis of liver steatosis in CD is uncertain. The aims of this review are to describe the possible mechanisms involved in the occurrence and progression of liver steatosis in CD patients.
28315909	A concise review of Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) and the importance of iodine, selenium, vitamin D and gluten on the autoimmunity and dietary management of HT patients.Points that need more investigation.	Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is a chronic autoimmune thyroid disease caused by an interaction between genetic factors and environmental conditions, both of which are yet to be fully understood. The management of HT depends on its clinical manifestations, commonly including diffuse or nodular goiter with euthyroidism, subclinical hypothyroidism and permanent hypothyroidism. However, in most cases of patients with HT, lifelong levothyroxine substitution is required. The additional role of diet for the management of HT is usually overlooked. A literature search regarding the importance and the influence of iodine, selenium, vitamin D and gluten on HT was conducted. In HT careful supplementation of possible deficiencies is recommended for the dietary management of these patients. The use of a diet low in gluten among HT patients with or without celiac disease (CD) is discussed.
25563009	[Endogenous intoxication and biochemical protection in children with celiac disease: state assesment and correlation-regression analysis].	AIM: The purpose of the study was to determine the characteristics of endogenous intoxication parameters, biochemical protection and reveal their interaction in children with celiac disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 81 children aged from 1 to 16 years with celiac disease were examined in acute and remission periods. In erythrocytes, blood serum and urine we determined low and moderate molecular weight substances (LMMWS), oligopeptides OP); in erythrocytes--the value of erythrocyte mechanical hemolysis (MH), malondialdehyde (MDA) content, the activity of glutathione reductase GR) and superoxide dismutase (SOD); in blood serum--ceruloplasmin (CP) level, alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity; in erythrocytes and blood serum--glutathione transferase (GT), and calculated intoxication index (II). RESULTS: In children with celiac disease in acute and remission periods LMMWS, OP, II levels in blood were statistically significantly high, while LMMWS level in urine was low. In both periods MH activity was high (p < 0.001), and GSR (p < 0.001) and SOD (p < 0.01) levels were low. We revealed the correlation between MDA and II (r = 0.67; p = 0.006), erythrocyte LMMWS and SOD (r = -0.61; p = 0.015), erythrocyte LMMWS and ADH (r = 0.62; p = 0.006), between GT and OP in urine (r = -0.31; p = 0.026), GTand MDA (r = 0.68; p = 0.000), GT and MH (r = -0.46; p = 0.004), between MDA and CP (r = 0.57; p = 0.002) that made it possible to develop the models of dependence of the parameters in relation to each other. CONCLUSION: In celiac disease there is endogenous intoxication. The changes of the first and the second phases of biotransformation, antioxidant protection is an essential factor of the disease pathogenesis, since they have an effect on endogenous intoxication formation that should be taken into consideration in therapy.
34613954	Determination of Urinary Gluten Immunogenic Peptides to Assess Adherence to the Gluten-Free Diet: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Controlled Study.	INTRODUCTION: The adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) is a trending topic in the management of celiac disease. The aim of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of urinary gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) determination to detect gluten contamination of the GFD. METHODS: In study A, 25 healthy adults on a standard GFD performed 6 gluten challenges (0, 10, 50, 100, 500, and 1,000 mg) with quantification of urinary GIP before (T0) and during the following 24 hours. In study B, 12 participants on a gluten contamination elimination diet underwent urinary GIP determination at T0 and after challenge with 5 or 10 mg gluten. Urine GIP concentration was determined by an immunochromatographic assay. RESULTS: In study A, 51 of 150 baseline urine samples were GIP+ on GFD and 7 of 17 were GIP+ after the zero-gluten challenge, whereas only 55 of 81 were GIP+ after the 10-1,000 mg gluten challenges. There was no significant change in the 24-hour urinary GIP when increasing gluten from 10 to 1,000 mg. In study B, 24 of 24 baseline urine samples were GIP-, whereas 8 of 24 were GIP+ after 5 or 10 mg of gluten. DISCUSSION: Traces of gluten in the standard GFD may cause positivity of urinary GIP determination, whereas a false negativity is common after a gluten intake of 10-1,000 mg. Owing to the impossibility of standardizing the test in normal conditions, it seems unlikely that urinary GIP determination may represent a reliable tool to assess the compliance to the GFD of patients with celiac disease or other gluten-related disorders.
30945820	[Psychiatric symptoms in a child with gluten sensitivity].	BACKGROUND: Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a diagnosis that is increasingly being reported. Psychiatric symptoms can be a rare but serious manifestation of this new clinical entity. CASE REPORT: A 13-year-old girl consulted the paediatrician with abdominal pain, diarrhoea, bloating, and compulsive thoughts and fears; these disappeared on a gluten-free diet. Celiac disease and wheat allergy were excluded. Double-blind placebo-controlled gluten challenge confirmed the diagnosis NCGS. CONCLUSION: Consider a diagnosis of NCGS in patients with psychiatric symptoms in combination with abdominal symptoms.
34975913	Celiac Disease After Administration of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors: A Case Report.	Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) reinvigorate the immune system to recognize and destroy tumor cells. Because of this biological mechanism, patients might develop autoimmune toxicities, notably in the digestive tract (most frequently, hepatitis or colitis). A 70-year-old man with relapsed mesothelioma was treated with nivolumab in 3rd line. He was hospitalized for watery and foul-smelling diarrhea. He underwent gastrointestinal endoscopy, showing duodenitis and villous atrophy and measurement of serum IgA antibodies to tissue transglutaminase (tTG-IgA+), leading to the diagnosis of ICI-induced celiac disease. He was treated with steroids, proton pump inhibitors, and a gluten-free diet. If ICI-induced celiac disease is rare in the literature, increasing reports suggest that celiac disease might represent an underestimated ICI toxicity. This case highlights the necessity of complementary investigation (including tTG-IgA and endoscopic biopsies) in patients with atypical digestive symptoms during immunotherapy.
28266187	The subclinical effect of celiac disease on the heart and the effect of gluten-free diet on cardiac functions.	This study aimed to investigate the effects of celiac disease (CD) on cardiac function in children by using conventional transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and tissue Doppler echocardiography (TDE). Forty-nine patients diagnosed with CD were enrolled into the study. Group 1 consisted of 26 (53%) patients who had recently been diagnosed and had not been on gluten-free diet whereas Group 2 consisted of 23 (47%) patients who had been on regular gluten-free diet for at least 10 months. 20 healthy children were enrolled into the study as the control group. The deceleration time (DT) and the left ventricle (LV) isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT) were significantly shorter in Group 1 compared to Group 2 and the control group (p=0.002, p=0.015). Mitral valve E/E' ratio was significantly lower in Group 1 and 2 when compared to the control group (p < 0.001). The study demonstrated that evaluation of these parameters by using TDE could be beneficial in the early diagnosis of cardiac involvement in children with CD.
24394601	Sampling of proximal and distal duodenal biopsies in the diagnosis and monitoring of celiac disease.	BACKGROUND: Since celiac disease-associated mucosal lesions are patchy, the diagnosis of the disease requires histological evaluation of multiple duodenal biopsies. AIM: To examine whether adequate biopsy sampling in either the bulb or distal duodenum is sufficient to diagnose celiac disease. METHODS: Twenty-five patients with positive celiac disease-specific serology and 17 patients with negative serology, who were on a gluten-containing diet, and 13 celiac disease patients on a gluten-free diet were consecutively and prospectively enrolled. Mucosal damage, anti-transglutaminase-2 IgA deposits, interferon-gamma, interleukin-17A and interleukin-15 transcripts were evaluated in bulb and distal duodenal biopsies. RESULTS: All patients with positive celiac disease-specific serology exhibited villous atrophy in both duodenal sites. In this group, mucosal anti-transglutaminase-2 IgA deposits were found in 24/25 (96%) bulb samples and 22/25 (88%) distal duodenal samples. No villous atrophy was documented in patients with negative serology. Interferon-gamma and interleukin-17A were over-expressed in both duodenal sites of patients with villous atrophy, unlike patients with normal duodenal morphology (p<0.001). Among treated celiac disease patients, 2 (15.4%) had villous atrophy exclusively in the bulb and 6 (46.2%) had minimal histological abnormalities at both sites. CONCLUSION: Sampling in the bulb and distal duodenum could be sufficient to diagnose/exclude celiac disease.
27834802	Prevalence and Characterization of Self-Reported Gluten Sensitivity in The Netherlands.	BACKGROUND: A growing number of individuals reports symptoms related to the ingestion of gluten-containing food in the absence of celiac disease. Yet the actual prevalence is not well established. METHODS: Between April 2015 and March 2016, unselected adults visiting marketplaces, dental practices and a university in The Netherlands were asked to complete a modified validated questionnaire for self-reported gluten sensitivity (srGS). RESULTS: Among the 785 adults enquired, two had celiac disease. Forty-nine (6.2%) reported symptoms related to the ingestion of gluten-containing food. These individuals were younger, predominantly female and lived more frequently in urban regions compared with the other respondents. Symptoms reported included bloating (74%), abdominal discomfort (49%) and flatulence (47%). A total of 23 (47%) srGS individuals reported having had tried a gluten-free or gluten-restricted diet. Abdominal discomfort related to fermentable oligosaccharide, disaccharide, monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP)-containing food was more often reported in srGS individuals compared with the other respondents (73.5% vs. 21.7%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Self-reported GS is common in The Netherlands, especially in younger individuals, females and urban regions, although the prevalence was lower than in a comparable recent UK study. It cannot be excluded that FODMAPs are in part responsible for these symptoms.
33804451	Iodine Absorption in Celiac Children: A Longitudinal Pilot Study.	Background: non-autoimmune thyroid disorder is a common finding in celiac patients, more frequent than in the general population. An impairment of iodine absorption has been hypothesized, but it has never been investigated so far. We aimed to evaluate the iodine absorption in children and adolescents with newly diagnosed celiac disease. Methods: 36 consecutive celiac patients (age 7.4 years, range 2.4-14.5 years) before starting a gluten-free diet (GFD) were enrolled. We assayed the urinary iodine concentration (UIC) in a 24-h urine sample, at baseline (T0) after 3 (T1) and 12 months (T2) of GFD. Results: UIC at T0 was 64 mug/L (IQR 45-93.25 mug/L) with an iodine deficiency rate of 77.8%. UIC was not different according to histological damage, clinical presentation (typical vs atypical); we found no correlation with the thyroid function tests and auxological parameters. UIC was not statistically different at T1 (76 mug/L) and T2 (89 mug/L) vs T0. UIC at T2 was similar between patients with positive and negative anti-transglutaminase antibodies at T2. No patients presented overt hypothyroidism during the study. Conclusions: We found that iodine absorption in celiac children is impaired compared to the general population; it increases slightly, but not significantly, during the GFD. We should regularly reinforce the need for a proper iodine intake in celiac disease patients to reduce iodine deficiency risk.
31450806	Gluten-Free Products: From Dietary Necessity to Premium Price Extraction Tool.	Every year, the Italian National Health Service (NHS) provides about 200,000 celiac people (based on 2017 data) living in Italy with financial support of about 250 million euro to cover the cost of their specific dietary constrains. The existence of gluten-free products of high quality and affordable price is very important for the quality of life of celiac people and the sustainability of public support. Over the last decade, the market for gluten-free products has experienced a dramatic surge, with an increasing shelf space dedicated to these products in supermarkets, and a large variety of products both in terms of kind of agricultural inputs and processing and packaging methods. This study aimed at assessing the offer of gluten-free (GF) pasta in Italian supermarkets, with respect to its ability to meet the needs of celiac people in terms of variety, prices and safety. A hedonic price analysis was performed. Results indicated that GF pasta is sold only in 44% of the 212 stores of the sample, with a price equal to more than twice that of conventional pasta. A premium price was found for the following attributes: small packages, brands specialized in GF products, content in fiber and the presence of quinoa as ingredient.
39086640	Digesting gluten with oral endopeptidases to improve the management of celiac disease.	In our editorial, we want to comment on the article by Stefanolo et al titled "Effect of Aspergillus niger prolyl endopeptidase in patients with celiac disease on a long-term gluten-free diet". Celiac disease is an immune-mediated disorder triggered by dietary gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. Although avoiding gluten can permit patients to live symptom-free, ongoing voluntary or involuntary exposure to gluten is common and associated with persistent villous atrophy in small bowel mucosa. As villous atrophy predisposes patients to life threatening complications, such as osteoporotic fractures or malignancies, therapeutic adjuncts to gluten-free diet become important to improve patients' quality of life and, if these adjuncts can be shown to improve villous atrophy, avoid complications. Oral administration of enzyme preparations, such as endopeptidases that digest gluten and mitigate its antigenicity to trigger inflammation, is one clinical strategy under investigation. The article is about the utility of one endopeptidase isolated from Aspergillus niger. We critique findings of this clinical trial and also summarize endopeptidase-based as well as other strategies and how they can complement gluten-free diet in the management of celiac disease.
37943101	Monitoring patients with celiac disease on gluten free diet: different outcomes comparing three tissue transglutaminase IgA assays.	OBJECTIVES: Tissue transglutaminase (tTG) IgA antibodies are a hallmark for celiac disease (CD). In CD patients on gluten free diet (GFD) these antibodies are transient. Few studies are available comparing the tTG-IgA assay characteristics for monitoring response to GFD. Since discrepant results were reported in patients on GFD after switching tTG-IgA assays, we conducted a retrospective observational study to monitor GFD response using three different tTG-IgA assays. METHODS: Diagnostic samples from 44 adults and 17 children with CD were included. Of most patients two follow-up samples after introduction of GFD were available. In all samples tTG-IgA were assessed using one fluorochrome-enzyme immuno-assay (FEIA) and two chemiluminescence immuno-assays (CLIA) and intestinal fatty acid binding protein (i-FABP) as surrogate marker for intestinal epithelial damage was measured. RESULTS: Using CLIA assays, normalization of antibody levels was delayed compared to FEIA (p<0.001). Of all samples taken after at least 6 months on GFD with elevated i-FABP indicating intestinal epithelial damage, 40 % had positive tTG-IgA according to the FEIA, 85 and 90 % according to the two CLIA. CONCLUSIONS: Normalization of tTG-IgA in patients on GFD depends on the assay used. Both CLIA appear to be more sensitive in detecting suboptimal treatment response in CD-indicated by elevated i-FABP - when applying the manufacturer's recommended cut-off for the diagnosis of CD.
28658068	Depression and insomnia among individuals with celiac disease or on a gluten-free diet in the USA: results from a national survey.	BACKGROUND: There is uncertainty regarding the prevalence of psychiatric illnesses in patients with celiac disease (CD) and people who avoid gluten (PWAG) without a diagnosis of CD. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: We obtained data from 22 274 participants from the 2009-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to compare the prevalence of depression, insomnia, quality-of-life variables, and psychotropic medication use in CD participants and PWAGs to controls. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess for independent associations between CD/PWAG status and the outcomes of these variables. RESULTS: Depression was present in 8.2% of controls compared with 3.9% of participants with CD (P=0.18) and 2.9% of PWAGs (P=0.002). After adjustment for age, sex, race, income, and access to healthcare, PWAGs maintained lower odds of depression compared with controls (odds ratio=0.25; 95% confidence interval: 0.12-0.51; P=0.0001). The prevalence estimates of sleep difficulty among controls (27.3%) compared to participants with CD or PWAGs were 37.7% (P=0.15) and 34.1% (P=0.11). Those with diagnosed CD had increased odds of sleep difficulty (odds ratio=2.41; 95% confidence interval 1.04-5.60), but this was no longer significant after multivariable adjustment (P=0.17). CONCLUSION: Among a nationally representative US sample, participants with CD overall showed no increased odds of depression or sleep difficulty. PWAGs showed lower odds of depression compared with controls. Future research should investigate the relationship between a diagnosis of CD and the development of psychiatric conditions.
28870408	Thyroid storm and warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia.	Graves' disease is often associated with other autoimmune disorders, including rare associations with autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). We describe a unique presentation of thyroid storm and warm AIHA diagnosed concurrently in a young female with hyperthyroidism. The patient presented with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and altered mental status. Laboratory studies revealed hemoglobin 3.9g/dL, platelets 171x109L-1, haptoglobin <5mg/dL, reticulocytosis, and positive direct antiglobulin test (IgG, C3d, warm). Additional workup revealed serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) <0.01muIU/mL and serum free-T4 (FT4) level 7.8ng/dL. Our patient was diagnosed with concurrent thyroid storm and warm AIHA. She was started on glucocorticoids to treat both warm AIHA and thyroid storm, as well as antithyroid medications, propranolol and folic acid. Due to profound anemia and hemodynamic instability, the patient was transfused two units of uncrossmatched packed red blood cells slowly and tolerated this well. She was discharged on methimazole as well as a prolonged prednisone taper, and achieved complete resolution of the thyrotoxicosis and anemia at one month. Hyperthyroidism can affect all three blood cell lineages of the hematopoietic system. Anemia can be seen in 10-20% of patients with thyrotoxicosis. Several autoimmune processes can lead to anemia in Graves' disease, including pernicious anemia, celiac disease, and warm AIHA. This case illustrates a rarely described presentation of a patient with Graves' disease presenting with concurrent thyroid storm and warm AIHA.
33708175	L-T4 Therapy in Enteric Malabsorptive Disorders.	Levothyroxine (L-T4) absorption can be impaired by various causes: a) L-T4 ingestion during breakfast, or with food; b) conditions of reduced gastric acidity; c) intestinal procedures and diseases such as bariatric surgery, lactose intolerance (LI), celiac disease (CD), inflammatory bowel disease; d) drugs that alter L-T4 absorption, increasing the gastric pH, or preventing the dissolution of tablets. The development of new oral formulations, i.e. the liquid preparation and the soft gel capsule, represents the most recent advance regarding L-T4 therapy. Treating hypothyroidism with L-T4 tablets can lead to an improper control of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in ~10%-15% of patients. The improperly elevated TSH is usually managed by increasing the L-T4 daily dose, and revaluating TSH upon 2-6 months. The increase of the L-T4 dosage may cause iatrogenic hyperthyroidism, especially when the underlying disorders are cured. Liquid L-T4 can be administered in patients unable to swallow capsules or tablets, and this is one of its major benefits. Liquid L-T4 can: 1- overcome food and beverages interference; 2- bypass the malabsorption associated with an increased gastric pH; 3- circumvent the issue of malabsorption in patients who underwent bariatric surgery; 4-maintain TSH values under control better than L-T4 tablets in hypothyroid patients with typical or atypical CD, or in patients with LI. Few clinical studies evaluated soft gel L-T4 with encouraging findings in patients with gastric- or coffee-related malabsorption, or hypothyroid patients without malabsorption. Additional research is necessary to investigate liquid L-T4, or soft gel capsule, in other conditions of altered L-T4 absorption.
28177956	Optimizing the diagnosis of celiac disease.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The diagnostic approach in celiac disease is continuously evolving as our understanding of its pathophysiology improves. This review aims to provide a summary of contemporary work that supports optimization of the diagnosis of this common yet underdiagnosed condition. RECENT FINDINGS: The recently updated National Institute of Clinical Excellence and European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition guidelines and the contentious biopsy-free diagnostic approach will be discussed. We will review the evidence advocating optimal biopsy techniques such as single bite biopsy and controversial bulb biopsy sampling to increase diagnostic yield. Recent data providing phenotypical characterization and clinical outcomes of celiac subtypes such as potential celiac disease, seronegative celiac disease and ultrashort celiac disease will be covered. We will present emerging evidence on novel case finding strategies with point of care tests. Promising novel markers for celiac disease such as serum intestinal fatty acid binding protein and in-vitro gluten challenge will be included. SUMMARY: Recent work has demonstrated the clinical significance of the celiac disease subtypes, emphasizing the importance of careful diagnosis and recognition. There is a move toward a less invasive and perhaps more cost-effective diagnostic approach in celiac disease, but duodenal biopsy remains the gold standard at present for all adults and the majority of pediatric patients.
25292220	Severe rickets in a young girl caused by celiac disease: the tragedy of delayed diagnosis: a case report.	BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is a systemic immune mediated disease which usually presents with gastrointestinal symptoms, but it may present with extra gastrointestinal manifestations such as metabolic bone disease and failure to thrive. This may lead to a delay in the diagnosis. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a 13 year old female from the middle east with an 8 year history of severe rickets causing multiple bone deformities leaving the child crippled with bowing of both of her arms and legs. The patient was also found to have growth failure, anemia and on further workup she was found to have celiac disease. CONCLUSION: We are presenting this case because it shows a severe case of rickets after malabsorption for many years. Celiac disease should be kept in mind as a cause of rickets in patients not responding to usual forms of treatment or when associated with other manifestations of malabsorption.
31082858	Persistent Alterations in Plasma Lipid Profiles Before Introduction of Gluten in the Diet Associated With Progression to Celiac Disease.	OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic enteropathy characterized by an autoimmune reaction in the small intestine of genetically susceptible individuals. The underlying causes of autoimmune reaction and its effect on host metabolism remain largely unknown. Herein, we apply lipidomics to elucidate the early events preceding clinical CD in a cohort of Finnish children, followed up in the Type 1 Diabetes Prediction and Prevention study. METHODS: Mass spectrometry-based lipidomics profiling was applied to a longitudinal/prospective series of 233 plasma samples obtained from CD progressors (n = 23) and healthy controls (n = 23), matched for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) risk, sex, and age. The children were followed from birth until diagnosis of clinical CD and subsequent introduction of a gluten-free diet. RESULTS: Twenty-three children progressed to CD at a mean age of 4.8 years. They showed increased amounts of triacylglycerols (TGs) of low carbon number and double bond count and a decreased level of phosphatidylcholines by age 3 months as compared to controls. These differences were exacerbated with age but were not observed at birth (cord blood). No significant differences were observed in the essential TGs. DISCUSSION: Our preliminary findings suggest that abnormal lipid metabolism associates with the development of clinical CD and occurs already before the first introduction of gluten to the diet. Moreover, our data suggest that the specific TGs found elevated in CD progressors may be due to a host response to compromised intake of essential lipids in the small intestine, requiring de novo lipogenesis.
33276620	Alterations in One-Carbon Metabolism in Celiac Disease.	Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune enteropathy associated with alterations of metabolism. Metabolomics studies, although limited, showed changes in choline, choline-derived lipids, and methionine concentrations, which could be ascribed to alterations in one-carbon metabolism. To date, no targeted metabolomics analysis investigating differences in the plasma choline/methionine metabolome of CD subjects are reported. This work is a targeted metabolomic study that analyzes 37 metabolites of the one-carbon metabolism in 17 children with CD, treated with a gluten-free diet and 17 healthy control siblings, in order to establish the potential defects in this metabolic network. Our results demonstrate the persistence of defects in the transsulfuration pathway of CD subjects, despite dietary treatment, while choline metabolism, methionine cycle, and folate cycle seem to be reversed and preserved to healthy levels. These findings describe for the first time, a metabolic defect in one-carbon metabolism which could have profound implications in the physiopathology and treatment of CD.
35125825	Current guidelines for the management of celiac disease: A systematic review with comparative analysis.	BACKGROUND: Wheat and other gluten-containing grains are widely consumed, providing approximately 50% of the caloric intake in both industrialised and developing countries. The widespread diffusion of gluten-containing diets has rapidly led to a sharp increase in celiac disease prevalence. This condition was thought to be very rare outside Europe and relatively ignored by health professionals and the global media. However, in recent years, the discovery of important diagnostic and pathogenic milestones has led to the emergence of celiac disease (CD) from obscurity to global prominence. These modifications have prompted experts worldwide to identify effective strategies for the diagnosis and follow-up of CD. Different scientific societies, mainly from Europe and America, have proposed guidelines based on CD's most recent evidence. AIM: To identify the most recent scientific guidelines on CD, aiming to find and critically analyse the main differences. METHODS: We performed a database search on PubMed selecting papers published between January 2010 and January 2021 in the English language. PubMed was lastly accessed on 1 March 2021. RESULTS: We distinguished guidelines from 7 different scientific societies whose reputation is worldwide recognized and representative of the clinical practice in different geographical regions. Differences were noted in the possibility of a no-biopsy diagnosis, HLA testing, follow-up protocols, and procedures. CONCLUSION: We found a relatively high concordance between the guidelines for CD. Important modifications have occurred in the last years, especially about the possibility of a no-biopsy diagnosis in children. Other modifications are expected in the next future and will probably involve the extension of the non-invasive diagnosis to the adult population and the follow-up modalities.
38139373	The Role of NKG2D and Its Ligands in Autoimmune Diseases: New Targets for Immunotherapy.	Natural killer (NK) cells and CD8+ T cells can clear infected and transformed cells and generate tolerance to themselves, which also prevents autoimmune diseases. Natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) is an important activating immune receptor that is expressed on NK cells, CD8+ T cells, gammadelta T cells, and a very small percentage of CD4+ T cells. In contrast, the NKG2D ligand (NKG2D-L) is generally not expressed on normal cells but is overexpressed under stress. Thus, the inappropriate expression of NKG2D-L leads to the activation of self-reactive effector cells, which can trigger or exacerbate autoimmunity. In this review, we discuss the role of NKG2D and NKG2D-L in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), multiple sclerosis (MS), type I diabetes (T1DM), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and celiac disease (CeD). The data suggest that NKG2D and NKG2D-L play a pathogenic role in some autoimmune diseases. Therefore, the development of strategies to block the interaction of NKG2D and NKG2D-L may have therapeutic effects in some autoimmune diseases.
34950132	Circulating miRNAs as Potential Biomarkers for Celiac Disease Development.	Background & Aims: Celiac disease (CeD), an immune-mediated disease with enteropathy triggered by gluten, affects ~1% of the general European population. Currently, there are no biomarkers to predict CeD development. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short RNAs involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation, and certain disease- and stage-specific miRNA profiles have been found previously. We aimed to investigate whether circulating miRNAs can predict the development of CeD. Methods: Using next-generation miRNA-sequencing, we determined miRNAs in >200 serum samples from 53 participants of the PreventCD study, of whom 33 developed CeD during follow-up. Following study inclusion at 3 months of age, samples were drawn at predefined ages, diagnosis (first anti-transglutaminase antibody (TGA) positivity or diagnostic biopsy) and after the start of a gluten-free diet (GFD). This allowed identification of circulating miRNAs that are deregulated before TGA positivity. For validation of the biomarkers for CeD and GFD response, two additional cohorts were included in subsequent meta-analyses. Additionally, miRNAs were measured in duodenal biopsies in a case-control cohort. Results: 53 circulating miRNAs were increased (27) or decreased (26) in CeD versus controls. We assessed specific trends in these individual miRNAs in the PreventCD cohort by grouping the pre-diagnostic samples of the CeD patients (all had negative TGA) by how close to seroconversion (first sample positive TGA) the samples were taken. 8/53 miRNAs differed significantly between controls and samples taken <1 year before TGA positivity: miR-21-3p, miR-374a-5p, 144-3p, miR-500a-3p, miR-486-3p let-7d-3p, let-7e-5p and miR-3605-3p. 6/26 downregulated miRNAs reconstituted upon GFD, including miR-150-5p/-3p, whereas no upregulated miRNAs were downregulated upon GFD. 15/53 biomarker candidates also differed between CeD biopsies and controls, with a concordant direction, indicating that these circulating miRNAs might originate from the intestine. Conclusions: We identified 53 circulating miRNAs that are potential early biomarkers for CeD, of which several can be detected more than a year before TGA positivity and some start to normalize upon GFD.
