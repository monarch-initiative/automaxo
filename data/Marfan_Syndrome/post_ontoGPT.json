Most FBN1 mutations are missense or nonsense mutations. Traditional molecular genetic testing for the FBN1 gene, like Sanger sequencing, may miss disease-causing mutations in the gene's regulatory regions or non-coding sequences, as well as partial or complete gene deletions and duplications. METHODS: Next-generation sequencing, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and gap PCR were conducted on two MFS patients to screen for disease-causing mutations. RESULTS: We identified two large deletions in FBN1 from two MFS patients. One patient had a 0.23 Mb deletion (NC_000015.9:g.48550506_48779360del) including 5'UTR-exon6 of FBN1. The other patient harbored a 1416 bp deletion (NC_000015.9:g.48410869_48412284del) affecting the last exon, exon 66, of the FBN1 gene. CONCLUSION: Our results expanded the number of large FBN1 deletions and highlighted the importance of screening for large deletions in FBN1 in clinical genetic testing, especially for those with the classic MFS phenotype.",

Changes in the fibrous tunic of the eye].Marfan syndrome (MS) is an orphan hereditary connective tissue disease associated with a mutation in the FBN1 gene, which pathological manifestations are characterized by polysystemic involvement. The fibrillin-1 protein is an integral component of the sclera and cornea of the eye, and in MS its structure is distrubed. PURPOSE: This study assesses potential structural and functional changes in the cornea and sclera of a patient with MS. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two groups were formed, comparable in the axial length of the eye and age: the main group - 19 patients (38 eyes) with a verified diagnosis of MS, and the control group - 24 patients (48 eyes) with myopia of varying degrees. The results obtained from MS patients were analyzed depending on the absence or presence of ectopia lentis. In addition to measuring the basic ophthalmological parameters (refraction, axial length, visual acuity), topographic keratometry, anterior segment optical coherence tomography, and ocular response analyzer were used for structural and functional assessment of the cornea and sclera. RESULTS: In MS there was a statistically significant increase in the radius of curvature and a decrease in corneal refraction in the central zone compared to the control group. There were no significant differences in central corneal thickness, but there was a significant decrease in the thickness of the sclera in the limbal zone compared to the control group. There were no statistically significant changes in corneal hysteresis and corneal resistance factor in MS. CONCLUSION: This study confirmed the previously obtained data on the tendency of the optical power to reliably decrease in MS (flattening of the cornea). This symptom can be considered as a compensatory factor affecting clinical refraction, while the decrease in the thickness of the sclera - as the main reason for aaxial length elongation in MS. There were no clear patterns of dependence of the changes in the cornea and sclera analyzed in this study on the presence or absence of ectopia lentis. Changes in the lens, perhaps, should be regarded only as one of the potential components of the ocular symptom complex in MS.",

However, a significant number of individuals with MFS remain genetically unexplained. In this study, we report novel pathogenic intronic variants in FBN1 in two unrelated families with MFS. METHODS: We evaluated subjects with suspected MFS from two unrelated families using Sanger sequencing or multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification of FBN1 and/or panel-based next-generation sequencing. As no pathogenic variants were identified, whole-genome sequencing was performed. Identified variants were analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR and targeted sequencing of FBN1 mRNA harvested from peripheral blood or skin fibroblasts obtained from affected probands. RESULTS: We found causative deep intronic variants, c.6163+1484A>T and c.5788+36C>A, in FBN1. The splicing analysis revealed an insertion of in-frame or out-of-frame intronic sequences of the FBN1 transcript predicted to alter function of calcium-binding epidermal growth factor protein domain.

CONCLUSION: Variable penetrance of the phenotype and negative genetic testing in MFS families should raise the possibility of deep intronic FBN1 variants and the need for additional molecular studies. This study expands the mutation spectrum of FBN1 and points out the importance of intronic sequence analysis and the need for integrative functional studies in MFS diagnosis.",

                    "text": "Overcoming challenges associated with identifying FBN1 deep intronic variants through whole-genome sequencing.BACKGROUND: Marfan syndrome (MFS), caused by pathogenic variants of FBN1 (fibrillin-1), is a systemic connective tissue disorder with variable phenotypes and treatment responsiveness depending on the variant. However, a significant number of individuals with MFS remain genetically unexplained. In this study, we report novel pathogenic intronic variants in FBN1 in two unrelated families with MFS. METHODS: We evaluated subjects with suspected MFS from two unrelated families using Sanger sequencing or multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification of FBN1 and/or panel-based next-generation sequencing. As no pathogenic variants were identified, whole-genome sequencing was performed. Identified variants were analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR and targeted sequencing of FBN1 mRNA harvested from peripheral blood or skin fibroblasts obtained from affected probands. RESULTS: We found causative deep intronic variants, c.6163+1484A>T and c.5788+36C>A, in FBN1. The splicing analysis revealed an insertion of in-frame or out-of-frame intronic sequences of the FBN1 transcript predicted to alter function of calcium-binding epidermal growth factor protein domain. Family members carrying c.6163+1484A>T had high systemic scores including prominent skeletal features and aortic dissection with lesser aortic dilatation. Family members carrying c.5788+36C>A had more severe aortic root dilatation without aortic dissection. Both families had ectopia lentis.

We evaluated outcomes after open extent I TAAA repair in patients with and without HTAD. METHODS: This retrospective study included 992 patients (median age 67 y [57-73]) who underwent extent I TAAA (1990-2022), stratified by the presence of HTAD (n=177, 17.8%). Patients with HTAD had either genetic aortopathies or presented at age <=50 years; 35% (62/177) had Marfan syndrome. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of operative mortality and adverse event (ie, operative death or persistent [present at discharge] stroke, paraplegia, paraparesis, or renal failure necessitating dialysis). Long-term outcomes were analyzed with competing risks analysis. RESULTS: Patients with HTAD had lower operative mortality (1.7% vs 7.0%, P=.01) and adverse event rates (2.8% vs 12.3%, P<.001) than non-HTAD patients. Most HTAD patients were discharged home (92.6% vs 76.9%, P<.001). Predictors of operative mortality were increasing age, aortic dissection, tobacco use, chronic symptoms, and rupture; predictors for adverse events were increasing age, acute symptoms, chronic dissection, and rupture. Patients with HTAD had substantially better repair-failure-free survival (P<.001).

With careful patient selection, some technical considerations, e.g. institution of peripheral cardiopulmonary bypass, and a sufficient learning curve, the right anterior minithoracotomy can become a convenient access for surgical interventions on the aortic root. We present the case of a 31-year-old female patient with Marfan syndrome and severe aortic regurgitation due to an aortic root aneurysm. We demonstrate a step-by-step guide through the David procedure via a right anterior minithoracotomy.",

Previous research found that pathogenic variants clustered in exons 24-32 of fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene result in more severe clinical phenotypes. Furthermore, genotype-phenotype correlation studies suggested that more severe cardiovascular phenotypes were related to variants held responsible for haploinsufficiency. Our objective was to analyze the differences in clinical manifestations and genotypes of individuals with early-onset Marfan syndrome and to assess their impact on management strategies. METHODS: We analyzed clinical and genetic data of a new patient with early-onset Marfan syndrome together with 51 previously reported ones in the PubMed database between 1991 and 2022. RESULTS: Analysis showed 94% (49/52) of pathogenic variants clustered in exons 24-32 of the FBN1. The most common skeletal features were arachnodactyly (98%), reduced elbow extension (48%), pectus deformity (40%), and scoliosis (39%). Haploinsufficiency variants were reported as having poor outcome in 87.5% of the cases. Among patients carrying variants that substitute a cysteine for another amino acid and those that do not change cysteine content, cardiac intervention was found to be associated with a better outcome (p = 0.035 vs. p = 0.002). Variants that create an extra cysteine residue were found to be associated with a higher risk of ectopia lentis. Additionally, children up to 36-months-old were more often reported as still alive at the time of publication compared to newborns (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings have implications for prognosis, because different genotype groups and their resulting phenotype may require personalized care and management.",

We conducted a comprehensive search of databases from their inception to May 1, 2023. Eligibility criteria were established based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The quality of studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), with studies scoring above five deemed high quality. Meta-analyses were performed using Stata 15.1 software. Nine studies were analyzed. Findings indicate MFS patients had increased vortex flow in the descending aorta (DAo), larger aortic root diameter (ARD) and Z-scores, lower inner wall shear stress (WSS) in the proximal descending aorta (pDAo), reduced in-plane rotational flow (IRF) in the aortic arch and proximal descending aorta (pDAo), and increased pulse wave velocity (PWV) in the ascending aorta (AAo) and DAo compared to healthy subjects. No significant difference in systolic flow reversal ratio was observed. Sensitivity analysis showed no heterogeneity and Egger's test revealed no publication bias. This meta-analysis underscores the effectiveness of 4D flow CMR in detecting MFS, particularly through indicators such as vortex flow, WSS, IRF, ARD, and PWV. The findings provide insights into diagnosing cardiovascular diseases and predicting cardiovascular events in MFS patients. Further case-control studies are needed to establish measurement standards and explore potential indicators for improved diagnosis and treatment of MFS.",

This study aimed to evaluate the longitudinal changes in spherical equivalent (SE) refractive error in preschool children with CEL. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Guangzhou, China. Medical records of CEL patients under 6-year-old who were diagnosed with Marfan syndrome at the initial visit from January 2014 to March 2022 were collected and were divided into surgery and non-surgery groups. Mean change rate of SE in the two groups was evaluated, and the potential associated factors of SE change rate were investigated by mixed-effect regression model. RESULTS: A total of 94 preschool patients from 14 provinces of China were included. Among the 42 children of the surgery group, the mean age with standard deviation (SD) was 5.02 +- 0.81 years and patients experienced a myopic shift of -0.05 +- 0.09 D/month in average. The mean age with SD of the 52 children of the non-surgery group was 4.34 +- 1.02 years, and the mean myopic shift was -0.09 +- 0.14 D/month. The mixed-effect regression model identified that higher degree of myopia at baseline was associated with slower myopic shift both in surgery (beta = 0.901, 95% CI: 0.822 ~ 0.980, P < 0.001) and in non-surgery group (beta = 1.006, 95% CI: 0.977 ~ 1.034, P < 0.001) in CEL patients. Surgical treatment (beta = 2.635, 95% CI: 1.376 ~ 3.894, P < 0.001) was associated with slower myopic shift in all participants CEL patients. CONCLUSIONS: Myopic progression was slower in the surgery group than in the non-surgery group of CEL. Preschool CEL patients who met the surgical indication are suggested being performed with timely surgery to slow down the myopic progression.",

The mixed-effect regression model identified that higher degree of myopia at baseline was associated with slower myopic shift both in surgery (beta = 0.901, 95% CI: 0.822 ~ 0.980, P < 0.001) and in non-surgery group (beta = 1.006, 95% CI: 0.977 ~ 1.034, P < 0.001) in CEL patients. Surgical treatment (beta = 2.635, 95% CI: 1.376 ~ 3.894, P < 0.001) was associated with slower myopic shift in all participants CEL patients. CONCLUSIONS: Myopic progression was slower in the surgery group than in the non-surgery group of CEL. Preschool CEL patients who met the surgical indication are suggested being performed with timely surgery to slow down the myopic progression.",

This study aimed to evaluate the longitudinal changes in spherical equivalent (SE) refractive error in preschool children with CEL. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Guangzhou, China. Medical records of CEL patients under 6-year-old who were diagnosed with Marfan syndrome at the initial visit from January 2014 to March 2022 were collected and were divided into surgery and non-surgery groups. Mean change rate of SE in the two groups was evaluated, and the potential associated factors of SE change rate were investigated by mixed-effect regression model. RESULTS: A total of 94 preschool patients from 14 provinces of China were included. Among the 42 children of the surgery group, the mean age with standard deviation (SD) was 5.02 +- 0.81 years and patients experienced a myopic shift of -0.05 +- 0.09 D/month in average. The mean age with SD of the 52 children of the non-surgery group was 4.34 +- 1.02 years, and the mean myopic shift was -0.09 +- 0.14 D/month.

This study aimed to analyze patient characteristics and clinical outcomes of this condition through a US national database. METHODS: The National Inpatient Sample database (2002-2018) was used to identify all type A aortic dissection in heart transplantation recipients aged >18 years. Incidence was quantified annually. Primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality; secondary outcomes were hospital length of stay and complications. RESULTS: We identified 78 cases of type A aortic dissection in heart transplantation recipients. Compared with type A aortic dissection patients without a history of solid organ transplantation (N = 70,715), our patients were younger (55.3 vs 60.7 years), less likely female (18.5% vs 33.5%), and more frequently Black or Hispanic (55% vs 23%). They had a greater prevalence of Marfan syndrome (13% vs 3%), congestive heart failure (46% vs 19%), and chronic kidney disease (19% vs 10%), as well as increased in-hospital mortality (30% vs 18%) and a longer hospital length of stay (29.5 vs 13.7 days). They experienced elevated rates of cardiac (57% vs 31%), respiratory (70. % vs 41%), renal (76% vs 30%), and bleeding complications (37% vs 14%). CONCLUSIONS: Type A aortic dissection in heart transplantation recipients appears to exhibit distinct characteristics and poorer outcomes compared with those in the general population. Heart transplantation recipients with predisposing risk factors warrant heightened attention to help prevent this devastating condition.",

                    "text": "Type A Aortic Dissection in Heart Transplantation Recipients in the United States.BACKGROUND: Type A aortic dissection in heart transplantation recipients is rare and lethal, with limited research beyond case reports. This study aimed to analyze patient characteristics and clinical outcomes of this condition through a US national database. METHODS: The National Inpatient Sample database (2002-2018) was used to identify all type A aortic dissection in heart transplantation recipients aged >18 years. Incidence was quantified annually. Primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality; secondary outcomes were hospital length of stay and complications. RESULTS: We identified 78 cases of type A aortic dissection in heart transplantation recipients. Compared with type A aortic dissection patients without a history of solid organ transplantation (N = 70,715), our patients were younger (55.3 vs 60.7 years), less likely female (18.5% vs 33.5%), and more frequently Black or Hispanic (55% vs 23%). They had a greater prevalence of Marfan syndrome (13% vs 3%), congestive heart failure (46% vs 19%), and chronic kidney disease (19% vs 10%), as well as increased in-hospital mortality (30% vs 18%) and a longer hospital length of stay (29.5 vs 13.7 days). They experienced elevated rates of cardiac (57% vs 31%), respiratory (70. % vs 41%), renal (76% vs 30%), and bleeding complications (37% vs 14%). CONCLUSIONS: Type A aortic dissection in heart transplantation recipients appears to exhibit distinct characteristics and poorer outcomes compared with those in the general population. Heart transplantation recipients with predisposing risk factors warrant heightened attention to help prevent this devastating condition.",

Although surgical management has improved, the optimal therapy is a matter of debate. Different surgical strategies have been proposed for patients under 60 years old. This paper evaluates the postoperative outcome and the need for secondary aortic operation after a limited surgical approach (proximal arch replacement) vs. extended arch repair. METHODS: Between January 2000 and January 2018, 530 patients received surgical treatment for AADA at our hospital; 182 were under 60 years old and were enrolled in this study - Group A (n=68), limited arch repair (proximal arch replacement), and group B (n=114), extended arch repair (> proximal arch replacement). RESULTS: More pericardial tamponade (P=0.005) and preoperative mechanical resuscitation (P=0.014) were seen in Group A. More need for renal replacement therapy (P=0.047) was seen in the full arch group. Mechanical ventilation time (P=0.022) and intensive care unit stay (P<0.001) were shorter in the limited repair group. Thirty-day mortality was comparable (P=0.117). New onset of postoperative stroke was comparable (Group A four patients [5.9%] vs. Group B 15 patients [13.2%]; P=0.120). Long-term follow-up did not differ significantly for secondary aortic surgery. CONCLUSION: Even though young patients received only limited arch repair, the outcome was comparable. Full-arch replacement was not beneficial in the long-time follow-up. A limited approach is justified in the cohort of young AADA patients. Exemptions, like known Marfan syndrome and the presence of an intimal tear in the arch, should be considered.",

METHODS: We analysed data from 2 European centres of patients with MFS and LDS undergoing EVAR. Patients were analysed based on (i) timing of the procedure (planned versus emergency procedure) and (ii) the nature of the landing zone (safe versus non-safe). The primary end-point was freedom from reintervention. Secondary end-points were freedom from stroke, bleeding and death. RESULTS: A population of 419 patients with MFS (n = 352) or LDS (n = 67) was analysed for the purpose of this study. Thirty-nine patients (9%) underwent EVAR. Indications for thoracic endovascular aortic repair or EVAR were aortic dissection in 13 (33%) patients, aortic aneurysm in 22 (57%) patients and others (intercostal patch aneurysm, penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer, pseudoaneurysm, kinking of frozen elephant trunk (FET)) in 4 (10%) patients. Thoracic endovascular repair was performed in 34 patients, and abdominal endovascular aortic repair was performed in 5 patients. Mean age at 1st thoracic endovascular aortic repair/EVAR was 48.5 +- 15.4 years. Mean follow-up after 1st thoracic endovascular aortic repair/EVAR was 5.9 +- 4.4 years. There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of reinterventions between patients with non-safe landing zone and the patients with safe proximal landing zone (P = 0.609). Furthermore, there was no increased probability for reintervention after planned endovascular intervention compared to emergency procedures (P = 0.916). Mean time to reintervention, either open surgical or endovascular, after planned endovascular intervention was in median 3.9 years (95% confidence interval 2.0-5.9 years) and 2.0 years (95% confidence interval -1.1 to 5.1 years) (P = 0.23) after emergency procedures.

METHODS: We analysed data from 2 European centres of patients with MFS and LDS undergoing EVAR. Patients were analysed based on (i) timing of the procedure (planned versus emergency procedure) and (ii) the nature of the landing zone (safe versus non-safe). The primary end-point was freedom from reintervention. Secondary end-points were freedom from stroke, bleeding and death. RESULTS: A population of 419 patients with MFS (n = 352) or LDS (n = 67) was analysed for the purpose of this study. Thirty-nine patients (9%) underwent EVAR. Indications for thoracic endovascular aortic repair or EVAR were aortic dissection in 13 (33%) patients, aortic aneurysm in 22 (57%) patients and others (intercostal patch aneurysm, penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer, pseudoaneurysm, kinking of frozen elephant trunk (FET)) in 4 (10%) patients. Thoracic endovascular repair was performed in 34 patients, and abdominal endovascular aortic repair was performed in 5 patients. Mean age at 1st thoracic endovascular aortic repair/EVAR was 48.5 +- 15.4 years. Mean follow-up after 1st thoracic endovascular aortic repair/EVAR was 5.9 +- 4.4 years. There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of reinterventions between patients with non-safe landing zone and the patients with safe proximal landing zone (P = 0.609). Furthermore, there was no increased probability for reintervention after planned endovascular intervention compared to emergency procedures (P = 0.916). Mean time to reintervention, either open surgical or endovascular, after planned endovascular intervention was in median 3.9 years (95% confidence interval 2.0-5.9 years) and 2.0 years (95% confidence interval -1.1 to 5.1 years) (P = 0.23) after emergency procedures. CONCLUSIONS: EVAR in patients with MFS and LDS and a safe landing zone is feasible and safe. Endovascular treatment is a viable option when employed by a multi-disciplinary aortic team even if the landing zone is in native tissue.",
