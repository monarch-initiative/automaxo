38450460	Association|diseaseD008382|ncbi2200	[Structural and functional features of the eye in diseaseD008382. Report 1. Changes in the fibrous tunic of the eye].diseaseD008382 (diseaseD008382) is an orphan diseaseD030342 associated with a mutation in the ncbi2200 gene, which pathological manifestations are characterized by polysystemic involvement. The ncbi2200 protein is an integral component of the sclera and cornea of the eye, and in diseaseD008382 its structure is distrubed. PURPOSE: This study assesses potential structural and functional changes in the cornea and sclera of a 9606 with diseaseD008382. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two groups were formed, comparable in the axial length of the eye and age: the main group - 19 9606 (38 eyes) with a verified diagnosis of diseaseD008382, and the control group - 24 9606 (48 eyes) with diseaseD009216 of varying degrees. The results obtained from diseaseD008382 9606 were analyzed depending on the absence or presence of diseaseD004479. In addition to measuring the basic ophthalmological parameters (refraction, axial length, visual acuity), topographic keratometry, anterior segment optical coherence tomography, and ocular response analyzer were used for structural and functional assessment of the cornea and sclera. RESULTS: In diseaseD008382 there was a statistically significant increase in the radius of curvature and a decrease in corneal refraction in the central zone compared to the control group. There were no significant differences in central corneal thickness, but there was a significant decrease in the thickness of the sclera in the limbal zone compared to the control group. There were no statistically significant changes in corneal hysteresis and corneal resistance factor in diseaseD008382. CONCLUSION: This study confirmed the previously obtained data on the tendency of the optical power to reliably decrease in diseaseD008382 (flattening of the cornea). This symptom can be considered as a compensatory factor affecting clinical refraction, while the decrease in the thickness of the sclera - as the main reason for aaxial length elongation in diseaseD008382. There were no clear patterns of dependence of the changes in the cornea and sclera analyzed in this study on the presence or absence of diseaseD004479. Changes in the lens, perhaps, should be regarded only as one of the potential components of the ocular symptom complex in diseaseD008382.

Most ncbi2200 mutations are missense or nonsense mutations. Traditional molecular genetic testing for the ncbi2200 gene, like Sanger sequencing, may miss disease-causing mutations in the gene's regulatory regions or non-coding sequences, as well as partial or complete gene deletions and duplications. METHODS: Next-generation sequencing, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and gap PCR were conducted on two diseaseD008382 9606 to screen for disease-causing mutations. RESULTS: We identified two large deletions in ncbi2200 from two diseaseD008382 9606. One 9606 had a 0.23 Mb deletion (NC_000015.9:variant#2200#g.48550506_48779360del) including 5'UTR-exon6 of ncbi2200. The other 9606 harbored a 1416 bp deletion (NC_000015.9:variant#2200#g.48410869_48412284del) affecting the last exon, exon 66, of the ncbi2200 gene. CONCLUSION: Our results expanded the number of large ncbi2200 deletions and highlighted the importance of screening for large deletions in ncbi2200 in clinical genetic testing, especially for those with the classic diseaseD008382 phenotype.
38332569		Research Progress on diseaseD000094628.diseaseD000094628 are one of the most common diseaseD000094628, involving the aortic valve, aortic sinus, bilateral coronary arteries, and part of the ascending aorta. It is a life-threatening diseaseD001018 with a high mortality rate of approximately 90%, due to diseaseD001019. diseaseD001022 is one of the most common complications of diseaseD000094628 that can lead to acute diseaseD006333. The etiology of diseaseD000094628 is not yet completely clear and is mainly related to diseaseD030342, such as diseaseD008382 and diseaseD050197. It can also occur secondary to diseaseD001024 or a diseaseD009140. Surgery is the primary treatment for diseaseD000094628, and aortic root replacement is a classic surgical method. However, the incidences of perioperative complications and mortality are relatively high, particularly in high-risk 9606. In recent years, the anatomical structure of the aortic root has been gradually refined, and an in-depth understanding of diseaseD000094628 has led to individualized treatment methods. Conservative drug therapy (ss-receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers), Bentall and modified Bentall surgeries (Button technology, Cabrol surgery, and modified Cabrol surgery), valve-sparing aortic root replacement (David and Yacoub), personalized external aortic root support, and endovascular intervention therapy have significantly improved the perioperative and long-term survival rates of 9606 with diseaseD000094628. However, different treatment methods have their own advantages and disadvantages. This review aimed to summarize the current research progress and treatment of diseaseD000094628.
37860854		The David procedure through a right anterior minithoracotomy.A right anterior minithoracotomy is the least-frequently utilized approach in minimally invasive aortic valve surgery; moreover, this access is rarely used for aortic root procedures. With careful patient selection, some technical considerations, e.g. institution of peripheral cardiopulmonary bypass, and a sufficient learning curve, the right anterior minithoracotomy can become a convenient access for surgical interventions on the aortic root. We present the case of a 31-year-old female patient with diseaseD008382 and severe diseaseD001022 due to an diseaseD000094628. We demonstrate a step-by-step guide through the David procedure via a right anterior minithoracotomy.
37866646		Outcomes After Extent I Thoracoabdominal Aortic Repair: Focus on diseaseD065627.BACKGROUND: Crawford extent I diseaseD000094624 (diseaseD000094624) repairs are increasingly performed by an endovascular approach, including in patients with heritable diseaseD013896 (diseaseD065627). We evaluated outcomes after open extent I diseaseD000094624 repair in patients with and without diseaseD065627. METHODS: This retrospective study included 992 patients (median age 67 y [57-73]) who underwent extent I diseaseD000094624 (1990-2022), stratified by the presence of diseaseD065627 (n=177, 17.8%). Patients with diseaseD065627 had either genetic aortopathies or presented at age <=50 years; 35% (62/177) had diseaseD008382. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of operative mortality and adverse event (ie, operative diseaseD003643 or persistent [present at discharge] diseaseD020521, diseaseD010264, diseaseD020335, or diseaseD051437 necessitating dialysis). Long-term outcomes were analyzed with competing risks analysis. RESULTS: Patients with diseaseD065627 had lower operative mortality (1.7% vs 7.0%, P=.01) and adverse event rates (2.8% vs 12.3%, P<.001) than non-diseaseD065627 patients. Most diseaseD065627 patients were discharged home (92.6% vs 76.9%, P<.001). Predictors of operative mortality were increasing age, diseaseD000784, tobacco use, chronic symptoms, and diseaseD012421; predictors for adverse events were increasing age, acute symptoms, chronic diseaseD000784, and diseaseD012421. Patients with diseaseD065627 had substantially better repair-failure-free survival (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Open extent I diseaseD000094624 repair was effective in patients with diseaseD065627, with low operative mortality and adverse event rates, better late survival, and excellent long-term durability, making a compelling argument for preferring open repair in these patients.

However, a significant number of individuals with diseaseD008382 remain genetically unexplained. In this study, we report novel pathogenic intronic variants in ncbi2200 in two unrelated families with diseaseD008382. METHODS: We evaluated subjects with suspected diseaseD008382 from two unrelated families using Sanger sequencing or multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification of ncbi2200 and/or panel-based next-generation sequencing. As no pathogenic variants were identified, whole-genome sequencing was performed. Identified variants were analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR and targeted sequencing of ncbi2200 mRNA harvested from peripheral blood or skin fibroblasts obtained from affected probands. RESULTS: We found causative deep intronic variants, variant#2200#c.6163+1484A>T and variant#2200#c.5788+36C>A, in ncbi2200. The splicing analysis revealed an insertion of in-frame or out-of-frame intronic sequences of the ncbi2200 transcript predicted to alter function of chemicalD002118-binding epidermal growth factor protein domain. Family members carrying variant#2200#c.6163+1484A>T had high systemic scores including prominent skeletal features and diseaseD000784 with lesser diseaseD002311. Family members carrying variant#2200#c.5788+36C>A had more severe diseaseD000094628 without diseaseD000784. Both families had diseaseD004479. CONCLUSION: Variable penetrance of the phenotype and negative genetic testing in diseaseD008382 families should raise the possibility of deep intronic ncbi2200 variants and the need for additional molecular studies. This study expands the mutation spectrum of ncbi2200 and points out the importance of intronic sequence analysis and the need for integrative functional studies in diseaseD008382 diagnosis.

Previous research found that pathogenic variants clustered in exons 24-32 of ncbi2200 (ncbi2200) gene result in more severe clinical phenotypes. Furthermore, genotype-phenotype correlation studies suggested that more severe cardiovascular phenotypes were related to variants held responsible for haploinsufficiency. Our objective was to analyze the differences in clinical manifestations and genotypes of individuals with early-onset diseaseD008382 and to assess their impact on management strategies. METHODS: We analyzed clinical and genetic data of a new patient with early-onset diseaseD008382 together with 51 previously reported ones in the PubMed database between 1991 and 2022. RESULTS: Analysis showed 94% (49/52) of pathogenic variants clustered in exons 24-32 of the ncbi2200. The most common skeletal features were diseaseD054119 (98%), diseaseD000092464 (48%), diseaseD066166 (40%), and diseaseD012600 (39%). Haploinsufficiency variants were reported as having poor outcome in 87.5% of the cases. Among patients carrying variants that substitute a chemicalD003545 for another amino acid and those that do not change chemicalD003545 content, cardiac intervention was found to be associated with a better outcome (p = 0.035 vs. p = 0.002). Variants that create an extra chemicalD003545 residue were found to be associated with a higher risk of diseaseD004479. Additionally, children up to 36-months-old were more often reported as still alive at the time of publication compared to newborns (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings have implications for prognosis, because different genotype groups and their resulting phenotype may require personalized care and management.
38360466		diseaseD000784 in Heart Transplantation Recipients in the United States.BACKGROUND: diseaseD000784 in heart transplantation recipients is rare and lethal, with limited research beyond case reports. This study aimed to analyze 9606 characteristics and clinical outcomes of this condition through a US national database. METHODS: The National Inpatient Sample database (2002-2018) was used to identify all diseaseD000784 in heart transplantation recipients aged >18 years. Incidence was quantified annually. Primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality; secondary outcomes were hospital length of stay and diseaseD008107. RESULTS: We identified 78 cases of diseaseD000784 in heart transplantation recipients. Compared with diseaseD000784 9606 without a history of solid organ transplantation (N = 70,715), our 9606 were younger (55.3 vs 60.7 years), less likely female (18.5% vs 33.5%), and more frequently Black or Hispanic (55% vs 23%). They had a greater prevalence of diseaseD008382 (13% vs 3%), diseaseD006333 (46% vs 19%), and diseaseD051436 (19% vs 10%), as well as increased in-hospital mortality (30% vs 18%) and a longer hospital length of stay (29.5 vs 13.7 days). They experienced elevated rates of cardiac (57% vs 31%), respiratory (70. % vs 41%), renal (76% vs 30%), and diseaseD008107 (37% vs 14%). CONCLUSIONS: diseaseD000784 in heart transplantation recipients appears to exhibit distinct characteristics and poorer outcomes compared with those in the general population. Heart transplantation recipients with predisposing risk factors warrant heightened attention to help prevent this devastating condition.
38363416		Longitudinal changes of diseaseD012030 in preschool children with diseaseD004479.BACKGROUND: diseaseD004479 (diseaseD004479) is a diseaseD015785 which severely impacts preschool children's visual function and development. This study aimed to evaluate the longitudinal changes in spherical equivalent (SE) diseaseD012030 in preschool children with diseaseD004479. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Guangzhou, China. Medical records of diseaseD004479 9606 under 6-year-old who were diagnosed with diseaseD008382 at the initial visit from January 2014 to March 2022 were collected and were divided into surgery and non-surgery groups. Mean change rate of SE in the two groups was evaluated, and the potential associated factors of SE change rate were investigated by mixed-effect regression model. RESULTS: A total of 94 preschool 9606 from 14 provinces of China were included. Among the 42 children of the surgery group, the mean age with standard deviation (SD) was 5.02 +- 0.81 years and 9606 experienced a diseaseD001251 shift of -0.05 +- 0.09 D/month in average. The mean age with SD of the 52 children of the non-surgery group was 4.34 +- 1.02 years, and the mean diseaseD001251 shift was -0.09 +- 0.14 D/month. The mixed-effect regression model identified that higher degree of diseaseD009216 at baseline was associated with slower diseaseD001251 shift both in surgery (beta = 0.901, 95% CI: 0.822 ~ 0.980, P < 0.001) and in non-surgery group (beta = 1.006, 95% CI: 0.977 ~ 1.034, P < 0.001) in diseaseD004479 9606. Surgical treatment (beta = 2.635, 95% CI: 1.376 ~ 3.894, P < 0.001) was associated with slower diseaseD001251 shift in all participants diseaseD004479 9606. CONCLUSIONS: diseaseD001251 progression was slower in the surgery group than in the non-surgery group of diseaseD004479. Preschool diseaseD004479 9606 who met the surgical indication are suggested being performed with timely surgery to slow down the diseaseD001251 progression.
37913934		Clinical application of four-dimensional flow cardiovascular magnetic resonance in diseaseD008382: A systematic review and meta-analysis.This study aims to fill this gap by assessing the application of 4D flow CMR in diseaseD008382 through a systematic review and meta-analysis. We conducted a comprehensive search of databases from their inception to May 1, 2023. Eligibility criteria were established based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The quality of studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), with studies scoring above five deemed high quality. Meta-analyses were performed using Stata 15.1 software. Nine studies were analyzed. Findings indicate diseaseD008382 patients had increased vortex flow in the descending aorta (DAo), larger aortic root diameter (ARD) and Z-scores, lower inner wall shear stress (WSS) in the proximal descending aorta (pDAo), reduced in-plane rotational flow (IRF) in the aortic arch and proximal descending aorta (pDAo), and increased pulse wave velocity (PWV) in the ascending aorta (AAo) and DAo compared to healthy subjects. No significant difference in systolic flow reversal ratio was observed. Sensitivity analysis showed no heterogeneity and Egger's test revealed no publication bias. This meta-analysis underscores the effectiveness of 4D flow CMR in detecting diseaseD008382, particularly through indicators such as vortex flow, WSS, IRF, ARD, and PWV. The findings provide insights into diagnosing diseaseD002318 and predicting cardiovascular events in diseaseD008382 patients. Further case-control studies are needed to establish measurement standards and explore potential indicators for improved diagnosis and treatment of diseaseD008382.
38384125	Negative_Correlation|chemicalD017258|diseaseC562399; Negative_Correlation|chemicalD017258|diseaseD008382	diseaseC562399 in diseaseD008382 9606 After Micropulse Transscleral Cyclophotocoagulation: A Call for Risk Stratification.BACKGROUND Micropulse transscleral cyclophotocoagulation is a non-invasive, widely employed procedure that uses diode laser to target the ciliary body to lower the intraocular pressure. Despite its acknowledged efficacy, certain complications are recognized, with diseaseC562399 being a rare yet serious consequence. This report seeks to shed light on a potential high-risk subgroup susceptible to diseaseC562399, exemplified by our 9606 with diseaseD008382, a condition characterized by thin sclera. CASE REPORT Our 9606, who was confirmed to have diseaseD008382 with diseaseD005901, underwent micropulse transscleral cyclophotocoagulation due to high intraocular pressure bilaterally and subsequently quickly manifested diseaseC562399 in both eyes postoperatively. Swift initiation of management involved a comprehensive approach, including topical antibiotics, preservative-free lubrication, chemicalD017258 1%, serum balanced salt solution (BSS) 50%, and the application of bandage contact lenses to expedite healing. Fortunately, the left eye demonstrated resolution within 10 days, while the right eye exhibited delayed healing, leading to subsequent scarring. CONCLUSIONS This report highlights the critical importance of recognizing populations predisposed to diseaseC562399 before subjecting them to micropulse transscleral cyclophotocoagulation. Such awareness allows for the fine-tuning of procedural parameters, offering a strategic approach to mitigate the risk of diseaseC562399 development. By further exploring and recognizing potential risk factors, clinicians can enhance 9606 outcomes and refine the safety profile of micropulse transscleral cyclophotocoagulation.

38430465		Endovascular aortic repair in 9606 with diseaseD008382 and diseaseD055947 is safe and durable when employed by a multi-disciplinary aortic team.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to report on mid-term outcomes after endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) in 9606 with diseaseD008382 (diseaseD008382) or diseaseD055947. METHODS: We analysed data from 2 European centres of 9606 with diseaseD008382 and LDS undergoing EVAR. 9606 were analysed based on (i) timing of the procedure (planned versus emergency procedure) and (ii) the nature of the landing zone (safe versus non-safe). The primary end-point was freedom from reintervention. Secondary end-points were freedom from diseaseD020521, diseaseD006470 and diseaseD003643. RESULTS: A population of 419 9606 with diseaseD008382 (n = 352) or LDS (n = 67) was analysed for the purpose of this study. Thirty-nine 9606 (9%) underwent EVAR. Indications for thoracic endovascular aortic repair or EVAR were diseaseD000784 in 13 (33%) 9606, diseaseD001014 in 22 (57%) 9606 and others (intercostal patch diseaseD000783, penetrating diseaseD014456, diseaseD017541, kinking of frozen elephant trunk (FET)) in 4 (10%) 9606. Thoracic endovascular repair was performed in 34 9606, and abdominal endovascular aortic repair was performed in 5 9606. Mean age at 1st thoracic endovascular aortic repair/EVAR was 48.5 +- 15.4 years. Mean follow-up after 1st thoracic endovascular aortic repair/EVAR was 5.9 +- 4.4 years. There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of reinterventions between 9606 with non-safe landing zone and the 9606 with safe proximal landing zone (P = 0.609). Furthermore, there was no increased probability for reintervention after planned endovascular intervention compared to emergency procedures (P = 0.916). Mean time to reintervention, either open surgical or endovascular, after planned endovascular intervention was in median 3.9 years (95% confidence interval 2.0-5.9 years) and 2.0 years (95% confidence interval -1.1 to 5.1 years) (P = 0.23) after emergency procedures. CONCLUSIONS: EVAR in 9606 with diseaseD008382 and LDS and a safe landing zone is feasible and safe. Endovascular treatment is a viable option when employed by a multi-disciplinary aortic team even if the landing zone is in native tissue.
37943993		diseaseD000094683 in Younger Patients (< 60 Years Old) - Does Full Arch Replacement Provide Benefits Compared to Limited Approach?INTRODUCTION: Acute diseaseD000784 diseaseD006969 (diseaseD000784) is a surgical emergency associated with high morbidity and mortality. Although surgical management has improved, the optimal therapy is a matter of debate. Different surgical strategies have been proposed for patients under 60 years old. This paper evaluates the postoperative outcome and the need for secondary aortic operation after a limited surgical approach (proximal arch replacement) vs. extended arch repair. METHODS: Between January 2000 and January 2018, 530 patients received surgical treatment for diseaseD000784 at our hospital; 182 were under 60 years old and were enrolled in this study - Group A (n=68), limited arch repair (proximal arch replacement), and group B (n=114), extended arch repair (> proximal arch replacement). RESULTS: More diseaseD002305 (P=0.005) and preoperative mechanical resuscitation (P=0.014) were seen in Group A. More need for renal replacement therapy (P=0.047) was seen in the full arch group. Mechanical ventilation time (P=0.022) and intensive care unit stay (P<0.001) were shorter in the limited repair group. Thirty-day mortality was comparable (P=0.117). New onset of diseaseD020521 was comparable (Group A four patients [5.9%] vs. Group B 15 patients [13.2%]; P=0.120). Long-term follow-up did not differ significantly for secondary aortic surgery. CONCLUSION: Even though young patients received only limited arch repair, the outcome was comparable. Full-arch replacement was not beneficial in the long-time follow-up. A limited approach is justified in the cohort of young diseaseD000784 patients. Exemptions, like known diseaseD008382 and the presence of an diseaseD012167 in the arch, should be considered.
37861579		Absent right diseaseD013479 and persistent left diseaseD013479: An incidental finding.A patient with diseaseD008382 undergoing Bentall operation was found to have an absent right diseaseD013479 and persistent left diseaseD013479. The diseaseD002311 raised the suspicion of persistent left diseaseD013479. The diagnosis was confirmed by agitated saline contrast echocardiography and computed tomography of the chest.
