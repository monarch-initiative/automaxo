input_text: 'Endovascular aortic repair in patients with Marfan and Loeys-Dietz syndrome
  is safe and durable when employed by a multi-disciplinary aortic team.OBJECTIVES:
  The aim of this study was to report on mid-term outcomes after endovascular aortic
  repair (EVAR) in patients with Marfan (MFS) or Loeys-Dietz (LDS) syndrome. METHODS:
  We analysed data from 2 European centres of patients with MFS and LDS undergoing
  EVAR. Patients were analysed based on (i) timing of the procedure (planned versus
  emergency procedure) and (ii) the nature of the landing zone (safe versus non-safe).
  The primary end-point was freedom from reintervention. Secondary end-points were
  freedom from stroke, bleeding and death. RESULTS: A population of 419 patients with
  MFS (n = 352) or LDS (n = 67) was analysed for the purpose of this study. Thirty-nine
  patients (9%) underwent EVAR. Indications for thoracic endovascular aortic repair
  or EVAR were aortic dissection in 13 (33%) patients, aortic aneurysm in 22 (57%)
  patients and others (intercostal patch aneurysm, penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer,
  pseudoaneurysm, kinking of frozen elephant trunk (FET)) in 4 (10%) patients. Thoracic
  endovascular repair was performed in 34 patients, and abdominal endovascular aortic
  repair was performed in 5 patients. Mean age at 1st thoracic endovascular aortic
  repair/EVAR was 48.5 +- 15.4 years. Mean follow-up after 1st thoracic endovascular
  aortic repair/EVAR was 5.9 +- 4.4 years. There was no statistically significant
  difference in the rate of reinterventions between patients with non-safe landing
  zone and the patients with safe proximal landing zone (P = 0.609). Furthermore,
  there was no increased probability for reintervention after planned endovascular
  intervention compared to emergency procedures (P = 0.916). Mean time to reintervention,
  either open surgical or endovascular, after planned endovascular intervention was
  in median 3.9 years (95% confidence interval 2.0-5.9 years) and 2.0 years (95% confidence
  interval -1.1 to 5.1 years) (P = 0.23) after emergency procedures. CONCLUSIONS:
  EVAR in patients with MFS and LDS and a safe landing zone is feasible and safe.
  Endovascular treatment is a viable option when employed by a multi-disciplinary
  aortic team even if the landing zone is in native tissue.'
