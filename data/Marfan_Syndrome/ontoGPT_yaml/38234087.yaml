input_text: 'Overcoming challenges associated with identifying FBN1 deep intronic
  variants through whole-genome sequencing.BACKGROUND: Marfan syndrome (MFS), caused
  by pathogenic variants of FBN1 (fibrillin-1), is a systemic connective tissue disorder
  with variable phenotypes and treatment responsiveness depending on the variant.
  However, a significant number of individuals with MFS remain genetically unexplained.
  In this study, we report novel pathogenic intronic variants in FBN1 in two unrelated
  families with MFS. METHODS: We evaluated subjects with suspected MFS from two unrelated
  families using Sanger sequencing or multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification
  of FBN1 and/or panel-based next-generation sequencing. As no pathogenic variants
  were identified, whole-genome sequencing was performed. Identified variants were
  analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR and targeted sequencing of FBN1 mRNA harvested
  from peripheral blood or skin fibroblasts obtained from affected probands. RESULTS:
  We found causative deep intronic variants, c.6163+1484A>T and c.5788+36C>A, in FBN1.
  The splicing analysis revealed an insertion of in-frame or out-of-frame intronic
  sequences of the FBN1 transcript predicted to alter function of calcium-binding
  epidermal growth factor protein domain. Family members carrying c.6163+1484A>T had
  high systemic scores including prominent skeletal features and aortic dissection
  with lesser aortic dilatation. Family members carrying c.5788+36C>A had more severe
  aortic root dilatation without aortic dissection. Both families had ectopia lentis.
  CONCLUSION: Variable penetrance of the phenotype and negative genetic testing in
  MFS families should raise the possibility of deep intronic FBN1 variants and the
  need for additional molecular studies. This study expands the mutation spectrum
  of FBN1 and points out the importance of intronic sequence analysis and the need
  for integrative functional studies in MFS diagnosis.'
