input_text: '[Structural and functional features of the eye in Marfan syndrome. Report
  1. Changes in the fibrous tunic of the eye].Marfan syndrome (MS) is an orphan hereditary
  connective tissue disease associated with a mutation in the FBN1 gene, which pathological
  manifestations are characterized by polysystemic involvement. The fibrillin-1 protein
  is an integral component of the sclera and cornea of the eye, and in MS its structure
  is distrubed. PURPOSE: This study assesses potential structural and functional changes
  in the cornea and sclera of a patient with MS. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two groups
  were formed, comparable in the axial length of the eye and age: the main group -
  19 patients (38 eyes) with a verified diagnosis of MS, and the control group - 24
  patients (48 eyes) with myopia of varying degrees. The results obtained from MS
  patients were analyzed depending on the absence or presence of ectopia lentis. In
  addition to measuring the basic ophthalmological parameters (refraction, axial length,
  visual acuity), topographic keratometry, anterior segment optical coherence tomography,
  and ocular response analyzer were used for structural and functional assessment
  of the cornea and sclera. RESULTS: In MS there was a statistically significant increase
  in the radius of curvature and a decrease in corneal refraction in the central zone
  compared to the control group. There were no significant differences in central
  corneal thickness, but there was a significant decrease in the thickness of the
  sclera in the limbal zone compared to the control group. There were no statistically
  significant changes in corneal hysteresis and corneal resistance factor in MS. CONCLUSION:
  This study confirmed the previously obtained data on the tendency of the optical
  power to reliably decrease in MS (flattening of the cornea). This symptom can be
  considered as a compensatory factor affecting clinical refraction, while the decrease
  in the thickness of the sclera - as the main reason for aaxial length elongation
  in MS. There were no clear patterns of dependence of the changes in the cornea and
  sclera analyzed in this study on the presence or absence of ectopia lentis. Changes
  in the lens, perhaps, should be regarded only as one of the potential components
  of the ocular symptom complex in MS.'
