input_text: 'Acute Aortic Dissection Type A in Younger Patients (< 60 Years Old) -
  Does Full Arch Replacement Provide Benefits Compared to Limited Approach?INTRODUCTION:
  Acute aortic dissection Stanford type A (AADA) is a surgical emergency associated
  with high morbidity and mortality. Although surgical management has improved, the
  optimal therapy is a matter of debate. Different surgical strategies have been proposed
  for patients under 60 years old. This paper evaluates the postoperative outcome
  and the need for secondary aortic operation after a limited surgical approach (proximal
  arch replacement) vs. extended arch repair. METHODS: Between January 2000 and January
  2018, 530 patients received surgical treatment for AADA at our hospital; 182 were
  under 60 years old and were enrolled in this study - Group A (n=68), limited arch
  repair (proximal arch replacement), and group B (n=114), extended arch repair (>
  proximal arch replacement). RESULTS: More pericardial tamponade (P=0.005) and preoperative
  mechanical resuscitation (P=0.014) were seen in Group A. More need for renal replacement
  therapy (P=0.047) was seen in the full arch group. Mechanical ventilation time (P=0.022)
  and intensive care unit stay (P<0.001) were shorter in the limited repair group.
  Thirty-day mortality was comparable (P=0.117). New onset of postoperative stroke
  was comparable (Group A four patients [5.9%] vs. Group B 15 patients [13.2%]; P=0.120).
  Long-term follow-up did not differ significantly for secondary aortic surgery. CONCLUSION:
  Even though young patients received only limited arch repair, the outcome was comparable.
  Full-arch replacement was not beneficial in the long-time follow-up. A limited approach
  is justified in the cohort of young AADA patients. Exemptions, like known Marfan
  syndrome and the presence of an intimal tear in the arch, should be considered.'
