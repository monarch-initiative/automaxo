input_text: The David procedure through a right anterior minithoracotomy.A right anterior
  minithoracotomy is the least-frequently utilized approach in minimally invasive
  aortic valve surgery; moreover, this access is rarely used for aortic root procedures.
  With careful patient selection, some technical considerations, e.g. institution
  of peripheral cardiopulmonary bypass, and a sufficient learning curve, the right
  anterior minithoracotomy can become a convenient access for surgical interventions
  on the aortic root. We present the case of a 31-year-old female patient with Marfan
  syndrome and severe aortic regurgitation due to an aortic root aneurysm. We demonstrate
  a step-by-step guide through the David procedure via a right anterior minithoracotomy.
