input_text: Research Progress on Aortic Root Aneurysms.Aortic root aneurysms are one
  of the most common aortic root diseases, involving the aortic valve, aortic sinus,
  bilateral coronary arteries, and part of the ascending aorta. It is a life-threatening
  aortic disease with a high mortality rate of approximately 90%, due to aortic aneurysm
  rupture. Aortic valve insufficiency is one of the most common complications of aortic
  root aneurysms that can lead to acute left heart failure. The etiology of aortic
  root aneurysms is not yet completely clear and is mainly related to genetic diseases,
  such as Marfan syndrome and atherosclerosis. It can also occur secondary to aortic
  valve stenosis or a bivalve deformity. Surgery is the primary treatment for aortic
  root aneurysms, and aortic root replacement is a classic surgical method. However,
  the incidences of perioperative complications and mortality are relatively high,
  particularly in high-risk patients. In recent years, the anatomical structure of
  the aortic root has been gradually refined, and an in-depth understanding of root
  aneurysms has led to individualized treatment methods. Conservative drug therapy
  (ss-receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin
  receptor blockers), Bentall and modified Bentall surgeries (Button technology, Cabrol
  surgery, and modified Cabrol surgery), valve-sparing aortic root replacement (David
  and Yacoub), personalized external aortic root support, and endovascular intervention
  therapy have significantly improved the perioperative and long-term survival rates
  of patients with aortic root aneurysms. However, different treatment methods have
  their own advantages and disadvantages. This review aimed to summarize the current
  research progress and treatment of aortic root aneurysms.
