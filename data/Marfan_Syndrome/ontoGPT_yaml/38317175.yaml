input_text: "Identification of two novel large deletions in FBN1 gene by next-generation
  sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification.BACKGROUND: Mutations
  in fibrillin-1 (FBN1) are known to be associated with Marfan syndrome (MFS), an
  autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder. Most FBN1 mutations are missense
  or nonsense mutations. Traditional molecular genetic testing for the FBN1 gene,
  like Sanger sequencing, may miss disease-causing mutations in the gene's regulatory
  regions or non-coding sequences, as well as partial or complete gene deletions and
  duplications. METHODS: Next-generation sequencing, multiplex ligation-dependent
  probe amplification and gap PCR were conducted on two MFS patients to screen for
  disease-causing mutations. RESULTS: We identified two large deletions in FBN1 from
  two MFS patients. One patient had a 0.23 Mb deletion (NC_000015.9:g.48550506_48779360del)
  including 5'UTR-exon6 of FBN1. The other patient harbored a 1416 bp deletion (NC_000015.9:g.48410869_48412284del)
  affecting the last exon, exon 66, of the FBN1 gene. CONCLUSION: Our results expanded
  the number of large FBN1 deletions and highlighted the importance of screening for
  large deletions in FBN1 in clinical genetic testing, especially for those with the
  classic MFS phenotype."
