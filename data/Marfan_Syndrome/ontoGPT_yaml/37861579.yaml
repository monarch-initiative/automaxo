input_text: 'Absent right superior vena cava and persistent left superior vena cava:
  An incidental finding.A patient with Marfan syndrome undergoing Bentall operation
  was found to have an absent right superior vena cava and persistent left superior
  vena cava. The dilation of coronary sinus raised the suspicion of persistent left
  superior vena cava. The diagnosis was confirmed by agitated saline contrast echocardiography
  and computed tomography of the chest.'
