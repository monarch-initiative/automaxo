                    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome (LNS) is a metabolic disorder involving mutations in the HGPRT1 gene that result in hyperuricemia, intellectual disability, a dystonic movement disorder, and compulsive self-injury with self-mutilation. The aim of this review is to summarize recent research that documents the extended behavioral, neurologic, and neurocognitive phenotype in classic LNS, to describe milder variants of HGprt deficiency that do not self-injure and have less severe neurological and cognitive deficits, and to provide an update on treatment for associated psychiatric and behavioral disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Psychiatric management utilizes combined behavioral and pharmacological treatment in conjunction with protective equipment and dental management to avert self-injury. Pharmacological management focuses on stabilization of mood and anxiety management. S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), a physiological intermediate in methylation and transsulfuration, has shown beneficial effects in carefully selected patients who can tolerate the drug. Deep brain stimulation is shown in several case reports and series to reduce or eliminate self-injury and aggression, and in some cases, modify dystonia. SUMMARY: This review highlights progress in our understanding of the behavioral and neurocognitive phenotype of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (HGprt deficiency) and its variants, describes psychiatric and behavioral management, and discusses prospects for new therapies.",

Bronchoscopy revealed tracheomalacia of the cresent moon type. He lost his weight, and his general condition gradually worsened. Four months post-tracheostomy, he died of massive hemoptysis from a tracheobrachicephalic artery fistula. Many patients with LNS have renal failure and pneumonitis, whereas occasional cases are complicated by convulsions, recurrent coma, abnormalities of respiration, and sudden death. The etiology of sudden death is not clear. Although tracheomalacia, to our knowledge, has not been described in the literature, it may be a clinical feature of LNS associated with abnormal respiration and sudden death. Tracheobrachiocephalic artery fistula is common in patients with neuromuscular disorders and a chronic tracheostomy tube.

Patients with this syndrome are characterized by hyperuricemia, self-mutilation, developmental retardation, and movement disorders such as spasticity and dystonia. The authors performed bilateral chronic stimulation of the globus pallidus internus for control of dystonic movements in a 19-year-old man with LNS. His self-mutilating behavior unexpectedly disappeared after chronic stimulation. This is the first case of LNS that has been successfully treated with deep brain stimulation. The findings indicate that neurobehavioral features of this syndrome are either mediated in the basal ganglia pathways or secondary to the dystonia.",

A characteristic feature of LNS is the appearance of intractable self-injurious behavior, usually in the form of severe lip and finger biting. The mechanism behind this severe self-mutilating behavior is unknown, and is one of the main challenges in the management of this condition. We here report the case of a 30-year-old man with a confirmed diagnosis of LNS who was successfully treated for self-mutilation of his lips with repeated botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) injections in the facial perioral muscles. Our findings suggest that treatment with BTX-A helped reduce self-abusive behavior in this patient. Our case illustrates that BTX-A injections can be a useful therapeutic approach in patients with self-abusive behavior.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a rare and debilitating condition characterized by dystonia and self-mutilating behavior. In order to shed light on the pathophysiology of dystonia, we report the pallidal electrophysiological activity recorded in two patients during deep brain stimulation surgery (DBS). METHODS: Microrecordings were performed on 162 neurons along four tracks aimed at the right and left anterior (limbic) and posterior (motor) globus pallidus internus (GPI). RESULTS: Regardless of the anesthetic agent used (propofol or sevoflurane), both patients showed similar neurons firing rates in the four regions studied, namely the limbic and motor portions of the globus pallidus externus (GPE) or GPI. In both patients, firing rates were similar in the GPE (12.2+/-1.8 Hz, N=38) and GPI (13.2+/-1.0 Hz, N=83) portions of the limbic track, while the motor GPE fired at a higher frequency (23.8+/-2.7 Hz, N=18) than the motor GPI (12.5+/-1.4 Hz, N=23). CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that light propofol or sevoflurane anesthesia influences pallidal activity in a similar way. Electrophysiological recordings suggest that Lesch-Nyhan syndrome might be characterized by analogous firing frequencies in the limbic GPE and GPI while motor GPE would tend to fire at higher rate than the motor GPI. It is therefore tempting to suggest that the symptoms that are observed in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome might result from motor GPI inhibition. SIGNIFICANCE: This observation may confirm the Albin and Delong's model of the basal nuclei in hypokinetic and hyperkinetic disorders.",

The aim of this review is to summarize recent research that documents the extended behavioral, neurologic, and neurocognitive phenotype in classic LNS, to describe milder variants of HGprt deficiency that do not self-injure and have less severe neurological and cognitive deficits, and to provide an update on treatment for associated psychiatric and behavioral disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Psychiatric management utilizes combined behavioral and pharmacological treatment in conjunction with protective equipment and dental management to avert self-injury. Pharmacological management focuses on stabilization of mood and anxiety management. S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), a physiological intermediate in methylation and transsulfuration, has shown beneficial effects in carefully selected patients who can tolerate the drug. Deep brain stimulation is shown in several case reports and series to reduce or eliminate self-injury and aggression, and in some cases, modify dystonia. SUMMARY: This review highlights progress in our understanding of the behavioral and neurocognitive phenotype of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (HGprt deficiency) and its variants, describes psychiatric and behavioral management, and discusses prospects for new therapies.",

A couple with a boy diagnosed with LN and a history of pregnancy termination was referred to the Hammersmith Hospital. Their affected son was born in 1982 after an uncomplicated pregnancy and vaginal delivery. Eight subsequent pregnancies had been unsuccessful. There were five therapeutic terminations and three spontaneous abortions, one at least directly caused by the sampling procedure during amniocentesis. From 1989 to 1991 two unsuccessful preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) cycles by sexing were performed by DNA amplification. The mutation was characterized and a nested PCR protocol was designed which allowed the efficient amplification of the affected loci followed by the detection of the mutant allele by restriction digestion. Three PGD cycles were performed using this specific diagnostic test before a successful pregnancy was achieved resulting in the birth of a healthy unaffected baby girl.",

The disorder is caused by a wide spectrum of mutations distributed throughout the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene. Female carriers of LN display no clinical symptoms but are at 50% risk of passing on the affected gene to their male offspring. A couple who had a boy with LN were referred to Monash IVF for preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) because the woman had undergone tubal ligation and the couple wanted to have another child. A test was developed for the causative mutation IVS8+6 T-->G mutation based on minisequencing primer extension that also incorporated the co-analysis of an informative tetranucleotide marker in intron 3 of the HPRT gene to identify allelic dropout. All four biopsied embryos from their first IVF cycle were diagnosed as unaffected, and transfer of two embryos in the cohort with the highest morphological quality resulted in a singleton pregnancy and the birth of a healthy girl. Direct mutation detection by mini-sequencing and parallel analysis of an informative linked marker provides an alternative strategy for molecular diagnosis of point mutations that will have useful application in PGD for other single gene disorders.",

LND cases have never been reported in Indonesia.Case report: A 15-year-old male who had been diagnosed with cerebral palsy was referred to our hospital due to renal failure requiring emergency dialysis. The patient presented with three classic manifestations of LND: increased uric acid levels, neurological disorders, and self-injurious behaviors. LND was suspected because of an abscess-like lump on the left ankle that was confirmed to be a tophus, which had burst and discharged thick masses containing blood, debris, and white crystal materials. The diagnosis of LND was confirmed by the presence of a deletion to exon 1 of the HPRT1 gene. The patient received oral allopurinol daily and treatment for end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which included regular dialysis and subcutaneous administration of erythropoietin. At a 2-month follow-up, he improved clinically with a 71% decrease in uric acid levels after regular dialysis and allopurinol treatment.Conclusion: In developed countries, LND can be diagnosed as early as 3 days after birth. However, diagnosis in the present case was delayed due to the rarity of the disease and the limited number of facilities in Indonesia that offer genetic counseling. Late diagnosis of LND leads to ESRD and irreversible abnormalities. This is the first case of LND presenting with a unique clinical presentation of tophus burst reported in Indonesia.",

Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a genetic disorder of purine metabolism resulting in several abnormalities, one of which is elevated levels of xanthine. The author reasons that elevated plasma xanthine sets off a chain of events that produce excessive endogenous convulsants and diminished endogenous anticonvulsants. Treatment is proposed for self-injury in Lesch-Nyhan that entails reducing production of two endogenous convulsants (kynurenine and quinolinic acid) and enhancing two endogenous anticonvulsants (serotonin and gamma aminobutyric acid).",

Affected boys have mental retardation, delayed development, extrapyramidal motor disturbances and self-injuring behavior. As hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been shown to be effective in several neurodevelopmental inborn errors, we hypothesized that it could be favorable in LNS as well. Following a myeloablative conditioning regimen (busulphan 3.2 mg/kg/day for 4 days, cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg/day for 2 days with ATG Thymoglobin 2.5 mg/kg/day for 4 days) an unrelated umbilical cord blood unit was transfused at the age of 2 years. The graft was a 6/6 HLA-matched at HLA-A, B loci by antigen level, and at DRB1 by allelic level typing. Infused total nucleated cell dose was 3.6 x 10e7 per kilogram body weight. Serum HPRT levels reached normal values by the end of the sixth month post transplant. Slow neurodevelopmental improvement seen during the three-year follow-up and the missing self-injuring behavior can be considered as a proof for the presence of enzyme-competent cells behind the blood-brain barrier.",

Affected boys have mental retardation, delayed development, extrapyramidal motor disturbances and self-injuring behavior. As hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been shown to be effective in several neurodevelopmental inborn errors, we hypothesized that it could be favorable in LNS as well. Following a myeloablative conditioning regimen (busulphan 3.2 mg/kg/day for 4 days, cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg/day for 2 days with ATG Thymoglobin 2.5 mg/kg/day for 4 days) an unrelated umbilical cord blood unit was transfused at the age of 2 years. The graft was a 6/6 HLA-matched at HLA-A, B loci by antigen level, and at DRB1 by allelic level typing. Infused total nucleated cell dose was 3.6 x 10e7 per kilogram body weight. Serum HPRT levels reached normal values by the end of the sixth month post transplant. Slow neurodevelopmental improvement seen during the three-year follow-up and the missing self-injuring behavior can be considered as a proof for the presence of enzyme-competent cells behind the blood-brain barrier.",

LND cases have never been reported in Indonesia.Case report: A 15-year-old male who had been diagnosed with cerebral palsy was referred to our hospital due to renal failure requiring emergency dialysis. The patient presented with three classic manifestations of LND: increased uric acid levels, neurological disorders, and self-injurious behaviors. LND was suspected because of an abscess-like lump on the left ankle that was confirmed to be a tophus, which had burst and discharged thick masses containing blood, debris, and white crystal materials. The diagnosis of LND was confirmed by the presence of a deletion to exon 1 of the HPRT1 gene. The patient received oral allopurinol daily and treatment for end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which included regular dialysis and subcutaneous administration of erythropoietin. At a 2-month follow-up, he improved clinically with a 71% decrease in uric acid levels after regular dialysis and allopurinol treatment.Conclusion: In developed countries, LND can be diagnosed as early as 3 days after birth. However, diagnosis in the present case was delayed due to the rarity of the disease and the limited number of facilities in Indonesia that offer genetic counseling. Late diagnosis of LND leads to ESRD and irreversible abnormalities. This is the first case of LND presenting with a unique clinical presentation of tophus burst reported in Indonesia.",

The aim of this review is to summarize recent research that documents the extended behavioral, neurologic, and neurocognitive phenotype in classic LNS, to describe milder variants of HGprt deficiency that do not self-injure and have less severe neurological and cognitive deficits, and to provide an update on treatment for associated psychiatric and behavioral disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Psychiatric management utilizes combined behavioral and pharmacological treatment in conjunction with protective equipment and dental management to avert self-injury. Pharmacological management focuses on stabilization of mood and anxiety management. S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), a physiological intermediate in methylation and transsulfuration, has shown beneficial effects in carefully selected patients who can tolerate the drug. Deep brain stimulation is shown in several case reports and series to reduce or eliminate self-injury and aggression, and in some cases, modify dystonia. SUMMARY: This review highlights progress in our understanding of the behavioral and neurocognitive phenotype of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (HGprt deficiency) and its variants, describes psychiatric and behavioral management, and discusses prospects for new therapies.",

LND cases have never been reported in Indonesia.Case report: A 15-year-old male who had been diagnosed with cerebral palsy was referred to our hospital due to renal failure requiring emergency dialysis. The patient presented with three classic manifestations of LND: increased uric acid levels, neurological disorders, and self-injurious behaviors. LND was suspected because of an abscess-like lump on the left ankle that was confirmed to be a tophus, which had burst and discharged thick masses containing blood, debris, and white crystal materials. The diagnosis of LND was confirmed by the presence of a deletion to exon 1 of the HPRT1 gene. The patient received oral allopurinol daily and treatment for end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which included regular dialysis and subcutaneous administration of erythropoietin. At a 2-month follow-up, he improved clinically with a 71% decrease in uric acid levels after regular dialysis and allopurinol treatment.Conclusion: In developed countries, LND can be diagnosed as early as 3 days after birth. However, diagnosis in the present case was delayed due to the rarity of the disease and the limited number of facilities in Indonesia that offer genetic counseling. Late diagnosis of LND leads to ESRD and irreversible abnormalities. This is the first case of LND presenting with a unique clinical presentation of tophus burst reported in Indonesia.",

The mechanism behind the severe self-mutilating behavior exhibited by patients with LNS is unknown and remains one of the greatest obstacles in providing care to these patients. This report describes a 10-year-old male child with confirmed LNS who was treated for self-mutilation of his hands, tongue, and lips with repeated botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) injections into the bilateral masseters. Our findings suggest that treatment with BTX-A affects both the central and peripheral nervous systems, resulting in reduced self-abusive behavior in this patient.",

A couple with a boy diagnosed with LN and a history of pregnancy termination was referred to the Hammersmith Hospital. Their affected son was born in 1982 after an uncomplicated pregnancy and vaginal delivery. Eight subsequent pregnancies had been unsuccessful. There were five therapeutic terminations and three spontaneous abortions, one at least directly caused by the sampling procedure during amniocentesis. From 1989 to 1991 two unsuccessful preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) cycles by sexing were performed by DNA amplification. The mutation was characterized and a nested PCR protocol was designed which allowed the efficient amplification of the affected loci followed by the detection of the mutant allele by restriction digestion. Three PGD cycles were performed using this specific diagnostic test before a successful pregnancy was achieved resulting in the birth of a healthy unaffected baby girl.",

LND cases have never been reported in Indonesia.Case report: A 15-year-old male who had been diagnosed with cerebral palsy was referred to our hospital due to renal failure requiring emergency dialysis. The patient presented with three classic manifestations of LND: increased uric acid levels, neurological disorders, and self-injurious behaviors. LND was suspected because of an abscess-like lump on the left ankle that was confirmed to be a tophus, which had burst and discharged thick masses containing blood, debris, and white crystal materials. The diagnosis of LND was confirmed by the presence of a deletion to exon 1 of the HPRT1 gene. The patient received oral allopurinol daily and treatment for end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which included regular dialysis and subcutaneous administration of erythropoietin. At a 2-month follow-up, he improved clinically with a 71% decrease in uric acid levels after regular dialysis and allopurinol treatment.Conclusion: In developed countries, LND can be diagnosed as early as 3 days after birth. However, diagnosis in the present case was delayed due to the rarity of the disease and the limited number of facilities in Indonesia that offer genetic counseling. Late diagnosis of LND leads to ESRD and irreversible abnormalities. This is the first case of LND presenting with a unique clinical presentation of tophus burst reported in Indonesia.",

DEVELOPMENT: Lesch Nyhan syndrome is an X linked inherited disorder of purine metabolism caused by the deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). Clinical features include overproduction of uric acid and a neurologic syndrome related to the severity of the enzyme defect. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with xanthine oxidase inhibitors is effective for the control of the elevated renal excretion of uric acid, but there is no specific treatment for the neurologic symptoms. Due to the low frequency of the syndrome and to the incomplete understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the neurologic manifestations, the treatments employed are merely symptomatic.",

DEVELOPMENT: Lesch Nyhan syndrome is an X linked inherited disorder of purine metabolism caused by the deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). Clinical features include overproduction of uric acid and a neurologic syndrome related to the severity of the enzyme defect. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with xanthine oxidase inhibitors is effective for the control of the elevated renal excretion of uric acid, but there is no specific treatment for the neurologic symptoms. Due to the low frequency of the syndrome and to the incomplete understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the neurologic manifestations, the treatments employed are merely symptomatic.",

The mechanism behind this severe self-mutilating behavior is unknown, and is one of the main challenges in the management of this condition. We here report the case of a 30-year-old man with a confirmed diagnosis of LNS who was successfully treated for self-mutilation of his lips with repeated botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) injections in the facial perioral muscles. Our findings suggest that treatment with BTX-A helped reduce self-abusive behavior in this patient. Our case illustrates that BTX-A injections can be a useful therapeutic approach in patients with self-abusive behavior.",

The disorder is caused by a wide spectrum of mutations distributed throughout the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene. Female carriers of LN display no clinical symptoms but are at 50% risk of passing on the affected gene to their male offspring. A couple who had a boy with LN were referred to Monash IVF for preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) because the woman had undergone tubal ligation and the couple wanted to have another child. A test was developed for the causative mutation IVS8+6 T-->G mutation based on minisequencing primer extension that also incorporated the co-analysis of an informative tetranucleotide marker in intron 3 of the HPRT gene to identify allelic dropout. All four biopsied embryos from their first IVF cycle were diagnosed as unaffected, and transfer of two embryos in the cohort with the highest morphological quality resulted in a singleton pregnancy and the birth of a healthy girl. Direct mutation detection by mini-sequencing and parallel analysis of an informative linked marker provides an alternative strategy for molecular diagnosis of point mutations that will have useful application in PGD for other single gene disorders.",

The immunologic immaturity of cord blood cells confers peculiar characteristics to these hematopoietic precursors. Autopsy reports from January 1, 1988, through June 30, 1998, were searched for patients who had received an umbilical cord blood transplant (UCBT). Thirty-two patients (19 male, 13 female) were identified with a mean age at autopsy of 13.0 years with a range from 1 to 52 years. Most patients (24) underwent UCBT for treatment of a malignant neoplasm, while the remainder were treated for immunodeficiencies (4), Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (2), Hurler syndrome (1), and Diamond-Blackfan syndrome (1). Sixteen patients had at least 1 infectious complication, and 8 patients had multiple infections. Organisms included mycoses (7 patients), viruses (8 patients), bacteria (3 patients), and Toxoplasma (2 patients). Hemorrhagic complications, such as intra-alveolar hemorrhage and gastrointestinal tract hemorrhage, were found in 24 patients. Other frequent findings at autopsy included diffuse alveolar damage (15 patients), hepatic veno-occlusive disease (11 patients), and acute or chronic graft-vs-host disease (9 patients).

RECENT FINDINGS: Psychiatric management utilizes combined behavioral and pharmacological treatment in conjunction with protective equipment and dental management to avert self-injury. Pharmacological management focuses on stabilization of mood and anxiety management. S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), a physiological intermediate in methylation and transsulfuration, has shown beneficial effects in carefully selected patients who can tolerate the drug.

The immunologic immaturity of cord blood cells confers peculiar characteristics to these hematopoietic precursors. Autopsy reports from January 1, 1988, through June 30, 1998, were searched for patients who had received an umbilical cord blood transplant (UCBT). Thirty-two patients (19 male, 13 female) were identified with a mean age at autopsy of 13.0 years with a range from 1 to 52 years. Most patients (24) underwent UCBT for treatment of a malignant neoplasm, while the remainder were treated for immunodeficiencies (4), Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (2), Hurler syndrome (1), and Diamond-Blackfan syndrome (1). Sixteen patients had at least 1 infectious complication, and 8 patients had multiple infections. Organisms included mycoses (7 patients), viruses (8 patients), bacteria (3 patients), and Toxoplasma (2 patients). Hemorrhagic complications, such as intra-alveolar hemorrhage and gastrointestinal tract hemorrhage, were found in 24 patients. Other frequent findings at autopsy included diffuse alveolar damage (15 patients), hepatic veno-occlusive disease (11 patients), and acute or chronic graft-vs-host disease (9 patients). Patients who have received UCBT represent a unique population of immunosuppressed patients. Infectious and hemorrhagic complications frequently are encountered at autopsy, and pathologists performing autopsies on these patients should be alert to unusual pathogens.",

Bronchoscopy revealed tracheomalacia of the cresent moon type. He lost his weight, and his general condition gradually worsened. Four months post-tracheostomy, he died of massive hemoptysis from a tracheobrachicephalic artery fistula. Many patients with LNS have renal failure and pneumonitis, whereas occasional cases are complicated by convulsions, recurrent coma, abnormalities of respiration, and sudden death. The etiology of sudden death is not clear. Although tracheomalacia, to our knowledge, has not been described in the literature, it may be a clinical feature of LNS associated with abnormal respiration and sudden death. Tracheobrachiocephalic artery fistula is common in patients with neuromuscular disorders and a chronic tracheostomy tube. Caution is required in LNS patients with opisthotonic extensor spasms of the neck and trunk, chronic bronchitis, and malnutrition.",

The aim of this review is to summarize recent research that documents the extended behavioral, neurologic, and neurocognitive phenotype in classic LNS, to describe milder variants of HGprt deficiency that do not self-injure and have less severe neurological and cognitive deficits, and to provide an update on treatment for associated psychiatric and behavioral disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Psychiatric management utilizes combined behavioral and pharmacological treatment in conjunction with protective equipment and dental management to avert self-injury. Pharmacological management focuses on stabilization of mood and anxiety management. S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), a physiological intermediate in methylation and transsulfuration, has shown beneficial effects in carefully selected patients who can tolerate the drug. Deep brain stimulation is shown in several case reports and series to reduce or eliminate self-injury and aggression, and in some cases, modify dystonia. SUMMARY: This review highlights progress in our understanding of the behavioral and neurocognitive phenotype of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (HGprt deficiency) and its variants, describes psychiatric and behavioral management, and discusses prospects for new therapies.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a rare and debilitating condition characterized by dystonia and self-mutilating behavior. In order to shed light on the pathophysiology of dystonia, we report the pallidal electrophysiological activity recorded in two patients during deep brain stimulation surgery (DBS). METHODS: Microrecordings were performed on 162 neurons along four tracks aimed at the right and left anterior (limbic) and posterior (motor) globus pallidus internus (GPI). RESULTS: Regardless of the anesthetic agent used (propofol or sevoflurane), both patients showed similar neurons firing rates in the four regions studied, namely the limbic and motor portions of the globus pallidus externus (GPE) or GPI. In both patients, firing rates were similar in the GPE (12.2+/-1.8 Hz, N=38) and GPI (13.2+/-1.0 Hz, N=83) portions of the limbic track, while the motor GPE fired at a higher frequency (23.8+/-2.7 Hz, N=18) than the motor GPI (12.5+/-1.4 Hz, N=23). CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that light propofol or sevoflurane anesthesia influences pallidal activity in a similar way. Electrophysiological recordings suggest that Lesch-Nyhan syndrome might be characterized by analogous firing frequencies in the limbic GPE and GPI while motor GPE would tend to fire at higher rate than the motor GPI. It is therefore tempting to suggest that the symptoms that are observed in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome might result from motor GPI inhibition. SIGNIFICANCE: This observation may confirm the Albin and Delong's model of the basal nuclei in hypokinetic and hyperkinetic disorders.",

To shed light on this complex issue, we have taken the opportunity to record the response of globus pallidus internus (GPi) neurones to 100 Hz stimulations in a case of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS) where four pallidal electrodes were implanted. Three types of response were observed, 2/19 neurones were unaffected by DBS. About 7/19 neurones were inhibited during DBS stimulation and 10/19 neurones were excited during DBS stimulation. Both effects ceased when DBS was turned off. Inhibited neurones were situated lower that exited ones on the trajectory (1.25 and 4.65 mm above the center of GPi respectively). These observations suggest that locally DBS induces a reversible inhibition of neurone firing rate while at the same time distantly exciting the main afferents to and/or efferents from the GPi. Both actions would result in a strong GPi inhibition that does not preclude increased outflow from the GPi.",

We applied a double bilateral simultaneous stimulation to limbic and motor internal pallidum in one patient for controlling both behavioral and movement disorders, respectively. The injurious compulsions disappeared; dystonia and dyskinesia were decreased at 28 months follow-up.",

Some cases have reported clinical results of DBS in LNS thus far. This systematic review was conducted to comprehensively summarize cases of LNS treated with DBS and evaluate the efficacy and safety of DBS in LNS. Eight publications covering 12 LNS patients were included in this review. DBS improved dystonia of the LNS to varying degrees. All the included cases achieved partial or complete control of self-injurious behavior (SIB). Overall, DBS is a promising treatment for both motor and behavior disorders of LNS patients, but the results reported thus far have varied widely, especially for motor outcomes. The ultimate clinical benefits in LNS patients were still unpredictable. DBS-related complications were rather common, which raised questions about the safety of the procedure in LNS. More research is needed to further clarify the safety and effectiveness of this treatment.",

Bronchoscopy revealed tracheomalacia of the cresent moon type. He lost his weight, and his general condition gradually worsened. Four months post-tracheostomy, he died of massive hemoptysis from a tracheobrachicephalic artery fistula. Many patients with LNS have renal failure and pneumonitis, whereas occasional cases are complicated by convulsions, recurrent coma, abnormalities of respiration, and sudden death. The etiology of sudden death is not clear. Although tracheomalacia, to our knowledge, has not been described in the literature, it may be a clinical feature of LNS associated with abnormal respiration and sudden death. Tracheobrachiocephalic artery fistula is common in patients with neuromuscular disorders and a chronic tracheostomy tube. Caution is required in LNS patients with opisthotonic extensor spasms of the neck and trunk, chronic bronchitis, and malnutrition.",

A couple with a boy diagnosed with LN and a history of pregnancy termination was referred to the Hammersmith Hospital. Their affected son was born in 1982 after an uncomplicated pregnancy and vaginal delivery. Eight subsequent pregnancies had been unsuccessful. There were five therapeutic terminations and three spontaneous abortions, one at least directly caused by the sampling procedure during amniocentesis. From 1989 to 1991 two unsuccessful preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) cycles by sexing were performed by DNA amplification. The mutation was characterized and a nested PCR protocol was designed which allowed the efficient amplification of the affected loci followed by the detection of the mutant allele by restriction digestion. Three PGD cycles were performed using this specific diagnostic test before a successful pregnancy was achieved resulting in the birth of a healthy unaffected baby girl.",
