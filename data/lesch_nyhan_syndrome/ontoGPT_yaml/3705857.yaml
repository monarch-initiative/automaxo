input_text: '[Pathogenetic mechanisms and therapy of a subclinical form of Lesch-Nyhan
  syndrome]. The results of clinical, experimental psychological and biochemical studies
  of patients with a subclinical form of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome suggested a reduction
  of the inhibitory influence of the caudate nucleus due to incomplete genetic defect
  of Hg-PRTase and related disorders of other types of metabolism in the area of basal
  ganglia as one of the links of pathogenesis. The pathogenetic therapy is based on
  maintaining high activity of Hg-PRTase by dietary treatment with limited intake
  of exogenous purines.'
