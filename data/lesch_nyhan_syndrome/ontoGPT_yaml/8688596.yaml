input_text: 'Preimplantation diagnosis of inherited disease by embryo biopsy: an update
  of the world figures. PURPOSE: Cleavage stage embryo biopsy and preimplantation
  diagnosis was first reported five years ago. The annual collation of the world figures
  for centres offering this procedure is important to continually assess the efficiency
  and success of the biopsy, diagnosis and pregnancies obtained. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
  Data was collected from 14 centres worldwide. The largest series of diagnosis has
  been performed for those patients carrying X-linked disease where the embryos have
  been sexed either by PCR or FISH. PCR has also been used for the specific diagnosis
  of a number of single gene defects, mainly for cystic fibrosis but also for the
  diagnosis of Lesch Nyhan syndrome, Fragile X, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Tay Sachs,
  haemophilia and RhD blood typing. RESULTS: For PCR sexing, a total of 62 cycles
  have been performed with 14 pregnancies, 8 deliveries and 11 babies born. For FISH
  sexing, 70 cycles have resulted in 15 pregnancies, 8 deliveries and 11 babies born.
  For the specific diagnosis of single genes defects, a total of 65 cycles resulted
  in 21 pregnancies, 12 deliveries and 12 babies born. Overall, 197 cycles were performed,
  with 171 embryo transfers (86%), 50 pregnancies (25% per cycle, 29% per transfer),
  28 deliveries and 34 babies born. CONCLUSIONS: New methods are being developed to
  increase the scope of preimplantation diagnoses that can be offered. From next year,
  the biochemical and miscarriage rates will also be recorded.'
