input_text: Preimplantation diagnosis of deficiency of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl
  transferase in a mouse model for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Male mice embryos deficient
  in hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT), derived from heterozygous (carrier)
  females and normal males, were diagnosed by biochemical microassay of HPRT activity
  in a single cell isolated from the eight-cell preimplantation embryo. The sampled
  embryos were transferred to recipient mothers and examined on the 14th day of gestation
  to confirm the accuracy of the preimplantation diagnosis. The diagnosis was sufficiently
  rapid that freezing of the embryos before transfer was not necessary. Of the embryos
  diagnosed as HPRT negative all 4 that grew into fetuses were correctly identified
  as HPRT-deficient males.
