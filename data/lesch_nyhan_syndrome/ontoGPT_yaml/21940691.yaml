input_text: 'Pallidal deep-brain stimulation associated with complete remission of
  self-injurious behaviors in a patient with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome: a case report.
  The purpose of this case report is to review the management of a boy with Lesch-Nyhan
  syndrome with deep-brain stimulation who had remission of self-injurious behaviors
  as a result. This patient was treated with intrathecal baclofen and, later, with
  deep-brain stimulation to reduce hypertonia. Goals were to improve wheelchair positioning
  for school attendance and to reduce the use of restraints for comfort. Intrathecal
  baclofen was implanted twice and decreased the hypertonia, but both were explanted
  because of infection. Deep-brain stimulation was initiated 2.5 years ago, and since
  that time, comfort and function have improved and caregiver burden has decreased.
  Improvements in dystonia with deep-brain stimulation have also occurred, and self-injurious
  behaviors have resolved.'
