input_text: "Electrophysiological characteristics of limbic and motor globus pallidus
  internus (GPI) neurons in two cases of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. OBJECTIVE: Lesch-Nyhan
  syndrome is a rare and debilitating condition characterized by dystonia and self-mutilating
  behavior. In order to shed light on the pathophysiology of dystonia, we report the
  pallidal electrophysiological activity recorded in two patients during deep brain
  stimulation surgery (DBS). METHODS: Microrecordings were performed on 162 neurons
  along four tracks aimed at the right and left anterior (limbic) and posterior (motor)
  globus pallidus internus (GPI). RESULTS: Regardless of the anesthetic agent used
  (propofol or sevoflurane), both patients showed similar neurons firing rates in
  the four regions studied, namely the limbic and motor portions of the globus pallidus
  externus (GPE) or GPI. In both patients, firing rates were similar in the GPE (12.2+/-1.8
  Hz, N=38) and GPI (13.2+/-1.0 Hz, N=83) portions of the limbic track, while the
  motor GPE fired at a higher frequency (23.8+/-2.7 Hz, N=18) than the motor GPI (12.5+/-1.4
  Hz, N=23). CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that light propofol or sevoflurane
  anesthesia influences pallidal activity in a similar way. Electrophysiological recordings
  suggest that Lesch-Nyhan syndrome might be characterized by analogous firing frequencies
  in the limbic GPE and GPI while motor GPE would tend to fire at higher rate than
  the motor GPI. It is therefore tempting to suggest that the symptoms that are observed
  in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome might result from motor GPI inhibition. SIGNIFICANCE: This
  observation may confirm the Albin and Delong's model of the basal nuclei in hypokinetic
  and hyperkinetic disorders."
