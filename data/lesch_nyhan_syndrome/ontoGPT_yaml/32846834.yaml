input_text: 'Delayed emergence from propofol anesthesia in a patient with Lesch-Nyhan
  syndrome: A case report. RATIONALE: Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS) is an X-linked recessive
  disorder presenting with uric acid overproduction, neurocognitive disability, and
  behavioral disturbances. Inhalational anesthesia has been frequently used in LNS
  patients undergoing surgery. Characteristic compulsive self-injurious behavior and
  high risk of emesis may hinder inhalational induction. Propofol may be beneficial
  for these patients because of its easy and rapid titration for anesthetic depth
  during induction, early recovery from anesthesia, and antiemetic effect as well
  as uricosuric effect. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 16-year-old male adolescent was scheduled
  for percutaneous nephrolithotomy. He exhibited poorly controlled muscle, self-injurious
  behaviors and intellectual disability. DIAGNOSIS: The patient presented with neurodevelopmental
  delay in the first year of life, and was diagnosed with LNS, with a substitution
  of phenylalanine to leucine in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT)
  1 gene on the X-chromosome at 3 years of age. INTERVENTIONS: Total intravenous anesthesia
  was used for induction and maintenance of anesthesia with propofol and remifentanil
  using target-controlled infusion. OUTCOMES: Time to recovery of consciousness was
  prolonged after uneventful surgery. Serum uric acid levels gradually increased during
  postoperative period. LESSONS: Propofol anesthesia using target-controlled infusion
  does not provide significant clinical advantages in rapid emergence from anesthesia
  and management of hyperuricemia in LNS patients undergoing urological surgery.'
