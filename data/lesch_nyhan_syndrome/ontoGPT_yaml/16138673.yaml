input_text: Botulinum toxin as a novel treatment for self-mutilation in Lesch-Nyhan
  syndrome. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS) is an X-linked recessive disorder resulting
  from a deficiency of the metabolic enzyme hypozanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase
  (HPRT). This syndrome presents with abnormal metabolic and neurological manifestations
  including hyperuricemia, mental retardation*, spastic cerebral palsy (CP), dystonia,
  and self-mutilation. The mechanism behind the severe self-mutilating behavior exhibited
  by patients with LNS is unknown and remains one of the greatest obstacles in providing
  care to these patients. This report describes a 10-year-old male child with confirmed
  LNS who was treated for self-mutilation of his hands, tongue, and lips with repeated
  botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) injections into the bilateral masseters. Our findings
  suggest that treatment with BTX-A affects both the central and peripheral nervous
  systems, resulting in reduced self-abusive behavior in this patient.
