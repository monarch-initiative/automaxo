input_text: Successful unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation in Lesch-Nyhan
  syndrome. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS) is a chronic, progressive neurodevelopmental
  disorder causing motor and behavioral dysfunction due to decreased synthesis of
  the enzyme hypoxantine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). Affected boys have
  mental retardation, delayed development, extrapyramidal motor disturbances and self-injuring
  behavior. As hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been shown to be
  effective in several neurodevelopmental inborn errors, we hypothesized that it could
  be favorable in LNS as well. Following a myeloablative conditioning regimen (busulphan
  3.2 mg/kg/day for 4 days, cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg/day for 2 days with ATG Thymoglobin
  2.5 mg/kg/day for 4 days) an unrelated umbilical cord blood unit was transfused
  at the age of 2 years. The graft was a 6/6 HLA-matched at HLA-A, B loci by antigen
  level, and at DRB1 by allelic level typing. Infused total nucleated cell dose was
  3.6 x 10e7 per kilogram body weight. Serum HPRT levels reached normal values by
  the end of the sixth month post transplant. Slow neurodevelopmental improvement
  seen during the three-year follow-up and the missing self-injuring behavior can
  be considered as a proof for the presence of enzyme-competent cells behind the blood-brain
  barrier.
