input_text: 'Gout and the risk of advanced chronic kidney disease in the UK health
  system: a national cohort study. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the association between gout
  and risk of advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). DESIGN: Retrospective matched
  cohort study. SETTING: UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink. PARTICIPANTS: The
  analysis included data for 68 897 patients with gout and 554 964 matched patients
  without gout. Patients were aged >=18 years, registered at UK practices, had >=12
  months of clinical data and had data linked with Hospital Episode Statistics. Patients
  were excluded for history of advanced CKD, juvenile gout, cancer, HIV, tumour lysis
  syndrome, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome or familial Mediterranean fever. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY
  OUTCOME MEASURES: Advanced CKD was defined as first occurrence of: (1) dialysis,
  kidney transplant, diagnosis of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) or stage 5 CKD (diagnostic
  codes in Read system or International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision);
  (2) estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <10 mL/min/1.73 m2; (3) doubling
  of serum creatinine from baseline and (4) death associated with CKD. RESULTS: Advanced
  CKD incidence was higher for patients with gout (8.54 per 1000 patient-years; 95%
  CI 8.26 to 8.83) versus without gout (4.08; 95% CI 4.00 to 4.16). Gout was associated
  with higher advanced CKD risk in both unadjusted analysis (HR, 2.00; 95% CI 1.92
  to 2.07) and after adjustment (HR, 1.29; 95% CI 1.23 to 1.35). Association was strongest
  for ESKD (HR, 2.13; 95% CI 1.73 to 2.61) and was present for eGFR <10 mL/min/1.73
  m2 (HR, 1.45; 95% CI 1.30 to 1.61) and serum creatinine doubling (HR, 1.13; 95%
  CI 1.08 to 1.19) but not CKD-associated death (HR, 1.14; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.31). Association
  of gout with advanced CKD was replicated in propensity-score matched analysis (HR,
  1.23; 95% CI 1.17 to 1.29) and analysis limited to patients with incident gout (HR,
  1.28; 95% CI 1.22 to 1.35). CONCLUSIONS: Gout is associated with elevated risk of
  CKD progression. Future studies should investigate whether controlling gout is protective
  and reduces CKD risk.'
