input_text: 'Prevention of self-mutilation in patients with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome:
  review of literature. There have been no standard methods established to prevent
  the self-mutilation seen in LNS. Preventive treatment must be developed, therefore,
  for each patient based on clinical findings. The first method to be utilized should
  be a nonsurgical splint or mouth guard. If it proves to be unsuccessful then the
  benefits of surgical procedures should be considered. In the future, the use of
  medication, such as carbamazepine, may prove to restructure the current approach
  advocated by the literature today.'
