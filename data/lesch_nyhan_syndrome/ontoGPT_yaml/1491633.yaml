input_text: Serotonin-GABA treatment is hypothesized for self-injury in Lesch-Nyhan
  syndrome. The self-injurious movements of Lesch-Nyhan patients are considered extremely
  severe and currently intractable. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a genetic disorder of
  purine metabolism resulting in several abnormalities, one of which is elevated levels
  of xanthine. The author reasons that elevated plasma xanthine sets off a chain of
  events that produce excessive endogenous convulsants and diminished endogenous anticonvulsants.
  Treatment is proposed for self-injury in Lesch-Nyhan that entails reducing production
  of two endogenous convulsants (kynurenine and quinolinic acid) and enhancing two
  endogenous anticonvulsants (serotonin and gamma aminobutyric acid).
