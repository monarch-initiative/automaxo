input_text: Urine alkalinization may be enough for the treatment of bilateral renal
  pelvis stones associated with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a rare
  sex-linked disorder of purine metabolism that is caused by a mutation in the hypoxanthine-guanine
  phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene which causes marked hyperuricemia and hyperuricosuria,
  with signs of gouty arthritis and uric acid stone disease in early childhood. We
  report a case of renal pelvis calculi which was dissolved within 10 days of urine
  alkalinization and hydration.
