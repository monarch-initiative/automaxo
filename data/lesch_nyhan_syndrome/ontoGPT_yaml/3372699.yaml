input_text: Pre-implantation diagnosis of HPRT-deficient male and carrier female mouse
  embryos by trophectoderm biopsy. In an animal model for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, the
  affected male embryos, as well as the carrier female embryos, have been successfully
  identified by biochemical microassay of a sample of trophectoderm cells taken from
  the mouse embryos at the blastocyst stage. The embryos were removed from the uterus,
  diagnosed and returned to the uterus within 2 days without the need for cryopreservation.
  The diagnosis was confirmed at 14 days gestation by analysis of the hypoxanthine
  phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) status of the fetuses. Live young were obtained
  from biopsied embryos after transfer.
