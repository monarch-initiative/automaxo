input_text: 'Lesch-Nyhan syndrome and its variants: examining the behavioral and neurocognitive
  phenotype. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome (LNS) is a metabolic disorder
  involving mutations in the HGPRT1 gene that result in hyperuricemia, intellectual
  disability, a dystonic movement disorder, and compulsive self-injury with self-mutilation.
  The aim of this review is to summarize recent research that documents the extended
  behavioral, neurologic, and neurocognitive phenotype in classic LNS, to describe
  milder variants of HGprt deficiency that do not self-injure and have less severe
  neurological and cognitive deficits, and to provide an update on treatment for associated
  psychiatric and behavioral disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Psychiatric management utilizes
  combined behavioral and pharmacological treatment in conjunction with protective
  equipment and dental management to avert self-injury. Pharmacological management
  focuses on stabilization of mood and anxiety management. S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe),
  a physiological intermediate in methylation and transsulfuration, has shown beneficial
  effects in carefully selected patients who can tolerate the drug. Deep brain stimulation
  is shown in several case reports and series to reduce or eliminate self-injury and
  aggression, and in some cases, modify dystonia. SUMMARY: This review highlights
  progress in our understanding of the behavioral and neurocognitive phenotype of
  Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (HGprt deficiency) and its variants, describes psychiatric
  and behavioral management, and discusses prospects for new therapies.'
