input_text: Preimplantation diagnosis of Lesch-Nyhan using mini-sequencing primer
  extension. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LN) is a severe X-linked disorder of males characterized
  by hyperuricaemia, choreoathetosis, spasticity, mental retardation and self-mutilation.
  The disorder is caused by a wide spectrum of mutations distributed throughout the
  hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene. Female carriers of LN display
  no clinical symptoms but are at 50% risk of passing on the affected gene to their
  male offspring. A couple who had a boy with LN were referred to Monash IVF for preimplantation
  genetic diagnosis (PGD) because the woman had undergone tubal ligation and the couple
  wanted to have another child. A test was developed for the causative mutation IVS8+6
  T-->G mutation based on minisequencing primer extension that also incorporated the
  co-analysis of an informative tetranucleotide marker in intron 3 of the HPRT gene
  to identify allelic dropout. All four biopsied embryos from their first IVF cycle
  were diagnosed as unaffected, and transfer of two embryos in the cohort with the
  highest morphological quality resulted in a singleton pregnancy and the birth of
  a healthy girl. Direct mutation detection by mini-sequencing and parallel analysis
  of an informative linked marker provides an alternative strategy for molecular diagnosis
  of point mutations that will have useful application in PGD for other single gene
  disorders.
