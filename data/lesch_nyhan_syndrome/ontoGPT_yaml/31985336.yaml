input_text: 'Late diagnosis of Lesch-Nyhan disease complicated with end-stage renal
  disease and tophi burst: a case report. Background: Lesch-Nyhan disease (LND) is
  a rare X-linked recessive inborn error of purine metabolism. Late diagnosis of LND
  may cause significant morbidity. LND cases have never been reported in Indonesia.Case
  report: A 15-year-old male who had been diagnosed with cerebral palsy was referred
  to our hospital due to renal failure requiring emergency dialysis. The patient presented
  with three classic manifestations of LND: increased uric acid levels, neurological
  disorders, and self-injurious behaviors. LND was suspected because of an abscess-like
  lump on the left ankle that was confirmed to be a tophus, which had burst and discharged
  thick masses containing blood, debris, and white crystal materials. The diagnosis
  of LND was confirmed by the presence of a deletion to exon 1 of the HPRT1 gene.
  The patient received oral allopurinol daily and treatment for end-stage renal disease
  (ESRD), which included regular dialysis and subcutaneous administration of erythropoietin.
  At a 2-month follow-up, he improved clinically with a 71% decrease in uric acid
  levels after regular dialysis and allopurinol treatment.Conclusion: In developed
  countries, LND can be diagnosed as early as 3 days after birth. However, diagnosis
  in the present case was delayed due to the rarity of the disease and the limited
  number of facilities in Indonesia that offer genetic counseling. Late diagnosis
  of LND leads to ESRD and irreversible abnormalities. This is the first case of LND
  presenting with a unique clinical presentation of tophus burst reported in Indonesia.'
