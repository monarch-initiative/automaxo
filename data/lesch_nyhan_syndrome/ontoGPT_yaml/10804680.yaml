input_text: A review of behavioral treatments used for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Lesch-Nyhan
  syndrome is a genetic disorder resulting in hyperuricemia, choreoathetosis, mental
  retardation, and self-mutilation. The most salient feature of this disorder is the
  self-injurious behavior (SIB). Although the utility of behavioral interventions
  with SIB has been well documented, behavioral interventions with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome
  have been limited in number and long-term success. This article reviews the behavioral
  treatments that have been used in treating individuals with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome
  and discusses the strengths and weaknesses of these methods. Suggestions for future
  directions in the use of behavioral interventions for controlling SIB in Lesch-Nyhan
  syndrome are provided.
