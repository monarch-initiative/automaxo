input_text: '[Treatment of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome]. AIM: We have reviewed the treatments
  employed to alleviate the different manifestations of the Lesch Nyhan syndrome,
  the adverse reactions related to these treatments, and the prospectives of future
  therapeutic approaches now under active research. DEVELOPMENT: Lesch Nyhan syndrome
  is an X linked inherited disorder of purine metabolism caused by the deficiency
  of the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). Clinical features
  include overproduction of uric acid and a neurologic syndrome related to the severity
  of the enzyme defect. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with xanthine oxidase inhibitors is
  effective for the control of the elevated renal excretion of uric acid, but there
  is no specific treatment for the neurologic symptoms. Due to the low frequency of
  the syndrome and to the incomplete understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms
  underlying the neurologic manifestations, the treatments employed are merely symptomatic.'
