input_text: Preimplantation genetic diagnosis of inherited disease. Research on diagnosis
  of inherited disease in human embryo before implantation was initiated to help those
  couples who would prefer to select embryos at this stage rather than during pregnancy.
  Following in vitro fertilization (IVF), one to two cells were removed from 3 day
  cleavage stage embryo and cells were analysed for genetic defects. Embryos diagnosed
  as unaffected were returned to the uterus and thus the resulting pregnancies were
  assured to be normal. First babies born after the preimplantation diagnosis were
  using DNA amplification of Y-linked sequences by PCR to avoid X-linked disease.
  Several pregnancies were obtained by identifying sex of embryos using dual fluorescent
  in situ hybridization (FISH) with fluorochrome labelled DNA sequences specific for
  X- and Y-chromosomes to interphase nuclei. Development of single cell PCR for single
  gene defects led to diagnose several genetic disorders. Preimplantation diagnosis
  was successfully achieved for predominant delta 508 deletion causing cystic fibrosis,
  and pregnancies were also diagnosed for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, Tay-Sachs and Duchenne
  muscular dystrophy.
