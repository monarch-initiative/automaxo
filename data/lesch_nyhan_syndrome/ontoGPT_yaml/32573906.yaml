input_text: "Deep Brain Stimulation of the Internal Pallidum in Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome:
  Clinical Outcomes and Connectivity Analysis. BACKGROUND: Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS)
  is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine
  phosphoribosyltransferase enzyme. It manifests during infancy with compulsive self-mutilation
  behavior associated with disabling generalized dystonia and dyskinesia. Clinical
  management of these patients poses an enormous challenge for medical teams and carers.
  OBJECTIVES: We report our experience with bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS)
  of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) in the management of this complex disorder.
  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Preoperative and postoperative functional assessment data
  prospectively collected by a multidisciplinary pediatric complex motor disorders
  team, including imaging, neuropsychology, and neurophysiology evaluations were analyzed
  with regards to motor and behavioral control, goal achievement, and patient and
  caregivers' expectations. RESULTS: Four male patients (mean age 13 years) underwent
  DBS implantation between 2011 and 2018. Three patients received double bilateral
  DBS electrodes within the posteroventral GPi and the anteromedial GPi, whereas one
  patient had bilateral electrodes placed in the posteroventral GPi only. Median follow-up
  was 47.5 months (range 22-98 months). Functional improvement was observed in all
  patients and discussed in relation to previous reports. Analysis of structural connectivity
  revealed significant correlation between the involvement of specific cortical regions
  and clinical outcome. CONCLUSION: Combined bilateral stimulation of the anteromedial
  and posteroventral GPi may be considered as an option for managing refractory dystonia
  and self-harm behavior in LNS patients. A multidisciplinary team-based approach
  is essential for patient selection and management, to support children and families,
  to achieve functional improvement and alleviate the overall disease burden for patients
  and caregivers."
