input_text: Use of propofol anesthesia during outpatient radiographic imaging studies
  in patients with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a rare, x-linked,
  recessive disorder of purine metabolism resulting in hyperuricemia, spasticity,
  choreoathetosis, dystonia, self-injurious behavior, and aggression, without significant
  cognitive impairment. Anesthetic management of inpatients who demonstrate classic
  manifestations of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome and require surgical interventions have been
  described. There are no guidelines in the literature addressing the anesthetic management
  of the outpatient with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Specifically, sudden, unexplained death,
  abnormalities in respiration, apnea, severe bradycardia, and an increased incidence
  of vomiting and chronic pulmonary aspiration may preclude this patient population
  from receiving anesthesia for outpatient procedures. General anesthesia with spontaneous
  ventilation was performed for diagnostic, radiographic imaging in 11 outpatients
  with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome using intravenous propofol. A bolus dose of 1.5 to 2.0
  mg/kg propofol was followed by maintenance doses of 60 to 160 mcg/kg/min. Results
  during and following sedation indicated end-tidal carbon dioxide ranges between
  34 mmHg and 59 mmHg. Respiratory rates were never below 10 breaths/min and no partial/complete
  airway obstruction or labored breathing was clinically evident. Hemodynamics were
  within 30% of presedation values. No patient demonstrated nausea, vomiting, or pulmonary
  aspiration. Baseline neuropsychologic status was achieved following sedation, and
  patients were discharged from the hospital 35 to 90 minutes after sedation was completed.
  Potential risks and benefits of using propofol in this patient population are discussed.
