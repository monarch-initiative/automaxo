input_text: 'Deep brain stimulation in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome: a systematic review.
  Given the good results of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the treatment of movement
  disorders, DBS was initially tried to treat Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS) with the
  aim to alleviate LNS-related dystonia. Some cases have reported clinical results
  of DBS in LNS thus far. This systematic review was conducted to comprehensively
  summarize cases of LNS treated with DBS and evaluate the efficacy and safety of
  DBS in LNS. Eight publications covering 12 LNS patients were included in this review.
  DBS improved dystonia of the LNS to varying degrees. All the included cases achieved
  partial or complete control of self-injurious behavior (SIB). Overall, DBS is a
  promising treatment for both motor and behavior disorders of LNS patients, but the
  results reported thus far have varied widely, especially for motor outcomes. The
  ultimate clinical benefits in LNS patients were still unpredictable. DBS-related
  complications were rather common, which raised questions about the safety of the
  procedure in LNS. More research is needed to further clarify the safety and effectiveness
  of this treatment.'
