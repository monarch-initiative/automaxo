input_text: Adenoviruses encoding HPRT correct biochemical abnormalities of HPRT-deficient
  cells and allow their survival in negative selection medium. The Lesch-Nyhan syndrome
  is an X-linked disorder caused by a virtually complete absence of the key enzyme
  of purine recycling, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). It is
  characterized by uric acid overproduction and severe neurological dysfunction. No
  treatment is yet available for the latter symptoms. A possible long-term solution
  is gene therapy, and recombinant adenoviruses have been proposed as vectors for
  gene transfer into postmitotic neuronal cells. We have constructed an adenoviral
  vector expressing the human HPRT cDNA under the transcriptional control of a short
  human cytomegalovirus major immediate early promoter (RAd-HPRT). Here we show that
  infection of human 1306, HPRT-negative cells with RAd-HPRT, expressed high enough
  levels of HPRT enzyme activity, as to reverse their abnormal biochemical phenotype,
  thus enhancing hypoxanthine incorporation and restoring purine recycling, increasing
  GTP levels, decreasing adenine incorporation, and allowing cell survival in HAT
  medium in which only cells expressing high levels of HPRT can survive. Infection
  of murine STO cells, increased hypoxanthine incorporation and restored purine recycling,
  thus allowing cell survival in HAT medium, and reduced de novo purine synthesis.
  Although both cells were able to survive in HAT medium post infection with RAd-HPRT,
  some of the biochemical consequences differed. In summary, even though adenoviral
  vectors do not integrate into the genome of target HPRT-deficient human or murine
  cells, RAd-HPRT mediated enzyme replacement corrects abnormal purine metabolism,
  increases intracellular GTP levels, and allows cells to survive in a negative selection
  medium.
