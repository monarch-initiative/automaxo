input_text: Opposite effects of internal globus pallidus stimulation on pallidal neurones
  activity. Besides clinical efficacy, the mechanisms of action of deep brain stimulation
  (DBS) are still debated. To shed light on this complex issue, we have taken the
  opportunity to record the response of globus pallidus internus (GPi) neurones to
  100 Hz stimulations in a case of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS) where four pallidal
  electrodes were implanted. Three types of response were observed, 2/19 neurones
  were unaffected by DBS. About 7/19 neurones were inhibited during DBS stimulation
  and 10/19 neurones were excited during DBS stimulation. Both effects ceased when
  DBS was turned off. Inhibited neurones were situated lower that exited ones on the
  trajectory (1.25 and 4.65 mm above the center of GPi respectively). These observations
  suggest that locally DBS induces a reversible inhibition of neurone firing rate
  while at the same time distantly exciting the main afferents to and/or efferents
  from the GPi. Both actions would result in a strong GPi inhibition that does not
  preclude increased outflow from the GPi.
