input_text: Successful preimplantation genetic diagnosis for sex Link Lesch--Nyhan
  Syndrome using specific diagnosis. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LN) is a severe X-linked
  recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl
  transferase (HRT). Clinical features displayed by affected boys are particularly
  severe and disturbing and include hyperuricaemia, Characteristic neurological features
  including self-mutilation, choreothetosis, spasticity and mental retardation. A
  couple with a boy diagnosed with LN and a history of pregnancy termination was referred
  to the Hammersmith Hospital. Their affected son was born in 1982 after an uncomplicated
  pregnancy and vaginal delivery. Eight subsequent pregnancies had been unsuccessful.
  There were five therapeutic terminations and three spontaneous abortions, one at
  least directly caused by the sampling procedure during amniocentesis. From 1989
  to 1991 two unsuccessful preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) cycles by sexing
  were performed by DNA amplification. The mutation was characterized and a nested
  PCR protocol was designed which allowed the efficient amplification of the affected
  loci followed by the detection of the mutant allele by restriction digestion. Three
  PGD cycles were performed using this specific diagnostic test before a successful
  pregnancy was achieved resulting in the birth of a healthy unaffected baby girl.
