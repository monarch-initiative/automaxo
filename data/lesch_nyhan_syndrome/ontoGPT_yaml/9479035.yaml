input_text: Cross-sensitization between footshock stress and apomorphine on self-injurious
  behavior and neostriatal catecholamines in a rat model of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.
  The effects of footshock sensitization (priming), apomorphine (APO) priming and
  their combination on behavior and neostriatal and cortical catecholamines were examined
  in adult rats which had neonatally received bilateral intracerebroventricular injections
  with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA; a model of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS)) or vehicle
  (unlesioned rats). Lesioned (6-OHDA-treated) rats displayed self-biting (SB; 7/20
  rats) and self-injurious behavior (SIB; 1/20 rats) during APO priming, but not during
  footshock priming. During subsequent acute cumulative APO dosing, 20-30% of lesioned
  rats primed with APO alone or footshock alone displayed SB and SIB. However, SB
  and SIB incidence in APO+footshock-primed lesioned rats was nearly tripled. Dopamine
  (DA) synthesis, metabolism and extracellular concentrations (disposition) in unlesioned
  rats and in cortices of lesioned animals were unaffected by priming. In lesioned
  rats primed with APO alone or footshock alone, only neostriatal 3-methoxytyramine
  (3-MT) was significantly increased. However, neostriatal DA and metabolite concentrations
  (and norepinephrine (NE)) were all significantly elevated in lesioned rats primed
  with both APO and footshock. These results confirm that neonatal 6-OHDA-induced
  neostriatal catecholamine depletion can be antagonized by experiential change, suggest
  that behavioral and neurochemical cross-sensitization between APO and footshock
  in such rats is unidirectional and support the view that stress can exacerbate the
  incidence of SIB in LNS.
