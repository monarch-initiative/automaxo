input_text: Self-injurious behaviour in young children with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.
  The early development of self-injurious behaviour in three young boys (aged 17,
  25, and 30 months at start of study) with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome was examined by means
  of parental interviews and by direct observations completed at 3 to 4 monthly intervals
  over an 18-month period. Results suggest that the self-injury began in a different
  way from that of other young children with autism and/or developmental disabilities
  in that, from the start, self-injurious responses were sudden and violent, rather
  than emerging gradually over time. Drastic measures, such as removal of the teeth
  or provision of tooth guards, were often taken to prevent further tissue damage.
  Direct observations showed that the boys' self-injury occurred at lower rates, but
  their carers were highly concerned about the behaviour. Sequential analysis of the
  observational data indicated that on some occasions the children were more likely
  to self-injure during periods of low social interaction, suggesting that their self-injury
  may have been influenced by environmental factors. The theoretical and practical
  implications of these findings are discussed.
