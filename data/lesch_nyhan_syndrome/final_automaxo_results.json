Patients with a partial deficiency of HPRT are spared most of the neurological disorder of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. The specific relationship between HPRT deficiency and the neurological dysfunction in the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is not known, at present. The genetic lesion which result in HPRT deficiency are heterogeneous. About 90 different mutations were found in over 110 families. The DNA-based mutation detection technique can be used for the diagnosis of affected males and for the determination of carrier status of asymptomatic females. This technique is also applicable for the prenatal diagnosis for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Transgenic mice, deficient in HPRT activity, have been obtained but they do not show any neurological dysfunction. After administration of 9-ethyladenine, however, they showed the self-injury behavior.",

The aim of this review is to summarize recent research that documents the extended behavioral, neurologic, and neurocognitive phenotype in classic LNS, to describe milder variants of HGprt deficiency that do not self-injure and have less severe neurological and cognitive deficits, and to provide an update on treatment for associated psychiatric and behavioral disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Psychiatric management utilizes combined behavioral and pharmacological treatment in conjunction with protective equipment and dental management to avert self-injury. Pharmacological management focuses on stabilization of mood and anxiety management. S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), a physiological intermediate in methylation and transsulfuration, has shown beneficial effects in carefully selected patients who can tolerate the drug. Deep brain stimulation is shown in several case reports and series to reduce or eliminate self-injury and aggression, and in some cases, modify dystonia. SUMMARY: This review highlights progress in our understanding of the behavioral and neurocognitive phenotype of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (HGprt deficiency) and its variants, describes psychiatric and behavioral management, and discusses prospects for new therapies.",

A couple with a boy diagnosed with LN and a history of pregnancy termination was referred to the Hammersmith Hospital. Their affected son was born in 1982 after an uncomplicated pregnancy and vaginal delivery. Eight subsequent pregnancies had been unsuccessful. There were five therapeutic terminations and three spontaneous abortions, one at least directly caused by the sampling procedure during amniocentesis. From 1989 to 1991 two unsuccessful preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) cycles by sexing were performed by DNA amplification. The mutation was characterized and a nested PCR protocol was designed which allowed the efficient amplification of the affected loci followed by the detection of the mutant allele by restriction digestion. Three PGD cycles were performed using this specific diagnostic test before a successful pregnancy was achieved resulting in the birth of a healthy unaffected baby girl.",

Anesthetic management of inpatients who demonstrate classic manifestations of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome and require surgical interventions have been described. There are no guidelines in the literature addressing the anesthetic management of the outpatient with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Specifically, sudden, unexplained death, abnormalities in respiration, apnea, severe bradycardia, and an increased incidence of vomiting and chronic pulmonary aspiration may preclude this patient population from receiving anesthesia for outpatient procedures. General anesthesia with spontaneous ventilation was performed for diagnostic, radiographic imaging in 11 outpatients with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome using intravenous propofol. A bolus dose of 1.5 to 2.0 mg/kg propofol was followed by maintenance doses of 60 to 160 mcg/kg/min. Results during and following sedation indicated end-tidal carbon dioxide ranges between 34 mmHg and 59 mmHg. Respiratory rates were never below 10 breaths/min and no partial/complete airway obstruction or labored breathing was clinically evident. Hemodynamics were within 30% of presedation values. No patient demonstrated nausea, vomiting, or pulmonary aspiration. Baseline neuropsychologic status was achieved following sedation, and patients were discharged from the hospital 35 to 90 minutes after sedation was completed. Potential risks and benefits of using propofol in this patient population are discussed.",

Inhalational anesthesia has been frequently used in LNS patients undergoing surgery. Characteristic compulsive self-injurious behavior and high risk of emesis may hinder inhalational induction. Propofol may be beneficial for these patients because of its easy and rapid titration for anesthetic depth during induction, early recovery from anesthesia, and antiemetic effect as well as uricosuric effect. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 16-year-old male adolescent was scheduled for percutaneous nephrolithotomy. He exhibited poorly controlled muscle, self-injurious behaviors and intellectual disability. DIAGNOSIS: The patient presented with neurodevelopmental delay in the first year of life, and was diagnosed with LNS, with a substitution of phenylalanine to leucine in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) 1 gene on the X-chromosome at 3 years of age. INTERVENTIONS: Total intravenous anesthesia was used for induction and maintenance of anesthesia with propofol and remifentanil using target-controlled infusion. OUTCOMES: Time to recovery of consciousness was prolonged after uneventful surgery. Serum uric acid levels gradually increased during postoperative period. LESSONS: Propofol anesthesia using target-controlled infusion does not provide significant clinical advantages in rapid emergence from anesthesia and management of hyperuricemia in LNS patients undergoing urological surgery.",

The aim of this review is to summarize recent research that documents the extended behavioral, neurologic, and neurocognitive phenotype in classic LNS, to describe milder variants of HGprt deficiency that do not self-injure and have less severe neurological and cognitive deficits, and to provide an update on treatment for associated psychiatric and behavioral disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Psychiatric management utilizes combined behavioral and pharmacological treatment in conjunction with protective equipment and dental management to avert self-injury. Pharmacological management focuses on stabilization of mood and anxiety management. S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), a physiological intermediate in methylation and transsulfuration, has shown beneficial effects in carefully selected patients who can tolerate the drug. Deep brain stimulation is shown in several case reports and series to reduce or eliminate self-injury and aggression, and in some cases, modify dystonia. SUMMARY: This review highlights progress in our understanding of the behavioral and neurocognitive phenotype of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (HGprt deficiency) and its variants, describes psychiatric and behavioral management, and discusses prospects for new therapies.",

The authors performed bilateral chronic stimulation of the globus pallidus internus for control of dystonic movements in a 19-year-old man with LNS. His self-mutilating behavior unexpectedly disappeared after chronic stimulation. This is the first case of LNS that has been successfully treated with deep brain stimulation.

The annual collation of the world figures for centres offering this procedure is important to continually assess the efficiency and success of the biopsy, diagnosis and pregnancies obtained. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data was collected from 14 centres worldwide. The largest series of diagnosis has been performed for those patients carrying X-linked disease where the embryos have been sexed either by PCR or FISH. PCR has also been used for the specific diagnosis of a number of single gene defects, mainly for cystic fibrosis but also for the diagnosis of Lesch Nyhan syndrome, Fragile X, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Tay Sachs, haemophilia and RhD blood typing. RESULTS: For PCR sexing, a total of 62 cycles have been performed with 14 pregnancies, 8 deliveries and 11 babies born. For FISH sexing, 70 cycles have resulted in 15 pregnancies, 8 deliveries and 11 babies born. For the specific diagnosis of single genes defects, a total of 65 cycles resulted in 21 pregnancies, 12 deliveries and 12 babies born. Overall, 197 cycles were performed, with 171 embryo transfers (86%), 50 pregnancies (25% per cycle, 29% per transfer), 28 deliveries and 34 babies born. CONCLUSIONS: New methods are being developed to increase the scope of preimplantation diagnoses that can be offered. From next year, the biochemical and miscarriage rates will also be recorded.",

Some cases have reported clinical results of DBS in LNS thus far. This systematic review was conducted to comprehensively summarize cases of LNS treated with DBS and evaluate the efficacy and safety of DBS in LNS. Eight publications covering 12 LNS patients were included in this review. DBS improved dystonia of the LNS to varying degrees. All the included cases achieved partial or complete control of self-injurious behavior (SIB). Overall, DBS is a promising treatment for both motor and behavior disorders of LNS patients, but the results reported thus far have varied widely, especially for motor outcomes. The ultimate clinical benefits in LNS patients were still unpredictable. DBS-related complications were rather common, which raised questions about the safety of the procedure in LNS. More research is needed to further clarify the safety and effectiveness of this treatment.",

Goals were to improve wheelchair positioning for school attendance and to reduce the use of restraints for comfort. Intrathecal baclofen was implanted twice and decreased the hypertonia, but both were explanted because of infection. Deep-brain stimulation was initiated 2.5 years ago, and since that time, comfort and function have improved and caregiver burden has decreased.

This patient was treated with intrathecal baclofen and, later, with deep-brain stimulation to reduce hypertonia. Goals were to improve wheelchair positioning for school attendance and to reduce the use of restraints for comfort. Intrathecal baclofen was implanted twice and decreased the hypertonia, but both were explanted because of infection. Deep-brain stimulation was initiated 2.5 years ago, and since that time, comfort and function have improved and caregiver burden has decreased. Improvements in dystonia with deep-brain stimulation have also occurred, and self-injurious behaviors have resolved.",

The aim of this review is to summarize recent research that documents the extended behavioral, neurologic, and neurocognitive phenotype in classic LNS, to describe milder variants of HGprt deficiency that do not self-injure and have less severe neurological and cognitive deficits, and to provide an update on treatment for associated psychiatric and behavioral disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Psychiatric management utilizes combined behavioral and pharmacological treatment in conjunction with protective equipment and dental management to avert self-injury. Pharmacological management focuses on stabilization of mood and anxiety management. S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), a physiological intermediate in methylation and transsulfuration, has shown beneficial effects in carefully selected patients who can tolerate the drug. Deep brain stimulation is shown in several case reports and series to reduce or eliminate self-injury and aggression, and in some cases, modify dystonia. SUMMARY: This review highlights progress in our understanding of the behavioral and neurocognitive phenotype of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (HGprt deficiency) and its variants, describes psychiatric and behavioral management, and discusses prospects for new therapies.",

A couple with a boy diagnosed with LN and a history of pregnancy termination was referred to the Hammersmith Hospital. Their affected son was born in 1982 after an uncomplicated pregnancy and vaginal delivery. Eight subsequent pregnancies had been unsuccessful. There were five therapeutic terminations and three spontaneous abortions, one at least directly caused by the sampling procedure during amniocentesis. From 1989 to 1991 two unsuccessful preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) cycles by sexing were performed by DNA amplification. The mutation was characterized and a nested PCR protocol was designed which allowed the efficient amplification of the affected loci followed by the detection of the mutant allele by restriction digestion. Three PGD cycles were performed using this specific diagnostic test before a successful pregnancy was achieved resulting in the birth of a healthy unaffected baby girl.",

Following in vitro fertilization (IVF), one to two cells were removed from 3 day cleavage stage embryo and cells were analysed for genetic defects. Embryos diagnosed as unaffected were returned to the uterus and thus the resulting pregnancies were assured to be normal. First babies born after the preimplantation diagnosis were using DNA amplification of Y-linked sequences by PCR to avoid X-linked disease. Several pregnancies were obtained by identifying sex of embryos using dual fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with fluorochrome labelled DNA sequences specific for X- and Y-chromosomes to interphase nuclei. Development of single cell PCR for single gene defects led to diagnose several genetic disorders.

Embryos diagnosed as unaffected were returned to the uterus and thus the resulting pregnancies were assured to be normal. First babies born after the preimplantation diagnosis were using DNA amplification of Y-linked sequences by PCR to avoid X-linked disease. Several pregnancies were obtained by identifying sex of embryos using dual fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with fluorochrome labelled DNA sequences specific for X- and Y-chromosomes to interphase nuclei. Development of single cell PCR for single gene defects led to diagnose several genetic disorders.

LND cases have never been reported in Indonesia.Case report: A 15-year-old male who had been diagnosed with cerebral palsy was referred to our hospital due to renal failure requiring emergency dialysis. The patient presented with three classic manifestations of LND: increased uric acid levels, neurological disorders, and self-injurious behaviors. LND was suspected because of an abscess-like lump on the left ankle that was confirmed to be a tophus, which had burst and discharged thick masses containing blood, debris, and white crystal materials. The diagnosis of LND was confirmed by the presence of a deletion to exon 1 of the HPRT1 gene. The patient received oral allopurinol daily and treatment for end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which included regular dialysis and subcutaneous administration of erythropoietin. At a 2-month follow-up, he improved clinically with a 71% decrease in uric acid levels after regular dialysis and allopurinol treatment.Conclusion: In developed countries, LND can be diagnosed as early as 3 days after birth. However, diagnosis in the present case was delayed due to the rarity of the disease and the limited number of facilities in Indonesia that offer genetic counseling. Late diagnosis of LND leads to ESRD and irreversible abnormalities. This is the first case of LND presenting with a unique clinical presentation of tophus burst reported in Indonesia.",

The annual collation of the world figures for centres offering this procedure is important to continually assess the efficiency and success of the biopsy, diagnosis and pregnancies obtained. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data was collected from 14 centres worldwide. The largest series of diagnosis has been performed for those patients carrying X-linked disease where the embryos have been sexed either by PCR or FISH. PCR has also been used for the specific diagnosis of a number of single gene defects, mainly for cystic fibrosis but also for the diagnosis of Lesch Nyhan syndrome, Fragile X, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Tay Sachs, haemophilia and RhD blood typing. RESULTS: For PCR sexing, a total of 62 cycles have been performed with 14 pregnancies, 8 deliveries and 11 babies born. For FISH sexing, 70 cycles have resulted in 15 pregnancies, 8 deliveries and 11 babies born. For the specific diagnosis of single genes defects, a total of 65 cycles resulted in 21 pregnancies, 12 deliveries and 12 babies born. Overall, 197 cycles were performed, with 171 embryo transfers (86%), 50 pregnancies (25% per cycle, 29% per transfer), 28 deliveries and 34 babies born. CONCLUSIONS: New methods are being developed to increase the scope of preimplantation diagnoses that can be offered. From next year, the biochemical and miscarriage rates will also be recorded.",

Following in vitro fertilization (IVF), one to two cells were removed from 3 day cleavage stage embryo and cells were analysed for genetic defects. Embryos diagnosed as unaffected were returned to the uterus and thus the resulting pregnancies were assured to be normal. First babies born after the preimplantation diagnosis were using DNA amplification of Y-linked sequences by PCR to avoid X-linked disease. Several pregnancies were obtained by identifying sex of embryos using dual fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with fluorochrome labelled DNA sequences specific for X- and Y-chromosomes to interphase nuclei. Development of single cell PCR for single gene defects led to diagnose several genetic disorders. Preimplantation diagnosis was successfully achieved for predominant delta 508 deletion causing cystic fibrosis, and pregnancies were also diagnosed for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, Tay-Sachs and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.",

Inhalational anesthesia has been frequently used in LNS patients undergoing surgery. Characteristic compulsive self-injurious behavior and high risk of emesis may hinder inhalational induction. Propofol may be beneficial for these patients because of its easy and rapid titration for anesthetic depth during induction, early recovery from anesthesia, and antiemetic effect as well as uricosuric effect. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 16-year-old male adolescent was scheduled for percutaneous nephrolithotomy. He exhibited poorly controlled muscle, self-injurious behaviors and intellectual disability. DIAGNOSIS: The patient presented with neurodevelopmental delay in the first year of life, and was diagnosed with LNS, with a substitution of phenylalanine to leucine in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) 1 gene on the X-chromosome at 3 years of age. INTERVENTIONS: Total intravenous anesthesia was used for induction and maintenance of anesthesia with propofol and remifentanil using target-controlled infusion. OUTCOMES: Time to recovery of consciousness was prolonged after uneventful surgery. Serum uric acid levels gradually increased during postoperative period. LESSONS: Propofol anesthesia using target-controlled infusion does not provide significant clinical advantages in rapid emergence from anesthesia and management of hyperuricemia in LNS patients undergoing urological surgery.",

This patient was treated with intrathecal baclofen and, later, with deep-brain stimulation to reduce hypertonia. Goals were to improve wheelchair positioning for school attendance and to reduce the use of restraints for comfort. Intrathecal baclofen was implanted twice and decreased the hypertonia, but both were explanted because of infection. Deep-brain stimulation was initiated 2.5 years ago, and since that time, comfort and function have improved and caregiver burden has decreased. Improvements in dystonia with deep-brain stimulation have also occurred, and self-injurious behaviors have resolved.",

The disorder is caused by a wide spectrum of mutations distributed throughout the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene. Female carriers of LN display no clinical symptoms but are at 50% risk of passing on the affected gene to their male offspring. A couple who had a boy with LN were referred to Monash IVF for preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) because the woman had undergone tubal ligation and the couple wanted to have another child. A test was developed for the causative mutation IVS8+6 T-->G mutation based on minisequencing primer extension that also incorporated the co-analysis of an informative tetranucleotide marker in intron 3 of the HPRT gene to identify allelic dropout. All four biopsied embryos from their first IVF cycle were diagnosed as unaffected, and transfer of two embryos in the cohort with the highest morphological quality resulted in a singleton pregnancy and the birth of a healthy girl. Direct mutation detection by mini-sequencing and parallel analysis of an informative linked marker provides an alternative strategy for molecular diagnosis of point mutations that will have useful application in PGD for other single gene disorders.",

Affected boys have mental retardation, delayed development, extrapyramidal motor disturbances and self-injuring behavior. As hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been shown to be effective in several neurodevelopmental inborn errors, we hypothesized that it could be favorable in LNS as well. Following a myeloablative conditioning regimen (busulphan 3.2 mg/kg/day for 4 days, cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg/day for 2 days with ATG Thymoglobin 2.5 mg/kg/day for 4 days) an unrelated umbilical cord blood unit was transfused at the age of 2 years. The graft was a 6/6 HLA-matched at HLA-A, B loci by antigen level, and at DRB1 by allelic level typing. Infused total nucleated cell dose was 3.6 x 10e7 per kilogram body weight. Serum HPRT levels reached normal values by the end of the sixth month post transplant. Slow neurodevelopmental improvement seen during the three-year follow-up and the missing self-injuring behavior can be considered as a proof for the presence of enzyme-competent cells behind the blood-brain barrier.",

LND cases have never been reported in Indonesia.Case report: A 15-year-old male who had been diagnosed with cerebral palsy was referred to our hospital due to renal failure requiring emergency dialysis. The patient presented with three classic manifestations of LND: increased uric acid levels, neurological disorders, and self-injurious behaviors. LND was suspected because of an abscess-like lump on the left ankle that was confirmed to be a tophus, which had burst and discharged thick masses containing blood, debris, and white crystal materials. The diagnosis of LND was confirmed by the presence of a deletion to exon 1 of the HPRT1 gene. The patient received oral allopurinol daily and treatment for end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which included regular dialysis and subcutaneous administration of erythropoietin. At a 2-month follow-up, he improved clinically with a 71% decrease in uric acid levels after regular dialysis and allopurinol treatment.Conclusion: In developed countries, LND can be diagnosed as early as 3 days after birth. However, diagnosis in the present case was delayed due to the rarity of the disease and the limited number of facilities in Indonesia that offer genetic counseling. Late diagnosis of LND leads to ESRD and irreversible abnormalities. This is the first case of LND presenting with a unique clinical presentation of tophus burst reported in Indonesia.",

The disorder is caused by a wide spectrum of mutations distributed throughout the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene. Female carriers of LN display no clinical symptoms but are at 50% risk of passing on the affected gene to their male offspring. A couple who had a boy with LN were referred to Monash IVF for preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) because the woman had undergone tubal ligation and the couple wanted to have another child. A test was developed for the causative mutation IVS8+6 T-->G mutation based on minisequencing primer extension that also incorporated the co-analysis of an informative tetranucleotide marker in intron 3 of the HPRT gene to identify allelic dropout. All four biopsied embryos from their first IVF cycle were diagnosed as unaffected, and transfer of two embryos in the cohort with the highest morphological quality resulted in a singleton pregnancy and the birth of a healthy girl. Direct mutation detection by mini-sequencing and parallel analysis of an informative linked marker provides an alternative strategy for molecular diagnosis of point mutations that will have useful application in PGD for other single gene disorders.",

Their affected son was born in 1982 after an uncomplicated pregnancy and vaginal delivery. Eight subsequent pregnancies had been unsuccessful. There were five therapeutic terminations and three spontaneous abortions, one at least directly caused by the sampling procedure during amniocentesis. From 1989 to 1991 two unsuccessful preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) cycles by sexing were performed by DNA amplification. The mutation was characterized and a nested PCR protocol was designed which allowed the efficient amplification of the affected loci followed by the detection of the mutant allele by restriction digestion.

Embryos diagnosed as unaffected were returned to the uterus and thus the resulting pregnancies were assured to be normal. First babies born after the preimplantation diagnosis were using DNA amplification of Y-linked sequences by PCR to avoid X-linked disease. Several pregnancies were obtained by identifying sex of embryos using dual fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with fluorochrome labelled DNA sequences specific for X- and Y-chromosomes to interphase nuclei. Development of single cell PCR for single gene defects led to diagnose several genetic disorders.

The disorder is caused by a wide spectrum of mutations distributed throughout the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene. Female carriers of LN display no clinical symptoms but are at 50% risk of passing on the affected gene to their male offspring. A couple who had a boy with LN were referred to Monash IVF for preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) because the woman had undergone tubal ligation and the couple wanted to have another child. A test was developed for the causative mutation IVS8+6 T-->G mutation based on minisequencing primer extension that also incorporated the co-analysis of an informative tetranucleotide marker in intron 3 of the HPRT gene to identify allelic dropout. All four biopsied embryos from their first IVF cycle were diagnosed as unaffected, and transfer of two embryos in the cohort with the highest morphological quality resulted in a singleton pregnancy and the birth of a healthy girl. Direct mutation detection by mini-sequencing and parallel analysis of an informative linked marker provides an alternative strategy for molecular diagnosis of point mutations that will have useful application in PGD for other single gene disorders.",

The aim of this review is to summarize recent research that documents the extended behavioral, neurologic, and neurocognitive phenotype in classic LNS, to describe milder variants of HGprt deficiency that do not self-injure and have less severe neurological and cognitive deficits, and to provide an update on treatment for associated psychiatric and behavioral disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Psychiatric management utilizes combined behavioral and pharmacological treatment in conjunction with protective equipment and dental management to avert self-injury. Pharmacological management focuses on stabilization of mood and anxiety management. S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), a physiological intermediate in methylation and transsulfuration, has shown beneficial effects in carefully selected patients who can tolerate the drug. Deep brain stimulation is shown in several case reports and series to reduce or eliminate self-injury and aggression, and in some cases, modify dystonia. SUMMARY: This review highlights progress in our understanding of the behavioral and neurocognitive phenotype of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (HGprt deficiency) and its variants, describes psychiatric and behavioral management, and discusses prospects for new therapies.",

LND cases have never been reported in Indonesia.Case report: A 15-year-old male who had been diagnosed with cerebral palsy was referred to our hospital due to renal failure requiring emergency dialysis. The patient presented with three classic manifestations of LND: increased uric acid levels, neurological disorders, and self-injurious behaviors. LND was suspected because of an abscess-like lump on the left ankle that was confirmed to be a tophus, which had burst and discharged thick masses containing blood, debris, and white crystal materials. The diagnosis of LND was confirmed by the presence of a deletion to exon 1 of the HPRT1 gene. The patient received oral allopurinol daily and treatment for end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which included regular dialysis and subcutaneous administration of erythropoietin. At a 2-month follow-up, he improved clinically with a 71% decrease in uric acid levels after regular dialysis and allopurinol treatment.Conclusion: In developed countries, LND can be diagnosed as early as 3 days after birth. However, diagnosis in the present case was delayed due to the rarity of the disease and the limited number of facilities in Indonesia that offer genetic counseling. Late diagnosis of LND leads to ESRD and irreversible abnormalities. This is the first case of LND presenting with a unique clinical presentation of tophus burst reported in Indonesia.",

The mechanism behind the severe self-mutilating behavior exhibited by patients with LNS is unknown and remains one of the greatest obstacles in providing care to these patients. This report describes a 10-year-old male child with confirmed LNS who was treated for self-mutilation of his hands, tongue, and lips with repeated botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) injections into the bilateral masseters. Our findings suggest that treatment with BTX-A affects both the central and peripheral nervous systems, resulting in reduced self-abusive behavior in this patient.",

A rapid decline in control spinal fluid HVA and 5-HIAA occurs over the first 3 years of life (50 and 60%, respectively), and a more gradual decline persists throughout adolescence. The Lesch-Nyhan subjects have similar age-related changes in their spinal fluid neurotransmitter levels. Sequential 5-HIAA determinations from the four Lesch-Nyhan boys fall within the control range.

Embryos diagnosed as unaffected were returned to the uterus and thus the resulting pregnancies were assured to be normal. First babies born after the preimplantation diagnosis were using DNA amplification of Y-linked sequences by PCR to avoid X-linked disease. Several pregnancies were obtained by identifying sex of embryos using dual fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with fluorochrome labelled DNA sequences specific for X- and Y-chromosomes to interphase nuclei. Development of single cell PCR for single gene defects led to diagnose several genetic disorders. Preimplantation diagnosis was successfully achieved for predominant delta 508 deletion causing cystic fibrosis, and pregnancies were also diagnosed for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, Tay-Sachs and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.",

The aim of this review is to summarize recent research that documents the extended behavioral, neurologic, and neurocognitive phenotype in classic LNS, to describe milder variants of HGprt deficiency that do not self-injure and have less severe neurological and cognitive deficits, and to provide an update on treatment for associated psychiatric and behavioral disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Psychiatric management utilizes combined behavioral and pharmacological treatment in conjunction with protective equipment and dental management to avert self-injury. Pharmacological management focuses on stabilization of mood and anxiety management. S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), a physiological intermediate in methylation and transsulfuration, has shown beneficial effects in carefully selected patients who can tolerate the drug. Deep brain stimulation is shown in several case reports and series to reduce or eliminate self-injury and aggression, and in some cases, modify dystonia. SUMMARY: This review highlights progress in our understanding of the behavioral and neurocognitive phenotype of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (HGprt deficiency) and its variants, describes psychiatric and behavioral management, and discusses prospects for new therapies.",

LND cases have never been reported in Indonesia.Case report: A 15-year-old male who had been diagnosed with cerebral palsy was referred to our hospital due to renal failure requiring emergency dialysis. The patient presented with three classic manifestations of LND: increased uric acid levels, neurological disorders, and self-injurious behaviors. LND was suspected because of an abscess-like lump on the left ankle that was confirmed to be a tophus, which had burst and discharged thick masses containing blood, debris, and white crystal materials. The diagnosis of LND was confirmed by the presence of a deletion to exon 1 of the HPRT1 gene. The patient received oral allopurinol daily and treatment for end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which included regular dialysis and subcutaneous administration of erythropoietin. At a 2-month follow-up, he improved clinically with a 71% decrease in uric acid levels after regular dialysis and allopurinol treatment.Conclusion: In developed countries, LND can be diagnosed as early as 3 days after birth. However, diagnosis in the present case was delayed due to the rarity of the disease and the limited number of facilities in Indonesia that offer genetic counseling. Late diagnosis of LND leads to ESRD and irreversible abnormalities. This is the first case of LND presenting with a unique clinical presentation of tophus burst reported in Indonesia.",

Inhalational anesthesia has been frequently used in LNS patients undergoing surgery. Characteristic compulsive self-injurious behavior and high risk of emesis may hinder inhalational induction. Propofol may be beneficial for these patients because of its easy and rapid titration for anesthetic depth during induction, early recovery from anesthesia, and antiemetic effect as well as uricosuric effect. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 16-year-old male adolescent was scheduled for percutaneous nephrolithotomy. He exhibited poorly controlled muscle, self-injurious behaviors and intellectual disability. DIAGNOSIS: The patient presented with neurodevelopmental delay in the first year of life, and was diagnosed with LNS, with a substitution of phenylalanine to leucine in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) 1 gene on the X-chromosome at 3 years of age. INTERVENTIONS: Total intravenous anesthesia was used for induction and maintenance of anesthesia with propofol and remifentanil using target-controlled infusion. OUTCOMES: Time to recovery of consciousness was prolonged after uneventful surgery. Serum uric acid levels gradually increased during postoperative period. LESSONS: Propofol anesthesia using target-controlled infusion does not provide significant clinical advantages in rapid emergence from anesthesia and management of hyperuricemia in LNS patients undergoing urological surgery.",

                    "abstract": "RATIONALE: Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS) is an X-linked recessive disorder presenting with uric acid overproduction, neurocognitive disability, and behavioral disturbances. Inhalational anesthesia has been frequently used in LNS patients undergoing surgery. Characteristic compulsive self-injurious behavior and high risk of emesis may hinder inhalational induction. Propofol may be beneficial for these patients because of its easy and rapid titration for anesthetic depth during induction, early recovery from anesthesia, and antiemetic effect as well as uricosuric effect. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 16-year-old male adolescent was scheduled for percutaneous nephrolithotomy. He exhibited poorly controlled muscle, self-injurious behaviors and intellectual disability. DIAGNOSIS: The patient presented with neurodevelopmental delay in the first year of life, and was diagnosed with LNS, with a substitution of phenylalanine to leucine in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) 1 gene on the X-chromosome at 3 years of age. INTERVENTIONS: Total intravenous anesthesia was used for induction and maintenance of anesthesia with propofol and remifentanil using target-controlled infusion. OUTCOMES: Time to recovery of consciousness was prolonged after uneventful surgery. Serum uric acid levels gradually increased during postoperative period. LESSONS: Propofol anesthesia using target-controlled infusion does not provide significant clinical advantages in rapid emergence from anesthesia and management of hyperuricemia in LNS patients undergoing urological surgery.",

DEVELOPMENT: Lesch Nyhan syndrome is an X linked inherited disorder of purine metabolism caused by the deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). Clinical features include overproduction of uric acid and a neurologic syndrome related to the severity of the enzyme defect. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with xanthine oxidase inhibitors is effective for the control of the elevated renal excretion of uric acid, but there is no specific treatment for the neurologic symptoms. Due to the low frequency of the syndrome and to the incomplete understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the neurologic manifestations, the treatments employed are merely symptomatic.",

RECENT FINDINGS: Psychiatric management utilizes combined behavioral and pharmacological treatment in conjunction with protective equipment and dental management to avert self-injury. Pharmacological management focuses on stabilization of mood and anxiety management. S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), a physiological intermediate in methylation and transsulfuration, has shown beneficial effects in carefully selected patients who can tolerate the drug. Deep brain stimulation is shown in several case reports and series to reduce or eliminate self-injury and aggression, and in some cases, modify dystonia.

Bronchoscopy revealed tracheomalacia of the cresent moon type. He lost his weight, and his general condition gradually worsened. Four months post-tracheostomy, he died of massive hemoptysis from a tracheobrachicephalic artery fistula. Many patients with LNS have renal failure and pneumonitis, whereas occasional cases are complicated by convulsions, recurrent coma, abnormalities of respiration, and sudden death. The etiology of sudden death is not clear. Although tracheomalacia, to our knowledge, has not been described in the literature, it may be a clinical feature of LNS associated with abnormal respiration and sudden death. Tracheobrachiocephalic artery fistula is common in patients with neuromuscular disorders and a chronic tracheostomy tube. Caution is required in LNS patients with opisthotonic extensor spasms of the neck and trunk, chronic bronchitis, and malnutrition.",

Affected boys have mental retardation, delayed development, extrapyramidal motor disturbances and self-injuring behavior. As hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been shown to be effective in several neurodevelopmental inborn errors, we hypothesized that it could be favorable in LNS as well. Following a myeloablative conditioning regimen (busulphan 3.2 mg/kg/day for 4 days, cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg/day for 2 days with ATG Thymoglobin 2.5 mg/kg/day for 4 days) an unrelated umbilical cord blood unit was transfused at the age of 2 years. The graft was a 6/6 HLA-matched at HLA-A, B loci by antigen level, and at DRB1 by allelic level typing. Infused total nucleated cell dose was 3.6 x 10e7 per kilogram body weight. Serum HPRT levels reached normal values by the end of the sixth month post transplant. Slow neurodevelopmental improvement seen during the three-year follow-up and the missing self-injuring behavior can be considered as a proof for the presence of enzyme-competent cells behind the blood-brain barrier.",

Some cases have reported clinical results of DBS in LNS thus far. This systematic review was conducted to comprehensively summarize cases of LNS treated with DBS and evaluate the efficacy and safety of DBS in LNS. Eight publications covering 12 LNS patients were included in this review. DBS improved dystonia of the LNS to varying degrees. All the included cases achieved partial or complete control of self-injurious behavior (SIB). Overall, DBS is a promising treatment for both motor and behavior disorders of LNS patients, but the results reported thus far have varied widely, especially for motor outcomes. The ultimate clinical benefits in LNS patients were still unpredictable. DBS-related complications were rather common, which raised questions about the safety of the procedure in LNS. More research is needed to further clarify the safety and effectiveness of this treatment.",

Clinical management of these patients poses an enormous challenge for medical teams and carers. OBJECTIVES: We report our experience with bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) in the management of this complex disorder. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Preoperative and postoperative functional assessment data prospectively collected by a multidisciplinary pediatric complex motor disorders team, including imaging, neuropsychology, and neurophysiology evaluations were analyzed with regards to motor and behavioral control, goal achievement, and patient and caregivers' expectations. RESULTS: Four male patients (mean age 13 years) underwent DBS implantation between 2011 and 2018. Three patients received double bilateral DBS electrodes within the posteroventral GPi and the anteromedial GPi, whereas one patient had bilateral electrodes placed in the posteroventral GPi only. Median follow-up was 47.5 months (range 22-98 months). Functional improvement was observed in all patients and discussed in relation to previous reports. Analysis of structural connectivity revealed significant correlation between the involvement of specific cortical regions and clinical outcome. CONCLUSION: Combined bilateral stimulation of the anteromedial and posteroventral GPi may be considered as an option for managing refractory dystonia and self-harm behavior in LNS patients. A multidisciplinary team-based approach is essential for patient selection and management, to support children and families, to achieve functional improvement and alleviate the overall disease burden for patients and caregivers.",

OBJECTIVES: We report our experience with bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) in the management of this complex disorder. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Preoperative and postoperative functional assessment data prospectively collected by a multidisciplinary pediatric complex motor disorders team, including imaging, neuropsychology, and neurophysiology evaluations were analyzed with regards to motor and behavioral control, goal achievement, and patient and caregivers' expectations. RESULTS: Four male patients (mean age 13 years) underwent DBS implantation between 2011 and 2018. Three patients received double bilateral DBS electrodes within the posteroventral GPi and the anteromedial GPi, whereas one patient had bilateral electrodes placed in the posteroventral GPi only. Median follow-up was 47.5 months (range 22-98 months). Functional improvement was observed in all patients and discussed in relation to previous reports. Analysis of structural connectivity revealed significant correlation between the involvement of specific cortical regions and clinical outcome. CONCLUSION: Combined bilateral stimulation of the anteromedial and posteroventral GPi may be considered as an option for managing refractory dystonia and self-harm behavior in LNS patients. A multidisciplinary team-based approach is essential for patient selection and management, to support children and families, to achieve functional improvement and alleviate the overall disease burden for patients and caregivers.",

To shed light on this complex issue, we have taken the opportunity to record the response of globus pallidus internus (GPi) neurones to 100 Hz stimulations in a case of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS) where four pallidal electrodes were implanted. Three types of response were observed, 2/19 neurones were unaffected by DBS. About 7/19 neurones were inhibited during DBS stimulation and 10/19 neurones were excited during DBS stimulation. Both effects ceased when DBS was turned off. Inhibited neurones were situated lower that exited ones on the trajectory (1.25 and 4.65 mm above the center of GPi respectively). These observations suggest that locally DBS induces a reversible inhibition of neurone firing rate while at the same time distantly exciting the main afferents to and/or efferents from the GPi. Both actions would result in a strong GPi inhibition that does not preclude increased outflow from the GPi.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a rare and debilitating condition characterized by dystonia and self-mutilating behavior. In order to shed light on the pathophysiology of dystonia, we report the pallidal electrophysiological activity recorded in two patients during deep brain stimulation surgery (DBS). METHODS: Microrecordings were performed on 162 neurons along four tracks aimed at the right and left anterior (limbic) and posterior (motor) globus pallidus internus (GPI). RESULTS: Regardless of the anesthetic agent used (propofol or sevoflurane), both patients showed similar neurons firing rates in the four regions studied, namely the limbic and motor portions of the globus pallidus externus (GPE) or GPI. In both patients, firing rates were similar in the GPE (12.2+/-1.8 Hz, N=38) and GPI (13.2+/-1.0 Hz, N=83) portions of the limbic track, while the motor GPE fired at a higher frequency (23.8+/-2.7 Hz, N=18) than the motor GPI (12.5+/-1.4 Hz, N=23). CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that light propofol or sevoflurane anesthesia influences pallidal activity in a similar way. Electrophysiological recordings suggest that Lesch-Nyhan syndrome might be characterized by analogous firing frequencies in the limbic GPE and GPI while motor GPE would tend to fire at higher rate than the motor GPI. It is therefore tempting to suggest that the symptoms that are observed in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome might result from motor GPI inhibition. SIGNIFICANCE: This observation may confirm the Albin and Delong's model of the basal nuclei in hypokinetic and hyperkinetic disorders.",

OBJECTIVES: We report our experience with bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) in the management of this complex disorder. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Preoperative and postoperative functional assessment data prospectively collected by a multidisciplinary pediatric complex motor disorders team, including imaging, neuropsychology, and neurophysiology evaluations were analyzed with regards to motor and behavioral control, goal achievement, and patient and caregivers' expectations. RESULTS: Four male patients (mean age 13 years) underwent DBS implantation between 2011 and 2018. Three patients received double bilateral DBS electrodes within the posteroventral GPi and the anteromedial GPi, whereas one patient had bilateral electrodes placed in the posteroventral GPi only. Median follow-up was 47.5 months (range 22-98 months). Functional improvement was observed in all patients and discussed in relation to previous reports. Analysis of structural connectivity revealed significant correlation between the involvement of specific cortical regions and clinical outcome. CONCLUSION: Combined bilateral stimulation of the anteromedial and posteroventral GPi may be considered as an option for managing refractory dystonia and self-harm behavior in LNS patients. A multidisciplinary team-based approach is essential for patient selection and management, to support children and families, to achieve functional improvement and alleviate the overall disease burden for patients and caregivers.",

Bronchoscopy revealed tracheomalacia of the cresent moon type. He lost his weight, and his general condition gradually worsened. Four months post-tracheostomy, he died of massive hemoptysis from a tracheobrachicephalic artery fistula. Many patients with LNS have renal failure and pneumonitis, whereas occasional cases are complicated by convulsions, recurrent coma, abnormalities of respiration, and sudden death. The etiology of sudden death is not clear. Although tracheomalacia, to our knowledge, has not been described in the literature, it may be a clinical feature of LNS associated with abnormal respiration and sudden death. Tracheobrachiocephalic artery fistula is common in patients with neuromuscular disorders and a chronic tracheostomy tube. Caution is required in LNS patients with opisthotonic extensor spasms of the neck and trunk, chronic bronchitis, and malnutrition.",

The disorder is caused by a wide spectrum of mutations distributed throughout the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene. Female carriers of LN display no clinical symptoms but are at 50% risk of passing on the affected gene to their male offspring. A couple who had a boy with LN were referred to Monash IVF for preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) because the woman had undergone tubal ligation and the couple wanted to have another child. A test was developed for the causative mutation IVS8+6 T-->G mutation based on minisequencing primer extension that also incorporated the co-analysis of an informative tetranucleotide marker in intron 3 of the HPRT gene to identify allelic dropout. All four biopsied embryos from their first IVF cycle were diagnosed as unaffected, and transfer of two embryos in the cohort with the highest morphological quality resulted in a singleton pregnancy and the birth of a healthy girl. Direct mutation detection by mini-sequencing and parallel analysis of an informative linked marker provides an alternative strategy for molecular diagnosis of point mutations that will have useful application in PGD for other single gene disorders.",

Thirty-two patients (19 male, 13 female) were identified with a mean age at autopsy of 13.0 years with a range from 1 to 52 years. Most patients (24) underwent UCBT for treatment of a malignant neoplasm, while the remainder were treated for immunodeficiencies (4), Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (2), Hurler syndrome (1), and Diamond-Blackfan syndrome (1). Sixteen patients had at least 1 infectious complication, and 8 patients had multiple infections. Organisms included mycoses (7 patients), viruses (8 patients), bacteria (3 patients), and Toxoplasma (2 patients). Hemorrhagic complications, such as intra-alveolar hemorrhage and gastrointestinal tract hemorrhage, were found in 24 patients. Other frequent findings at autopsy included diffuse alveolar damage (15 patients), hepatic veno-occlusive disease (11 patients), and acute or chronic graft-vs-host disease (9 patients). Patients who have received UCBT represent a unique population of immunosuppressed patients.

As hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been shown to be effective in several neurodevelopmental inborn errors, we hypothesized that it could be favorable in LNS as well. Following a myeloablative conditioning regimen (busulphan 3.2 mg/kg/day for 4 days, cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg/day for 2 days with ATG Thymoglobin 2.5 mg/kg/day for 4 days) an unrelated umbilical cord blood unit was transfused at the age of 2 years. The graft was a 6/6 HLA-matched at HLA-A, B loci by antigen level, and at DRB1 by allelic level typing. Infused total nucleated cell dose was 3.6 x 10e7 per kilogram body weight. Serum HPRT levels reached normal values by the end of the sixth month post transplant. Slow neurodevelopmental improvement seen during the three-year follow-up and the missing self-injuring behavior can be considered as a proof for the presence of enzyme-competent cells behind the blood-brain barrier.",

                    "abstract": "Human umbilical cord blood stem cells have been used to reconstitute hematopoiesis in patients with malignant and nonmalignant diseases. The immunologic immaturity of cord blood cells confers peculiar characteristics to these hematopoietic precursors. Autopsy reports from January 1, 1988, through June 30, 1998, were searched for patients who had received an umbilical cord blood transplant (UCBT). Thirty-two patients (19 male, 13 female) were identified with a mean age at autopsy of 13.0 years with a range from 1 to 52 years. Most patients (24) underwent UCBT for treatment of a malignant neoplasm, while the remainder were treated for immunodeficiencies (4), Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (2), Hurler syndrome (1), and Diamond-Blackfan syndrome (1). Sixteen patients had at least 1 infectious complication, and 8 patients had multiple infections. Organisms included mycoses (7 patients), viruses (8 patients), bacteria (3 patients), and Toxoplasma (2 patients). Hemorrhagic complications, such as intra-alveolar hemorrhage and gastrointestinal tract hemorrhage, were found in 24 patients. Other frequent findings at autopsy included diffuse alveolar damage (15 patients), hepatic veno-occlusive disease (11 patients), and acute or chronic graft-vs-host disease (9 patients). Patients who have received UCBT represent a unique population of immunosuppressed patients. Infectious and hemorrhagic complications frequently are encountered at autopsy, and pathologists performing autopsies on these patients should be alert to unusual pathogens.",
