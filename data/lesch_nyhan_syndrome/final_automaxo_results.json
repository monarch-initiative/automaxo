The aim of this review is to summarize recent research that documents the extended behavioral, neurologic, and neurocognitive phenotype in classic LNS, to describe milder variants of HGprt deficiency that do not self-injure and have less severe neurological and cognitive deficits, and to provide an update on treatment for associated psychiatric and behavioral disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Psychiatric management utilizes combined behavioral and pharmacological treatment in conjunction with protective equipment and dental management to avert self-injury. Pharmacological management focuses on stabilization of mood and anxiety management. S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), a physiological intermediate in methylation and transsulfuration, has shown beneficial effects in carefully selected patients who can tolerate the drug. Deep brain stimulation is shown in several case reports and series to reduce or eliminate self-injury and aggression, and in some cases, modify dystonia. SUMMARY: This review highlights progress in our understanding of the behavioral and neurocognitive phenotype of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (HGprt deficiency) and its variants, describes psychiatric and behavioral management, and discusses prospects for new therapies.",

Patients with a partial deficiency of HPRT are spared most of the neurological disorder of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. The specific relationship between HPRT deficiency and the neurological dysfunction in the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is not known, at present. The genetic lesion which result in HPRT deficiency are heterogeneous. About 90 different mutations were found in over 110 families. The DNA-based mutation detection technique can be used for the diagnosis of affected males and for the determination of carrier status of asymptomatic females. This technique is also applicable for the prenatal diagnosis for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.

Lesioned (6-OHDA-treated) rats displayed self-biting (SB; 7/20 rats) and self-injurious behavior (SIB; 1/20 rats) during APO priming, but not during footshock priming. During subsequent acute cumulative APO dosing, 20-30% of lesioned rats primed with APO alone or footshock alone displayed SB and SIB. However, SB and SIB incidence in APO+footshock-primed lesioned rats was nearly tripled. Dopamine (DA) synthesis, metabolism and extracellular concentrations (disposition) in unlesioned rats and in cortices of lesioned animals were unaffected by priming. In lesioned rats primed with APO alone or footshock alone, only neostriatal 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT) was significantly increased. However, neostriatal DA and metabolite concentrations (and norepinephrine (NE)) were all significantly elevated in lesioned rats primed with both APO and footshock. These results confirm that neonatal 6-OHDA-induced neostriatal catecholamine depletion can be antagonized by experiential change, suggest that behavioral and neurochemical cross-sensitization between APO and footshock in such rats is unidirectional and support the view that stress can exacerbate the incidence of SIB in LNS.",

                    "abstract": "A 19-year-old man with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS), had dyspnea and an inspiratory wheeze, and underwent assisted mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy. Bronchoscopy revealed tracheomalacia of the cresent moon type. He lost his weight, and his general condition gradually worsened. Four months post-tracheostomy, he died of massive hemoptysis from a tracheobrachicephalic artery fistula. Many patients with LNS have renal failure and pneumonitis, whereas occasional cases are complicated by convulsions, recurrent coma, abnormalities of respiration, and sudden death. The etiology of sudden death is not clear. Although tracheomalacia, to our knowledge, has not been described in the literature, it may be a clinical feature of LNS associated with abnormal respiration and sudden death. Tracheobrachiocephalic artery fistula is common in patients with neuromuscular disorders and a chronic tracheostomy tube. Caution is required in LNS patients with opisthotonic extensor spasms of the neck and trunk, chronic bronchitis, and malnutrition.",

Clinical management of these patients poses an enormous challenge for medical teams and carers. OBJECTIVES: We report our experience with bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) in the management of this complex disorder. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Preoperative and postoperative functional assessment data prospectively collected by a multidisciplinary pediatric complex motor disorders team, including imaging, neuropsychology, and neurophysiology evaluations were analyzed with regards to motor and behavioral control, goal achievement, and patient and caregivers' expectations. RESULTS: Four male patients (mean age 13 years) underwent DBS implantation between 2011 and 2018. Three patients received double bilateral DBS electrodes within the posteroventral GPi and the anteromedial GPi, whereas one patient had bilateral electrodes placed in the posteroventral GPi only. Median follow-up was 47.5 months (range 22-98 months). Functional improvement was observed in all patients and discussed in relation to previous reports. Analysis of structural connectivity revealed significant correlation between the involvement of specific cortical regions and clinical outcome. CONCLUSION: Combined bilateral stimulation of the anteromedial and posteroventral GPi may be considered as an option for managing refractory dystonia and self-harm behavior in LNS patients. A multidisciplinary team-based approach is essential for patient selection and management, to support children and families, to achieve functional improvement and alleviate the overall disease burden for patients and caregivers.",

The mechanism behind this severe self-mutilating behavior is unknown, and is one of the main challenges in the management of this condition. We here report the case of a 30-year-old man with a confirmed diagnosis of LNS who was successfully treated for self-mutilation of his lips with repeated botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) injections in the facial perioral muscles. Our findings suggest that treatment with BTX-A helped reduce self-abusive behavior in this patient. Our case illustrates that BTX-A injections can be a useful therapeutic approach in patients with self-abusive behavior.",

The annual collation of the world figures for centres offering this procedure is important to continually assess the efficiency and success of the biopsy, diagnosis and pregnancies obtained. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data was collected from 14 centres worldwide. The largest series of diagnosis has been performed for those patients carrying X-linked disease where the embryos have been sexed either by PCR or FISH. PCR has also been used for the specific diagnosis of a number of single gene defects, mainly for cystic fibrosis but also for the diagnosis of Lesch Nyhan syndrome, Fragile X, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Tay Sachs, haemophilia and RhD blood typing. RESULTS: For PCR sexing, a total of 62 cycles have been performed with 14 pregnancies, 8 deliveries and 11 babies born. For FISH sexing, 70 cycles have resulted in 15 pregnancies, 8 deliveries and 11 babies born. For the specific diagnosis of single genes defects, a total of 65 cycles resulted in 21 pregnancies, 12 deliveries and 12 babies born. Overall, 197 cycles were performed, with 171 embryo transfers (86%), 50 pregnancies (25% per cycle, 29% per transfer), 28 deliveries and 34 babies born. CONCLUSIONS: New methods are being developed to increase the scope of preimplantation diagnoses that can be offered. From next year, the biochemical and miscarriage rates will also be recorded.",

It manifests during infancy with compulsive self-mutilation behavior associated with disabling generalized dystonia and dyskinesia. Clinical management of these patients poses an enormous challenge for medical teams and carers. OBJECTIVES: We report our experience with bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) in the management of this complex disorder. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Preoperative and postoperative functional assessment data prospectively collected by a multidisciplinary pediatric complex motor disorders team, including imaging, neuropsychology, and neurophysiology evaluations were analyzed with regards to motor and behavioral control, goal achievement, and patient and caregivers' expectations. RESULTS: Four male patients (mean age 13 years) underwent DBS implantation between 2011 and 2018. Three patients received double bilateral DBS electrodes within the posteroventral GPi and the anteromedial GPi, whereas one patient had bilateral electrodes placed in the posteroventral GPi only. Median follow-up was 47.5 months (range 22-98 months). Functional improvement was observed in all patients and discussed in relation to previous reports. Analysis of structural connectivity revealed significant correlation between the involvement of specific cortical regions and clinical outcome. CONCLUSION: Combined bilateral stimulation of the anteromedial and posteroventral GPi may be considered as an option for managing refractory dystonia and self-harm behavior in LNS patients. A multidisciplinary team-based approach is essential for patient selection and management, to support children and families, to achieve functional improvement and alleviate the overall disease burden for patients and caregivers.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a rare and debilitating condition characterized by dystonia and self-mutilating behavior. In order to shed light on the pathophysiology of dystonia, we report the pallidal electrophysiological activity recorded in two patients during deep brain stimulation surgery (DBS). METHODS: Microrecordings were performed on 162 neurons along four tracks aimed at the right and left anterior (limbic) and posterior (motor) globus pallidus internus (GPI). RESULTS: Regardless of the anesthetic agent used (propofol or sevoflurane), both patients showed similar neurons firing rates in the four regions studied, namely the limbic and motor portions of the globus pallidus externus (GPE) or GPI. In both patients, firing rates were similar in the GPE (12.2+/-1.8 Hz, N=38) and GPI (13.2+/-1.0 Hz, N=83) portions of the limbic track, while the motor GPE fired at a higher frequency (23.8+/-2.7 Hz, N=18) than the motor GPI (12.5+/-1.4 Hz, N=23). CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that light propofol or sevoflurane anesthesia influences pallidal activity in a similar way. Electrophysiological recordings suggest that Lesch-Nyhan syndrome might be characterized by analogous firing frequencies in the limbic GPE and GPI while motor GPE would tend to fire at higher rate than the motor GPI. It is therefore tempting to suggest that the symptoms that are observed in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome might result from motor GPI inhibition. SIGNIFICANCE: This observation may confirm the Albin and Delong's model of the basal nuclei in hypokinetic and hyperkinetic disorders.",

The aim of this review is to summarize recent research that documents the extended behavioral, neurologic, and neurocognitive phenotype in classic LNS, to describe milder variants of HGprt deficiency that do not self-injure and have less severe neurological and cognitive deficits, and to provide an update on treatment for associated psychiatric and behavioral disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Psychiatric management utilizes combined behavioral and pharmacological treatment in conjunction with protective equipment and dental management to avert self-injury. Pharmacological management focuses on stabilization of mood and anxiety management. S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), a physiological intermediate in methylation and transsulfuration, has shown beneficial effects in carefully selected patients who can tolerate the drug. Deep brain stimulation is shown in several case reports and series to reduce or eliminate self-injury and aggression, and in some cases, modify dystonia. SUMMARY: This review highlights progress in our understanding of the behavioral and neurocognitive phenotype of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (HGprt deficiency) and its variants, describes psychiatric and behavioral management, and discusses prospects for new therapies.",

Following in vitro fertilization (IVF), one to two cells were removed from 3 day cleavage stage embryo and cells were analysed for genetic defects. Embryos diagnosed as unaffected were returned to the uterus and thus the resulting pregnancies were assured to be normal. First babies born after the preimplantation diagnosis were using DNA amplification of Y-linked sequences by PCR to avoid X-linked disease. Several pregnancies were obtained by identifying sex of embryos using dual fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with fluorochrome labelled DNA sequences specific for X- and Y-chromosomes to interphase nuclei. Development of single cell PCR for single gene defects led to diagnose several genetic disorders. Preimplantation diagnosis was successfully achieved for predominant delta 508 deletion causing cystic fibrosis, and pregnancies were also diagnosed for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, Tay-Sachs and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.",

SETTING: UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink. PARTICIPANTS: The analysis included data for 68 897 patients with gout and 554 964 matched patients without gout. Patients were aged >=18 years, registered at UK practices, had >=12 months of clinical data and had data linked with Hospital Episode Statistics. Patients were excluded for history of advanced CKD, juvenile gout, cancer, HIV, tumour lysis syndrome, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome or familial Mediterranean fever. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Advanced CKD was defined as first occurrence of: (1) dialysis, kidney transplant, diagnosis of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) or stage 5 CKD (diagnostic codes in Read system or International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision); (2) estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <10 mL/min/1.73 m2; (3) doubling of serum creatinine from baseline and (4) death associated with CKD. RESULTS: Advanced CKD incidence was higher for patients with gout (8.54 per 1000 patient-years; 95% CI 8.26 to 8.83) versus without gout (4.08; 95% CI 4.00 to 4.16). Gout was associated with higher advanced CKD risk in both unadjusted analysis (HR, 2.00; 95% CI 1.92 to 2.07) and after adjustment (HR, 1.29; 95% CI 1.23 to 1.35). Association was strongest for ESKD (HR, 2.13; 95% CI 1.73 to 2.61) and was present for eGFR <10 mL/min/1.73 m2 (HR, 1.45; 95% CI 1.30 to 1.61) and serum creatinine doubling (HR, 1.13; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.19) but not CKD-associated death (HR, 1.14; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.31). Association of gout with advanced CKD was replicated in propensity-score matched analysis (HR, 1.23; 95% CI 1.17 to 1.29) and analysis limited to patients with incident gout (HR, 1.28; 95% CI 1.22 to 1.35). CONCLUSIONS: Gout is associated with elevated risk of CKD progression. Future studies should investigate whether controlling gout is protective and reduces CKD risk.",

The pathogenetic therapy is based on maintaining high activity of Hg-PRTase by dietary treatment with limited intake of exogenous purines.",

Clinical features displayed by affected boys are particularly severe and disturbing and include hyperuricaemia, Characteristic neurological features including self-mutilation, choreothetosis, spasticity and mental retardation. A couple with a boy diagnosed with LN and a history of pregnancy termination was referred to the Hammersmith Hospital. Their affected son was born in 1982 after an uncomplicated pregnancy and vaginal delivery. Eight subsequent pregnancies had been unsuccessful. There were five therapeutic terminations and three spontaneous abortions, one at least directly caused by the sampling procedure during amniocentesis. From 1989 to 1991 two unsuccessful preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) cycles by sexing were performed by DNA amplification. The mutation was characterized and a nested PCR protocol was designed which allowed the efficient amplification of the affected loci followed by the detection of the mutant allele by restriction digestion. Three PGD cycles were performed using this specific diagnostic test before a successful pregnancy was achieved resulting in the birth of a healthy unaffected baby girl.",

Following in vitro fertilization (IVF), one to two cells were removed from 3 day cleavage stage embryo and cells were analysed for genetic defects. Embryos diagnosed as unaffected were returned to the uterus and thus the resulting pregnancies were assured to be normal. First babies born after the preimplantation diagnosis were using DNA amplification of Y-linked sequences by PCR to avoid X-linked disease. Several pregnancies were obtained by identifying sex of embryos using dual fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with fluorochrome labelled DNA sequences specific for X- and Y-chromosomes to interphase nuclei. Development of single cell PCR for single gene defects led to diagnose several genetic disorders. Preimplantation diagnosis was successfully achieved for predominant delta 508 deletion causing cystic fibrosis, and pregnancies were also diagnosed for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, Tay-Sachs and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.",

                    "abstract": "Research on diagnosis of inherited disease in human embryo before implantation was initiated to help those couples who would prefer to select embryos at this stage rather than during pregnancy. Following in vitro fertilization (IVF), one to two cells were removed from 3 day cleavage stage embryo and cells were analysed for genetic defects. Embryos diagnosed as unaffected were returned to the uterus and thus the resulting pregnancies were assured to be normal. First babies born after the preimplantation diagnosis were using DNA amplification of Y-linked sequences by PCR to avoid X-linked disease. Several pregnancies were obtained by identifying sex of embryos using dual fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with fluorochrome labelled DNA sequences specific for X- and Y-chromosomes to interphase nuclei. Development of single cell PCR for single gene defects led to diagnose several genetic disorders. Preimplantation diagnosis was successfully achieved for predominant delta 508 deletion causing cystic fibrosis, and pregnancies were also diagnosed for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, Tay-Sachs and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.",

The disorder is caused by a wide spectrum of mutations distributed throughout the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene. Female carriers of LN display no clinical symptoms but are at 50% risk of passing on the affected gene to their male offspring. A couple who had a boy with LN were referred to Monash IVF for preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) because the woman had undergone tubal ligation and the couple wanted to have another child. A test was developed for the causative mutation IVS8+6 T-->G mutation based on minisequencing primer extension that also incorporated the co-analysis of an informative tetranucleotide marker in intron 3 of the HPRT gene to identify allelic dropout. All four biopsied embryos from their first IVF cycle were diagnosed as unaffected, and transfer of two embryos in the cohort with the highest morphological quality resulted in a singleton pregnancy and the birth of a healthy girl. Direct mutation detection by mini-sequencing and parallel analysis of an informative linked marker provides an alternative strategy for molecular diagnosis of point mutations that will have useful application in PGD for other single gene disorders.",

                    "abstract": "Background: Lesch-Nyhan disease (LND) is a rare X-linked recessive inborn error of purine metabolism. Late diagnosis of LND may cause significant morbidity. LND cases have never been reported in Indonesia.Case report: A 15-year-old male who had been diagnosed with cerebral palsy was referred to our hospital due to renal failure requiring emergency dialysis. The patient presented with three classic manifestations of LND: increased uric acid levels, neurological disorders, and self-injurious behaviors. LND was suspected because of an abscess-like lump on the left ankle that was confirmed to be a tophus, which had burst and discharged thick masses containing blood, debris, and white crystal materials. The diagnosis of LND was confirmed by the presence of a deletion to exon 1 of the HPRT1 gene. The patient received oral allopurinol daily and treatment for end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which included regular dialysis and subcutaneous administration of erythropoietin. At a 2-month follow-up, he improved clinically with a 71% decrease in uric acid levels after regular dialysis and allopurinol treatment.Conclusion: In developed countries, LND can be diagnosed as early as 3 days after birth. However, diagnosis in the present case was delayed due to the rarity of the disease and the limited number of facilities in Indonesia that offer genetic counseling. Late diagnosis of LND leads to ESRD and irreversible abnormalities. This is the first case of LND presenting with a unique clinical presentation of tophus burst reported in Indonesia.",

The sampled embryos were transferred to recipient mothers and examined on the 14th day of gestation to confirm the accuracy of the preimplantation diagnosis. The diagnosis was sufficiently rapid that freezing of the embryos before transfer was not necessary. Of the embryos diagnosed as HPRT negative all 4 that grew into fetuses were correctly identified as HPRT-deficient males.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Cleavage stage embryo biopsy and preimplantation diagnosis was first reported five years ago. The annual collation of the world figures for centres offering this procedure is important to continually assess the efficiency and success of the biopsy, diagnosis and pregnancies obtained. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data was collected from 14 centres worldwide. The largest series of diagnosis has been performed for those patients carrying X-linked disease where the embryos have been sexed either by PCR or FISH. PCR has also been used for the specific diagnosis of a number of single gene defects, mainly for cystic fibrosis but also for the diagnosis of Lesch Nyhan syndrome, Fragile X, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Tay Sachs, haemophilia and RhD blood typing. RESULTS: For PCR sexing, a total of 62 cycles have been performed with 14 pregnancies, 8 deliveries and 11 babies born. For FISH sexing, 70 cycles have resulted in 15 pregnancies, 8 deliveries and 11 babies born. For the specific diagnosis of single genes defects, a total of 65 cycles resulted in 21 pregnancies, 12 deliveries and 12 babies born. Overall, 197 cycles were performed, with 171 embryo transfers (86%), 50 pregnancies (25% per cycle, 29% per transfer), 28 deliveries and 34 babies born. CONCLUSIONS: New methods are being developed to increase the scope of preimplantation diagnoses that can be offered. From next year, the biochemical and miscarriage rates will also be recorded.",

Affected boys have mental retardation, delayed development, extrapyramidal motor disturbances and self-injuring behavior. As hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been shown to be effective in several neurodevelopmental inborn errors, we hypothesized that it could be favorable in LNS as well. Following a myeloablative conditioning regimen (busulphan 3.2 mg/kg/day for 4 days, cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg/day for 2 days with ATG Thymoglobin 2.5 mg/kg/day for 4 days) an unrelated umbilical cord blood unit was transfused at the age of 2 years. The graft was a 6/6 HLA-matched at HLA-A, B loci by antigen level, and at DRB1 by allelic level typing. Infused total nucleated cell dose was 3.6 x 10e7 per kilogram body weight. Serum HPRT levels reached normal values by the end of the sixth month post transplant. Slow neurodevelopmental improvement seen during the three-year follow-up and the missing self-injuring behavior can be considered as a proof for the presence of enzyme-competent cells behind the blood-brain barrier.",

The disorder is caused by a wide spectrum of mutations distributed throughout the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene. Female carriers of LN display no clinical symptoms but are at 50% risk of passing on the affected gene to their male offspring. A couple who had a boy with LN were referred to Monash IVF for preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) because the woman had undergone tubal ligation and the couple wanted to have another child. A test was developed for the causative mutation IVS8+6 T-->G mutation based on minisequencing primer extension that also incorporated the co-analysis of an informative tetranucleotide marker in intron 3 of the HPRT gene to identify allelic dropout. All four biopsied embryos from their first IVF cycle were diagnosed as unaffected, and transfer of two embryos in the cohort with the highest morphological quality resulted in a singleton pregnancy and the birth of a healthy girl. Direct mutation detection by mini-sequencing and parallel analysis of an informative linked marker provides an alternative strategy for molecular diagnosis of point mutations that will have useful application in PGD for other single gene disorders.",

Goals were to improve wheelchair positioning for school attendance and to reduce the use of restraints for comfort. Intrathecal baclofen was implanted twice and decreased the hypertonia, but both were explanted because of infection. Deep-brain stimulation was initiated 2.5 years ago, and since that time, comfort and function have improved and caregiver burden has decreased. Improvements in dystonia with deep-brain stimulation have also occurred, and self-injurious behaviors have resolved.",

Patients were aged >=18 years, registered at UK practices, had >=12 months of clinical data and had data linked with Hospital Episode Statistics. Patients were excluded for history of advanced CKD, juvenile gout, cancer, HIV, tumour lysis syndrome, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome or familial Mediterranean fever. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Advanced CKD was defined as first occurrence of: (1) dialysis, kidney transplant, diagnosis of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) or stage 5 CKD (diagnostic codes in Read system or International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision); (2) estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <10 mL/min/1.73 m2; (3) doubling of serum creatinine from baseline and (4) death associated with CKD. RESULTS: Advanced CKD incidence was higher for patients with gout (8.54 per 1000 patient-years; 95% CI 8.26 to 8.83) versus without gout (4.08; 95% CI 4.00 to 4.16).

The disorder is caused by a wide spectrum of mutations distributed throughout the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene. Female carriers of LN display no clinical symptoms but are at 50% risk of passing on the affected gene to their male offspring. A couple who had a boy with LN were referred to Monash IVF for preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) because the woman had undergone tubal ligation and the couple wanted to have another child. A test was developed for the causative mutation IVS8+6 T-->G mutation based on minisequencing primer extension that also incorporated the co-analysis of an informative tetranucleotide marker in intron 3 of the HPRT gene to identify allelic dropout. All four biopsied embryos from their first IVF cycle were diagnosed as unaffected, and transfer of two embryos in the cohort with the highest morphological quality resulted in a singleton pregnancy and the birth of a healthy girl. Direct mutation detection by mini-sequencing and parallel analysis of an informative linked marker provides an alternative strategy for molecular diagnosis of point mutations that will have useful application in PGD for other single gene disorders.",

Affected boys have mental retardation, delayed development, extrapyramidal motor disturbances and self-injuring behavior. As hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been shown to be effective in several neurodevelopmental inborn errors, we hypothesized that it could be favorable in LNS as well. Following a myeloablative conditioning regimen (busulphan 3.2 mg/kg/day for 4 days, cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg/day for 2 days with ATG Thymoglobin 2.5 mg/kg/day for 4 days) an unrelated umbilical cord blood unit was transfused at the age of 2 years. The graft was a 6/6 HLA-matched at HLA-A, B loci by antigen level, and at DRB1 by allelic level typing. Infused total nucleated cell dose was 3.6 x 10e7 per kilogram body weight. Serum HPRT levels reached normal values by the end of the sixth month post transplant. Slow neurodevelopmental improvement seen during the three-year follow-up and the missing self-injuring behavior can be considered as a proof for the presence of enzyme-competent cells behind the blood-brain barrier.",

LND cases have never been reported in Indonesia.Case report: A 15-year-old male who had been diagnosed with cerebral palsy was referred to our hospital due to renal failure requiring emergency dialysis. The patient presented with three classic manifestations of LND: increased uric acid levels, neurological disorders, and self-injurious behaviors. LND was suspected because of an abscess-like lump on the left ankle that was confirmed to be a tophus, which had burst and discharged thick masses containing blood, debris, and white crystal materials. The diagnosis of LND was confirmed by the presence of a deletion to exon 1 of the HPRT1 gene. The patient received oral allopurinol daily and treatment for end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which included regular dialysis and subcutaneous administration of erythropoietin. At a 2-month follow-up, he improved clinically with a 71% decrease in uric acid levels after regular dialysis and allopurinol treatment.Conclusion: In developed countries, LND can be diagnosed as early as 3 days after birth. However, diagnosis in the present case was delayed due to the rarity of the disease and the limited number of facilities in Indonesia that offer genetic counseling. Late diagnosis of LND leads to ESRD and irreversible abnormalities. This is the first case of LND presenting with a unique clinical presentation of tophus burst reported in Indonesia.",

Following in vitro fertilization (IVF), one to two cells were removed from 3 day cleavage stage embryo and cells were analysed for genetic defects. Embryos diagnosed as unaffected were returned to the uterus and thus the resulting pregnancies were assured to be normal. First babies born after the preimplantation diagnosis were using DNA amplification of Y-linked sequences by PCR to avoid X-linked disease. Several pregnancies were obtained by identifying sex of embryos using dual fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with fluorochrome labelled DNA sequences specific for X- and Y-chromosomes to interphase nuclei. Development of single cell PCR for single gene defects led to diagnose several genetic disorders. Preimplantation diagnosis was successfully achieved for predominant delta 508 deletion causing cystic fibrosis, and pregnancies were also diagnosed for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, Tay-Sachs and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.",

The disorder is caused by a wide spectrum of mutations distributed throughout the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene. Female carriers of LN display no clinical symptoms but are at 50% risk of passing on the affected gene to their male offspring. A couple who had a boy with LN were referred to Monash IVF for preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) because the woman had undergone tubal ligation and the couple wanted to have another child. A test was developed for the causative mutation IVS8+6 T-->G mutation based on minisequencing primer extension that also incorporated the co-analysis of an informative tetranucleotide marker in intron 3 of the HPRT gene to identify allelic dropout. All four biopsied embryos from their first IVF cycle were diagnosed as unaffected, and transfer of two embryos in the cohort with the highest morphological quality resulted in a singleton pregnancy and the birth of a healthy girl. Direct mutation detection by mini-sequencing and parallel analysis of an informative linked marker provides an alternative strategy for molecular diagnosis of point mutations that will have useful application in PGD for other single gene disorders.",

Inhalational anesthesia has been frequently used in LNS patients undergoing surgery. Characteristic compulsive self-injurious behavior and high risk of emesis may hinder inhalational induction. Propofol may be beneficial for these patients because of its easy and rapid titration for anesthetic depth during induction, early recovery from anesthesia, and antiemetic effect as well as uricosuric effect. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 16-year-old male adolescent was scheduled for percutaneous nephrolithotomy. He exhibited poorly controlled muscle, self-injurious behaviors and intellectual disability. DIAGNOSIS: The patient presented with neurodevelopmental delay in the first year of life, and was diagnosed with LNS, with a substitution of phenylalanine to leucine in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) 1 gene on the X-chromosome at 3 years of age. INTERVENTIONS: Total intravenous anesthesia was used for induction and maintenance of anesthesia with propofol and remifentanil using target-controlled infusion. OUTCOMES: Time to recovery of consciousness was prolonged after uneventful surgery. Serum uric acid levels gradually increased during postoperative period. LESSONS: Propofol anesthesia using target-controlled infusion does not provide significant clinical advantages in rapid emergence from anesthesia and management of hyperuricemia in LNS patients undergoing urological surgery.",

The aim of this review is to summarize recent research that documents the extended behavioral, neurologic, and neurocognitive phenotype in classic LNS, to describe milder variants of HGprt deficiency that do not self-injure and have less severe neurological and cognitive deficits, and to provide an update on treatment for associated psychiatric and behavioral disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Psychiatric management utilizes combined behavioral and pharmacological treatment in conjunction with protective equipment and dental management to avert self-injury. Pharmacological management focuses on stabilization of mood and anxiety management. S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), a physiological intermediate in methylation and transsulfuration, has shown beneficial effects in carefully selected patients who can tolerate the drug. Deep brain stimulation is shown in several case reports and series to reduce or eliminate self-injury and aggression, and in some cases, modify dystonia. SUMMARY: This review highlights progress in our understanding of the behavioral and neurocognitive phenotype of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (HGprt deficiency) and its variants, describes psychiatric and behavioral management, and discusses prospects for new therapies.",

LND cases have never been reported in Indonesia.Case report: A 15-year-old male who had been diagnosed with cerebral palsy was referred to our hospital due to renal failure requiring emergency dialysis. The patient presented with three classic manifestations of LND: increased uric acid levels, neurological disorders, and self-injurious behaviors. LND was suspected because of an abscess-like lump on the left ankle that was confirmed to be a tophus, which had burst and discharged thick masses containing blood, debris, and white crystal materials. The diagnosis of LND was confirmed by the presence of a deletion to exon 1 of the HPRT1 gene. The patient received oral allopurinol daily and treatment for end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which included regular dialysis and subcutaneous administration of erythropoietin. At a 2-month follow-up, he improved clinically with a 71% decrease in uric acid levels after regular dialysis and allopurinol treatment.Conclusion: In developed countries, LND can be diagnosed as early as 3 days after birth. However, diagnosis in the present case was delayed due to the rarity of the disease and the limited number of facilities in Indonesia that offer genetic counseling. Late diagnosis of LND leads to ESRD and irreversible abnormalities. This is the first case of LND presenting with a unique clinical presentation of tophus burst reported in Indonesia.",

The mechanism behind the severe self-mutilating behavior exhibited by patients with LNS is unknown and remains one of the greatest obstacles in providing care to these patients. This report describes a 10-year-old male child with confirmed LNS who was treated for self-mutilation of his hands, tongue, and lips with repeated botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) injections into the bilateral masseters.

Clinical features displayed by affected boys are particularly severe and disturbing and include hyperuricaemia, Characteristic neurological features including self-mutilation, choreothetosis, spasticity and mental retardation. A couple with a boy diagnosed with LN and a history of pregnancy termination was referred to the Hammersmith Hospital. Their affected son was born in 1982 after an uncomplicated pregnancy and vaginal delivery. Eight subsequent pregnancies had been unsuccessful. There were five therapeutic terminations and three spontaneous abortions, one at least directly caused by the sampling procedure during amniocentesis. From 1989 to 1991 two unsuccessful preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) cycles by sexing were performed by DNA amplification. The mutation was characterized and a nested PCR protocol was designed which allowed the efficient amplification of the affected loci followed by the detection of the mutant allele by restriction digestion. Three PGD cycles were performed using this specific diagnostic test before a successful pregnancy was achieved resulting in the birth of a healthy unaffected baby girl.",

LND cases have never been reported in Indonesia.Case report: A 15-year-old male who had been diagnosed with cerebral palsy was referred to our hospital due to renal failure requiring emergency dialysis. The patient presented with three classic manifestations of LND: increased uric acid levels, neurological disorders, and self-injurious behaviors. LND was suspected because of an abscess-like lump on the left ankle that was confirmed to be a tophus, which had burst and discharged thick masses containing blood, debris, and white crystal materials. The diagnosis of LND was confirmed by the presence of a deletion to exon 1 of the HPRT1 gene. The patient received oral allopurinol daily and treatment for end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which included regular dialysis and subcutaneous administration of erythropoietin. At a 2-month follow-up, he improved clinically with a 71% decrease in uric acid levels after regular dialysis and allopurinol treatment.Conclusion: In developed countries, LND can be diagnosed as early as 3 days after birth. However, diagnosis in the present case was delayed due to the rarity of the disease and the limited number of facilities in Indonesia that offer genetic counseling. Late diagnosis of LND leads to ESRD and irreversible abnormalities. This is the first case of LND presenting with a unique clinical presentation of tophus burst reported in Indonesia.",

DEVELOPMENT: Lesch Nyhan syndrome is an X linked inherited disorder of purine metabolism caused by the deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). Clinical features include overproduction of uric acid and a neurologic syndrome related to the severity of the enzyme defect. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with xanthine oxidase inhibitors is effective for the control of the elevated renal excretion of uric acid, but there is no specific treatment for the neurologic symptoms. Due to the low frequency of the syndrome and to the incomplete understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the neurologic manifestations, the treatments employed are merely symptomatic.",

Inhalational anesthesia has been frequently used in LNS patients undergoing surgery. Characteristic compulsive self-injurious behavior and high risk of emesis may hinder inhalational induction. Propofol may be beneficial for these patients because of its easy and rapid titration for anesthetic depth during induction, early recovery from anesthesia, and antiemetic effect as well as uricosuric effect. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 16-year-old male adolescent was scheduled for percutaneous nephrolithotomy. He exhibited poorly controlled muscle, self-injurious behaviors and intellectual disability. DIAGNOSIS: The patient presented with neurodevelopmental delay in the first year of life, and was diagnosed with LNS, with a substitution of phenylalanine to leucine in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) 1 gene on the X-chromosome at 3 years of age. INTERVENTIONS: Total intravenous anesthesia was used for induction and maintenance of anesthesia with propofol and remifentanil using target-controlled infusion. OUTCOMES: Time to recovery of consciousness was prolonged after uneventful surgery. Serum uric acid levels gradually increased during postoperative period. LESSONS: Propofol anesthesia using target-controlled infusion does not provide significant clinical advantages in rapid emergence from anesthesia and management of hyperuricemia in LNS patients undergoing urological surgery.",

DEVELOPMENT: Lesch Nyhan syndrome is an X linked inherited disorder of purine metabolism caused by the deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). Clinical features include overproduction of uric acid and a neurologic syndrome related to the severity of the enzyme defect. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with xanthine oxidase inhibitors is effective for the control of the elevated renal excretion of uric acid, but there is no specific treatment for the neurologic symptoms. Due to the low frequency of the syndrome and to the incomplete understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the neurologic manifestations, the treatments employed are merely symptomatic.",

The mechanism behind this severe self-mutilating behavior is unknown, and is one of the main challenges in the management of this condition. We here report the case of a 30-year-old man with a confirmed diagnosis of LNS who was successfully treated for self-mutilation of his lips with repeated botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) injections in the facial perioral muscles. Our findings suggest that treatment with BTX-A helped reduce self-abusive behavior in this patient.

                    "abstract": "Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LN) is a severe X-linked disorder of males characterized by hyperuricaemia, choreoathetosis, spasticity, mental retardation and self-mutilation. The disorder is caused by a wide spectrum of mutations distributed throughout the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene. Female carriers of LN display no clinical symptoms but are at 50% risk of passing on the affected gene to their male offspring. A couple who had a boy with LN were referred to Monash IVF for preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) because the woman had undergone tubal ligation and the couple wanted to have another child. A test was developed for the causative mutation IVS8+6 T-->G mutation based on minisequencing primer extension that also incorporated the co-analysis of an informative tetranucleotide marker in intron 3 of the HPRT gene to identify allelic dropout. All four biopsied embryos from their first IVF cycle were diagnosed as unaffected, and transfer of two embryos in the cohort with the highest morphological quality resulted in a singleton pregnancy and the birth of a healthy girl. Direct mutation detection by mini-sequencing and parallel analysis of an informative linked marker provides an alternative strategy for molecular diagnosis of point mutations that will have useful application in PGD for other single gene disorders.",

The aim of this review is to summarize recent research that documents the extended behavioral, neurologic, and neurocognitive phenotype in classic LNS, to describe milder variants of HGprt deficiency that do not self-injure and have less severe neurological and cognitive deficits, and to provide an update on treatment for associated psychiatric and behavioral disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Psychiatric management utilizes combined behavioral and pharmacological treatment in conjunction with protective equipment and dental management to avert self-injury. Pharmacological management focuses on stabilization of mood and anxiety management. S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), a physiological intermediate in methylation and transsulfuration, has shown beneficial effects in carefully selected patients who can tolerate the drug. Deep brain stimulation is shown in several case reports and series to reduce or eliminate self-injury and aggression, and in some cases, modify dystonia. SUMMARY: This review highlights progress in our understanding of the behavioral and neurocognitive phenotype of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (HGprt deficiency) and its variants, describes psychiatric and behavioral management, and discusses prospects for new therapies.",

The aim of this review is to summarize recent research that documents the extended behavioral, neurologic, and neurocognitive phenotype in classic LNS, to describe milder variants of HGprt deficiency that do not self-injure and have less severe neurological and cognitive deficits, and to provide an update on treatment for associated psychiatric and behavioral disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Psychiatric management utilizes combined behavioral and pharmacological treatment in conjunction with protective equipment and dental management to avert self-injury. Pharmacological management focuses on stabilization of mood and anxiety management. S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), a physiological intermediate in methylation and transsulfuration, has shown beneficial effects in carefully selected patients who can tolerate the drug. Deep brain stimulation is shown in several case reports and series to reduce or eliminate self-injury and aggression, and in some cases, modify dystonia. SUMMARY: This review highlights progress in our understanding of the behavioral and neurocognitive phenotype of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (HGprt deficiency) and its variants, describes psychiatric and behavioral management, and discusses prospects for new therapies.",

Bronchoscopy revealed tracheomalacia of the cresent moon type. He lost his weight, and his general condition gradually worsened. Four months post-tracheostomy, he died of massive hemoptysis from a tracheobrachicephalic artery fistula. Many patients with LNS have renal failure and pneumonitis, whereas occasional cases are complicated by convulsions, recurrent coma, abnormalities of respiration, and sudden death. The etiology of sudden death is not clear. Although tracheomalacia, to our knowledge, has not been described in the literature, it may be a clinical feature of LNS associated with abnormal respiration and sudden death. Tracheobrachiocephalic artery fistula is common in patients with neuromuscular disorders and a chronic tracheostomy tube. Caution is required in LNS patients with opisthotonic extensor spasms of the neck and trunk, chronic bronchitis, and malnutrition.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the association between gout and risk of advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). DESIGN: Retrospective matched cohort study. SETTING: UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink. PARTICIPANTS: The analysis included data for 68 897 patients with gout and 554 964 matched patients without gout. Patients were aged >=18 years, registered at UK practices, had >=12 months of clinical data and had data linked with Hospital Episode Statistics. Patients were excluded for history of advanced CKD, juvenile gout, cancer, HIV, tumour lysis syndrome, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome or familial Mediterranean fever. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Advanced CKD was defined as first occurrence of: (1) dialysis, kidney transplant, diagnosis of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) or stage 5 CKD (diagnostic codes in Read system or International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision); (2) estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <10 mL/min/1.73 m2; (3) doubling of serum creatinine from baseline and (4) death associated with CKD. RESULTS: Advanced CKD incidence was higher for patients with gout (8.54 per 1000 patient-years; 95% CI 8.26 to 8.83) versus without gout (4.08; 95% CI 4.00 to 4.16). Gout was associated with higher advanced CKD risk in both unadjusted analysis (HR, 2.00; 95% CI 1.92 to 2.07) and after adjustment (HR, 1.29; 95% CI 1.23 to 1.35). Association was strongest for ESKD (HR, 2.13; 95% CI 1.73 to 2.61) and was present for eGFR <10 mL/min/1.73 m2 (HR, 1.45; 95% CI 1.30 to 1.61) and serum creatinine doubling (HR, 1.13; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.19) but not CKD-associated death (HR, 1.14; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.31). Association of gout with advanced CKD was replicated in propensity-score matched analysis (HR, 1.23; 95% CI 1.17 to 1.29) and analysis limited to patients with incident gout (HR, 1.28; 95% CI 1.22 to 1.35). CONCLUSIONS: Gout is associated with elevated risk of CKD progression. Future studies should investigate whether controlling gout is protective and reduces CKD risk.",

The aim of this review is to summarize recent research that documents the extended behavioral, neurologic, and neurocognitive phenotype in classic LNS, to describe milder variants of HGprt deficiency that do not self-injure and have less severe neurological and cognitive deficits, and to provide an update on treatment for associated psychiatric and behavioral disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Psychiatric management utilizes combined behavioral and pharmacological treatment in conjunction with protective equipment and dental management to avert self-injury. Pharmacological management focuses on stabilization of mood and anxiety management. S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), a physiological intermediate in methylation and transsulfuration, has shown beneficial effects in carefully selected patients who can tolerate the drug. Deep brain stimulation is shown in several case reports and series to reduce or eliminate self-injury and aggression, and in some cases, modify dystonia. SUMMARY: This review highlights progress in our understanding of the behavioral and neurocognitive phenotype of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (HGprt deficiency) and its variants, describes psychiatric and behavioral management, and discusses prospects for new therapies.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a rare and debilitating condition characterized by dystonia and self-mutilating behavior. In order to shed light on the pathophysiology of dystonia, we report the pallidal electrophysiological activity recorded in two patients during deep brain stimulation surgery (DBS). METHODS: Microrecordings were performed on 162 neurons along four tracks aimed at the right and left anterior (limbic) and posterior (motor) globus pallidus internus (GPI). RESULTS: Regardless of the anesthetic agent used (propofol or sevoflurane), both patients showed similar neurons firing rates in the four regions studied, namely the limbic and motor portions of the globus pallidus externus (GPE) or GPI. In both patients, firing rates were similar in the GPE (12.2+/-1.8 Hz, N=38) and GPI (13.2+/-1.0 Hz, N=83) portions of the limbic track, while the motor GPE fired at a higher frequency (23.8+/-2.7 Hz, N=18) than the motor GPI (12.5+/-1.4 Hz, N=23). CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that light propofol or sevoflurane anesthesia influences pallidal activity in a similar way. Electrophysiological recordings suggest that Lesch-Nyhan syndrome might be characterized by analogous firing frequencies in the limbic GPE and GPI while motor GPE would tend to fire at higher rate than the motor GPI. It is therefore tempting to suggest that the symptoms that are observed in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome might result from motor GPI inhibition. SIGNIFICANCE: This observation may confirm the Albin and Delong's model of the basal nuclei in hypokinetic and hyperkinetic disorders.",

To shed light on this complex issue, we have taken the opportunity to record the response of globus pallidus internus (GPi) neurones to 100 Hz stimulations in a case of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS) where four pallidal electrodes were implanted. Three types of response were observed, 2/19 neurones were unaffected by DBS. About 7/19 neurones were inhibited during DBS stimulation and 10/19 neurones were excited during DBS stimulation. Both effects ceased when DBS was turned off. Inhibited neurones were situated lower that exited ones on the trajectory (1.25 and 4.65 mm above the center of GPi respectively). These observations suggest that locally DBS induces a reversible inhibition of neurone firing rate while at the same time distantly exciting the main afferents to and/or efferents from the GPi. Both actions would result in a strong GPi inhibition that does not preclude increased outflow from the GPi.",

Some cases have reported clinical results of DBS in LNS thus far. This systematic review was conducted to comprehensively summarize cases of LNS treated with DBS and evaluate the efficacy and safety of DBS in LNS. Eight publications covering 12 LNS patients were included in this review. DBS improved dystonia of the LNS to varying degrees. All the included cases achieved partial or complete control of self-injurious behavior (SIB). Overall, DBS is a promising treatment for both motor and behavior disorders of LNS patients, but the results reported thus far have varied widely, especially for motor outcomes. The ultimate clinical benefits in LNS patients were still unpredictable. DBS-related complications were rather common, which raised questions about the safety of the procedure in LNS. More research is needed to further clarify the safety and effectiveness of this treatment.",

Bronchoscopy revealed tracheomalacia of the cresent moon type. He lost his weight, and his general condition gradually worsened. Four months post-tracheostomy, he died of massive hemoptysis from a tracheobrachicephalic artery fistula. Many patients with LNS have renal failure and pneumonitis, whereas occasional cases are complicated by convulsions, recurrent coma, abnormalities of respiration, and sudden death. The etiology of sudden death is not clear. Although tracheomalacia, to our knowledge, has not been described in the literature, it may be a clinical feature of LNS associated with abnormal respiration and sudden death. Tracheobrachiocephalic artery fistula is common in patients with neuromuscular disorders and a chronic tracheostomy tube. Caution is required in LNS patients with opisthotonic extensor spasms of the neck and trunk, chronic bronchitis, and malnutrition.",

A couple with a boy diagnosed with LN and a history of pregnancy termination was referred to the Hammersmith Hospital. Their affected son was born in 1982 after an uncomplicated pregnancy and vaginal delivery. Eight subsequent pregnancies had been unsuccessful. There were five therapeutic terminations and three spontaneous abortions, one at least directly caused by the sampling procedure during amniocentesis. From 1989 to 1991 two unsuccessful preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) cycles by sexing were performed by DNA amplification. The mutation was characterized and a nested PCR protocol was designed which allowed the efficient amplification of the affected loci followed by the detection of the mutant allele by restriction digestion. Three PGD cycles were performed using this specific diagnostic test before a successful pregnancy was achieved resulting in the birth of a healthy unaffected baby girl.",

                    "abstract": "The use of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for the treatment of genetic diseases with neurologic involvement has yielded mixed results. We have employed a mouse model of Lesch-Nyhan disease (LND) to assess the efficacy of BMT in ameliorating the neurologic manifestations of the disease. Adult HPRT-deficient mice exhibit a measurable decrease in striatal dopamine levels and a hypersensitivity to amphetamine. Marrow-ablated adult HPRT-deficient mice were transplanted with marrow from congenic HPRT-expressing mice. BMT altered neither the neurochemical nor the behavioral phenotypes in either HPRT-positive or HPRT-deficient mice. Barring any important species differences, these results suggest that BMT in its present form may not be an effective therapy for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.",

The immunologic immaturity of cord blood cells confers peculiar characteristics to these hematopoietic precursors. Autopsy reports from January 1, 1988, through June 30, 1998, were searched for patients who had received an umbilical cord blood transplant (UCBT). Thirty-two patients (19 male, 13 female) were identified with a mean age at autopsy of 13.0 years with a range from 1 to 52 years. Most patients (24) underwent UCBT for treatment of a malignant neoplasm, while the remainder were treated for immunodeficiencies (4), Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (2), Hurler syndrome (1), and Diamond-Blackfan syndrome (1). Sixteen patients had at least 1 infectious complication, and 8 patients had multiple infections. Organisms included mycoses (7 patients), viruses (8 patients), bacteria (3 patients), and Toxoplasma (2 patients). Hemorrhagic complications, such as intra-alveolar hemorrhage and gastrointestinal tract hemorrhage, were found in 24 patients. Other frequent findings at autopsy included diffuse alveolar damage (15 patients), hepatic veno-occlusive disease (11 patients), and acute or chronic graft-vs-host disease (9 patients). Patients who have received UCBT represent a unique population of immunosuppressed patients.
