16138673	Botulinum toxin as a novel treatment for self-mutilation in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.	Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS) is an X-linked recessive disorder resulting from a deficiency of the metabolic enzyme hypozanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). This syndrome presents with abnormal metabolic and neurological manifestations including hyperuricemia, mental retardation*, spastic cerebral palsy (CP), dystonia, and self-mutilation. The mechanism behind the severe self-mutilating behavior exhibited by patients with LNS is unknown and remains one of the greatest obstacles in providing care to these patients. This report describes a 10-year-old male child with confirmed LNS who was treated for self-mutilation of his hands, tongue, and lips with repeated botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) injections into the bilateral masseters. Our findings suggest that treatment with BTX-A affects both the central and peripheral nervous systems, resulting in reduced self-abusive behavior in this patient.
9051548	Use of propofol anesthesia during outpatient radiographic imaging studies in patients with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.	Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a rare, x-linked, recessive disorder of purine metabolism resulting in hyperuricemia, spasticity, choreoathetosis, dystonia, self-injurious behavior, and aggression, without significant cognitive impairment. Anesthetic management of inpatients who demonstrate classic manifestations of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome and require surgical interventions have been described. There are no guidelines in the literature addressing the anesthetic management of the outpatient with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Specifically, sudden, unexplained death, abnormalities in respiration, apnea, severe bradycardia, and an increased incidence of vomiting and chronic pulmonary aspiration may preclude this patient population from receiving anesthesia for outpatient procedures. General anesthesia with spontaneous ventilation was performed for diagnostic, radiographic imaging in 11 outpatients with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome using intravenous propofol. A bolus dose of 1.5 to 2.0 mg/kg propofol was followed by maintenance doses of 60 to 160 mcg/kg/min. Results during and following sedation indicated end-tidal carbon dioxide ranges between 34 mmHg and 59 mmHg. Respiratory rates were never below 10 breaths/min and no partial/complete airway obstruction or labored breathing was clinically evident. Hemodynamics were within 30% of presedation values. No patient demonstrated nausea, vomiting, or pulmonary aspiration. Baseline neuropsychologic status was achieved following sedation, and patients were discharged from the hospital 35 to 90 minutes after sedation was completed. Potential risks and benefits of using propofol in this patient population are discussed.

16530134	Electrophysiological characteristics of limbic and motor globus pallidus internus (GPI) neurons in two cases of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.	OBJECTIVE: Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a rare and debilitating condition characterized by dystonia and self-mutilating behavior. In order to shed light on the pathophysiology of dystonia, we report the pallidal electrophysiological activity recorded in two patients during deep brain stimulation surgery (DBS). METHODS: Microrecordings were performed on 162 neurons along four tracks aimed at the right and left anterior (limbic) and posterior (motor) globus pallidus internus (GPI). RESULTS: Regardless of the anesthetic agent used (propofol or sevoflurane), both patients showed similar neurons firing rates in the four regions studied, namely the limbic and motor portions of the globus pallidus externus (GPE) or GPI. In both patients, firing rates were similar in the GPE (12.2+/-1.8 Hz, N=38) and GPI (13.2+/-1.0 Hz, N=83) portions of the limbic track, while the motor GPE fired at a higher frequency (23.8+/-2.7 Hz, N=18) than the motor GPI (12.5+/-1.4 Hz, N=23). CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that light propofol or sevoflurane anesthesia influences pallidal activity in a similar way. Electrophysiological recordings suggest that Lesch-Nyhan syndrome might be characterized by analogous firing frequencies in the limbic GPE and GPI while motor GPE would tend to fire at higher rate than the motor GPI. It is therefore tempting to suggest that the symptoms that are observed in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome might result from motor GPI inhibition. SIGNIFICANCE: This observation may confirm the Albin and Delong's model of the basal nuclei in hypokinetic and hyperkinetic disorders.
10694659	Successful preimplantation genetic diagnosis for sex Link Lesch--Nyhan Syndrome using specific diagnosis.	Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LN) is a severe X-linked recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (HRT). Clinical features displayed by affected boys are particularly severe and disturbing and include hyperuricaemia, Characteristic neurological features including self-mutilation, choreothetosis, spasticity and mental retardation. A couple with a boy diagnosed with LN and a history of pregnancy termination was referred to the Hammersmith Hospital. Their affected son was born in 1982 after an uncomplicated pregnancy and vaginal delivery. Eight subsequent pregnancies had been unsuccessful. There were five therapeutic terminations and three spontaneous abortions, one at least directly caused by the sampling procedure during amniocentesis. From 1989 to 1991 two unsuccessful preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) cycles by sexing were performed by DNA amplification. The mutation was characterized and a nested PCR protocol was designed which allowed the efficient amplification of the affected loci followed by the detection of the mutant allele by restriction digestion. Three PGD cycles were performed using this specific diagnostic test before a successful pregnancy was achieved resulting in the birth of a healthy unaffected baby girl.

3705857	[Pathogenetic mechanisms and therapy of a subclinical form of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome].	The results of clinical, experimental psychological and biochemical studies of patients with a subclinical form of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome suggested a reduction of the inhibitory influence of the caudate nucleus due to incomplete genetic defect of Hg-PRTase and related disorders of other types of metabolism in the area of basal ganglia as one of the links of pathogenesis. The pathogenetic therapy is based on maintaining high activity of Hg-PRTase by dietary treatment with limited intake of exogenous purines.
12436387	[Treatment of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome].	AIM: We have reviewed the treatments employed to alleviate the different manifestations of the Lesch Nyhan syndrome, the adverse reactions related to these treatments, and the prospectives of future therapeutic approaches now under active research. DEVELOPMENT: Lesch Nyhan syndrome is an X linked inherited disorder of purine metabolism caused by the deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). Clinical features include overproduction of uric acid and a neurologic syndrome related to the severity of the enzyme defect. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with xanthine oxidase inhibitors is effective for the control of the elevated renal excretion of uric acid, but there is no specific treatment for the neurologic symptoms. Due to the low frequency of the syndrome and to the incomplete understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the neurologic manifestations, the treatments employed are merely symptomatic.
11693008	Prevention of self-mutilation in patients with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome: review of literature.	There have been no standard methods established to prevent the self-mutilation seen in LNS. Preventive treatment must be developed, therefore, for each patient based on clinical findings. The first method to be utilized should be a nonsurgical splint or mouth guard. If it proves to be unsuccessful then the benefits of surgical procedures should be considered. In the future, the use of medication, such as carbamazepine, may prove to restructure the current approach advocated by the literature today.

32573906	Deep Brain Stimulation of the Internal Pallidum in Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome: Clinical Outcomes and Connectivity Analysis.	BACKGROUND: Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase enzyme. It manifests during infancy with compulsive self-mutilation behavior associated with disabling generalized dystonia and dyskinesia. Clinical management of these patients poses an enormous challenge for medical teams and carers. OBJECTIVES: We report our experience with bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) in the management of this complex disorder. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Preoperative and postoperative functional assessment data prospectively collected by a multidisciplinary pediatric complex motor disorders team, including imaging, neuropsychology, and neurophysiology evaluations were analyzed with regards to motor and behavioral control, goal achievement, and patient and caregivers' expectations. RESULTS: Four male patients (mean age 13 years) underwent DBS implantation between 2011 and 2018. Three patients received double bilateral DBS electrodes within the posteroventral GPi and the anteromedial GPi, whereas one patient had bilateral electrodes placed in the posteroventral GPi only. Median follow-up was 47.5 months (range 22-98 months). Functional improvement was observed in all patients and discussed in relation to previous reports. Analysis of structural connectivity revealed significant correlation between the involvement of specific cortical regions and clinical outcome. CONCLUSION: Combined bilateral stimulation of the anteromedial and posteroventral GPi may be considered as an option for managing refractory dystonia and self-harm behavior in LNS patients. A multidisciplinary team-based approach is essential for patient selection and management, to support children and families, to achieve functional improvement and alleviate the overall disease burden for patients and caregivers.
21331772	Urine alkalinization may be enough for the treatment of bilateral renal pelvis stones associated with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.	Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a rare sex-linked disorder of purine metabolism that is caused by a mutation in the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene which causes marked hyperuricemia and hyperuricosuria, with signs of gouty arthritis and uric acid stone disease in early childhood. We report a case of renal pelvis calculi which was dissolved within 10 days of urine alkalinization and hydration.
1491633	Serotonin-GABA treatment is hypothesized for self-injury in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.	The self-injurious movements of Lesch-Nyhan patients are considered extremely severe and currently intractable. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a genetic disorder of purine metabolism resulting in several abnormalities, one of which is elevated levels of xanthine. The author reasons that elevated plasma xanthine sets off a chain of events that produce excessive endogenous convulsants and diminished endogenous anticonvulsants. Treatment is proposed for self-injury in Lesch-Nyhan that entails reducing production of two endogenous convulsants (kynurenine and quinolinic acid) and enhancing two endogenous anticonvulsants (serotonin and gamma aminobutyric acid).
36694014	Deep brain stimulation in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome: a systematic review.	Given the good results of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the treatment of movement disorders, DBS was initially tried to treat Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS) with the aim to alleviate LNS-related dystonia. Some cases have reported clinical results of DBS in LNS thus far. This systematic review was conducted to comprehensively summarize cases of LNS treated with DBS and evaluate the efficacy and safety of DBS in LNS. Eight publications covering 12 LNS patients were included in this review. DBS improved dystonia of the LNS to varying degrees. All the included cases achieved partial or complete control of self-injurious behavior (SIB). Overall, DBS is a promising treatment for both motor and behavior disorders of LNS patients, but the results reported thus far have varied widely, especially for motor outcomes. The ultimate clinical benefits in LNS patients were still unpredictable. DBS-related complications were rather common, which raised questions about the safety of the procedure in LNS. More research is needed to further clarify the safety and effectiveness of this treatment.

12593632	Disappearance of self-mutilating behavior in a patient with lesch-nyhan syndrome after bilateral chronic stimulation of the globus pallidus internus. Case report.	Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS) is an X-linked hereditary disorder caused by a deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase. Patients with this syndrome are characterized by hyperuricemia, self-mutilation, developmental retardation, and movement disorders such as spasticity and dystonia. The authors performed bilateral chronic stimulation of the globus pallidus internus for control of dystonic movements in a 19-year-old man with LNS. His self-mutilating behavior unexpectedly disappeared after chronic stimulation. This is the first case of LNS that has been successfully treated with deep brain stimulation. The findings indicate that neurobehavioral features of this syndrome are either mediated in the basal ganglia pathways or secondary to the dystonia.
8976112	[Complete and partial deficiency of HPRT].	The Lesch-Nyhan syndrome results from a complete or virtually complete deficiency of the purine salvage enzyme, hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT). The disease is characterized by hyperuricemia, choreoathetosis, spasticity, compulsive self-mutilation, and mental retardation. Patients with a partial deficiency of HPRT are spared most of the neurological disorder of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. The specific relationship between HPRT deficiency and the neurological dysfunction in the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is not known, at present. The genetic lesion which result in HPRT deficiency are heterogeneous. About 90 different mutations were found in over 110 families. The DNA-based mutation detection technique can be used for the diagnosis of affected males and for the determination of carrier status of asymptomatic females. This technique is also applicable for the prenatal diagnosis for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Transgenic mice, deficient in HPRT activity, have been obtained but they do not show any neurological dysfunction. After administration of 9-ethyladenine, however, they showed the self-injury behavior.

32846834	Delayed emergence from propofol anesthesia in a patient with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome: A case report.	RATIONALE: Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS) is an X-linked recessive disorder presenting with uric acid overproduction, neurocognitive disability, and behavioral disturbances. Inhalational anesthesia has been frequently used in LNS patients undergoing surgery. Characteristic compulsive self-injurious behavior and high risk of emesis may hinder inhalational induction. Propofol may be beneficial for these patients because of its easy and rapid titration for anesthetic depth during induction, early recovery from anesthesia, and antiemetic effect as well as uricosuric effect. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 16-year-old male adolescent was scheduled for percutaneous nephrolithotomy. He exhibited poorly controlled muscle, self-injurious behaviors and intellectual disability. DIAGNOSIS: The patient presented with neurodevelopmental delay in the first year of life, and was diagnosed with LNS, with a substitution of phenylalanine to leucine in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) 1 gene on the X-chromosome at 3 years of age. INTERVENTIONS: Total intravenous anesthesia was used for induction and maintenance of anesthesia with propofol and remifentanil using target-controlled infusion. OUTCOMES: Time to recovery of consciousness was prolonged after uneventful surgery. Serum uric acid levels gradually increased during postoperative period. LESSONS: Propofol anesthesia using target-controlled infusion does not provide significant clinical advantages in rapid emergence from anesthesia and management of hyperuricemia in LNS patients undergoing urological surgery.
10478138	Autopsy findings in umbilical cord blood transplant recipients.	Human umbilical cord blood stem cells have been used to reconstitute hematopoiesis in patients with malignant and nonmalignant diseases. The immunologic immaturity of cord blood cells confers peculiar characteristics to these hematopoietic precursors. Autopsy reports from January 1, 1988, through June 30, 1998, were searched for patients who had received an umbilical cord blood transplant (UCBT). Thirty-two patients (19 male, 13 female) were identified with a mean age at autopsy of 13.0 years with a range from 1 to 52 years. Most patients (24) underwent UCBT for treatment of a malignant neoplasm, while the remainder were treated for immunodeficiencies (4), Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (2), Hurler syndrome (1), and Diamond-Blackfan syndrome (1). Sixteen patients had at least 1 infectious complication, and 8 patients had multiple infections. Organisms included mycoses (7 patients), viruses (8 patients), bacteria (3 patients), and Toxoplasma (2 patients). Hemorrhagic complications, such as intra-alveolar hemorrhage and gastrointestinal tract hemorrhage, were found in 24 patients. Other frequent findings at autopsy included diffuse alveolar damage (15 patients), hepatic veno-occlusive disease (11 patients), and acute or chronic graft-vs-host disease (9 patients). Patients who have received UCBT represent a unique population of immunosuppressed patients. Infectious and hemorrhagic complications frequently are encountered at autopsy, and pathologists performing autopsies on these patients should be alert to unusual pathogens.
10804680	A review of behavioral treatments used for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.	Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a genetic disorder resulting in hyperuricemia, choreoathetosis, mental retardation, and self-mutilation. The most salient feature of this disorder is the self-injurious behavior (SIB). Although the utility of behavioral interventions with SIB has been well documented, behavioral interventions with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome have been limited in number and long-term success. This article reviews the behavioral treatments that have been used in treating individuals with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome and discusses the strengths and weaknesses of these methods. Suggestions for future directions in the use of behavioral interventions for controlling SIB in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome are provided.
1523062	Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and xanthine calculi in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.	We report a case of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS) with urinary xanthine calculi. At eight years of age calculi in the renal pelvis were successfully disintegrated by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) without any complications. Follow-up sonography is very useful for management of patients with LNS, particularly when they are on allopurinol therapy.
14653897	Preimplantation diagnosis of Lesch-Nyhan using mini-sequencing primer extension.	Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LN) is a severe X-linked disorder of males characterized by hyperuricaemia, choreoathetosis, spasticity, mental retardation and self-mutilation. The disorder is caused by a wide spectrum of mutations distributed throughout the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene. Female carriers of LN display no clinical symptoms but are at 50% risk of passing on the affected gene to their male offspring. A couple who had a boy with LN were referred to Monash IVF for preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) because the woman had undergone tubal ligation and the couple wanted to have another child. A test was developed for the causative mutation IVS8+6 T-->G mutation based on minisequencing primer extension that also incorporated the co-analysis of an informative tetranucleotide marker in intron 3 of the HPRT gene to identify allelic dropout. All four biopsied embryos from their first IVF cycle were diagnosed as unaffected, and transfer of two embryos in the cohort with the highest morphological quality resulted in a singleton pregnancy and the birth of a healthy girl. Direct mutation detection by mini-sequencing and parallel analysis of an informative linked marker provides an alternative strategy for molecular diagnosis of point mutations that will have useful application in PGD for other single gene disorders.
29227296	Lesch-Nyhan syndrome and its variants: examining the behavioral and neurocognitive phenotype.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome (LNS) is a metabolic disorder involving mutations in the HGPRT1 gene that result in hyperuricemia, intellectual disability, a dystonic movement disorder, and compulsive self-injury with self-mutilation. The aim of this review is to summarize recent research that documents the extended behavioral, neurologic, and neurocognitive phenotype in classic LNS, to describe milder variants of HGprt deficiency that do not self-injure and have less severe neurological and cognitive deficits, and to provide an update on treatment for associated psychiatric and behavioral disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Psychiatric management utilizes combined behavioral and pharmacological treatment in conjunction with protective equipment and dental management to avert self-injury. Pharmacological management focuses on stabilization of mood and anxiety management. S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), a physiological intermediate in methylation and transsulfuration, has shown beneficial effects in carefully selected patients who can tolerate the drug. Deep brain stimulation is shown in several case reports and series to reduce or eliminate self-injury and aggression, and in some cases, modify dystonia. SUMMARY: This review highlights progress in our understanding of the behavioral and neurocognitive phenotype of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (HGprt deficiency) and its variants, describes psychiatric and behavioral management, and discusses prospects for new therapies.

17853483	Antero-ventral internal pallidum stimulation improves behavioral disorders in Lesch-Nyhan disease.	The Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by a deficiency in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase, a purine salvage enzyme. Affected individuals exhibit a characteristic neurobehavioral disorder with delayed acquisition of motor skills, dystonia, severe self-mutilations, and aggressive behavior. Deep brain stimulation has been previously proposed for controlling isolated involuntary movements and psychiatric disorders. We applied a double bilateral simultaneous stimulation to limbic and motor internal pallidum in one patient for controlling both behavioral and movement disorders, respectively. The injurious compulsions disappeared; dystonia and dyskinesia were decreased at 28 months follow-up.
8688596	Preimplantation diagnosis of inherited disease by embryo biopsy: an update of the world figures.	PURPOSE: Cleavage stage embryo biopsy and preimplantation diagnosis was first reported five years ago. The annual collation of the world figures for centres offering this procedure is important to continually assess the efficiency and success of the biopsy, diagnosis and pregnancies obtained. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data was collected from 14 centres worldwide. The largest series of diagnosis has been performed for those patients carrying X-linked disease where the embryos have been sexed either by PCR or FISH. PCR has also been used for the specific diagnosis of a number of single gene defects, mainly for cystic fibrosis but also for the diagnosis of Lesch Nyhan syndrome, Fragile X, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Tay Sachs, haemophilia and RhD blood typing. RESULTS: For PCR sexing, a total of 62 cycles have been performed with 14 pregnancies, 8 deliveries and 11 babies born. For FISH sexing, 70 cycles have resulted in 15 pregnancies, 8 deliveries and 11 babies born. For the specific diagnosis of single genes defects, a total of 65 cycles resulted in 21 pregnancies, 12 deliveries and 12 babies born. Overall, 197 cycles were performed, with 171 embryo transfers (86%), 50 pregnancies (25% per cycle, 29% per transfer), 28 deliveries and 34 babies born. CONCLUSIONS: New methods are being developed to increase the scope of preimplantation diagnoses that can be offered. From next year, the biochemical and miscarriage rates will also be recorded.
2343029	A pitfall in the prenatal diagnosis of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome by chorionic villus sampling.	The ratio of the activities of catabolic enzymes such as 5'-nucleotidase and purine nucleoside phosphorylase to that of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) may be much higher in frozen or cultured chorionic villus cells than in cultured amniotic fluid cells, cultured fibroblasts, or red blood cells. Consequently, unless these catabolic activities are controlled the observed activity of HPRT may be greatly decreased, and a false diagnosis of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome may result. For a reliable diagnosis, the reaction products of HPRT must be protected from catabolism.
21940691	Pallidal deep-brain stimulation associated with complete remission of self-injurious behaviors in a patient with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome: a case report.	The purpose of this case report is to review the management of a boy with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome with deep-brain stimulation who had remission of self-injurious behaviors as a result. This patient was treated with intrathecal baclofen and, later, with deep-brain stimulation to reduce hypertonia. Goals were to improve wheelchair positioning for school attendance and to reduce the use of restraints for comfort. Intrathecal baclofen was implanted twice and decreased the hypertonia, but both were explanted because of infection. Deep-brain stimulation was initiated 2.5 years ago, and since that time, comfort and function have improved and caregiver burden has decreased. Improvements in dystonia with deep-brain stimulation have also occurred, and self-injurious behaviors have resolved.
2582310	Lesch-Nyhan syndrome: CSF neurotransmitter abnormalities.	Serial determinations of spinal fluid homovanillic acid (HVA) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) were made in four patients with the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome over a 5-year period. Control spinal fluids for age-matched comparison were obtained from 194 neurologic and nonneurologic pediatric patients. A rapid decline in control spinal fluid HVA and 5-HIAA occurs over the first 3 years of life (50 and 60%, respectively), and a more gradual decline persists throughout adolescence. The Lesch-Nyhan subjects have similar age-related changes in their spinal fluid neurotransmitter levels. Sequential 5-HIAA determinations from the four Lesch-Nyhan boys fall within the control range. The Lesch-Nyhan HVA levels are lower than the mean value for the age-matched control group in 18 of 19 samples. Ten of 19 determinations fell below the control range. Our findings provide evidence for altered CNS dopamine metabolism in the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.
13677952	[A patient with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome complicated by tracheobronchomalacia and fatal bleeding from tracheobrachiocephalic artery fistula].	A 19-year-old man with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS), had dyspnea and an inspiratory wheeze, and underwent assisted mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy. Bronchoscopy revealed tracheomalacia of the cresent moon type. He lost his weight, and his general condition gradually worsened. Four months post-tracheostomy, he died of massive hemoptysis from a tracheobrachicephalic artery fistula. Many patients with LNS have renal failure and pneumonitis, whereas occasional cases are complicated by convulsions, recurrent coma, abnormalities of respiration, and sudden death. The etiology of sudden death is not clear. Although tracheomalacia, to our knowledge, has not been described in the literature, it may be a clinical feature of LNS associated with abnormal respiration and sudden death. Tracheobrachiocephalic artery fistula is common in patients with neuromuscular disorders and a chronic tracheostomy tube. Caution is required in LNS patients with opisthotonic extensor spasms of the neck and trunk, chronic bronchitis, and malnutrition.
18520986	Botulinum toxin: treatment of self-mutilation in patients with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.	Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS) is a rare X-linked recessive disorder involving purine metabolism caused by the congenital absence of hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase. A characteristic feature of LNS is the appearance of intractable self-injurious behavior, usually in the form of severe lip and finger biting. The mechanism behind this severe self-mutilating behavior is unknown, and is one of the main challenges in the management of this condition. We here report the case of a 30-year-old man with a confirmed diagnosis of LNS who was successfully treated for self-mutilation of his lips with repeated botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) injections in the facial perioral muscles. Our findings suggest that treatment with BTX-A helped reduce self-abusive behavior in this patient. Our case illustrates that BTX-A injections can be a useful therapeutic approach in patients with self-abusive behavior.

16698380	Xanthine urolithiasis.	Xanthine calculi are uncommonly encountered stones. When they occur, they typically do so in association with inborn metabolic disorders such as hereditary xanthinuria or Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. They may also occur in association with states of profound hyperuricemia such as myeloproliferative disease after treatment with allopurinol. If the underlying disorder is not addressed, a high risk of stone recurrence exists. Therefore, to raise clinical awareness, we reviewed and report our experience in the treatment of patients with these stones, discussing the underlying pathophysiology and approach to treatment.
22350962	Successful unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.	Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS) is a chronic, progressive neurodevelopmental disorder causing motor and behavioral dysfunction due to decreased synthesis of the enzyme hypoxantine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). Affected boys have mental retardation, delayed development, extrapyramidal motor disturbances and self-injuring behavior. As hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been shown to be effective in several neurodevelopmental inborn errors, we hypothesized that it could be favorable in LNS as well. Following a myeloablative conditioning regimen (busulphan 3.2 mg/kg/day for 4 days, cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg/day for 2 days with ATG Thymoglobin 2.5 mg/kg/day for 4 days) an unrelated umbilical cord blood unit was transfused at the age of 2 years. The graft was a 6/6 HLA-matched at HLA-A, B loci by antigen level, and at DRB1 by allelic level typing. Infused total nucleated cell dose was 3.6 x 10e7 per kilogram body weight. Serum HPRT levels reached normal values by the end of the sixth month post transplant. Slow neurodevelopmental improvement seen during the three-year follow-up and the missing self-injuring behavior can be considered as a proof for the presence of enzyme-competent cells behind the blood-brain barrier.
9246906	Preimplantation genetic diagnosis of inherited disease.	Research on diagnosis of inherited disease in human embryo before implantation was initiated to help those couples who would prefer to select embryos at this stage rather than during pregnancy. Following in vitro fertilization (IVF), one to two cells were removed from 3 day cleavage stage embryo and cells were analysed for genetic defects. Embryos diagnosed as unaffected were returned to the uterus and thus the resulting pregnancies were assured to be normal. First babies born after the preimplantation diagnosis were using DNA amplification of Y-linked sequences by PCR to avoid X-linked disease. Several pregnancies were obtained by identifying sex of embryos using dual fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with fluorochrome labelled DNA sequences specific for X- and Y-chromosomes to interphase nuclei. Development of single cell PCR for single gene defects led to diagnose several genetic disorders. Preimplantation diagnosis was successfully achieved for predominant delta 508 deletion causing cystic fibrosis, and pregnancies were also diagnosed for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, Tay-Sachs and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

31985336	Late diagnosis of Lesch-Nyhan disease complicated with end-stage renal disease and tophi burst: a case report.	Background: Lesch-Nyhan disease (LND) is a rare X-linked recessive inborn error of purine metabolism. Late diagnosis of LND may cause significant morbidity. LND cases have never been reported in Indonesia.Case report: A 15-year-old male who had been diagnosed with cerebral palsy was referred to our hospital due to renal failure requiring emergency dialysis. The patient presented with three classic manifestations of LND: increased uric acid levels, neurological disorders, and self-injurious behaviors. LND was suspected because of an abscess-like lump on the left ankle that was confirmed to be a tophus, which had burst and discharged thick masses containing blood, debris, and white crystal materials. The diagnosis of LND was confirmed by the presence of a deletion to exon 1 of the HPRT1 gene. The patient received oral allopurinol daily and treatment for end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which included regular dialysis and subcutaneous administration of erythropoietin. At a 2-month follow-up, he improved clinically with a 71% decrease in uric acid levels after regular dialysis and allopurinol treatment.Conclusion: In developed countries, LND can be diagnosed as early as 3 days after birth. However, diagnosis in the present case was delayed due to the rarity of the disease and the limited number of facilities in Indonesia that offer genetic counseling. Late diagnosis of LND leads to ESRD and irreversible abnormalities. This is the first case of LND presenting with a unique clinical presentation of tophus burst reported in Indonesia.
17595035	Opposite effects of internal globus pallidus stimulation on pallidal neurones activity.	Besides clinical efficacy, the mechanisms of action of deep brain stimulation (DBS) are still debated. To shed light on this complex issue, we have taken the opportunity to record the response of globus pallidus internus (GPi) neurones to 100 Hz stimulations in a case of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS) where four pallidal electrodes were implanted. Three types of response were observed, 2/19 neurones were unaffected by DBS. About 7/19 neurones were inhibited during DBS stimulation and 10/19 neurones were excited during DBS stimulation. Both effects ceased when DBS was turned off. Inhibited neurones were situated lower that exited ones on the trajectory (1.25 and 4.65 mm above the center of GPi respectively). These observations suggest that locally DBS induces a reversible inhibition of neurone firing rate while at the same time distantly exciting the main afferents to and/or efferents from the GPi. Both actions would result in a strong GPi inhibition that does not preclude increased outflow from the GPi.
