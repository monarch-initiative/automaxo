Immunohistochemistry for VP1 was compared to non-radioactive JCV DNA in situ hybridization (ISH) in ten cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Tissue sections from postmortem brains were studied from PML patients suffering from immunodeficient conditions of various causes: immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS, n = 7), severe combined immune deficiency due to adenosine deaminase deficiency (n = 1), sarcoidosis (n = 1) and leukemia (n = 1). VP1 immunohistochemistry demonstrated the presence of JCV in lesional oligodendrocytes of all PML patients, whereas ISH was able to detect JCV in nine out of ten cases. We conclude that VP1 immunohistochemistry is a specific, sensitive and rapid method for confirming the diagnosis of PML.",

RESULTS: Following HDR irradiation, the fibroblast strains derived from the different human SCID disorders displayed a wide range of radiosensitivity: the adenosine deaminase deficiency cells were similar in radiosensitivity to normal fibroblasts, T(-)B(-) cells were as hypersensitive to radiation as A-T cells and the Omenn's syndrome cells showed intermediate radiosensitivity.

To determine whether earlier expression would lead to adenosine accumulation and/or be deleterious for thymocyte maturation, thymic purine metabolism, and T cell differentiation were studied in lckNT transgenic mice overexpressing 5'-NT in cortical thymocytes under the control of the lck proximal promoter. In spite of a 100-fold elevation in thymic 5'-NT activity, transgenic adenosine levels were unchanged and T cell immunity was normal. Inosine, the product of adenosine deamination, was elevated more than twofold, however, indicating that adenosine deaminase (ADA) can prevent the accumulation of adenosine, even with a dramatic increase in 5'-NT activity, and demonstrating the availability of 5'-NT substrates in the thymus for the first time. Thymic adenosine concentrations of mice treated with the ADA inhibitor 2'-deoxycoformycin (dCF) were elevated over 30-fold, suggesting that high ADA activity, rather than an absence of 5'-NT, is mainly responsible for low thymic adenosine levels. The adenosine concentrations in dCF-treated mice are sufficient to cause adenosine receptor-mediated thymocyte apoptosis in vitro, suggesting that adenosine accumulation could play a role in ADA-deficient severe combined immunodeficiency.",

Over the past 25 years, the metabolic basis for immune deficiency has largely been established. The clinical spectrum associated with ADA deficiency is now quite broad, including older children and adults. The ADA gene has been sequenced, the structure of the enzyme has been determined, and over 50 ADA gene mutations have been identified. There appears to be a quantitative relationship between residual ADA activity, determined by genotype, and both metabolic and clinical phenotype. ADA deficiency has become a focus for novel approaches to enzyme replacement and gene therapy. Enzyme replacement with polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified ADA, used to treat patients who lack a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched bone marrow donor, is safe and effective, but expensive. Several approaches to gene therapy have been investigated in patients receiving PEG-ADA. Persistent expression of transduced ADA cDNA in T lymphocytes and myeloid cells has occurred in a few patients, but significant improvement in immune function because of the transduced cells has not been shown. The major barrier to effective gene therapy remains the low efficiency of stem cell transduction with retroviral vectors.",

To determine whether earlier expression would lead to adenosine accumulation and/or be deleterious for thymocyte maturation, thymic purine metabolism, and T cell differentiation were studied in lckNT transgenic mice overexpressing 5'-NT in cortical thymocytes under the control of the lck proximal promoter. In spite of a 100-fold elevation in thymic 5'-NT activity, transgenic adenosine levels were unchanged and T cell immunity was normal. Inosine, the product of adenosine deamination, was elevated more than twofold, however, indicating that adenosine deaminase (ADA) can prevent the accumulation of adenosine, even with a dramatic increase in 5'-NT activity, and demonstrating the availability of 5'-NT substrates in the thymus for the first time. Thymic adenosine concentrations of mice treated with the ADA inhibitor 2'-deoxycoformycin (dCF) were elevated over 30-fold, suggesting that high ADA activity, rather than an absence of 5'-NT, is mainly responsible for low thymic adenosine levels. The adenosine concentrations in dCF-treated mice are sufficient to cause adenosine receptor-mediated thymocyte apoptosis in vitro, suggesting that adenosine accumulation could play a role in ADA-deficient severe combined immunodeficiency.",

Immunohistochemistry for VP1 was compared to non-radioactive JCV DNA in situ hybridization (ISH) in ten cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Tissue sections from postmortem brains were studied from PML patients suffering from immunodeficient conditions of various causes: immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS, n = 7), severe combined immune deficiency due to adenosine deaminase deficiency (n = 1), sarcoidosis (n = 1) and leukemia (n = 1). VP1 immunohistochemistry demonstrated the presence of JCV in lesional oligodendrocytes of all PML patients, whereas ISH was able to detect JCV in nine out of ten cases. We conclude that VP1 immunohistochemistry is a specific, sensitive and rapid method for confirming the diagnosis of PML.",

In this study, we explore the capacity of genetically modified keratinocytes to metabolize extracellular substrate in a culture model that resembles in vivo epidermal architecture. Keratinocytes from adenosine deaminase (ADA)-deficient patients were transduced with a retroviral vector encoding the human ADA gene and the capacity of this tissue to deaminate deoxyadenosine (dAdo) in vitro was measured. The results show that at a substrate concentration of 10 microM, ADA-corrected keratinocytes deaminate dAdo at a rate of 0.38 nmol/min.10(6) cells. These results indicate that keratinocytes process extracellular substrate at rates that suggest complete substrate conversion in a single pass. This study provides a strong indication that the epidermis, the largest and most accessible tissue of the body, is a valuable site for designing clinically relevant gene therapies.",

The results show that at a substrate concentration of 10 microM, ADA-corrected keratinocytes deaminate dAdo at a rate of 0.38 nmol/min.10(6) cells. These results indicate that keratinocytes process extracellular substrate at rates that suggest complete substrate conversion in a single pass. This study provides a strong indication that the epidermis, the largest and most accessible tissue of the body, is a valuable site for designing clinically relevant gene therapies.",

One patient received gene therapy and the other 2 patients received HLA-haploidentical bone marrow transplantation. The medical costs required for hospitalization periods for gene therapy and bone marrow transplantation were estimated respectively by analyzing the monthly bills that were calculated based on the fee schedule covered by health insurance. In the gene therapy, the total cost was calculated by adding the charges not covered by health insurance. The gene therapy and transplantation patients had significant differences in terms of cost structure and total cost. The items concerning \"procedures\" associated with gene transduction in the former amounted to 47.8% of the total cost, and \"medication\" in the latter amounted to 34.3% and 31.9% respectively. The items concerning \"hospitalization\" amounted to a large percentage in both treatments. The total cost was estimated at approximately 18.9 million yen for gene therapy, and 7.4 million yen and 10.5 million yen for transplantation. These results obtained through this study revealed the cost structure of gene therapy in comparison with transplantation. This report represents the first step to the assessment of medical technology of human gene therapy, in terms of medical cost, in which a stable and favorable therapeutic outcome was achieved.",

Over the past 25 years, the metabolic basis for immune deficiency has largely been established. The clinical spectrum associated with ADA deficiency is now quite broad, including older children and adults. The ADA gene has been sequenced, the structure of the enzyme has been determined, and over 50 ADA gene mutations have been identified. There appears to be a quantitative relationship between residual ADA activity, determined by genotype, and both metabolic and clinical phenotype. ADA deficiency has become a focus for novel approaches to enzyme replacement and gene therapy. Enzyme replacement with polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified ADA, used to treat patients who lack a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched bone marrow donor, is safe and effective, but expensive. Several approaches to gene therapy have been investigated in patients receiving PEG-ADA. Persistent expression of transduced ADA cDNA in T lymphocytes and myeloid cells has occurred in a few patients, but significant improvement in immune function because of the transduced cells has not been shown. The major barrier to effective gene therapy remains the low efficiency of stem cell transduction with retroviral vectors.",

Such a genetic strategy seemed rational given the recognition that cancer typically develops in a multistep process involving alterations of a number of different genes as demonstrated in familial polyposis and colorectal cancer through the work of Vogelstein et al. Because of the numerous alterations that may result in the eventual development of cancer, there is no obvious single choice for a therapeutic gene. Although one may view this as an obstacle, it also allows for a variety of possible therapeutic interventions. This review focuses on the known genetic defects that occur in ovarian cancer, the gene therapy strategies suggested by such defects, and the approaches under current development for the treatment of this disease. As such, this work also describes some of the approved human gene therapy protocols. Finally, an overview of the problems and directions for future growth and research is presented.",
