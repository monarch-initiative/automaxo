However, recent disappointing results of the considerable clinical trials have also clearly demonstrated that such an initial expectation was an overestimation of gene therapy. There are only a few successful cases despite the 3000 patients who have been treated with various forms of gene therapy. Gene therapy for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) caused by adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency is one of the few such cases where results have been promising. In particular, peripheral T-lymphocytes-directed gene therapy provides further immunological improvements for patients with ADA-SCID receiving the PEG-ADA treatment whereas gene therapy targeting haematopoietic stem cell has so far proved insufficient for clinical benefits. This report will review crucial problems elucidated in the past five clinical trials for ADA-SCID and gives an outline of the next generation of stem cell gene therapy in Japan.",

Management options for ADA SCID include hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, enzyme replacement therapy and gene therapy. Formal data on the outcome following each of the three treatment modalities are limited, and this symposium was held in order to gather together the experience from major centers in Europe and the US. Transplantation for ADA-SCID is highly successful with survival rates of approximately 90% if a matched sibling or matched related donor is available but survival following matched unrelated donor or haploidentical procedures is 63% and 50% respectively with a significant rejection/non-engraftment rate in unconditioned procedures. Successfully transplanted patients demonstrated good immunological recovery with normal cellular and humoral function in the majority of cases. PEG-ADA has been used in over 150 patients worldwide either as an alternative to mismatched transplant or as a stabilizing measure prior to transplant. Overall, approximately two thirds of patients treated with PEG-ADA have survived with the majority of patients showing good clinical improvement. The level of immune recovery long term was less than that seen after transplant and approximately 50% of patients continued to receive immunoglobulin replacement. Gene therapy has been used as an experimental procedure in two centers in Europe. Early results from 9 patients suggest that the treatment is safe and that the majority have shown recovery of cellular immune function. Long-term follow-up of treated patients highlights a significant incidence of non-immunological problems with cognitive, neurological and audiological abnormalities most prominent.",

                    "text": "Gene therapy of genetic diseases and cancer.The scope of gene transfer applications in human therapy has expanded enormously over the last 15 years to include not only several types of genetic diseases but also a variety of genetic approaches to the treatment of cancer. Hematopoietic stem cells have been considered excellent targets for therapeutic gene transfer because of their capacity for self-renewal and for differentiation into multiple cellular lineages. Retrovirus-mediated gene transfer has been tested for treatment of diseases that specifically affect the hematopoietic system, such as adenosine deaminase deficiency and chronic granulomatous disease. Storage disorders such as Gaucher disease, Hurler syndrome and Hunter syndrome, genetic deficiencies that affect a broad range of tissue types, may also be amenable to treatment by gene transfer into hematopoietic cells, owing to the release of enzyme expressed in transduced cells with subsequent uptake by untransduced cells (\"metabolic cross-correction\"). Hematopoietic stem cells may also be targeted for introduction of drug-resistance genes for the purpose of protecting normal tissues from the toxic side-effects of cancer chemotherapeutic agents, thus allowing more effective antitumor chemotherapy. The danger of introducing drug-resistance function into tumor cells may be dealt with by including sequences specifically designed to reduce expression of oncogenes or to restore expression of tumor suppressor genes. Current limitations on the efficiency of gene transfer into hematopoietic stem cells may be alleviated by the development of new vector systems such as adeno-associated virus or lentivirus vectors, or by advances in cell processing that render hematopoietic cells more susceptible to transduction. Drug-resistance genes may also be applied for in vivo selection to expand the representation of a small proportion of transduced hematopoietic cells. These approaches toward increasing the frequency of hematopoietic cell transduction contribute to the anticipated feasibility of gene therapy for genetic diseases and cancer.",

This ranges from the establishment of the 293, 911 and PER.C6 cell lines, which are used worldwide for the production of replication-defective adenoviral vectors, to the development of targeted viral vectors and T lymphocytes as well as of non-viral vectors. Several milestones have been achieved in Dutch clinical gene therapy trials, including the first treatment worldwide of patients with adenosine deaminase deficiency with genetically corrected hematopoietic stem cells in collaboration with French and British scientists. Until now, about 230 patients with various diseases have been treated with viral and non-viral gene therapy in this country. Ongoing and upcoming Dutch clinical trials focus on the translation of new developments in gene therapy research, including the restoration of genetic defects other than SCID, and the use of oncolytic adenoviruses and targeted T cells for the treatment of cancer. The growing commercial interest in Dutch clinical gene therapy is reflected by the involvement of two Dutch companies in ongoing trials as well as the participation of Dutch clinical centres in large phase III international multicenter immuno-gene therapy trials on prostate cancer sponsored by an American company. Translational gene therapy research in The Netherlands is boosted at a governmental level by the Dutch Ministry of Health via a dedicated funding programme.

In this study, a 2-year-old boy presented with ADEM, and he showed improvement on treatment with high-dose intravenous corticosteroids. At the age of 3 years, the presence of recurrent bronchitis, bronchiectasia, and lymphopenia suggested that the patient was suffering from combined immunodeficiency.

The objective of this study was to document the incidence and type of SCID in Australia, the age and clinical features at presentation and short-term management. The Australian Paediatric Surveillance Unit conducts active, monthly, national surveillance of rare disorders with reporting by child-health specialists. Between May 1995 and December 2001, clinicians provided clinical and laboratory data on children newly diagnosed with SCID. Thirty-three incident cases of SCID were identified [incidence 1.8/10(5) live births per annum; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-2.5]. Twenty-six children had classical SCID (1.45/10(5) live births; 95% CI, 0.9-2.0) and 20 (77%) of these were boys. Classical SCID was X-linked in 13 children, autosomal recessive (AR), not further classified in four, and attributed to adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA) in four, interleukin-7 receptor alpha chain deficiency in one, Ommen syndrome in two, and Di George syndrome in two. Twenty-one (81%) received bone marrow/stem cell transplantation, three of whom died between 1 and 4 months after transplantation (two ADA deficient, one AR). Seven children had atypical SCID, five of whom died within 1-4 yr of diagnosis. Most children with SCID presented with failure to thrive and recurrent infections and there was no significant delay between presentation and diagnosis. The reported national incidence of classical SCID in Australia (1.45/10(5) or approximately 4 cases per year or 1/69,000 live births) is consistent with the rate (1.4/10(5)) previously reported in Victoria. Diagnosis is rarely delayed, and transplantation is associated with good short-term survival.",

In all other settings [X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID), adenosine deaminase deficiency, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, and beta-hemoglobinopathies], the bone marrow content of the different stem and precursor cells and the cells' relationship with the stroma have very specific characteristics. These peculiarities can influence the cells' harvesting and behavior in culture, and the postgraft uptake and further behavior of the gene-modified hematopoietic/precursor cells.

This review describes the latest advances in gene therapy trials for this condition using peripheral blood lymphocytes or hematopoietic progenitors. RECENT FINDINGS: In the first patients with severe combined immunodeficiency due to adenosine deaminase deficiency treated with peripheral blood lymphocytes, transduced T cells have been shown to persist for over 10 years, expressing transgenic adenosine deaminase, but the therapeutic effect of gene therapy remained difficult to assess because of the concomitant treatment with bovine adenosine deaminase conjugated to polyethylene-glycol (PEG-ADA). A recent report showed that discontinuation of PEG-ADA resulted in a strong selective advantage of gene corrected T cells associated with restoration of T cell functions and antibody responses to neoantigen, but incomplete correction of the metabolic defect. Follow-up studies in patients treated with engineered hematopoietic progenitors in the early trials revealed low marking levels of long-term living progenitors and limited clinical effect. Recently, an improved gene transfer protocol in bone marrow CD34+ cells combined with low-dose busulfan resulted in multilineage, stable engraftment of transduced progenitors at substantial levels, restoration of immune functions, correction of the adenosine deaminase metabolic defect, and proven clinical benefit, in the absence of PEG-ADA. Overall, no adverse effect or toxicity has been observed in patients treated with adenosine deaminase gene transfer in mature lymphocytes or hematopoietic progenitors.

RECENT FINDINGS: In the first patients with severe combined immunodeficiency due to adenosine deaminase deficiency treated with peripheral blood lymphocytes, transduced T cells have been shown to persist for over 10 years, expressing transgenic adenosine deaminase, but the therapeutic effect of gene therapy remained difficult to assess because of the concomitant treatment with bovine adenosine deaminase conjugated to polyethylene-glycol (PEG-ADA). A recent report showed that discontinuation of PEG-ADA resulted in a strong selective advantage of gene corrected T cells associated with restoration of T cell functions and antibody responses to neoantigen, but incomplete correction of the metabolic defect. Follow-up studies in patients treated with engineered hematopoietic progenitors in the early trials revealed low marking levels of long-term living progenitors and limited clinical effect. Recently, an improved gene transfer protocol in bone marrow CD34+ cells combined with low-dose busulfan resulted in multilineage, stable engraftment of transduced progenitors at substantial levels, restoration of immune functions, correction of the adenosine deaminase metabolic defect, and proven clinical benefit, in the absence of PEG-ADA. Overall, no adverse effect or toxicity has been observed in patients treated with adenosine deaminase gene transfer in mature lymphocytes or hematopoietic progenitors. SUMMARY: Gene transfer in hematopoietic stem cells combined with nonmyeloablative conditioning is efficacious and might be extended to the treatment of other inherited and acquired disorders of the hematopoietic system.",

METHODS: We conducted functional and phenotypic analyses of human T cells in peritoneal washings from severe combined immunodeficiency mice reconstituted with PBMCs from normal and atopic human donors. We also examined the expression of IL-4 and CD40 ligand by CD8(+) T cells from a patient with adenosine deaminase deficiency who received autologous T cell-directed gene therapy. RESULTS: Transfer of atopic cells into the mice caused production of IgE and IgG with increased expression of IL-4 and CD40 ligand mRNA. In addition, both intracellular IL-4 and cell surface CD40 ligand were detected in CD8(+) and in CD4(+) T cells. CD8(+) T-cell lines generated from the patient's T cells carrying the adenosine deaminase gene expressed not only IL-4 mRNA and protein but also CD40 ligand mRNA and protein after being stimulated with an anti-CD3 mAb. After anti-CD3 stimulation and paraformaldehyde fixation, CD8(+) T cells induced IgE synthesis by normal human B cells in the presence of recombinant IL-4.

                    "text": "Perspectives of gene therapy for primary immunodeficiencies.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Standard therapies for patients with severe primary immunodeficiencies include bone marrow transplantation and, for adenosine deaminase deficiency, enzyme replacement. In the last decade, gene therapy has been developed as an alternative for these conditions. We summarize the recent advances in gene therapy for primary immunodeficiencies and discuss the unexpected occurrence of leukemia in a gene therapy trial for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency. RECENT FINDINGS: Eight of 10 infants with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency who received autologous hematopoietic stem cells transduced with a retroviral vector carrying the IL2RG complementary DNA achieved immune reconstitution. However, the two youngest patients developed leukemic expansions of gene-corrected cells. The first case had proliferation of a gamma delta T cell clone, and the second case had three alpha beta T cell clones derived from a single transduced progenitor. Leukemic cells in both patients aberrantly expressed the LIM domain only-2 transcription factor due to retroviral vector insertions in this locus. After receiving anti-leukemic treatment one patient achieved a lasting remission, but the other relapsed. Four adenosine deaminase deficient severe combined immunodeficiency patients also developed functional immunity after receiving autologous hematopoietic stem cells transduced with the adenosine deaminase gene complementary DNA following submyeloablative chemotherapy. Chronic granulomatous disease, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, JAK3 deficiency and RAG2 deficiency are other immunodeficiencies being studied as candidates for gene therapy. SUMMARY: Gene therapy is a promising therapeutic option for some primary immunodeficiencies, especially when cells expressing the correct gene have a selective advantage.

METHODS: We treated 50 patients with ADA-SCID (30 in the United States and 20 in the United Kingdom) with an investigational gene therapy composed of autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) transduced ex vivo with a self-inactivating lentiviral vector encoding human ADA. Data from the two U.S. studies (in which fresh and cryopreserved formulations were used) at 24 months of follow-up were analyzed alongside data from the U.K. study (in which a fresh formulation was used) at 36 months of follow-up. RESULTS: Overall survival was 100% in all studies up to 24 and 36 months. Event-free survival (in the absence of reinitiation of enzyme-replacement therapy or rescue allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation) was 97% (U.S. studies) and 100% (U.K. study) at 12 months; 97% and 95%, respectively, at 24 months; and 95% (U.K. study) at 36 months. Engraftment of genetically modified HSPCs persisted in 29 of 30 patients in the U.S. studies and in 19 of 20 patients in the U.K. study. Patients had sustained metabolic detoxification and normalization of ADA activity levels. Immune reconstitution was robust, with 90% of the patients in the U.S. studies and 100% of those in the U.K. study discontinuing immunoglobulin-replacement therapy by 24 months and 36 months, respectively. No evidence of monoclonal expansion, leukoproliferative complications, or emergence of replication-competent lentivirus was noted, and no events of autoimmunity or graft-versus-host disease occurred. Most adverse events were of low grade. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of ADA-SCID with ex vivo lentiviral HSPC gene therapy resulted in high overall and event-free survival with sustained ADA expression, metabolic correction, and functional immune reconstitution.

METHODS: We treated 50 patients with ADA-SCID (30 in the United States and 20 in the United Kingdom) with an investigational gene therapy composed of autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) transduced ex vivo with a self-inactivating lentiviral vector encoding human ADA. Data from the two U.S. studies (in which fresh and cryopreserved formulations were used) at 24 months of follow-up were analyzed alongside data from the U.K. study (in which a fresh formulation was used) at 36 months of follow-up. RESULTS: Overall survival was 100% in all studies up to 24 and 36 months. Event-free survival (in the absence of reinitiation of enzyme-replacement therapy or rescue allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation) was 97% (U.S. studies) and 100% (U.K. study) at 12 months; 97% and 95%, respectively, at 24 months; and 95% (U.K. study) at 36 months. Engraftment of genetically modified HSPCs persisted in 29 of 30 patients in the U.S. studies and in 19 of 20 patients in the U.K. study. Patients had sustained metabolic detoxification and normalization of ADA activity levels. Immune reconstitution was robust, with 90% of the patients in the U.S. studies and 100% of those in the U.K. study discontinuing immunoglobulin-replacement therapy by 24 months and 36 months, respectively. No evidence of monoclonal expansion, leukoproliferative complications, or emergence of replication-competent lentivirus was noted, and no events of autoimmunity or graft-versus-host disease occurred. Most adverse events were of low grade.

It results in the intracellular accumulation of toxic metabolites which have effects particularly on lymphocytes and the brain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of 13 ADA-deficient patients. We planned to evaluate their clinical and laboratory findings before and after enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT), and hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy (HSCGT). METHODS: Measurement of ADA enzyme activity and metabolites and sequencing of the ADA gene were performed in most of the patients with ADA deficiency. One of the patients with late-onset ADA deficiency was diagnosed by the help of primary immunodeficiency panel screening. RESULTS: Ten out of 13 patients were diagnosed as SCID, while 3 out of 13 were diagnosed as delayed-/late-onset ADA deficiency. Late-onset ADA deficiency patients had clinical and laboratory findings of combined immunodeficiency (CID). Eight patients with ADA-SCID were found to have higher levels of ADA metabolite (dAXP%) (62.1% (34.6-71.9)) than 3 patients with delayed-/late-onset ADA deficiency (6.9% (2.1-8.9). All but one patient with SCID had T-B-NK- phenotype, one had T-B-NK+ phenotype. Genetic defect was documented in 11 patients. Four out of 11 patients had compound heterozygous defects. Three out of 4 patients with compound heterozygous defects had delayed-onset/late-onset ADA deficiency. Seven out of 11 patients with SCID had homozygous defects. Five out of 7 had the same homozygous indel frameshift mutation (c.955-959delGAAGA) showing a founder effect. There were two novel splice site defects: one (IVS10+2T>C) was heterozygous in a patient with late-onset ADA deficiency, and the other was homozygous (IVS2delT+2) in a SCID patient. Other defects were missense defects. Nine out of 13 patients were put on pegylated ADA ERT. Four out of six patients were transplanted without using a conditioning regimen. HSCGT was performed to one of the patients. CONCLUSION: The genetic diagnosis of SCID is utmost important. There is a chance to give ERT before the definitive therapy if the patient with SCID/CID has ADA deficiency. Although ERT was insufficient to restore a normal immune function in ADA-SCID patients, it was useful to improve and stabilize the clinical status before curative therapy (aHSCT/HSCGT). Enzyme replacement therapy was successful in patients with late-/delayed-onset ADA deficiency who presented with the features of combined immunodeficiency. Gastrointestinal polyposis in a patient with late-onset ADA deficiency may be an association or a coincidental finding. Intermittent neurodevelopmental evaluation especially for hearing impairment should be performed in most of the ADA-deficient patients. This may alleviate the speech delay and cognitive abnormalities which may be observed in the follow-up.",

                    "text": "ADA Deficiency: Evaluation of the Clinical and Laboratory Features and the Outcome.INTRODUCTION: Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency is an autosomal recessive primary immunodeficiency. It results in the intracellular accumulation of toxic metabolites which have effects particularly on lymphocytes and the brain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of 13 ADA-deficient patients. We planned to evaluate their clinical and laboratory findings before and after enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT), and hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy (HSCGT). METHODS: Measurement of ADA enzyme activity and metabolites and sequencing of the ADA gene were performed in most of the patients with ADA deficiency. One of the patients with late-onset ADA deficiency was diagnosed by the help of primary immunodeficiency panel screening. RESULTS: Ten out of 13 patients were diagnosed as SCID, while 3 out of 13 were diagnosed as delayed-/late-onset ADA deficiency. Late-onset ADA deficiency patients had clinical and laboratory findings of combined immunodeficiency (CID). Eight patients with ADA-SCID were found to have higher levels of ADA metabolite (dAXP%) (62.1% (34.6-71.9)) than 3 patients with delayed-/late-onset ADA deficiency (6.9% (2.1-8.9). All but one patient with SCID had T-B-NK- phenotype, one had T-B-NK+ phenotype. Genetic defect was documented in 11 patients. Four out of 11 patients had compound heterozygous defects. Three out of 4 patients with compound heterozygous defects had delayed-onset/late-onset ADA deficiency. Seven out of 11 patients with SCID had homozygous defects. Five out of 7 had the same homozygous indel frameshift mutation (c.955-959delGAAGA) showing a founder effect. There were two novel splice site defects: one (IVS10+2T>C) was heterozygous in a patient with late-onset ADA deficiency, and the other was homozygous (IVS2delT+2) in a SCID patient. Other defects were missense defects. Nine out of 13 patients were put on pegylated ADA ERT. Four out of six patients were transplanted without using a conditioning regimen. HSCGT was performed to one of the patients. CONCLUSION: The genetic diagnosis of SCID is utmost important. There is a chance to give ERT before the definitive therapy if the patient with SCID/CID has ADA deficiency. Although ERT was insufficient to restore a normal immune function in ADA-SCID patients, it was useful to improve and stabilize the clinical status before curative therapy (aHSCT/HSCGT). Enzyme replacement therapy was successful in patients with late-/delayed-onset ADA deficiency who presented with the features of combined immunodeficiency. Gastrointestinal polyposis in a patient with late-onset ADA deficiency may be an association or a coincidental finding. Intermittent neurodevelopmental evaluation especially for hearing impairment should be performed in most of the ADA-deficient patients. This may alleviate the speech delay and cognitive abnormalities which may be observed in the follow-up.",

Enzyme-replacement therapy was not given after infusion of the cells. RESULTS: All patients are alive after a median follow-up of 4.0 years (range, 1.8 to 8.0).

Eight patients do not require enzyme-replacement therapy, their blood cells continue to express ADA, and they have no signs of defective detoxification of purine metabolites. Nine patients had immune reconstitution with increases in T-cell counts (median count at 3 years, 1.07x10(9) per liter) and normalization of T-cell function.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the outcomes of 23 mostly conditioned patients with SCID and compare their outcomes with those of 25 previously reported nonconditioned patients with SCID who underwent transplantation. METHODS: In the present study we reviewed the medical records of these 23 consecutive, mostly conditioned patients with SCID who underwent transplantation between 1998 and 2007. RESULTS: Eighteen patients (median age at transplantation, 10 months; range, 0.8-108 months) received haploidentical mismatched related donor, matched unrelated donor, or mismatched unrelated donor transplants, 17 of whom received pretransplantation conditioning (with 1 not conditioned); 13 (72%) patients engrafted with donor cells and survive at a median of 3.8 years (range, 1.8-9.8 year); 5 (38%) of 13 patients require intravenous immunoglobulin; and 6 of 6 age-eligible children attend school. Of 5 recipients (median age at transplantation, 7 months; range, 2-23 months) of matched related donor transplants, all 5 engrafted and survive at a median of 7.5 years (range, 1.5-9.5 year), 1 recipient requires intravenous immunoglobulin, and 3 of 3 age-eligible children attend school. Gene mutations were known in 16 cases: mutation in the common gamma chain of the IL-2 receptor (IL2RG) in 7 patients, mutation in the alpha chain of the IL-7 receptor (IL7RA) in 4 patients, mutation in the recombinase-activating gene (RAG1) in 2 patients, adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA) in 2 patients, and adenylate kinase 2 (AK2) in 1 patient. Early outcomes and quality of life of the previous nonconditioned versus the present conditioned cohorts were not statistically different, but longer-term follow-up is necessary for confirmation. CONCLUSIONS: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with SCID results in engraftment, long-term survival, and a good quality of life for the majority of patients with or without pretransplantation conditioning.",

Depending on the underlying genetic defect and when blocks in differentiation occur during lymphocyte ontogeny, infants with SCID have absent or greatly reduced numbers of functional T cells. Natural killer (NK) cell populations are usually absent in the SCID-X1 and Janus kinase 3 forms of SCID and greatly reduced in adenosine deaminase deficiency SCID but often present in other forms of the disorder. OBJECTIVE: To determine if SCID phenotypes indicate host permissiveness to donor cell engraftment. METHODS: A retrospective data analysis considered whether host NK cells influenced donor T-cell engraftment, immune reconstitution, and long-term outcomes in children who had undergone nonconditioned allogeneic stem cell transplantation between 1990 and 2011 in the United Kingdom. Detailed analysis of T- and B-cell immune reconstitution and donor chimerism was compared between the NK(+) (n = 24) and NK(-) (n = 53) forms of SCID. RESULTS: Overall, 77 children underwent transplantation, with survival of 90% in matched sibling donor/matched family donor transplants compared with 60% when alternative donors were used. Infants with NK(-)SCID were more likely to survive than NK(+) recipients (87% vs 62%, P < .01) and had high-level donor T-cell chimerism with superior long-term recovery of CD4 T-cell immunity. Notably, 33% of children with NK(+)SCID required additional transplantation procedures compared with only 8% of children with NK(-)SCID (P < .005). CONCLUSIONS: NK(-)SCID disorders are highly permissive for donor T-cell engraftment without preconditioning, whereas the presence of NK cells is a strong indicator that preparative conditioning is required for engraftment of T-cell precursors capable of supporting robust T-cell reconstitution.",

Hematopoietic stem cells have been considered excellent targets for therapeutic gene transfer because of their capacity for self-renewal and for differentiation into multiple cellular lineages. Retrovirus-mediated gene transfer has been tested for treatment of diseases that specifically affect the hematopoietic system, such as adenosine deaminase deficiency and chronic granulomatous disease. Storage disorders such as Gaucher disease, Hurler syndrome and Hunter syndrome, genetic deficiencies that affect a broad range of tissue types, may also be amenable to treatment by gene transfer into hematopoietic cells, owing to the release of enzyme expressed in transduced cells with subsequent uptake by untransduced cells (\"metabolic cross-correction\"). Hematopoietic stem cells may also be targeted for introduction of drug-resistance genes for the purpose of protecting normal tissues from the toxic side-effects of cancer chemotherapeutic agents, thus allowing more effective antitumor chemotherapy. The danger of introducing drug-resistance function into tumor cells may be dealt with by including sequences specifically designed to reduce expression of oncogenes or to restore expression of tumor suppressor genes. Current limitations on the efficiency of gene transfer into hematopoietic stem cells may be alleviated by the development of new vector systems such as adeno-associated virus or lentivirus vectors, or by advances in cell processing that render hematopoietic cells more susceptible to transduction. Drug-resistance genes may also be applied for in vivo selection to expand the representation of a small proportion of transduced hematopoietic cells.

It is a benign, asymptomatic disease of the oral mucosa caused by human papilloma viruses (HPV). Previous studies postulated an association between these lesions and immunodeficiency. Genetic deficiency of adenosine deaminase (ADA) results in varying degrees of immunodeficiency, including neonatal onset severe combined immunodeficiency (ADA-SCID), and milder, later onset immunodeficiency. We report a 12-year-old girl with the late onset-ADA deficiency presenting with Heck's disease.

Recently, ADA deficiency has been successfully treated using lentiviral-transduced autologous CD34+ cells carrying the ADA gene. T and B cell function appears to be fully restored, but in many patients' B cell numbers remain low, and assessments of the immunoglobulin heavy (IgHV) repertoire following gene therapy are lacking. METHODS: We performed deep sequencing of IgHV repertoire in peripheral blood lymphocytes from a child following lentivirus-based gene therapy for ADA deficiency and compared to the IgHV repertoire in healthy infants and adults. RESULTS: After gene therapy, Ig diversity increased over time as evidenced by V, D, and J gene usage, N-additions, CDR3 length, extent of somatic hypermutation, and Ig class switching. There was the emergence of predominant IgHM, IgHG, and IgHA CDR3 lengths after gene therapy indicating successful oligoclonal expansion in response to antigens.

Clinical trials of human gene therapy began with the ex vivo techniques. Based on the initial successes of gene-therapy clinical trials, these approaches have spread worldwide. The number of gene therapy trials approved worldwide increased gradually starting in 1989, reaching 116 protocols per year in 1999, and a total of 2210 protocols had been approved by 2015. Accumulating clinical evidence has demonstrated the safety and benefits of several types of gene therapy, with the exception of serious adverse events in several clinical trials. These painful experiences were translated backward to basic science, resulting in the development of several new technologies that have influenced the recent development of ex vivo gene therapy in this field. To date, six gene therapies have been approved in a limited number of countries worldwide. In Japan, clinical trials of gene therapy have developed under the strong influence of trials in the US and Europe. Since the initial stages, 50 clinical trials have been approved by the Japanese government. In this review, the history and current status of clinical trials of ex vivo gene therapy for hematological disorders are introduced and discussed. ",

The aim of this study was to generate a retrovirus packaging cell line that could be used for the production of large clinical batch vectors.

Furthermore, using the same culture conditions viral titers proved to be stable for a 3-month culture period.

However, in HSC gene therapy clinical trials, genotoxicity mediated by integrated vector proviruses has led to clonal expansion, and in some cases frank leukemia. Numerous studies have been performed to understand the molecular basis of vector-mediated genotoxicity with the aim of developing safer vectors and safer gene therapy protocols. These genotoxicity studies are critical to advancing HSC gene therapy. AREAS COVERED: This review provides an introduction to the mechanisms of retroviral vector genotoxicity. It also covers advances over the last 20 years in designing safer gene therapy vectors, and in integration site analysis in clinical trials and large animal models. Mechanisms of retroviral-mediated genotoxicity, and the risk factors that contribute to clonal expansion and leukemia in HSC gene therapy are introduced. EXPERT OPINION: Continued research on virus-host interactions and next-generation vectors should further improve the safety of future HSC gene therapy vectors and protocols.",

The standard of care for adenosine deaminase deficient severe combined immune deficiency (ADA-SCID) includes enzyme replacement therapy or bone marrow transplantation. Gene therapies for ADA-SCID over nearly two decades have exclusively involved retroviral vectors targeted to lymphocytes and hematopoetic progenitors. These groundbreaking gene therapies represent a revolution in clinical medicine, but come with several challenges, including the risk of insertional mutagenesis. An alternative gene therapy for ADA-SCID may utilize recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors in vivo, with numerous target tissues, to foster ectopic expression and secretion of adenosine deaminase. This review endeavors to describe ADA-SCID, the traditional treatments, previous retroviral gene therapies, and primarily, alternative recombinant adeno-associated virus-based strategies to remedy this potentially fatal genetic disease.",

Primary immunodeficiency diseases have led to the way in this field of gene therapy as an example and a model. Clinical results from the past 15 years have shown that significant improvement and even cure can be achieved for diseases such as X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency, adenosine deaminase deficiency, chronic granulomatous disease and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. Unfortunately, with the initial clear clinical benefits, the first serious complications of gene therapy have also occurred. In a significant number of patients treated using vectors based on murine gamma-retroviruses and carrying powerful viral enhancer elements, insertional oncogenesis events have resulted in acute leukemias that, in some cases, have had fatal outcomes. These serious adverse events have sparked a revision of the assessment of risks and benefits of integrating gene transfer for hematological diseases and prompted the development and application of new generations of viral vectors with recognized superior safety characteristics. This review summarizes the clinical experience of gene therapy for primary immunodeficiencies and discusses the likely avenues of progress in the future development of this expanding field of clinical investigations.",

                    "text": "Gene transfer into hematopoietic stem cells as treatment for primary immunodeficiency diseases.Gene transfer into the hematopoietic stem cell has shown curative potential for a variety of hematological disorders. Primary immunodeficiency diseases have led to the way in this field of gene therapy as an example and a model. Clinical results from the past 15 years have shown that significant improvement and even cure can be achieved for diseases such as X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency, adenosine deaminase deficiency, chronic granulomatous disease and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. Unfortunately, with the initial clear clinical benefits, the first serious complications of gene therapy have also occurred. In a significant number of patients treated using vectors based on murine gamma-retroviruses and carrying powerful viral enhancer elements, insertional oncogenesis events have resulted in acute leukemias that, in some cases, have had fatal outcomes. These serious adverse events have sparked a revision of the assessment of risks and benefits of integrating gene transfer for hematological diseases and prompted the development and application of new generations of viral vectors with recognized superior safety characteristics. This review summarizes the clinical experience of gene therapy for primary immunodeficiencies and discusses the likely avenues of progress in the future development of this expanding field of clinical investigations.",

The stable production of kappa-deleting recombination excision circle(+) lymphocytes sustained an increase in B cell number in HSCT-treated patients, whereas in PEG-ADA-treated patients, it was accompanied by a significant and progressive decrease in circulating CD19(+) lymphocytes, which never reached the levels observed in age-matched children. The mobilization of TCR excision circle(+) cells, though lower than in controls, was stable with time after HSCT treatment, leading to a constant peripheral T cell number and to the diversification of the T cell repertoire; however, it was compromised in children receiving prolonged PEG-ADA therapy, whose T cells showed progressively narrowing T cell repertoires.",

However, recent disappointing results of the considerable clinical trials have also clearly demonstrated that such an initial expectation was an overestimation of gene therapy. There are only a few successful cases despite the 3000 patients who have been treated with various forms of gene therapy. Gene therapy for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) caused by adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency is one of the few such cases where results have been promising. In particular, peripheral T-lymphocytes-directed gene therapy provides further immunological improvements for patients with ADA-SCID receiving the PEG-ADA treatment whereas gene therapy targeting haematopoietic stem cell has so far proved insufficient for clinical benefits. This report will review crucial problems elucidated in the past five clinical trials for ADA-SCID and gives an outline of the next generation of stem cell gene therapy in Japan.",

Fetal administration of genetically modified HSCs has only been feasible to date through invasive and morbid methods. It has been recently shown that native donor HSCs can reach the fetal circulation and bone marrow after simple delivery into the amniotic fluid, at least in a syngeneic healthy model. We sought to determine whether the transamniotic route could also be a practical alternative for the fetal administration of genetically modified HSCs in a comparable model. Pregnant Lewis rat dams underwent volume-matched intra-amniotic injections in all their fetuses (n = 47) on gestational day 17 (E17; term = E21-22) of donor HSCs genetically modified using a custom lentiviral vector designed to constitutively express both a firefly luciferase reporter gene and a human adenosine deaminase (ADA) transgene. Donor HSCs consisted of syngeneic cells isolated from the amniotic fluid and phenotyped by flow cytometry. Fetuses were euthanized at term, when seven select sites relevant to HSC-based therapies were screened for either luciferase activity by luminometry or for the presence of human ADA mRNA by digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR). Among survivors (30/47; 64%), positive luminescence and positive human ADA expression were detected in the bone marrow (respectively, 33% and 76%), liver (respectively, 11% and 81%), spleen (respectively, 11% and 67%), thymus (respectively, 33% and 67%), lungs (respectively, 44% and 86%), and brain (respectively, 22% and 90%). Nucleated peripheral blood cells were analyzed only by ddPCR, showing positive human ADA expression at 54%. We conclude that genetically modified HSCs can reach the fetal circulation and fetal bone marrow after simple intra-amniotic administration in a syngeneic rat model. Gene therapy by transamniotic HSC delivery may become a practicable, minimally invasive strategy for the prenatal treatment of select hemoglobinopathies, immunodeficiencies, and inherited metabolic disorders.",

Combined immunodeficiencies can result, because B cells and natural killer cells rely on successful interactions with T cells to ensure their proper performance and survival. Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is the most noteworthy of these conditions, leading to considerable early morbidity and often death by the age of 1 year if left untreated. Newborn screening for SCID is effective and allows for early implementation of lifesaving supportive measures, including protective isolation, initiation of prophylactic antimicrobials, caution with blood product transfusions, and avoidance of live vaccinations. Once a definitive diagnosis of SCID has been established, treatment frequently involves bone marrow or stem cell transplantation; however, enzyme replacement and gene therapy are also becoming options in those with SCID due to adenosine deaminase deficiency and other forms of SCID. Neonatal clinicians should understand the screening and diagnostic approach to SCID along with the initial management approaches for these extremely high-risk patients.",

OBJECTIVES: To determine if embryonic Myb(-/-) alveolar-like macrophages have therapeutic value on pulmonary transplantation in acute and chronic airway diseases. METHODS: Directed differentiation of murine PSCs was used in factor-defined media to produce expandable embryonic macrophages conditioned to an alveolar-like phenotype with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. AMs were partially depleted in mice to create an acute lung injury. To model a chronic lung disease, ADA(-/-) mice were used. Alveolar-like macrophages were intratracheally transplanted to the injured animals and therapeutic potential was determined. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The differentiation protocol is highly efficient and adaptable to human PSCs. The PSC macrophages are phenotypically like AMs both functionally and by ligand marker characterization. They engulf bacteria and apoptotic cells and are better phagocytes than bone marrow-derived macrophages. In vivo, these macrophages remain in healthy airways for at least 4 weeks, can engulf neutrophils during acute lung injury, enhance pulmonary tissue repair, and promote survival in ADA(-/-) mice.

In vivo, these macrophages remain in healthy airways for at least 4 weeks, can engulf neutrophils during acute lung injury, enhance pulmonary tissue repair, and promote survival in ADA(-/-) mice. Animals receiving the macrophages do not develop abnormal pathology or teratomas. CONCLUSIONS: PSCs are a reliable source to produce therapeutically active alveolar-like macrophages to treat airway disease.",

Conditioning therapy is necessary for reliable engraftment and full immune reconstitution; however, the beneficial effect of cytoreductive conditioning is counterbalanced by increased short- and long-term treatment-related toxicity. Whether bone marrow transplantation with a nonmyeloablative preparative regimen was sufficient for the establishment of donor immune reconstitution, with the resultant correction of disease phenotype, was investigated. Eight patients with severe immunodeficiency states underwent T-cell replete bone marrow transplantation from a human leukocyte antigen-matched unrelated (n = 6) or sibling (n = 2) donor with nonmyeloablative conditioning using a fludarabine-melphalan-anti-lymphocyte globulin-based regimen. All patients had severe organ dysfunction that precluded transplantation with conventional conditioning. All patients were engrafted with predominantly donor hematopoiesis, and the duration of neutropenia was brief. Significant acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) did not develop, but one patient had limited chronic GVHD. One patient died of disease recurrence, and 3 have stable, mixed chimerism. At a median follow-up of 1 year, all patients have had good recovery of CD3(+) T-cell numbers, and 6 of 7 evaluable patients have normal phytohemagglutinin stimulation indices. The rate of immune reconstitution is comparable with that of historical controls undergoing standard myeloablative protocols. Two patients with CD40 ligand deficiency now show significant expression, and a patient with adenosine deaminase deficiency has improved deoxy adenosine triphosphate metabolites. In summary, it has been demonstrated that nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation permits rapid engraftment from both sibling and unrelated donors with minimal toxicity even in the presence of severe organ dysfunction. If long-term immune reconstitution of patients treated with this protocol is demonstrated, it is believed this approach might offer significant advantages compared with standard protocols by combining adequate immune reconstitution with reduced short- and long-term toxicity.

Stem-cell sources may be bone marrow, umbilical cord blood and the peripheral blood of donors previously treated with colony stimulating factors for the mobilization CD34. We discuss the differences in the results obtained in patients treated at the Hospital Materno-Infantil Vall d'Hebron. Gene therapy opens a new era in the treatment of primary immunodeficiency diseases. The first patient to undergo this treatment in the United States of America had adenosine-deaminase deficiency, even though sustained remodeling has not been achieved. The favorable results obtained in patients with SCID by deficit in the gamma chain of the IL-2 receptor in Paris, with more than a year of follow up, suggest that the near future is promising. We also discuss the differences observed according to the vectors used and the underlying disease.",

METHODS: The NYS algorithm utilizes a first-tier molecular screen for TRECs (T-cell receptor excision circles), the absence of which is indicative of increased risk of immunodeficiency. RESULTS: During the first 2 years, 485,912 infants were screened for SCID. Repeat specimens were requested from 561 premature and 746 non-premature infants with low or borderline TRECs. A total of 531 infants were referred for diagnostic evaluation leading to identification of 10 infants with SCID and 87 with a clinically significant non-SCID abnormality based on flow cytometry or CBC results (positive predictive value 20.3 %). Nine infants were diagnosed with typical SCID and one with leaky SCID. SCID diagnoses included two patients with adenosine deaminase deficiency, three patients with typical and one with leaky IL2RG-related SCID, one patient with IL7Ralpha-related SCID, and three cases of typical SCID, etiology unknown. TRECs were undetectable in eight of the nine babies with typical SCID. Infants with other non-SCID conditions included 27 patients with a syndrome that included T-cell impairment, 18 of which had DiGeorge syndrome. Seventeen infants had T-cell impairment secondary to another clinically significant condition, and 13 were classified as 'other'. Among 30 infants classified as idiopathic T-cell lymphopenia, 11 have since resolved, and the remainder continues to be followed. One infant with undetectable TRECs had normal follow-up studies. Molecular studies revealed the presence of two changes in the infant's DNA. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, ten infants with SCID were identified during the first 2 years of screening in NYS, yielding an incidence of approximately 1 in 48,500 live births, which is consistent with the incidence observed by other states screening for SCID. The incidence of any clinically significant laboratory abnormality was approximately 1 in 5,000; both estimates are higher than estimates prior to the onset of newborn screening for SCID. Improvements to the NYS algorithm included the addition of a borderline category that reduced the proportion of infants referred for flow cytometric analysis, without decreasing sensitivity. We identified a large number of infants with abnormal TRECs and subsequent idiopathic T-cell lymphopenia.

METHODS: The NYS algorithm utilizes a first-tier molecular screen for TRECs (T-cell receptor excision circles), the absence of which is indicative of increased risk of immunodeficiency. RESULTS: During the first 2 years, 485,912 infants were screened for SCID. Repeat specimens were requested from 561 premature and 746 non-premature infants with low or borderline TRECs. A total of 531 infants were referred for diagnostic evaluation leading to identification of 10 infants with SCID and 87 with a clinically significant non-SCID abnormality based on flow cytometry or CBC results (positive predictive value 20.3 %). Nine infants were diagnosed with typical SCID and one with leaky SCID. SCID diagnoses included two patients with adenosine deaminase deficiency, three patients with typical and one with leaky IL2RG-related SCID, one patient with IL7Ralpha-related SCID, and three cases of typical SCID, etiology unknown. TRECs were undetectable in eight of the nine babies with typical SCID. Infants with other non-SCID conditions included 27 patients with a syndrome that included T-cell impairment, 18 of which had DiGeorge syndrome. Seventeen infants had T-cell impairment secondary to another clinically significant condition, and 13 were classified as 'other'. Among 30 infants classified as idiopathic T-cell lymphopenia, 11 have since resolved, and the remainder continues to be followed. One infant with undetectable TRECs had normal follow-up studies. Molecular studies revealed the presence of two changes in the infant's DNA. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, ten infants with SCID were identified during the first 2 years of screening in NYS, yielding an incidence of approximately 1 in 48,500 live births, which is consistent with the incidence observed by other states screening for SCID. The incidence of any clinically significant laboratory abnormality was approximately 1 in 5,000; both estimates are higher than estimates prior to the onset of newborn screening for SCID. Improvements to the NYS algorithm included the addition of a borderline category that reduced the proportion of infants referred for flow cytometric analysis, without decreasing sensitivity. We identified a large number of infants with abnormal TRECs and subsequent idiopathic T-cell lymphopenia. Long-term follow-up studies are needed to determine the prognosis and optimal treatment for this group of patients, some of whom may present with previously unrecognized, transient lymphopenia of infancy.",

STUDY DESIGN: We constructed a decision analysis model to estimate the costs and benefits of NBS in an annual birth cohort of 86 600 infants based on projections of avoided infant deaths. Point estimates and ranges for input variables, including the birth prevalence of SCID, proportion detected asymptomatically without screening through family history, screening test characteristics, survival rates, and costs of screening, diagnosis, and treatment were derived from published estimates, expert opinion, and the Washington NBS program. We estimated treatment costs stratified by age of identification and SCID type (with or without adenosine deaminase deficiency). Economic benefit was estimated using values of $4.2 and $9.0 million per death averted. We performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the influence of key variables on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of net direct cost per life-year saved. RESULTS: Our model predicts an additional 1.19 newborn infants with SCID detected preclinically through screening, in addition to those who would have been detected early through family history, and 0.40 deaths averted annually. Our base-case model suggests an ICER of $35 311 per life-year saved, and a benefit-cost ratio of either 5.31 or 2.71. Sensitivity analyses found ICER values <$100 000 and positive net benefit for plausible assumptions on all variables.

We investigated B cell deficiency in ADA-deficient mice and found that B cell development in the bone marrow was normal. However, spleens were markedly smaller, their architecture was dramatically altered, and splenic B lymphocytes showed defects in proliferation and activation. ADA-deficient B cells exhibited a higher propensity to undergo B cell receptor-mediated apoptosis than their wild-type counterparts, suggesting that ADA plays a role in the survival of cells during Ag-dependent responses. In keeping with this finding, IgM production by extrafollicular plasmablast cells was higher in ADA-deficient than in wild-type mice, thus indicating that activated B cells accumulate extrafollicularly as a result of a poor or nonexistent germinal center formation. This hypothesis was subsequently confirmed by the profound loss of germinal center architecture. A comparison of levels of the ADA substrates, adenosine and 2'-deoxyadenosine, as well resulting dATP levels and S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase inhibition in bone marrow and spleen suggested that dATP accumulation in ADA-deficient spleens may be responsible for impaired B cell development. The altered splenic environment and signaling abnormalities may concurrently contribute to a block in B cell Ag-dependent maturation in ADA-deficient mouse spleens.",

Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) can improve the metabolic, immune and non-immune abnormalities in patients prior to transplantation, however, its benefits over extended periods are not well characterized. We describe a 28-year-old female who received ERT for 27 years. She suffered from EBV negative B cell lymphoma of the hip at 14 years of age and Guillian-Barre Syndrome 2 years later. At 22 years of age, she experienced a gastrointestinal infection with Mycobacterium genavense. At 26 years of age, lymphoma reoccurred with multiple liver lesions followed by Mycobacterium genavense infection with dissemination to the brain. Throughout this period, ADA activity in the plasma was within the therapeutic range. Repeated evaluations demonstrated very low lymphocyte counts and impaired T cell function. CONCLUSIONS: ERT might be insufficient to maintain normal immunity over extended periods in some ADA-deficient patients.",

As this protocol has features distinct from those of other clinical trials, its results provide insights into SCGT for ADA deficiency. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pt 1 was treated at age 4.7 years, whereas pt 2, who had previously received T-cell gene therapy, was treated at age 13 years. Bone marrow CD34(+) cells were harvested after enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) was withdrawn; following transduction of ADA cDNA by the gamma-retroviral vector GCsapM-ADA, they were administered intravenously. No cytoreductive conditioning, at present considered critical for therapeutic benefit, was given before cell infusion. Hematological/immunological reconstitution kinetics, levels of systemic detoxification, gene-marking levels, and proviral insertion sites in hematopoietic cells were assessed. RESULTS: Treatment was well tolerated, and no serious adverse events were observed. Engraftment of gene-modified repopulating cells was evidenced by the appearance and maintenance of peripheral lymphocytes expressing functional ADA. Systemic detoxification was moderately achieved, allowing temporary discontinuation of ERT for 6 and 10 years in pt 1 and pt 2, respectively.

In its early-onset form, it is rapidly fatal to infants. Delayed or late-onset ADA-SCID is characterized by insidious progressive immunodeficiency that leads to permanent organ damage or death. Quantification of T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) or tandem mass spectrometry (tandem-MS) analysis of dried blood spots (DBSs) collected at birth can identify newborns with early-onset ADA-SCID and are used in screening programs. However, it is not clear whether these analyses can identify newborns who will have delayed or late-onset ADA-SCID before symptoms appear. OBJECTIVE: We performed a retrospective study to evaluate whether tandem-MS and quantitative TREC analyses of DBSs could identify newborns who had delayed-onset ADA-SCID later in life. METHODS: We tested stored DBSs collected at birth from 3 patients with delayed-onset ADA-SCID using tandem-MS (PCT EP2010/070517) to evaluate levels of adenosine and 2'-deoxyadenosine and real-time PCR to quantify TREC levels. We also analyzed DBSs from 3 newborns with early-onset ADA-SCID and 2 healthy newborn carriers of ADA deficiency. RESULTS: The DBSs taken at birth from the 3 patients with delayed-onset ADA-SCID had adenosine levels of 10, 25, and 19 mumol/L (normal value, <1.5 mumol/L) and 2'-deoxyadenosine levels of 0.7, 2.7, and 2.4 mumol/L (normal value, <0.07 mumol/L); the mean levels of adenosine and 2'-deoxyadenosine were respectively 12.0- and 27.6-fold higher than normal values. DBSs taken at birth from all 3 patients with delayed-onset ADA deficiency had normal TREC levels, but TRECs were undetectable in blood samples taken from the same patients at the time of diagnosis.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the results of the first year statewide NBS for ADA by means of dried blood spot NBS.

We report 1 known case of ADA deficiency in the 18 months before screening. We then reviewed the results of the first 2 years of TMS ADA screening in Michigan. RESULTS: There was 1 patient with ADA deficiency known to our centers in the 18 months before initiation of TMS ADA screening; this patient died of complications of their disease. In the first 2 years of TMS ADA NBS, 206,321 infants were screened, and 2 patients had positive ADA screen results. Both patients had ADA deficiency confirmed through biochemical and genetic testing.

Owing to the characteristics of adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency, a small but important number of cases can be missed by this screening. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the results of the first year statewide NBS for ADA by means of dried blood spot NBS. METHODS: On October 7, 2019, the state of Michigan began screening newborn dried blood spots for ADA deficiency by means of the Neobase-2 tandem mass spectroscopy (TMS) kit. We report 1 known case of ADA deficiency in the 18 months before screening. We then reviewed the results of the first 2 years of TMS ADA screening in Michigan. RESULTS: There was 1 patient with ADA deficiency known to our centers in the 18 months before initiation of TMS ADA screening; this patient died of complications of their disease. In the first 2 years of TMS ADA NBS, 206,321 infants were screened, and 2 patients had positive ADA screen results. Both patients had ADA deficiency confirmed through biochemical and genetic testing. One patient identified also had a positive TREC screen and was confirmed to have ADA-SCID. CONCLUSION: In our first 2 years, TMS NBS for ADA deficiency identified 2 patients with ADA deficiency at negligible cost, including 1 patient who would not have been identified by TREC NBS. This report provides initial evidence of the value of specific NBS for ADA deficiency.",

No clonal outgrow was observed indicating a limited risk for future malignant development. Despite these promising results, the safety of gene therapy can still be improved.",

In addition to infections, ADA-deficient patients can present with neurodevelopmental, behavioral, hearing, skeletal, lung, heart, skin, kidney, urogenital, and liver abnormalities. Some patients also suffer from autoimmunity and malignancies. In recent years, there have been remarkable advances in the management of ADA deficiency. Most ADA-deficient patients can be identified by newborn screening for severe combined immunodeficiency, which facilitates early diagnosis and treatment of asymptomatic infants.

When matched sibling donor or matched family member donor is not available, autologous ADA gene therapy with nonmyeloablative conditioning and ERT withdrawal, which is reported in recent studies to result in 100% overall survival and 90% to 95% engraftment, should be pursued. If gene therapy is not immediately available, ERT can be continued for a few years, although its excessive cost might be prohibitive. The recent improved outcome of hematopoietic cell transplantation using HLA-mismatched family-related donors or HLA-matched unrelated donors, after reduced-intensity conditioning, suggests that such procedures might also be considered rather than continuing ERT for prolonged periods.

This ranges from the establishment of the 293, 911 and PER.C6 cell lines, which are used worldwide for the production of replication-defective adenoviral vectors, to the development of targeted viral vectors and T lymphocytes as well as of non-viral vectors. Several milestones have been achieved in Dutch clinical gene therapy trials, including the first treatment worldwide of patients with adenosine deaminase deficiency with genetically corrected hematopoietic stem cells in collaboration with French and British scientists. Until now, about 230 patients with various diseases have been treated with viral and non-viral gene therapy in this country. Ongoing and upcoming Dutch clinical trials focus on the translation of new developments in gene therapy research, including the restoration of genetic defects other than SCID, and the use of oncolytic adenoviruses and targeted T cells for the treatment of cancer. The growing commercial interest in Dutch clinical gene therapy is reflected by the involvement of two Dutch companies in ongoing trials as well as the participation of Dutch clinical centres in large phase III international multicenter immuno-gene therapy trials on prostate cancer sponsored by an American company. Translational gene therapy research in The Netherlands is boosted at a governmental level by the Dutch Ministry of Health via a dedicated funding programme. This paper presents an overview on milestones in Dutch basic gene therapy research as well as on past, present and future clinical gene therapy trials in The Netherlands.",

Additionally, ADA-deficient patients suffer from hearing impairment. We hypothesized that ADA-deficient (-/-) mice also exhibit hearing abnormalities and that ERT from an early age will improve the hearing and immune defects in these mice. Methods: Auditory brainstem evoked responses, organ weights, thymocytes numbers, and subpopulations, lymphocytes in peripheral blood as well as T lymphocytes in spleen were analyzed in ADA-/- and ADA-proficient littermate post-partum (pp). The cochlea was visualized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The effects of polyethylene glycol conjugated ADA (PEG-ADA) ERT or 40% oxygen initiated at 7 days pp on the hearing and immune abnormalities were assessed. Results: Markedly abnormal hearing thresholds responses were found in ADA-/- mice at low and medium tone frequencies. SEM demonstrated extensive damage to the cochlear hair cells of ADA-/- mice, which were splayed, short or missing, correlating with the hearing deficits. The hearing defects were not reversed when hypoxia in ADA-/- mice was corrected. Progressive immune abnormalities were detected in ADA-/- mice from 4 days pp, initially affecting the thymus followed by peripheral lymphocytes and T cells in the spleen. ERT initiated at 7 days pp significantly improved the hearing of ADA-/- mice as well as the number of thymocytes and T lymphocytes, although not all normalized. Conclusions: ADA deficiency is associated with hearing deficits and damage to cochlear hair cells. Early initiation of ERT improves the hearing and immune abnormalities.",

Mismatched and unrelated donor transplants are common, demanding an increased vigilance to detect incipient graft failure, secondary lymphoma as well as relapse and other problems, which now are potentially treatable. To diagnose these complications it may be important to know whether blood and marrow cells are of recipient or donor origin. To evaluate the role of mixed donor-recipient chimerism in relation to clinical problems we adapted a polymerase chain-reaction technique, using fluorescent primers analyzing DNA fragment length polymorphisms, to follow prospectively 17 bone marrow grafted children. To increase the precision of chimerism analysis, immunomagnetically isolated leukocyte populations were assayed in selected cases. Five patients encountered clinical problems related to chimerism. One infant with adenosine deaminase deficiency failed to engraft stem cells, yet succumbed to graft-versus-host disease, mediated by mature donor T-cells. Three children developed significant mixed chimerism. One of these three patients died in relapse of leukemia, while the two other patients who had received T-cell depleted grafts had persistent recipient T-cells, in spite of engraftment. After 5 months, these were displaced by donor T-cells in one of the patients. In the fifth patient, also after T-cell depleted BMT, a fatal donor cell lymphoma occurred. Twelve children had stable full chimerism or in one case a low grade mixed chimerism and remain disease-free throughout follow up (median 9 months). In conclusion, the analysis of chimerism, particularly of separated leukocyte populations, offers an almost indispensable insight and a basis for therapeutic decisions in complicated situations such as grafting involving unrelated or mismatched donors, graft manipulation, adoptive immunotherapy and in immunodeficiency patients.",

Whilst most notable affects are on lymphocytes, other manifestations include skeletal abnormalities, neurodevelopmental affects and pulmonary manifestations associated with pulmonary-alveolar proteinosis. Affected patients present in early infancy, usually with persistent infection, or with pulmonary insufficiency. Three treatment options are currently available. Initial treatment with enzyme replacement therapy may alleviate acute symptoms and enable partial immunological reconstitution, but treatment is life-long, immune reconstitution is incomplete, and the reconstituted immune system may nullify the effects of the enzyme replacement. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant has long been established as the treatment of choice, particularly where a matched sibling or well matched unrelated donor is available. More recently, the use of gene addition techniques to correct the genetic defect in autologous haematopoietic stem cells treatment has demonstrated immunological and clinical efficacy. This article reviews the biology, clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment of ADA-deficiency.",

To better understand the causes of T-cell depletion in vivo and to discriminate between extracellular and intracellular effects of exogenously added adenosine in vitro, we investigated mechanisms of 2 different effects of adenosine on murine thymocytes. These effects of adenosine include direct induction of apoptosis in about 6% to 15% thymocytes and inhibition of T-cell receptor (TCR)-induced activation of the majority of thymocytes with inhibited ADA. A(2A) adenosine receptors, but not A(2B), A(1), or A(3) receptors, are shown to be mostly responsible for extAdo-triggered signaling (cyclic adenosine monophosphate [cAMP] accumulation) in murine thymocytes and this prompted studies of the effects of extAdo on thymocytes from A(2A)R gene-deficient mice. It is found that direct apoptotic effects of extAdo on CD4(+)CD8(+) double positive (DP) thymocytes are completely accounted for by signaling through A(2A)R, with no contribution of intracellular lymphotoxicity or of compensating A(2B)Rs because only A(2A)R +/+, but not A(2A)R -/- thymocytes were susceptible to apoptotic effects of extAdo.

Restoration of purine metabolism and immune functions can be achieved by enzyme replacement therapy, or more effectively by bone marrow transplant or HSC gene therapy (HSC-GT). However, autoimmune complications and autoantibody production, including anti-nuclear antibodies (ANAs), frequently occur in ADA-SCID patients after treatment. To assess whether ADA deficiency affects the establishment of B cell tolerance, we tested the reactivity of recombinant antibodies isolated from single B cells of ADA-SCID patients before and after HSC-GT. We found that before HSC-GT, new emigrant/transitional and mature naive B cells from ADA-SCID patients contained more autoreactive and ANA-expressing clones, indicative of defective central and peripheral B cell tolerance checkpoints. We further observed impaired B cell receptor (BCR) and TLR functions in B cells after ADA inhibition, which may underlie the defects in B cell tolerance. Strikingly, after HSC-GT, ADA-SCID patients displayed quasi-normal early B cell tolerance checkpoints, as evidenced by restored removal of developing autoreactive and ANA-expressing B cells. Hence, ADA plays an essential role in controlling autoreactive B cell counterselection by regulating BCR and TLR functions.",

Restoration of purine metabolism and immune functions can be achieved by enzyme replacement therapy, or more effectively by bone marrow transplant or HSC gene therapy (HSC-GT). However, autoimmune complications and autoantibody production, including anti-nuclear antibodies (ANAs), frequently occur in ADA-SCID patients after treatment. To assess whether ADA deficiency affects the establishment of B cell tolerance, we tested the reactivity of recombinant antibodies isolated from single B cells of ADA-SCID patients before and after HSC-GT. We found that before HSC-GT, new emigrant/transitional and mature naive B cells from ADA-SCID patients contained more autoreactive and ANA-expressing clones, indicative of defective central and peripheral B cell tolerance checkpoints. We further observed impaired B cell receptor (BCR) and TLR functions in B cells after ADA inhibition, which may underlie the defects in B cell tolerance. Strikingly, after HSC-GT, ADA-SCID patients displayed quasi-normal early B cell tolerance checkpoints, as evidenced by restored removal of developing autoreactive and ANA-expressing B cells. Hence, ADA plays an essential role in controlling autoreactive B cell counterselection by regulating BCR and TLR functions.",

OBJECTIVES: We sought to characterize the frequency and features of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) in patients with ADA deficiency. METHODS: Clinical and laboratory features of all patients with SCID caused by ADA deficiency in a single center were analyzed. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and lung biopsy specimens were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and periodic acid-Schiff, visualized by means of electron microscopy, and studied for associated infections. As a control group, BAL fluid and biopsy specimens from 22 patients with SCID caused by other genetic abnormalities were similarly assessed. RESULTS: Among 16 consecutive patients with ADA deficiency, 7 had BAL fluid containing periodic acid-Schiff-positive surfactant-like material with macrophages engulfing degenerating lamellar bodies and/or lung biopsy specimens with alveolar spaces filled with homogeneous granular eosinophilic material and large macrophages. The lung pathology was typical of PAP. Identification of various pathogens coincided with PAP in 3 of these patients. We have diagnosed PAP among patients with ADA deficiency more commonly in the last 10 years than previously (P= .05), likely reflecting increased awareness of this condition. There were no significant differences in the clinical or immunologic characteristics between patients with ADA deficiency with or without PAP. Similar findings of PAP were not found among patients with SCID caused by other genetic abnormalities (P= .001). ADA coupled to polyethylene glycol or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation rapidly corrected this pulmonary complication.
