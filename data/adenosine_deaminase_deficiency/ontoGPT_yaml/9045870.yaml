input_text: Insights into thymic purine metabolism and adenosine deaminase deficiency
  revealed by transgenic mice overexpressing ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73). The adenosine
  producing enzyme ecto-5'-nucleotidase (5'-NT) is not normally expressed during thymocyte
  development until the medullary stage. To determine whether earlier expression would
  lead to adenosine accumulation and/or be deleterious for thymocyte maturation, thymic
  purine metabolism, and T cell differentiation were studied in lckNT transgenic mice
  overexpressing 5'-NT in cortical thymocytes under the control of the lck proximal
  promoter. In spite of a 100-fold elevation in thymic 5'-NT activity, transgenic
  adenosine levels were unchanged and T cell immunity was normal. Inosine, the product
  of adenosine deamination, was elevated more than twofold, however, indicating that
  adenosine deaminase (ADA) can prevent the accumulation of adenosine, even with a
  dramatic increase in 5'-NT activity, and demonstrating the availability of 5'-NT
  substrates in the thymus for the first time. Thymic adenosine concentrations of
  mice treated with the ADA inhibitor 2'-deoxycoformycin (dCF) were elevated over
  30-fold, suggesting that high ADA activity, rather than an absence of 5'-NT, is
  mainly responsible for low thymic adenosine levels. The adenosine concentrations
  in dCF-treated mice are sufficient to cause adenosine receptor-mediated thymocyte
  apoptosis in vitro, suggesting that adenosine accumulation could play a role in
  ADA-deficient severe combined immunodeficiency.
