input_text: 'Cost analysis of treatments for severe combined immunodeficiency patients
  caused by adenosine deaminase deficiency: comparison of gene therapy and bone marrow
  transplantation. In order to perform a cost assessment of treatment for severe combined-immunodeficiency
  patients caused by adenosine deaminase deficiency, we estimated the cost for 3 successfully
  treated patients in Japan for whom related HLA-identical bone marrow donors could
  not be found. One patient received gene therapy and the other 2 patients received
  HLA-haploidentical bone marrow transplantation. The medical costs required for hospitalization
  periods for gene therapy and bone marrow transplantation were estimated respectively
  by analyzing the monthly bills that were calculated based on the fee schedule covered
  by health insurance. In the gene therapy, the total cost was calculated by adding
  the charges not covered by health insurance. The gene therapy and transplantation
  patients had significant differences in terms of cost structure and total cost.
  The items concerning "procedures" associated with gene transduction in the former
  amounted to 47.8% of the total cost, and "medication" in the latter amounted to
  34.3% and 31.9% respectively. The items concerning "hospitalization" amounted to
  a large percentage in both treatments. The total cost was estimated at approximately
  18.9 million yen for gene therapy, and 7.4 million yen and 10.5 million yen for
  transplantation. These results obtained through this study revealed the cost structure
  of gene therapy in comparison with transplantation. This report represents the first
  step to the assessment of medical technology of human gene therapy, in terms of
  medical cost, in which a stable and favorable therapeutic outcome was achieved.'
