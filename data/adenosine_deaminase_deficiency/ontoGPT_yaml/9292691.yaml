input_text: 'Detection of JC virus by anti-VP1 immunohistochemistry in brains with
  progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. We have assessed the diagnostic efficacy
  of a novel polyclonal rabbit antiserum directed to the recombinant major capsid
  protein VP1 of JC virus (JCV). Immunohistochemistry for VP1 was compared to non-radioactive
  JCV DNA in situ hybridization (ISH) in ten cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
  (PML). Tissue sections from postmortem brains were studied from PML patients suffering
  from immunodeficient conditions of various causes: immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS,
  n = 7), severe combined immune deficiency due to adenosine deaminase deficiency
  (n = 1), sarcoidosis (n = 1) and leukemia (n = 1). VP1 immunohistochemistry demonstrated
  the presence of JCV in lesional oligodendrocytes of all PML patients, whereas ISH
  was able to detect JCV in nine out of ten cases. We conclude that VP1 immunohistochemistry
  is a specific, sensitive and rapid method for confirming the diagnosis of PML.'
