input_text: Gene therapy for ovarian carcinoma. Originally conceived and applied for
  the treatment of inherited monogenetic defects such as adenosine deaminase deficiency
  and cystic fibrosis, gene therapy was later applied to the treatment of cancer.
  Such a genetic strategy seemed rational given the recognition that cancer typically
  develops in a multistep process involving alterations of a number of different genes
  as demonstrated in familial polyposis and colorectal cancer through the work of
  Vogelstein et al. Because of the numerous alterations that may result in the eventual
  development of cancer, there is no obvious single choice for a therapeutic gene.
  Although one may view this as an obstacle, it also allows for a variety of possible
  therapeutic interventions. This review focuses on the known genetic defects that
  occur in ovarian cancer, the gene therapy strategies suggested by such defects,
  and the approaches under current development for the treatment of this disease.
  As such, this work also describes some of the approved human gene therapy protocols.
  Finally, an overview of the problems and directions for future growth and research
  is presented.
