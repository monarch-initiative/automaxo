input_text: Successful peripheral T-lymphocyte-directed gene transfer for a patient
  with severe combined immune deficiency caused by adenosine deaminase deficiency.
  Ten patients with adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA-) have been enrolled in gene
  therapy clinical trials since the first patient was treated in September 1990. We
  describe a Japanese ADA- severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) patient who has
  received periodic infusions of genetically modified autologous T lymphocytes transduced
  with the human ADA cDNA containing retroviral vector LASN. The percentage of peripheral
  blood lymphocytes carrying the transduced ADA gene has remained stable at 10% to
  20% during the 12 months since the fourth infusion. ADA enzyme activity in the patient's
  circulating T cells, which was only marginally detected before gene transfer, increased
  to levels comparable to those of a heterozygous carrier individual and was associated
  with increased T-lymphocyte counts and improvement of the patient's immune function.
  The results obtained in this trial are in agreement with previously published observations
  and support the usefulness of T lymphocyte-directed gene transfer in the treatment
  of ADA-SCID.
