input_text: "Cellular radiosensitivity in human severe-combined-immunodeficiency (SCID)
  syndromes. PURPOSE: The aim of the work was to establish to what extent a variety
  of human severe-combined-immunodeficiency (SCID) disorders are associated with in
  vitro cellular hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A
  study was made of fibroblast strains established from individuals with adenosine
  deaminase deficiency, T(-)B(-) SCID, Omenn's syndrome and a SCID heterozygote. For
  comparison, an assessment was also made of the radiosensitivity of a series of fibroblast
  strains derived from: normal donors, a patients with ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T)
  and an A-T heterozygote. Radiosensitivity was determined using a clonogenic assay
  following both high (HDR) and low (LDR) dose-rate irradiation. RESULTS: Following
  HDR irradiation, the fibroblast strains derived from the different human SCID disorders
  displayed a wide range of radiosensitivity: the adenosine deaminase deficiency cells
  were similar in radiosensitivity to normal fibroblasts, T(-)B(-) cells were as hypersensitive
  to radiation as A-T cells and the Omenn's syndrome cells showed intermediate radiosensitivity.
  However, whereas all four normal cell strains studied showed significant LDR sparing,
  none of the SCID fibroblasts did. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that human SCID
  is variable in terms of radiosensitivity depending on the particular defect. In
  addition, the lack of LDR sparing of radiation-induced damage suggests the involvement
  of some form(s) of DNA repair defect in all the human SCID syndromes."
