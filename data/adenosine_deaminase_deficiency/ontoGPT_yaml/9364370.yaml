input_text: A girl with diabetes and severe combined immunodeficiency from adenosine
  deaminase deficiency. We present a girl with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)
  from adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency who developed insulin dependent diabetes
  mellitus (IDDM). This combination of features has not been previously reported.
  Because HLA typing (DQbeta-57 Asp/Asp and DQalpha-52 Ser/Ser) showed no alleles
  usually associated with IDDM, and ICA were repeatedly negative even after treatment
  with PEG-ADA and gene transplant, hypotheses on the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus
  in this patient are discussed.
