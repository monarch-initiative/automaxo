input_text: 'Keratinocyte gene therapy for adenosine deaminase deficiency: a model
  approach for inherited metabolic disorders. Disorders in which there is toxic buildup
  of circulating substrate may be treated by furnishing an enzyme reservoir capable
  of metabolically processing the excess substrate. The epidermal keratinocyte is
  a potential site for such a reservoir. In this study, we explore the capacity of
  genetically modified keratinocytes to metabolize extracellular substrate in a culture
  model that resembles in vivo epidermal architecture. Keratinocytes from adenosine
  deaminase (ADA)-deficient patients were transduced with a retroviral vector encoding
  the human ADA gene and the capacity of this tissue to deaminate deoxyadenosine (dAdo)
  in vitro was measured. The results show that at a substrate concentration of 10
  microM, ADA-corrected keratinocytes deaminate dAdo at a rate of 0.38 nmol/min.10(6)
  cells. These results indicate that keratinocytes process extracellular substrate
  at rates that suggest complete substrate conversion in a single pass. This study
  provides a strong indication that the epidermis, the largest and most accessible
  tissue of the body, is a valuable site for designing clinically relevant gene therapies.'
