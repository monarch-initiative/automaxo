9364370	A girl with diabetes and severe combined immunodeficiency from adenosine deaminase deficiency. We present a girl with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) from adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency who developed insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). This combination of features has not been previously reported. Because HLA typing (DQbeta-57 Asp/Asp and DQalpha-52 Ser/Ser) showed no alleles usually associated with IDDM, and ICA were repeatedly negative even after treatment with PEG-ADA and gene transplant, hypotheses on the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus in this patient are discussed.
9292691	Detection of JC virus by anti-VP1 immunohistochemistry in brains with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. We have assessed the diagnostic efficacy of a novel polyclonal rabbit antiserum directed to the recombinant major capsid protein VP1 of JC virus (JCV). Immunohistochemistry for VP1 was compared to non-radioactive JCV DNA in situ hybridization (ISH) in ten cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Tissue sections from postmortem brains were studied from PML patients suffering from immunodeficient conditions of various causes: immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS, n = 7), severe combined immune deficiency due to adenosine deaminase deficiency (n = 1), sarcoidosis (n = 1) and leukemia (n = 1). VP1 immunohistochemistry demonstrated the presence of JCV in lesional oligodendrocytes of all PML patients, whereas ISH was able to detect JCV in nine out of ten cases. We conclude that VP1 immunohistochemistry is a specific, sensitive and rapid method for confirming the diagnosis of PML.
9132827	Cellular radiosensitivity in human severe-combined-immunodeficiency (SCID) syndromes. PURPOSE: The aim of the work was to establish to what extent a variety of human severe-combined-immunodeficiency (SCID) disorders are associated with in vitro cellular hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A study was made of fibroblast strains established from individuals with adenosine deaminase deficiency, T(-)B(-) SCID, Omenn's syndrome and a SCID heterozygote. For comparison, an assessment was also made of the radiosensitivity of a series of fibroblast strains derived from: normal donors, a patients with ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) and an A-T heterozygote. Radiosensitivity was determined using a clonogenic assay following both high (HDR) and low (LDR) dose-rate irradiation. RESULTS: Following HDR irradiation, the fibroblast strains derived from the different human SCID disorders displayed a wide range of radiosensitivity: the adenosine deaminase deficiency cells were similar in radiosensitivity to normal fibroblasts, T(-)B(-) cells were as hypersensitive to radiation as A-T cells and the Omenn's syndrome cells showed intermediate radiosensitivity. However, whereas all four normal cell strains studied showed significant LDR sparing, none of the SCID fibroblasts did. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that human SCID is variable in terms of radiosensitivity depending on the particular defect. In addition, the lack of LDR sparing of radiation-induced damage suggests the involvement of some form(s) of DNA repair defect in all the human SCID syndromes.
9195213	Keratinocyte gene therapy for adenosine deaminase deficiency: a model approach for inherited metabolic disorders. Disorders in which there is toxic buildup of circulating substrate may be treated by furnishing an enzyme reservoir capable of metabolically processing the excess substrate. The epidermal keratinocyte is a potential site for such a reservoir. In this study, we explore the capacity of genetically modified keratinocytes to metabolize extracellular substrate in a culture model that resembles in vivo epidermal architecture. Keratinocytes from adenosine deaminase (ADA)-deficient patients were transduced with a retroviral vector encoding the human ADA gene and the capacity of this tissue to deaminate deoxyadenosine (dAdo) in vitro was measured. The results show that at a substrate concentration of 10 microM, ADA-corrected keratinocytes deaminate dAdo at a rate of 0.38 nmol/min.10(6) cells. These results indicate that keratinocytes process extracellular substrate at rates that suggest complete substrate conversion in a single pass. This study provides a strong indication that the epidermis, the largest and most accessible tissue of the body, is a valuable site for designing clinically relevant gene therapies.
9612707	Cost analysis of treatments for severe combined immunodeficiency patients caused by adenosine deaminase deficiency: comparison of gene therapy and bone marrow transplantation. In order to perform a cost assessment of treatment for severe combined-immunodeficiency patients caused by adenosine deaminase deficiency, we estimated the cost for 3 successfully treated patients in Japan for whom related HLA-identical bone marrow donors could not be found. One patient received gene therapy and the other 2 patients received HLA-haploidentical bone marrow transplantation. The medical costs required for hospitalization periods for gene therapy and bone marrow transplantation were estimated respectively by analyzing the monthly bills that were calculated based on the fee schedule covered by health insurance. In the gene therapy, the total cost was calculated by adding the charges not covered by health insurance. The gene therapy and transplantation patients had significant differences in terms of cost structure and total cost. The items concerning "procedures" associated with gene transduction in the former amounted to 47.8% of the total cost, and "medication" in the latter amounted to 34.3% and 31.9% respectively. The items concerning "hospitalization" amounted to a large percentage in both treatments. The total cost was estimated at approximately 18.9 million yen for gene therapy, and 7.4 million yen and 10.5 million yen for transplantation. These results obtained through this study revealed the cost structure of gene therapy in comparison with transplantation. This report represents the first step to the assessment of medical technology of human gene therapy, in terms of medical cost, in which a stable and favorable therapeutic outcome was achieved.
9045870	Insights into thymic purine metabolism and adenosine deaminase deficiency revealed by transgenic mice overexpressing ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73). The adenosine producing enzyme ecto-5'-nucleotidase (5'-NT) is not normally expressed during thymocyte development until the medullary stage. To determine whether earlier expression would lead to adenosine accumulation and/or be deleterious for thymocyte maturation, thymic purine metabolism, and T cell differentiation were studied in lckNT transgenic mice overexpressing 5'-NT in cortical thymocytes under the control of the lck proximal promoter. In spite of a 100-fold elevation in thymic 5'-NT activity, transgenic adenosine levels were unchanged and T cell immunity was normal. Inosine, the product of adenosine deamination, was elevated more than twofold, however, indicating that adenosine deaminase (ADA) can prevent the accumulation of adenosine, even with a dramatic increase in 5'-NT activity, and demonstrating the availability of 5'-NT substrates in the thymus for the first time. Thymic adenosine concentrations of mice treated with the ADA inhibitor 2'-deoxycoformycin (dCF) were elevated over 30-fold, suggesting that high ADA activity, rather than an absence of 5'-NT, is mainly responsible for low thymic adenosine levels. The adenosine concentrations in dCF-treated mice are sufficient to cause adenosine receptor-mediated thymocyte apoptosis in vitro, suggesting that adenosine accumulation could play a role in ADA-deficient severe combined immunodeficiency.
9414266	Successful peripheral T-lymphocyte-directed gene transfer for a patient with severe combined immune deficiency caused by adenosine deaminase deficiency. Ten patients with adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA-) have been enrolled in gene therapy clinical trials since the first patient was treated in September 1990. We describe a Japanese ADA- severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) patient who has received periodic infusions of genetically modified autologous T lymphocytes transduced with the human ADA cDNA containing retroviral vector LASN. The percentage of peripheral blood lymphocytes carrying the transduced ADA gene has remained stable at 10% to 20% during the 12 months since the fourth infusion. ADA enzyme activity in the patient's circulating T cells, which was only marginally detected before gene transfer, increased to levels comparable to those of a heterozygous carrier individual and was associated with increased T-lymphocyte counts and improvement of the patient's immune function. The results obtained in this trial are in agreement with previously published observations and support the usefulness of T lymphocyte-directed gene transfer in the treatment of ADA-SCID.
9801258	Adenosine deaminase deficiency: clinical expression, molecular basis, and therapy. Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency is the first known cause of severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID). Over the past 25 years, the metabolic basis for immune deficiency has largely been established. The clinical spectrum associated with ADA deficiency is now quite broad, including older children and adults. The ADA gene has been sequenced, the structure of the enzyme has been determined, and over 50 ADA gene mutations have been identified. There appears to be a quantitative relationship between residual ADA activity, determined by genotype, and both metabolic and clinical phenotype. ADA deficiency has become a focus for novel approaches to enzyme replacement and gene therapy. Enzyme replacement with polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified ADA, used to treat patients who lack a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched bone marrow donor, is safe and effective, but expensive. Several approaches to gene therapy have been investigated in patients receiving PEG-ADA. Persistent expression of transduced ADA cDNA in T lymphocytes and myeloid cells has occurred in a few patients, but significant improvement in immune function because of the transduced cells has not been shown. The major barrier to effective gene therapy remains the low efficiency of stem cell transduction with retroviral vectors.
9633852	Gene therapy for ovarian carcinoma. Originally conceived and applied for the treatment of inherited monogenetic defects such as adenosine deaminase deficiency and cystic fibrosis, gene therapy was later applied to the treatment of cancer. Such a genetic strategy seemed rational given the recognition that cancer typically develops in a multistep process involving alterations of a number of different genes as demonstrated in familial polyposis and colorectal cancer through the work of Vogelstein et al. Because of the numerous alterations that may result in the eventual development of cancer, there is no obvious single choice for a therapeutic gene. Although one may view this as an obstacle, it also allows for a variety of possible therapeutic interventions. This review focuses on the known genetic defects that occur in ovarian cancer, the gene therapy strategies suggested by such defects, and the approaches under current development for the treatment of this disease. As such, this work also describes some of the approved human gene therapy protocols. Finally, an overview of the problems and directions for future growth and research is presented.
