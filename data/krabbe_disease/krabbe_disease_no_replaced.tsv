37952085	Combination hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and intravenous AAVrh10-mediated gene therapy in a canine model proves pivotal for translation of Krabbe disease therapy. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only approved treatment for presymptomatic infantile globoid cell leukodystrophy (GLD, Krabbe disease). However, correction of disease is not complete, and outcomes remain poor. Herein we evaluated HSCT, intravenous (IV) AAVrh10 gene therapy, and combination HSCT + IV AAVrh10 in the canine model of GLD. While HSCT alone resulted in no increase in survival as compared to untreated GLD dogs (~16 weeks of age), combination HSCT + IV AAVrh10 at a dose of 4E13 gc/kg resulted in delayed disease progression and increased survival beyond one year of age. A 5-fold increase in AAVrh10 dose to 2E14 gc/kg, in combination with HSCT, normalized neurologic dysfunction up to 2 years of age. Intravenous AAVrh10 alone resulted in an average survival of 41.2 weeks of age. In the peripheral nervous system, IV AAVrh10 alone or in addition to HSCT normalized nerve conduction velocity, improved ultrastructure, and normalized GALC enzyme activity and psychosine concentration. In the central nervous system, only combination therapy at the highest dose was able to restore GALC activity and psychosine concentration to within normal range. These data have now guided clinical translation of systemic AAV gene therapy as an addition to HSCT (NCT04693598, NCT05739643).
37147621	Molecular genetic screening of full-term small for gestational age. OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical application of genomic screening in newborns small for gestational age (SGA), hoping to provide an efficient technique for early discovery of neonatal diseases, which is necessary to elevate survival rates and the quality of life in infants. METHODS: Totally 93 full-term SGA newborns were assessed. Dried blood spot (DBS) samples were obtained at 72 h after birth, and tandem mass spectrometry (TMS) and Angel Care genomic screening (GS, using Targeted next generation sequencing) were carried out. RESULTS: All 93 subjects were examined by Angel Care GS and TMS. No children showing inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) were detected by TMS, while 2 pediatric cases (2.15%, 2/93) were confirmed as thyroid dyshormonogenesis 6 (TDH6) by Angel Care GS. Additionally, 45 pediatric cases (48.4%) had one or more variants conferring a carrier status for recessive childhood-onset disorders, with 31 genes and 42 variants associated with 26 diseases. The top three gene-related diseases with carrier status were autosomal recessive deafness (DFNB), abnormal thyroid hormone and Krabbe disease. CONCLUSIONS: SGA is tightly associated with genetic variation. Molecular Genetic Screening allows early detection of congenital hypothyroidism and may be a potent genomic sequencing technique for screening newborns.
36196048	Preclinical studies in Krabbe disease: A model for the investigation of novel combination therapies for lysosomal storage diseases. Krabbe disease (KD) is a lysosomal storage disease (LSD) caused by mutations in the galc gene. There are over 50 monogenetic LSDs, which largely impede the normal development of children and often lead to premature death. At present, there are no cures for LSDs and the available treatments are generally insufficient, short acting, and not without co-morbidities or long-term side effects. The last 30 years have seen significant advances in our understanding of LSD pathology as well as treatment options. Two gene therapy-based clinical trials, NCT04693598 and NCT04771416, for KD were recently started based on those advances. This review will discuss how our knowledge of KD got to where it is today, focusing on preclinical investigations, and how what was discovered may prove beneficial for the treatment of other LSDs.

36835039	Gene Therapy of Sphingolipid Metabolic Disorders. Sphingolipidoses are defined as a group of rare hereditary diseases resulting from mutations in the genes encoding lysosomal enzymes. This group of lysosomal storage diseases includes more than 10 genetic disorders, including GM1-gangliosidosis, Tay-Sachs disease, Sandhoff disease, the AB variant of GM2-gangliosidosis, Fabry disease, Gaucher disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy, Krabbe disease, Niemann-Pick disease, Farber disease, etc. Enzyme deficiency results in accumulation of sphingolipids in various cell types, and the nervous system is also usually affected. There are currently no known effective methods for the treatment of sphingolipidoses; however, gene therapy seems to be a promising therapeutic variant for this group of diseases. In this review, we discuss gene therapy approaches for sphingolipidoses that are currently being investigated in clinical trials, among which adeno-associated viral vector-based approaches and transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells genetically modified with lentiviral vectors seem to be the most effective.
36200664	An autopsy case report of adult-onset Krabbe disease: Comparison with an infantile-onset case. Krabbe disease is a lysosomal storage disease caused by a deficiency of the galactocerebrosidase (GALC) enzyme, which leads to demyelination of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Almost all patients with Krabbe disease are infants, and this is the first report of adult-onset cases that describe pathological findings. Here, we present two autopsy cases: a 73-year-old female and a 2-year-old male. The adult-onset case developed symptoms in her late thirties and was diagnosed by the identification of GALC D528N and L634S mutations and by T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging; she had increased signal in the white matter along the pyramidal tract to the bilateral precentral gyrus, as well as from the triangular part to the posterior horn of the lateral ventricle. Microscopically, Kluver-Barrera staining was pale in the white matter of the precentral gyrus and occipito-thalamic radiation, and a few globoid cells were observed. The GALC mutations that were identified in the present adult-onset case do not completely inactivate GALC enzyme activity, resulting in focal demyelination of the brain.
37628569	Brain Targeted AAV1-GALC Gene Therapy Reduces Psychosine and Extends Lifespan in a Mouse Model of Krabbe Disease. Krabbe disease (KD) is a progressive and devasting neurological disorder that leads to the toxic accumulation of psychosine in the white matter of the central nervous system (CNS). The condition is inherited via biallelic, loss-of-function mutations in the galactosylceramidase (GALC) gene. To rescue GALC gene function in the CNS of the twitcher mouse model of KD, an adeno-associated virus serotype 1 vector expressing murine GALC under control of a chicken beta-actin promoter (AAV1-GALC) was administered to newborn mice by unilateral intracerebroventricular injection. AAV1-GALC treatment significantly improved body weight gain and survival of the twitcher mice (n = 8) when compared with untreated controls (n = 5). The maximum weight gain after postnatal day 10 was significantly increased from 81% to 217%. The median lifespan was extended from 43 days to 78 days (range: 74-88 days) in the AAV1-GALC-treated group. Widespread expression of GALC protein and alleviation of KD neuropathology were detected in the CNS of the treated mice when examined at the moribund stage. Functionally, elevated levels of psychosine were completely normalized in the forebrain region of the treated mice. In the posterior region, which includes the mid- and the hindbrain, psychosine was reduced by an average of 77% (range: 53-93%) compared to the controls. Notably, psychosine levels in this region were inversely correlated with body weight and lifespan of AAV1-GALC-treated mice, suggesting that the degree of viral transduction of posterior brain regions following ventricular injection determined treatment efficacy on growth and survivability, respectively. Overall, our results suggest that viral vector delivery via the cerebroventricular system can partially correct psychosine accumulation in brain that leads to slower disease progression in KD.
36056676	Why must the debate continue on Krabbe disease newborn screening? Since the early 2000s, many families impacted by Krabbe disease have tried to implement newborn screening for this rare fatal neurological disorder in their home state. However, despite grassroots efforts, states have been unable to agree to newborn screening for Krabbe disease due to poor testing mechanisms, lack of understanding of the developmental outcomes of transplantation, low incidence rate, and more. Over the past five years, many organizations and experts have made significant strides to help Krabbe disease meet the eligibility requirements for state panels and the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP). Nevertheless, ethicists and newborn screening advisory committees continue to disregard the progress our community has made in the treatment and screening of Krabbe disease.
38311562	[Genetic analysis of a case with Adult-onset globoid cell leukodystrophy]. OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical features and genetic etiology of a patient with Adult-onset globoid cell leukodystrophy/Krabbe disease (KD). METHODS: A patient who was admitted to the Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology on February 15, 2022 due to exacerbation of right leg weakness for over 4 years was selected as the study subject. Clinical data and results of medical imaging and genetic analysis were analyzed. Candidate variants were verified by family analysis. RESULTS: The patient, a 36-year-old woman, had spasmodic gait as the primary presentation. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed symmetrical abnormalities in the bilateral corticospinal tracts, and the activity of beta-galactocerebrosidase (GALC) in her white blood cells was significantly decreased. The patient was found to harbor compound heterozygous variants of the GALC gene, namely c.461C>A (p.Pro154His) and c.1901T>C (p.Leu634Ser). Her mother, sister and nephew were heterozygous carriers of the c.461C>A (p.Pro154His) variant, whilst her father was heterozygous for the c.1901T>C (p.Leu634Ser) variant. CONCLUSION: The patient was ultimately diagnosed with adult-onset KD, for which the compound heterozygous variants of the GALC gene may be accountable.
37080866	Favorable outcome of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in late-onset Krabbe disease. BACKGROUND: Late-onset Krabbe disease is a disorder with autosomal recessive inheritance caused by a deficiency in galactocerebrosidase (GALC) activity. Its late-onset form usually shows slow disease progression with atypical symptoms including spastic paresis. The efficacy of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in late-onset Krabbe disease has not been fully established. CASE REPORT: We describe the case of a patient with late-onset Krabbe disease showing progressive spastic paraparesis. At the age of 18, one and a half years after the development of symptoms, the patient underwent HSCT. After HSCT, the patient's GALC activity returned to a normal level and the lesions in the brain and spinal cord became faint on images. Over two and a half years after the HSCT, the patient's gait remained spastic, however, an improvement in gait speed and modified Rankin Scale score was observed. No severe adverse events occurred during this period. CONCLUSION: Our experience reported herein provides additional evidence for a favorable course in HSCT conducted in the early course of late-onset Krabbe disease.
