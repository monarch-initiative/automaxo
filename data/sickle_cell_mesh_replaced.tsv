This study aims to synthesize available data on EBIs for diseaseD000755 and assess IROs. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of RCTs reporting on EBIs for diseaseD000755 management implemented in LMICs. We identified articles from PubMed/Medline, Global Health, PubMed Central, Embase, Web of Science medical subject heading (MeSH and Emtree) and keywords, published from inception through February 23, 2020, and conducted an updated search through December 24, 2020. We provide intervention characteristics for each study, EBI impact on diseaseD000755, and evidence of reporting on IROs. MAIN RESULTS: 29 RCTs were analyzed. EBIs identified included disease modifying agents, supportive care agents/analgesics, anti-malarials, systemic treatments, 9606/ provider education, and nutritional supplements. Studies using disease modifying agents, nutritional supplements, and anti-malarials reported improvements in diseaseD010146 crisis, hospitalization, children's growth and reduction in severity and prevalence of diseaseD008288. Two studies reported on the sustainability of supplementary chemicalD001120, chemicalD002956, and daily chemicalD002738 and chemicalD006918 for diseaseD000755 9606. Only 13 studies (44.8%) provided descriptions that captured at least three of the eight IROs. There was limited reporting of acceptability, feasibility, fidelity, cost and sustainability. CONCLUSION: EBIs are effective for diseaseD000755 management in LMICs; however, measurement of IROs is scarce. Future research should focus on penetration of EBIs to inform evidence-based practice and sustainability in the context of LMICs. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: This review is registered in PROSPERO #CRD42020167289.
27677923	Positive_Correlation|chemicalD006918|diseaseD000740; Negative_Correlation|chemicalD006918|diseaseD000755	Epidemiology and treatment of diseaseD000740 in children with diseaseD000755 in sub-Saharan Africa.INTRODUCTION: diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) is the most common diseaseD006453 in the world, with the majority of cases in sub-Saharan Africa. Concomitant diseaseD044342, diseaseD007239 or exposure to environmental toxins exacerbate chronic diseaseD000740 in children with diseaseD000755. The resulting diseaseD000740 is associated with increased risk of diseaseD020521, diseaseD003072 and diseaseD006130. It may also attenuate optimal response to chemicalD006918 therapy, the only effective and practical treatment option for diseaseD000755 in sub-Saharan Africa. This review will focus on the epidemiology, clinical sequelae, and treatment of diseaseD000740 in children with diseaseD000755 living in low and middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Areas covered: The causes and treatment of diseaseD000740 in children with diseaseD000755 in sub-Saharan Africa. The MEDLINE database was searched using medical subject headings (MeSH) and keywords for articles regarding diseaseD000740 in children with diseaseD000755 in sub-Saharan Africa. Expert commentary: diseaseD000740 due to diseaseD044342 and diseaseD003141 such as diseaseD006373 and diseaseD008288 are prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa. Their co-existence in children with diseaseD000755 increases morbidity and mortality. Therefore, preventing, diagnosing and treating the underlying cause of this diseaseD000740 will improve diseaseD000755-related outcomes in children in sub-Saharan Africa.
30540112		SOCIOECONOMIC AND NUTRITIONAL diseaseD062706 OF CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH diseaseD000755: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW.OBJECTIVE: To describe the socioeconomic and nutritional characteristics of children and adolescents with diseaseD000755. DATA SOURCES: The present study is a systematic literature review based on published scientific articles. The searches were carried out using the electronic database of the National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health- PubMed. Two searches of articles published in the last 20years and without limitation of language were carried out. Thefirst one started from the Medical Subject Headings term "diseaseD000755 Cell" associated with "Socioeconomic Factors"; and the second started from the term "diseaseD000755 Cell" associated with "Anthropometry". Thesearches were directed to research conducted on 9606 in the age group from 0 to 18years. DATA SYNTHESIS: The final selection was composed by 11 articles on socioeconomic characteristics and 21articles on nutritional characteristics. Allstudies included children and adolescents with diseaseD000755 (age range 0-18years), both genders, and most of them of black ethnicity. Families of children and adolescents with diseaseD000755 were of predominantly low socioeconomic status. Parents had lower educational levels when compared to parents of healthy children and adolescents. Body measurements (weight and height) and anthropometric indicators of children with diseaseD000755 were often lower when compared to healthy groups or reference populations. CONCLUSIONS: Children and adolescents with diseaseD000755 have socioeconomic limitations and worse nutritional conditions, when compared to reference populations. These limitations may lead to worse growth and greater occurrence of possible complications that can impair their quality of life.
30325033		Red blood cell mechanical sensitivity improves in 9606 with diseaseD000755 undergoing chronic transfusion after prolonged, subhemolytic shear exposure.BACKGROUND: diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) is a genetically diseaseD006453 in which deoxygenated hemoglobin S polymerizes, leading to stiff red blood cells (RBCs) and inefficient microcirculatory blood flow. Transfusion therapy acts as primary and secondary prevention of diseaseD002544 in diseaseD000755. Whether blood transfusion alters the mechanical sensitivity (MS) of RBCs to prolonged subhemolytic shear stress (shear) is unknown. We hypothesized that individuals with diseaseD000755 undergoing chronic blood transfusion would have improved sensitivity to shear, compared with 9606 not undergoing transfusion therapy. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Blood suspensions from individuals with diseaseD000755 not receiving (n = 15) and receiving (n = 15) chronic simple transfusion were conditioned to shear (1, 4, 16, 32, and 64 Pa) for various durations (1, 4, 16, 32, and 64 sec), and then deformability of RBCs was immediately measured. Healthy young controls (n = 15) were included for reference. A surface mesh was interpolated using the data to determine the effect of blood transfusion on MS of RBCs. RESULTS: There was impaired RBC deformability to prolonged supraphysiologic shear in both diseaseD000755 groups; however, MS improved in transfused 9606 when exposed to prolonged physiologic shear. Furthermore, in the transfused 9606 with diseaseD000755, the threshold above which subhemolytic damage occurs was similar to controls. CONCLUSION: We found that chronic transfusion therapy normalizes the MS threshold above which RBC subhemolytic damage occurs after prolonged shear exposure in diseaseD000755. An important and novel finding in transfused 9606 with diseaseD000755 was the improvement in RBC deformability in response to prolonged shear exposure over the physiologic range.
26667608		Pregnancy outcomes in 9606 with diseaseD000755 in low and high income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis.BACKGROUND: Pregnancy in 9606 with diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) is associated with increased adverse outcomes. Findings on the association between diseaseD000755 and adverse pregnancy outcomes are conflicting, and the results do not address whether these associations are similar in both low- and high-income countries. OBJECTIVES: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate pregnancy outcomes associated with diseaseD000755. SEARCH STRATEGY: The MEDLINE database was searched using medical subject headings (MeSH) and keywords for articles on pregnancy outcomes in 9606 with diseaseD000755. SELECTION CRITERIA: We used full research articles published in English that compared 9606 with diseaseD000755 with 9606 who did not have diseaseD000755, as controls. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were abstracted and analysed using comprehensive Meta-analysis 2.2. The primary outcomes were diseaseD005317 and perinatal mortality. Secondary outcomes were rates of caesarean sections, diseaseD011225, diseaseD004461, diseaseD006473, diseaseD000079262 mortality, diseaseC536271, and low birthweight. Random-effects models were used to calculate pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). MAIN RESULTS: Sixteen studies met all of the selection criteria and were included in the analysis. diseaseD000755 was associated with diseaseD005317 (pooled OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.85-4.21), perinatal mortality (pooled OR 3.76, 95% CI 2.34-6.06), and low birthweight (pooled OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.42-2.83). diseaseD000755 was also associated with an increased risk of diseaseD011225 (pooled OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.47-2.85), diseaseD000079262 mortality (pooled OR 10.91, 95% CI 1.83-65.11, P = 0.009), and diseaseD004461 (pooled OR 3.02, 95% CI 1.20-7.58). CONCLUSION: Pregnancy in 9606 with diseaseD000755 is associated with increased risks of adverse perinatal and diseaseD000079262 outcomes in both low- and high-income countries. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: This meta-analysis showed worse pregnancy outcomes in 9606 with diseaseD000755 compared with controls.
35140852		Association and Risk Factors of diseaseD000070603 in diseaseD000755: A Systematic Review.OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the level of evidence about the associated factors and the risk factors of diseaseD000070603 (diseaseD000070603) in diseaseD000755 individuals. METHODS: The review was based on the search and selection of studies available in the electronic databases PubMed, SCIELO, LILACS, BVS. As descriptors, the terms of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and Health Sciences Descriptors (DeCS) corresponding to "diseaseD010020", "diseaseD010020" and "diseaseD010020" and "diseaseD000070603" and "diseaseD000755" and "risk factor" and "predictor". RESULTS: Among clinical and laboratorial factors the most promising risk factors were the severity of diseaseD000755 and diseaseD000208 diseaseD056586. As a result, from studies of a moderate level of quality, blood pressure, body weight, previous diseaseD014947, haemoglobin to haematocrit ratio (Hb/HCT), and number of hospitalizations can be highlighted. Others, such as genetic markers and male gender, have also been positively associated in lower quality studies. CONCLUSION: For a better clarification of what the risk factors are for the diseaseD000070603, it is necessary to study with populations of different origins, different ages, different profiles of Hb, which present greater methodological rigor and perform a multivariate analysis to control confounding factors. Further study is also needed to understand the genetic determinants of diseaseD000070603.
18830514		Newborn screening: what pediatricians should know.OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on the current situation of neonatal screening worldwide and in Brazil. To define the role of pediatricians in neonatal screening programs. SOURCES: Scientific articles selected by means of searches run on the medical websites MEDLINE, Cochrane, PubMed (MeSH) and MD Consult, using the keywords newborn screening, neonatal, pediatrics, diagnosis, primary care, ethics and their equivalents in Portuguese, in isolation and in combination, in addition to medical textbooks on genetics and diseaseD008661, published between January 1998 and December 2007, the National Neonatal Screening Program technical standards and routines manual, and Ministry of Health decree 822/2001. SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS: Published data demonstrate a great diversity in the number of diseases included in the neonatal screening programs of different countries. In Brazil, the National Neonatal Screening Program was set up in 2001, to screen for diseaseD010661, diseaseD003409, diseaseD000755 and diseaseD003550. Screening for a wider range of conditions using mass spectrometry is currently the subject of disagreement and discussion of financial and ethical issues. CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal screening is one of the most important advances for the prevention of pediatric diseases. Nevertheless, implementation is complex, multidisciplinary and dependent on public health policies and, to date, there is no consensus on which diseases should be included. A large number of scientific and ethical questions need to be discussed in order to better define the screening panels to be implemented. Pediatricians have important roles to play in all stages of neonatal screening programs.
35283782	Positive_Correlation|chemicalD017382|diseaseD007249; Association|chemicalD010743|chemicalD017382; Positive_Correlation|chemicalD017382|diseaseD006461; Positive_Correlation|chemicalD017382|ncbi3048	diseaseD000014 in 9606 Erythrocytes Subjected to Oxidative diseaseD007249.Erythrocytes are chemicalD010100 carriers and exposed to redox cycle in oxygenation and deoxygenation of hemoglobin. This indicates that circulating erythrocytes are vulnerable to the oxidative injury occurring under the imbalance of redox homeostasis. In this review article, two topics are presented concerning the 9606 erythrocytes exposed to the oxidative diseaseD007249 including septic and sterile conditions. First, we demonstrate rheological derangement of erythrocytes subjected to acute oxidative injury caused by exogenous generators of chemicalD017382 (chemicalD017382). Erythrocyte filterability as whole-cell deformability has been estimated by the gravity-based chemicalD009532 mesh filtration technique in our laboratory and was dramatically impaired in a time-dependent manner after starting exposure to the chemicalD017382 generators, that is associated with concurrent progression of membrane protein degradation, chemicalD010743 peroxidation, erythrocyte swelling, ncbi3048 formation, and oxidative diseaseD006461. Second, we introduce an impairment of erythrocyte filterability confirmed quantitatively in diseaseD003920 and diseaseD006973 of animal models and 9606 under treatment. Among the cell geometry, internal viscosity, and membrane property as the three major determinants of erythrocyte deformability, erythrocyte membrane alteration is supposed to be the primary cause of this impairment in these lifestyle-related diseases associated with persistent oxidative diseaseD007249. Excessive chemicalD017382 trigger the diseaseD007249 responses and reduce the erythrocyte membrane fluidity. Oxidative diseaseD007249 increasing erythrocyte membrane rigidity underlies the impaired systemic microcirculation, which is observed in diseaseD003920/or diseaseD006973 9606. On the other hand, elevated internal viscosity caused by sickle hemoglobin polymerization is a primary cause of impaired erythrocyte filterability in diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755). However, oxidative diseaseD007249 is also involved in the pathophysiology of diseaseD000755. The physiologic level of chemicalD017382 acts as signaling molecules for adaptation to oxidative environment, but the pathological level of chemicalD017382 induces suicidal erythrocyte death (eryptosis). These findings provide further insight into the chemicalD017382-related pathophysiology of many clinical conditions.
22048588		Orofacial manifestations of diseaseD006402: diseaseD000740 and diseaseD020141.The aim of this paper is to review the literature and identify orofacial manifestations of diseaseD006402, with particular reference to diseaseD000740 and diseaseD009358. A computerized literature search using MEDLINE was conducted for published articles on orofacial manifestations of diseaseD006402, with emphasis on diseaseD000740. Mesh phrases used in the search were: diseaseD009059 AND diseaseD000743; diseaseD004194 AND diseaseD000743; diseaseD020820 AND diseaseD000743; orofacial manifestations AND diseaseD020141. The Boolean operator "AND" was used to combine and narrow the searches. diseaseD009358 associated with orofacial signs and symptoms include diseaseD018798, diseaseD011004, diseaseD000749, diseaseD000755, thalassaemia and diseaseD000741. The manifestations include diseaseD010167, diseaseD005928, diseaseD013280, diseaseD003680, diseaseD014060, diseaseC537559, osteoclerosis, diseaseD010019 and paraesthesia/diseaseD008305 the diseaseD008607 nerve. Orofacial diseaseD011693, diseaseC563620, diseaseD004844, spontaneous and post-traumatic diseaseD005884 and prolonged post-extraction diseaseD006470 are common orofacial manifestations of diseaseD020141 such as diseaseD014842 and diseaseD006467. A wide array of anemic and diseaseD020141 encountered in internal medicine has manifestations in the oral cavity and the facial region. Most of these manifestations are non-specific, but should alert the hematologist and the dental surgeon to the possibilities of a concurrent disease of hemopoiesis or hemostasis or a latent one that may subsequently manifest itself.
38013366		Psychosocial challenges of persons with diseaseD000755: A narrative review.diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) is a severe form of diseaseD000755 that primarily affects black populations and individuals in tropical countries. This condition causes significant morbidity and mortality and leads to a range of psychosocial challenges. A preliminary search was conducted on Ovid Medline and public databases with a combination of Medical Subject Headings keywords, resulting in 368 articles. The articles were screened based on the selection criteria in a nonsystematic method by 3 researchers, and a narrative synthesis was done to analyze extracted data from selected peer-reviewed article. diseaseD001523, diseaseD012893, interpersonal relationship challenges, stigmatization, and diseaseD000073397 diseaseD010468 were identified as significant contributors to the psychosocial distress experienced by individuals with diseaseD000755 and their families. diseaseD003866 and diseaseD001007 were prevalent among individuals with diseaseD000755, leading to poor treatment adherence, increased diseaseD010146, and disruptions in various aspects of life. diseaseD012893, including diseaseD012891 and sleepwalking, were also identified as significant contributors to poor sleep quality in diseaseD000755 patients. Families of individuals with diseaseD000755 also face challenges, including psychological stress, financial strain, and social disruption. Stigmatization is common, leading to misconceptions and diseaseD010468. diseaseD000073397 diseaseD010468 is prevalent, with a high unemployment rate among adult diseaseD000755 patients. Comprehensive care is crucial to address these psychosocial issues. Early identification and intervention, comprehensive support programs, patient and family education, enhanced diseaseD010146 management strategies, and integration of mental health into clinical care are recommended. School-based support, research and advocacy, and community support groups are also important. By addressing these challenges through comprehensive care and support, healthcare professionals, policymakers, and society can reduce psychosocial distress and improve the lives of individuals with diseaseD000755.
30122266		Impact of Red Blood Cell Antigen Matching on diseaseC536394 and Transfusion Complications in 9606 with diseaseD000755: A Systematic Review.Red blood cells (RBC) transfusion is critical in managing acute and chronic complications in diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755); however, it is complicated by RBC diseaseC536394, diseaseD019190, transfusion reactions and diseaseD007239. Several reports documented an increased incidence of alloantibodies in transfused individuals with diseaseD000755, especially for Rh and Kell antigens. As a result, the National Institutes of Health Expert Panel and British Society for Haematology guidelines recommend primary matching for C/c, E/e and K antigens in addition to ncbi28/RhD for RBC transfusions. However, the evidence supporting these recommendations was cited as limited and understanding of diseaseC536394 in diseaseD000755 is evolving. To examine the limitations of the evidence, we undertook a systematic review of evidence behind recommendations for limited and extended serologic and genotypic RBC antigen matching to reduce diseaseC536394, autoimmunization and transfusion reactions. Searches of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases using MeSH index and free text terms between 1976 through October 2015 and papers and captured through July 2016 through review references in papers, word of mouth, and ongoing Google Scholar and Medline Alerts identified 303 unique articles. Nineteen articles met inclusion criteria and were classified by the Oxford Centre Evidence Based levels of evidence. Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology checklists were completed for 18 of the 19 studies. There were no prospective randomized controlled trials. Sixteen of the articles were cohort studies, two were cross-sectional studies, and one decision tree model examining costs. Low-quality evidence from observational cohort studies supports that diseaseC536394 prevalence can be decreased by extending serological RBC antigen matching. Transfusion reactions are generally poorly and inconsistently reported. There was no evidence reporting the effect prophylactic genotypic matching has on diseaseC536394, autoimmunization or transfusion reactions. There were no studies comparing prophylactic genotypic matching to serologic matching. High-quality evidence was lacking to support clinical decision making regarding best transfusion practices. Multicenter prospective randomized clinical trials are needed to determine best strategies for reducing the rate of diseaseC536394 using serologic and genotypic matching.
37200963		Impact of the diseaseD000086382 in individuals with diseaseD000755: an integrative review.diseaseD000755 is the most common diseaseD006453 among 9606. As the condition promotes susceptibility to diseaseD007239, chronic diseaseD007249, and diseaseD019851, several international agencies have included individuals with this disease in the diseaseD000086382 risk group for severe outcomes. However, available information about the subject is not properly systematized yet. This review aimed to understand and summarize the scientific knowledge about the impact of diseaseD000086382 in 9606 with diseaseD000755. Searches were performed in the Medline, PubMed, and Virtual Health Library databases based on descriptors chosen according to the Medical Subject Headings. We analyzed studies published between 2020 and October 2022, developed with qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methodology, and written in English, Spanish, or Portuguese. The search resulted in 90 articles organized into six categories. There is disagreement in the literature about how different aspects related to diseaseD000755, such as chronic diseaseD007249 status, diseaseD019851, diseaseD000743, use of chemicalD006918, and access to medical care interference with the clinical course of diseaseD000086382. These topics deserve further investigation. It is evident, however, that the diseaseD007239 may manifest in an atypical way and act as a trigger for the development of diseaseD000755-specific complications, such as diseaseD056586 and diseaseD013224, conditions that are associated with great morbidity and mortality. Therefore, healthcare professionals must be aware of the different forms of presentation of diseaseD000086382 among these individuals. Specific guidelines and therapeutic protocols, as well as public policies for diseaseD000755 individuals, must be considered. Systematic review registration: This review (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/NH4AS) and the review protocol (https://osf.io/3y649/) are registered in the Open Science Framework platform.
28905692		The emerging challenge of optimal blood pressure management and diseaseD006973 in pregnant 9606 with diseaseD000755: a review.INTRODUCTION: diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) is one of the most common diseaseD006453, affecting a considerable proportion of black populations of African origin, Middle East and in the Indian sub-continent. 9606 with diseaseD000755 are more likely to experience adverse pregnancy and delivery outcomes. diseaseD006973 in pregnancy such as diseaseD011225 and diseaseD004461 are more common in 9606 with diseaseD000755. Areas covered: This review examined the influence of diseaseD006973 and diseaseD000755 in pregnancy, and provides the preliminary evidence that the traditional systolic and diastolic blood pressure thresholds for diseaseD006973 such as diseaseD011225 and diseaseD004461 may require reassessment in pregnant 9606 with diseaseD000755. The causes of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality, diseaseD006973 of pregnancy in 9606 with and without diseaseD000755 were reviewed. A MEDLINE database search using medical subject headings (MeSH) and keywords for articles regarding diseaseD000755, pregnancy and diseaseD006973 was performed. Expert commentary: Pregnancy in 9606 with diseaseD000755 is associated with high maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Using the existing thresholds for diagnosis and treatment for diseaseD006973 in pregnancy without adjustment to accommodate for the lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure in those with diseaseD000755 may worsen an already poor maternal and perinatal outcome in this population.
36927679		9606 perspectives on noninvasive prenatal testing among black 9606 in the United States: a scoping review.Advances in reproductive health technologies such as noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) are changing the landscape of prenatal care and maternal health. NIPT, made clinically available in the United States (US) in 2011, is a screening test that utilizes cell-free DNA (cfDNA) to detect for diseaseD000782 and genetic characteristics in fetal DNA. In September 2020, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommended NIPT for all pregnant 9606 regardless of age or risk factors. We examined peer-reviewed, empirical studies published from January 2011 to February 2022, assessing NIPT studies with 9606 perspectives in the US and what is known about how empirical studies include Black 9606. Our scoping review draws from PubMed (with advanced MeSH search options) and Scopus databases for advanced scoping review, with 33 articles meeting our criteria. Empirical studies on NIPT show 9606 perceptions range across five themes: 1) accuracy / safety, 2) return of results, 3) 9606 knowledge, 4) informed consent, and 5) perceptions among minoritized groups (with perceptions of race and gender as a social demographic intersection). Additionally, among the 15 studies that included that Black 9606 in their study sample, none measured the perceptions of Black 9606 with diseaseD030342. Bridging this knowledge gap is critical because NIPT is becoming increasingly accessible across the nation and is being developed to screen for additional diseaseD030342, such as diseaseD000755. Ultimately, NIPT researchers need to go to greater lengths to examine the 9606 perspectives of Black 9606 with and without diseaseD030342.
26141903	Negative_Correlation|chemicalD014807|diseaseD000755	[chemicalD014807 in children and adolescents with diseaseD000755: an integrative review].OBJECTIVE: To review the literature about the prevalence of diseaseD014808 and its consequences in children and adolescents with diseaseD000755. DATA SOURCES: The literature survey was performed through the bibliographic databases Medline; U.S. National Library of Medicine and National Institutes of Health (PubMed); diseaseC537495 Caribe em Ciencias da Saude (Lilacs), and the Cochrane Library. The keywords were selected using Medical Heading Terms (MeSH): "chemicalD014807" OR "diseaseD014808" AND "diseaseD000740, diseaseD000755" AND "Child" AND "Adolescent". The search was limited to articles in English, Spanish and Portuguese, published until April 2014. DATA SYNTHESIS: Eleven articles were selected among the 18 found. In 6 of the 11 studies, serum levels of chemicalD014807 in children and/or adolescents with diseaseD000755 were low. The prevalence of diseaseD014808 in 9606 with diseaseD000755 exceeded that of the comparison group. The low intake of chemicalD014807, seasonality, exposure to sun, increased metabolism associated with the diseaseD006453, and age increase were factors associated with the deficiency. There was an association between a significant diseaseD014808 and diseaseD018908 and diseaseD010146. There was a positive correlation between increased levels of chemicalD014807 by supplementation and functional, physical capacity. CONCLUSIONS: The diseaseD014808 in children and adolescents with diseaseD000755 is prevalent and requires further studies to demonstrate its association with comorbidities and possible benefits of chemicalD014807 supplementation.
36714120		Feature preserving mesh network for semantic segmentation of retinal vasculature to support ophthalmic diseaseD004194 analysis.Introduction: diseaseC535922 are approaching an alarming count across the globe. Typically, ophthalmologists depend on manual methods for the analysis of different diseaseC535922 such as diseaseD005901, diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755), diseaseD003930, and diseaseD058437. All these manual assessments are not reliable, time-consuming, tedious, and prone to error. Therefore, automatic methods are desirable to replace conventional approaches. The accuracy of this segmentation of these vessels using automated approaches directly depends on the quality of fundus images. Retinal vessels are assumed as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of many diseaseC535922. Mostly newly developed diseaseC535922 contain minor changes in vasculature which is a critical job for the early detection and analysis of diseaseD004194. Method: Several artificial intelligence-based methods suggested intelligent solutions for automated retinal vessel detection. However, existing methods exhibited significant limitations in segmentation performance, complexity, and computational efficiency. Specifically, most of the existing methods failed in detecting small vessels owing to vanishing gradient problems. To overcome the stated problems, an intelligence-based automated shallow network with high performance and low cost is designed named Feature Preserving Mesh Network (FPM-Net) for the accurate segmentation of retinal vessels. FPM-Net employs a feature-preserving block that preserves the spatial features and helps in maintaining a better segmentation performance. Similarly, FPM-Net architecture uses a series of feature concatenation that also boosts the overall segmentation performance. Finally, preserved features, low-level input image information, and up-sampled spatial features are aggregated at the final concatenation stage for improved pixel prediction accuracy. The technique is reliable since it performs better on the DRIVE database, CHASE-DB1 database, and STARE dataset. Results and discussion: Experimental outcomes confirm that FPM-Net outperforms state-of-the-art techniques with superior computational efficiency. In addition, presented results are achieved without using any preprocessing or postprocessing scheme. Our proposed method FPM-Net gives improvement results which can be observed with DRIVE datasets, it gives chemicalD012643, Sp, and Acc as 0.8285, 0.98270, 0.92920, for CHASE-DB1 dataset 0.8219, 0.9840, 0.9728 and STARE datasets it produces 0.8618, 0.9819 and 0.9727 respectively. Which is a remarkable difference and enhancement as compared to the conventional methods using only 2.45 million trainable parameters.
7771550	Association|chemicalD010100|chemicalD011108	Contributions of sickle hemoglobin chemicalD011108 and diseaseD000755 cell membranes to impaired filterability.diseaseD000755 is a disease of abnormal rheology caused by acute and reversible, as well as chronic and irreversible, changes in the properties and deformability of diseaseD000755 erythrocytes. Deformability is determined by several factors, including intracellular sickle hemoglobin polymerization, the abnormal membrane properties of diseaseD000755 cells, and the abnormal rheological properties of the soluble concentrated hemoglobin solution within dense diseaseD000755 red blood cells. In this study, we used a 5-microns pore chemicalD009532 mesh filter to evaluate quantitatively the effects of these factors on the filterability of erythrocytes containing sickle hemoglobin. We used diseaseD000755 trait and diseaseD000755/diseaseD017086 cells, because they have minimal diseaseD015433 or density heterogeneity, to investigate the effects of chemicalD011108 formation on rheological properties. We found that filterability of these cells is sensitive to small amounts of intracellular chemicalD011108 and that impaired filtration is linearly related to chemicalD010100-dependent chemicalD011108 formation, up to a chemicalD011108 fraction of 0.3. By increasing the proportion of dense cells in populations of normal cells or cells from individuals with diseaseD000755 and equilibrating these cells with gas ligands, we estimate that polymerization, even at 95% saturation, contributes twice as much to impaired filterability of diseaseD000755 erythrocytes as the abnormal membranes in homozygous diseaseD000755. At lower saturation values, the effects of chemicalD011108 are even greater. The viscosity of the concentrated hemoglobin in dense cells had the smallest effect, over physiologically relevant saturation values. These results emphasize the importance of sickle hemoglobin polymerization in the pathogenesis of diseaseD000755 and should help define its pathophysiology and responses to therapy in quantitative terms.
