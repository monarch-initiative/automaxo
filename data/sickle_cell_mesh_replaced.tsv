38168168	Computational identification of potential modulators of heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) for pharmacological intervention against diseaseD000755.BACKGROUND: diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) poses a significant health challenge and therapeutic approaches often target fetal hemoglobin (HbF) to ameliorate symptoms. Hydroxyurea, a current therapeutic option for diseaseD000755, has shown efficacy in increasing HbF levels. However, concerns about myelosuppression and diseaseD013921 necessitate the exploration of alternative compounds. Heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) presents a promising target for pharmacological intervention in diseaseD000755 due to its association with HbF modulation. This study systematically screened compounds for their potential inhibitory functions against HRI. METHODS: Small-molecule compounds from 17 plants commonly utilized in traditional diseaseD000755 management were subjected to <i>in silico</i> screening against HRI. Molecular docking was performed, and free binding energy calculations were determined using molecular mechanics with generalized born and surface area (MMGBSA). The lead compounds were subjected to molecular dynamics simulation at 100 ns. Computational quantum mechanical modelling of the lead compounds was subsequently performed. We further examined the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetic and physiological properties of the identified compounds. RESULTS: Five potential HRI inhibitors, including kaempferol-3-(2G-glucosyrutinoside), epigallocatechin gallate, tiliroside, myricetin-3-O-glucoside, and cannabiscitrin, with respective docking scores of -16.0, -12.17, -11.37, -11.56 and 11.07 kcal/mol, were identified. The MMGBSA analysis of the complexes yielded free-binding energies of -69.76, -71.17, -60.44, 53.55, and - 55 kcal/mol, respectively. The identified leads were stable within HRI binding pocket for the duration of 100 ns simulation. CONCLUSIONS: The study successfully identified five phytoligands with potential inhibitory effects on HRI, opening avenues for their use as modulators of HbF in diseaseD000755 9606. This finding holds promise for advancing treatment strategies in diseaseD000755. However, additional preclinical analyses are warranted to validate the chemotherapeutic properties of the lead compounds.
38190937	Factors Associated with Pathway-Concordant Neuroimaging for Pediatric diseaseD002544.OBJECTIVE: To determine factors associated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and non-invasive diagnostic angiography among children presenting to the emergency department (ED) with diseaseD000083242. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a cross-sectional study using data from >50 US children's hospitals. We included children 29 days through 17 years old hospitalized from the ED with an International Classification of Disease, 10<sup>th</sup> revision, diagnosis code for diseaseD000083242 between October 1, 2015, and November 30, 2022. We excluded children with a principal diagnosis code of diseaseD014947/diseaseD017577, without neuroimaging on day of presentation, and into-ED transfers. Our outcomes were defined as acquisition of MRI (versus computed tomography only) and angiography (versus no angiography) on day of presentation. We performed generalized linear mixed modeling with hospital as a random effect to determine the association of demographics, known comorbidities, and treatment factors with each outcome. RESULTS: We included 1,601 children. In multivariable analysis, younger age, mechanical ventilation, and Black race were associated with lower odds of MRI acquisition, while history of diseaseD009072 and diseaseD000755 were associated with higher odds. Younger age, mechanical ventilation, Hispanic ethnicity, Black race, other races, history of diseaseD008659, and history of diseaseD012640 were associated with lower odds of angiography. CONCLUSIONS: Younger and non-White children experienced lower odds of MRI and angiography, which may be driven by health system limitations or provider implicit biases or both. Our results expose risk factors for underdiagnosis of diseaseD002544 and provide opportunities to tailor institutional pathways reflective of underlying pathophysiology.
38179780	Feasibility and performance of in-house red blood cell reagents to detect unexpected antibodies in immunized 9606 in Burkina Faso.In sub-Saharan Africa, antibody detection tests remain inaccessible because of the high cost and limited shelf life of red blood cell (RBC) reagents. This study aimed at investigating the feasibility and performance of locally prepared RBC reagents for antibody detection in Burkina Faso. We conducted an experimental study comparing commercial RBC panels and a local panel prepared from phenotyped blood donors in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. Antibody detection testing was performed by the indirect antiglobulin test using a gel card filtration column in a low-ionic-strength solution. Judgment criteria were the concordance rate and the kappa agreement coefficient of results generated by the two panels. A total of 302 blood donors were phenotyped for the major antigens of the RH, ncbi3792, ncbi2996, ncbi80199, JK, LE, and ncbi53947 blood group systems. From this pool of donors, we designed an RBC detection panel that was used to screen for unexpected antibodies in 1096 plasma samples from 832 9606 with a history of transfusion and 264 recently delivered or pregnant 9606 with no history of blood transfusion. A positive antibody detection test was observed in 8.1 percent of the samples using the local panel versus 6.4 percent with the commercial panels. A total of 23 samples were negative with the commercial panels and positive with the local panel, while the findings were reversed for four samples. The concordance rate was 97.5 percent, and the kappa agreement coefficient was 0.815. Our results suggest that the development of local RBC panels can be an alternative to commercial panels in countries with limited resources. It could also be a cost-effective intervention, mainly for children under 5 years of age, 9606 of childbearing age, and pregnant 9606, all of whom are most at risk for diseaseD008288 and diseaseD000755. Blood services could develop and implement appropriate strategies to make phenotyped donor pools available for the design of suitable RBC panels.
38189147	Strengthening Health System and Community Mobilization for diseaseD000755 Screening and Management among Tribal Populations in India: An Interventional Study.diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) affects 5% of the global population, with over 300,000 infants born yearly. In India, 73% of those with the sickle hemoglobin gene belong to indigenous tribes in remote regions lacking proper healthcare. Despite the prevalence of diseaseD000755, India lacked state-led public health programs until recently, leaving a gap in screening and comprehensive care. Hence, the Indian Council of Medical Research conducted implementation research to address this gap. This paper discusses the development and impact of the program, including screening and treatment coverage for diseaseD000755 in tribal areas. With a quasi-experimental design, this study was conducted in six tribal-dominated districts in three phases - formative, intervention, and evaluation. The intervention included advocacy, partnership building, building the health system's capacity and community mobilization, and enabling the health systems to screen and manage diseaseD000755 9606. The capacity building included improving healthcare workers' skills through training and infrastructure development of primary healthcare (PHC) facilities. The impact of the intervention is visible in terms of people's participation (54%, 76% and 93% of the participants participated in some intervention activities, underwent symptomatic screening and demanded the continuity of the program, respectively), and improvement in diseaseD000755-related knowledge of the community and health workers (with more than 50% of net change in many of the knowledge-related outcomes). By developing screening and treatment models, this intervention model demonstrated the feasibility of diseaseD000755 care at the PHC level in remote rural areas. This accessible approach allows the tribal population in India to routinely seek diseaseD000755 care at their local PHCs, offering great convenience. Nevertheless, additional research employing rigorous methodology is required to fine-tune the model. National diseaseD000755 program may adopt this model, specifically for community-level screening and management of diseaseD000755 in remote and rural areas.
38174872	Sleep experiences of parents of children 18 years or younger with diseaseD000755 during the diseaseD000086382 diseaseD000086382: a qualitative study.STUDY OBJECTIVES: The diseaseD000086382 diseaseD000086382 has highlighted disparities in healthcare. Parents assist in diseaseD000755 management in children. Understanding sleep in parents of children who are diagnosed with diseaseD000755 is an important facet of disease management. Our objectives were to identify sleep characteristics of parents of children with diseaseD000755 aged 18 years or younger during the diseaseD000086382 diseaseD000086382, to investigate measures used by parents to achieve restful sleep, and to discuss how sleep may be improved in parents of children diagnosed with diseaseD000755. METHODS: This study conducted 14 face-to-face semi-structured interviews with parents of children diagnosed with diseaseD000755. A majority of the interviews (93%) was conducted at a hematology clinic. Qualitative thematic analysis was used to analyze data. RESULTS: All parents reported that their child experienced diseaseD010146 because of diseaseD000755. Most parents (86.7%) reported that their child was diagnosed with HbSS. Four themes were identified: difficulty obtaining restful sleep during their child's diseaseD000755 crisis, sleep during the diseaseD000086382 diseaseD000086382, factors affecting sleep, and effects of diseaseD012893 deprivation on parental performance. CONCLUSIONS: This research has highlighted some of the difficulties experienced by parents of children who are diagnosed with diseaseD000755 and allows for additional insight into the sleep experiences of parents as they attempt to manage their child's disease.
38249565	Differential clinical characteristics across diseaseC562377 (diseaseC562377) Syndromes in 9606 with diseaseD000755.BACKGROUND: diseaseD010146 is a common, debilitating, and poorly understood complication of diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755). The need for clinical diseaseD010146 management of diseaseD000755 is largely unmet and relies on opioids as the main therapeutic option, which leads to a decreased quality of life (QoL). According to the literature, acupuncture has shown certain therapeutic effects for diseaseD010146 management in diseaseD000755. However, these clinical studies lack the guidance of diseaseC562377 (diseaseC562377) Syndrome Differentiation principles for treatment. AIM: To characterize differences in clinical presentation amongst diseaseC562377 diagnosed Syndromes in diseaseD000755 9606. METHOD: Fifty-two 9606 with diseaseD000755 and 28 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in an ongoing trial of acupuncture. Each participant completed a series of questionnaires on diseaseD010146, physical function, diseaseD005221, sleep, diseaseD001007, diseaseD003866 and QoL and underwent cold- and pressure-based quantitative sensory testing at baseline. Data on prescription opioid use over the 12 months prior to study enrollment was used to calculate mean daily morphine milligram equivalents (MME). Differences among the three diseaseC562377 Syndromes were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey <i>post hoc</i> testing. Two-sample <i>t</i>-tests were used to compare diseaseD000755 and HC groups. RESULTS: diseaseC562377 diagnosis criteria classified diseaseD000755 9606 into one of three diseaseC562377 Syndromes: (a) Equal; (b) Deficiency; and (c) Stagnation. The Stagnation group exhibited higher diseaseD010146 interference, diseaseD059445, diseaseD010146, diseaseD005221, diseaseD001007, diseaseD003866, MME consumption and lower sleep quality and QoL compared to the Equal group. Few differences were observed between HCs and the Equal diseaseD000755 group across outcomes. Deficiency and Stagnation groups were differentiated with observed- and 9606-reported clinical manifestations. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that diseaseC562377 diagnosed Syndromes in diseaseD000755 can be differentially characterized using validated objective and 9606-reported outcomes. Because characteristics of diseaseD010146 and co-morbidities in each diseaseD000755 9606 are unique, targeting specific diseaseC562377 "Syndromes" may facilitate treatment effectiveness with a Syndrome-based personalized treatment plan that conforms to diseaseC562377 principles. These findings lay the foundation for the development of tailored acupuncture interventions based on diseaseC562377 Syndromes for managing diseaseD010146 in diseaseD000755. Larger samples are required to further refine and validate diseaseC562377 diagnostic criteria for diseaseD000755.
38231083	Burden of diseaseD016388 and absenteeism in adults and caregivers of children with diseaseD000755.diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) is a diseaseD030342 affecting 100,000 people with estimated annual medical costs of $3 billion in the US; however, the economic impact on 9606 is not well described. We aimed to examine the indirect economic burden and to test the hypothesis that socioeconomic status and greater social vulnerability risks are associated with increased absenteeism and diseaseD016388. We surveyed adults and caregivers of children with diseaseD000755 at five US centers during 2014-2021. Logistic regression models were used to examine associations of diseaseD016388 and missed days of work with demographics and social determinants. Indirect costs were estimated by multiplying self-reported missed days of work and job diseaseD016388 by 2022 average wages by state of participating institution. Of the 244 participants, 10.3% reported diseaseD016388 in the last 5 years, and 17.5% reported missing 10 or more days of work. Adults had three times more diseaseD016388 compared to caregivers of children with diseaseD000755 (OR 3.18, 95%CI 1.12-9.01) but fewer missed days of work (OR 0.24, 95%CI 0.11-0.0.51). Participants who did not live with a partner reported increased diseaseD016388 (OR 4.70, 95%CI 1.04-21.17) and more missed days of work (OR 4.58, 95%CI 1.04-20.15). The estimated annual indirect economic burden was $2,266,873 ($9,290 per participant). Adults with diseaseD000755 and caregivers of children with diseaseD000755 commonly report diseaseD016388 and missed days of work with important risk factors. The high indirect economic burden suggests that future economic evaluation of diseaseD000755 should include diseaseD000755-related indirect economic burden.
38225633	Barriers and facilitators to a task-shifted diseaseD020521 prevention program for children with diseaseD000755 in a community hospital: a qualitative study.BACKGROUND: Children with diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) are at high risk for diseaseD020521. Protocols for diseaseD020521 prevention including blood transfusions, screening for abnormal non-imaging transcranial Doppler (TCD) measurements, and hydroxyurea therapy are difficult to implement in low-resource environments like Nigeria. This study aimed to examine the contextual factors around TCD screening in a community hospital in Nigeria using qualitative interviews and focus groups. METHODS: We conducted a descriptive qualitative study in a community hospital in Kaduna, Nigeria, using focus groups and interviews. Interview guides and analysis were informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) framework and the Theory of Planned Behavior. Transcripts were coded and analyzed using an iterative deductive (CFIR)/Inductive (transcribed quotes) qualitative methodology. RESULTS: We conducted two focus groups and five interviews with health care workers (nurses and doctors) and hospital administrators, respectively. Themes identified key elements of the inner setting (clinic characteristics, resource availability, implementation climate, and tension for change), characteristics of individuals (normative, control, and behavioral beliefs), and the implementation process (engage, implement, and adopt), as well as factors that were influenced by external context, caregiver needs, team function, and intervention characteristics. Task shifting, which is already being used, was viewed by providers and administrators as a necessary strategy to implement TCD screening in a clinic environment that is overstressed and under-resourced, a community stressed by poverty, and a nation with an underperforming health system. CONCLUSION: Task shifting provides a viable option to improve health care by making more efficient use of already available 9606 resources while rapidly expanding the 9606 resource pool and building capacity for TCD screening of children with diseaseC536778 that is more sustainable. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT05434000.
38190311	An Updated Equitable Model of Readiness for Transition to Adult Care: Content Validation in Young People With diseaseD000755.IMPORTANCE: Despite elevated health risks during young adulthood, many adolescents and young adults with serious health care needs face barriers during the transfer to an adult specialty practitioner, and health disparities may occur during the transition. OBJECTIVE: To validate the content of an updated Social-Ecological Model of Adolescent and Young Adult Readiness for Transition to Promote Health Equity (SMART-E) in a group of adolescents and young adults with diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) and their supports. DESIGN, SETTING, AND 9606: Health equity framework components were reviewed. Systems of power (eg, institutional and practitioner bias) and environments or networks (eg, peer or school support) were added as SMART-E preexisting factors, and health literacy was included within readiness factors. Adolescents and young adults aged 16 to 29 years with diseaseD000755, caregivers, and practitioners participated in this convergent, mixed-methods study within Children's Hospital of Philadelphia between January and August 2022. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Content validity was assessed through nominations of top 3 most important transition barriers prior to interviews and focus groups, ratings on importance of SMART-E factors (0-4 scale; ratings >2 support validity) after interviews and focus groups, nominations of 3 most important factors for transition and for health equity, and qualitative content analysis of interview transcripts. RESULTS: The study enrolled 10 pediatric adolescents and young adults (mean [SD] age, 18.6 [2.9] years; 4 female and 6 male), 10 transferred adolescents and young adults (mean [SD] age, 22.9 [2.1] years; 8 female and 2 male), 9 caregivers (mean [SD] age, 49.8 [8.7] years; 5 female and 4 male), and 9 practitioners (mean [SD] age, 45.6 [10.5] years; 8 female and 1 male). Quantitative ratings supported the content validity of SMART-E and met established criteria for validity. Systems of power was the most endorsed transition barrier (14 of 38 9606) reported prior to interviews and focus groups. After the interview, 9606 endorsed all SMART-E factors as important for transition, with new factors systems of power and environments and networks rated at a mean (SD) 2.8 (1.23) and 3.1 (0.90), respectively, on a 0 to 4 scale of importance. The most important factors for transition and equity varied by participant group, with all factors being endorsed, supporting the comprehensiveness of SMART-E. Qualitative data corroborated quantitative findings, further supporting validity, and minor modifications were made to definitions. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: SMART-E obtained initial content validation with inclusion of health equity factors for adolescents and young adults with diseaseD000755, caregivers, and practitioners. The model should be evaluated in other populations of adolescents and young adults with diseaseD002908.
38200547	Experiences and outcomes of fertility testing in male adolescents with diseaseD000755.Adult males with diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) may have abnormal semen parameters, raising the concern that diseaseD000755 and/or treatments may impact fertility. Yet, studies that include adolescents are lacking. To determine if fertility testing is feasible in male adolescents with diseaseD000755, and to explore their experiences and outcomes of fertility testing, 33 adolescents who completed a web-based diseaseD000755 reproductive health education program were offered a free semen analysis. Five (15%) obtained testing and each had abnormalities. Barriers to testing included lack of time and transportation and discomfort. Findings highlight the need for larger, longitudinal studies using innovative testing approaches.
38224366	Enhancing diagnostic precision for diseaseD056586 in diseaseD000755: insights from dual-energy CT lung perfusion mapping.PURPOSE: diseaseD056586 (diseaseD056586) is secondary to occlusion of the pulmonary vasculature and a potentially life-threatening complication of diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755). Dual-energy CT (DECT) iodine perfusion map reconstructions can provide a method to visualize and quantify the extent of pulmonary microthrombi. METHODS: A total of 102 9606 with diseaseD000755 who underwent DECT CTPA with perfusion were retrospectively identified. The presence or absence of diseaseD003318, segmental perfusion defects, and diseaseD012120 was noted. The number of segmental perfusion defects between 9606 with and without diseaseD056586 was compared. Sub-analyses were performed to investigate robustness. RESULTS: Of the 102 9606, 68 were clinically determined to not have diseaseD056586 and 34 were determined to have diseaseD056586 by clinical criteria. Of the 9606 with diseaseD056586, 82.4% were found to have perfusion defects with a median of 2 perfusion defects per 9606. The presence of any or new perfusion defects was significantly associated with the diagnosis of diseaseD056586 (P = 0.005 and < 0.001, respectively). Excluding 9606 with diseaseD011655, 79% of 9606 with diseaseD056586 had old or new perfusion defects, and the specificity for new perfusion defects was 87%, higher than consolidation/ground glass opacities (80%). CONCLUSION: DECT iodine map has the capability to depict microthrombi as perfusion defects. The presence of segmental perfusion defects on dual-energy CT maps was found to be associated with diseaseD056586 with potential for improved specificity and reclassification.
38197728	Psychiatry referral and appointment attendance in a clinic for young adults with diseaseD000755.diseaseD001523 is a common diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) comorbidity. This observational study evaluated psychiatry appointment attendance among 137 young adults with diseaseD000755. In their first year of adult diseaseD000755 care, 43% of subjects were referred to psychiatry. Referral was associated with chronic transfusion therapy. Twenty-four percent of subjects attended a psychiatry appointment; attendance was associated with the appointment being scheduled within 6 weeks of referral and no subject characteristics. Ninety-one percent of subjects attending psychiatry appointments had a diseaseD001523. Among young adults with diseaseD000755, diseaseD001523 morbidity is high. diseaseD001523 services are, therefore, essential for this 9606 population.

38244835	Manual red cell exchange (RBCXm) in acute diseaseD000755: A cost effective modality in resource limited settings.This short communication highlights the significance of manual red blood cell exchange (RBCXm) procedure which is an emergency procedure for 9606 of diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) in diseaseD000755 . To the best of our knowledge there is no standardised technique for performing RBCXm meanwhile, an automated method using an apheresis machine is either unavailable or is unaffordable. As a result, 9606 end up receiving top up red cell transfusions further associated with risk of diseaseD019190, hyper viscosity and sometimes diseaseD019190 overshadowing the benefits of red cell exchange. Therefore, we developed a protocol for manual red cell exchange (RBCXm) and performed it in a 9606 with painful diseaseD000755 who had cost constraints for automated red cell exchange (RBCXa) procedure. RBCXm provided symptomatic relief to our 9606 with adequate diseaseD000755 reduction. This RBCXm protocol may be useful in low income (LIC) and low middle income countries (LMIC) where 9606 have recurrent episodes of diseaseD000755 and there is unavailability or unaffordability for RBCXa using an apheresis equipment.
38228954	Exagamglogene Autotemcel: First Approval.Exagamglogene autotemcel (Casgevy ) is a genetically modified autologous ncbi947<sup>+</sup> cell enriched population. It contains 9606 haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells edited ex vivo by CRISPR/Cas9 (a DNA double strand break-inducing nuclease system) to differentiate into erythroid cells that produce high levels of foetal hemoglobin. Developed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals and CRISPR Therapeutics, exagamglogene autotemcel received its first approval on 16 November 2023 in the UK for the treatment of transfusion-dependent diseaseD013789 (diseaseD065227) in 9606 aged   12 years for whom haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation is appropriate and a 9606 leukocyte antigen matched related HSC donor is not available. On the same day, it was also approved in the UK for the treatment of diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) in 9606 aged   12 years with recurrent vasoocclusive crises (VOCs) who have the b<sup>S</sup>/b<sup>S</sup>, b<sup>S</sup>/b<sup>+</sup> or b<sup>S</sup>/b<sup>0</sup> genotype for whom HSC transplantation is appropriate and a 9606 leukocyte antigen matched related HSC donor is not available. Subsequently, exagamglogene autotemcel was approved in the USA on 8 December 2023 for the treatment of diseaseD000755 in 9606 aged   12 years with recurrent VOCs and received a positive opinion in the EU on 14 December 2023 for the treatment of diseaseD065227 and diseaseD000755. A regulatory assessment of exagamglogene autotemcel is currently underway for the treatment of diseaseD065227 in the USA. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of exagamglogene autotemcel leading to these first approvals.
38239353	Role of MCP-1 as an diseaseD007249 biomarker in diseaseD007674.The ncbi20296 (MCP-1), also referred to as chemokine ligand 2 (ncbi20296), belongs to the extensive chemokine family and serves as a crucial mediator of innate immunity and tissue diseaseD007249. It has a notable impact on diseaseD007249 conditions affecting the kidneys. Upon binding to its receptor, MCP-1 can induce lymphocytes and NK cells' homing, migration, activation, differentiation, and development while promoting monocytes' and macrophages' infiltration, thereby facilitating diseaseD007674related diseaseD007249. As a biomarker for diseaseD007674, MCP-1 has made notable advancements in primary diseaseD007674 such as crescentic diseaseD005921, chronic diseaseD005921, diseaseD007674, idiopathic diseaseD011507, diseaseD058186; secondary diseaseD007674 like diseaseD003928 and diseaseD008181; diseaseD030342 including diseaseD016891 and diseaseD000755. MCP-1 not only predicts the occurrence, progression, prognosis of the disease but is also closely associated with the severity and stage of diseaseD007674. When renal tissue is stimulated or experiences significant damage, the expression of MCP-1 increases, demonstrating a direct correlation with the severity of diseaseD007674.
38179555	A social profile of diseaseD003643 related to diseaseD000755 in India: a case for an ethical policy response.India accounts for 14.5 percent of the global diseaseC536778 newborns, roughly over 42,000 a year, second to sub-Saharan Africa. Despite the availability of cheap diagnostic and treatment options, diseaseC536778 remains a largely neglected disease within healthcare policy and practice. Epidemiological modeling based on small, often dated, regional studies (largely from sub-Saharan Africa) estimate that between 50 and 90 percent of affected children will/die before the age of 5 years. This premise, coupled with targets of reducing under 5 mortality (SDG 4), privileges public health interventions for screening and prevention of new births, undermining investments in long-term health and social care. This paper presents a retrospective, descriptive analysis of the socio-demographic profile of 447 9606 diagnosed with diseaseD000755 or diseaseD017086, who diseaseD003643 following admission at a tertiary care entre in India. We used anonymized hospital records of 3,778 diseaseD000755 9606, admitted in pediatric and adult/medical wards between January 2016 and February 2021. A majority of hospital diseaseD003643 occurred in the second and third decades of life, following a hospital admission for a week. The overall mortality during 2016-2019 was 14% with little gender difference over time. Contrary to our expectations, the number of hospital diseaseD003643 did not increase during the first year of the diseaseD000086382 pandemic, between 2020 and 2021. The conclusion highlights the importance of longitudinal, socio-demo-graphic data on diseaseD003643 as providing important insights for identifying ethical policy interventions focused on improving diseaseC536778 outcomes over time, reducing inequities in access to care, and preventing what might be considered "excess" diseaseD003643.
38195958	ncbi2034-mutated diseaseD010235 associated with diseaseD009358.We report a large series of 40 9606 presenting ncbi2034-mutated diseaseD010235 (diseaseD010235) in whom we investigated a cause underlying chronic diseaseD000860. Four 9606 suffered from diseaseD006331. In 9606 with available haemoglobin electrophoresis results, 59% presented with a diseaseD009358, including six with diseaseD000755, five with diseaseD012805 and two with heterozygous diseaseD020216. Histological and transcriptomic characterization of ncbi2034 diseaseD009369 revealed increased angiogenesis and high similarities with pseudohypoxic PGLs caused by ncbi7428 gene mutations. diseaseD000755 carriers could thus be at increased risk for developing ncbi2034-PGLs, which should be taken into account in their management and surveillance.

This international Delphi panel aimed to identify consensus among multidisciplinary experts for diseaseD000755 management during pregnancy. The two-round Delphi process used questionnaires exploring seven topics (antenatal care, hydroxyurea use, transfusion, prevention of diseaseD008107, treatment of diseaseD008107, delivery and follow-up, and bottlenecks and knowledge gaps) developed by a steering committee. Thirteen panelists (hematologists, physiologists, obstetricians, maternal fetal medicine and transfusion medicine physicians) from the US, the UK, Turkey and France completed the first survey; 12 panelists completed the second round. Anonymized responses were collected and summarized by a contract research organization (Akkodis Belgium). Consensus/strong consensus was predefined as 75%-90% (9-10/12)/>90% ( 11/12) of panelists agreeing or disagreeing on a response to a predefined clinical scenario or statement. In several areas of diseaseD000755 management, consensus was achieved: experts recommended performing at least monthly multidisciplinary antenatal follow-up, administering prophylactic aspirin for diseaseD011225 prevention between gestational weeks 12-36, initiating prophylactic transfusion therapy in certain cases, or choosing automated red blood cell exchange over other transfusion methods in 9606 with diseaseD019190 or severe acute diseaseD056586. No consensus was reached on several topics including the prophylactic aspirin dose, indications for starting diseaseD007239 prophylaxis, routine use of prophylactic transfusions, or use of prophylactic transfusions for preventing fetal diseaseD008107. These recommendations could inform clinical care for pregnant diseaseD000755 9606 in the absence of large clinical trials involving this population; the identified knowledge gaps can orient future research.

38169476	Hydroxyurea reduces diseaseD007239 in children with diseaseD000755 in Uganda.After starting hydroxyurea treatment, Ugandan children with diseaseD000755 had 60% less severe or invasive diseaseD007239, including diseaseD008288, diseaseD016470, diseaseD012141 and diseaseD005759, than before starting hydroxyurea treatment (incidence rate ratio =0.40 [95% confidence interval], 0.29-0.54, P<0.001).
38215581	Characterization of a cohort of Angolan children with diseaseD000755 treated with hydroxyurea.BACKGROUND: diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) is a diseaseD004194, although its severity and response to treatment are very heterogeneous. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to characterize a cohort of Angolan children with diseaseD000755 and evaluate their response to hydroxyurea (HU) treatment and the potential side effects and diseaseD064420. METHODS: The study enrolled 215 9606 between 3 and 12 years old before and after the administration of HU, at a fix dose of 20 mg/kg/day for 12 months. RESULTS: A total of 157 9606 started HU medication and 141 of them completed the 12-month treatment. After initiating HU treatment, the frequency of clinical events decreased (transfusions 53.4 %, hospitalizations 47.1 %). The response to HU medication varied among 9606, with some experiencing an increase in fetal hemoglobin (HbF) of <5 %. The mean increase in HbF was 11.9 %, ranging from 1.8 % to 31 %. Responders to HU treatment were 57 %, inadequate responders 38.7 % and non-adherent 4.2 %. No clinical side effects related to HU were reported. diseaseD006402 were transient and reversible. Children naive to HU and with lower HbF reported higher number of hospitalizations caused by diseaseD008288. During HU treatment, the frequency of diseaseD008288 episodes did not appear to be affected by HbF levels. CONCLUSIONS: the present study provided a valuable contribution to the understanding of the clinical and laboratory profiles of Angolan children with diseaseD000755. These findings support the evidence that the implementation of prophylactic measures and treatment with HU is associated with increased survival in children with diseaseD000755.
38193560	Early Cholecystectomy in diseaseD000755 9606 with Uncomplicated diseaseD002769 is Associated with Better Outcomes.BACKGROUND: Up to 85% of 9606 with diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) will develop diseaseD042882 by their third decade. Cholecystectomy is the most commonly performed procedure in these 9606. Cholecystectomy is recommended for 9606 with diseaseD000755 with symptomatic diseaseD002769 and leads to lower morbidity. No contemporary large studies have evaluated this recommendation or associated clinical outcomes. This study evaluates clinical outcomes after cholecystectomy in 9606 with diseaseD000755 and diseaseD002769 with specific advanced clinical presentations. STUDY DESIGN: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample was queried for 9606 with diseaseD000755 and diseaseD005705 between years 2006-2015. 9606 were divided into groups based on their disease presentation including: uncomplicated diseaseD002769, diseaseD041881, and diseaseD042882. Clinical outcomes associated with disease presentation were analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test, Chi-square, ANOVA, and logistic regression. RESULTS: There were 6,662 9606 with diseaseD000755 who presented with diseaseD002769. Median age was 20 [IQR 16-34] and 54% were female. Cholecystectomy was performed in 1,779 diseaseD000755 9606 with the most common indication being diseaseD002764 (44%), followed by uncomplicated diseaseD002769 (27%), diseaseD041881 (21%), and diseaseD042883 and/or diseaseD042882 (8%). On multivariable regression, advanced clinical presentation was the strongest predictor of peri-operative diseaseD001157, which was the most common complication. 9606 undergoing cholecystectomy for uncomplicated diseaseD002769 were at lower risk than those with diseaseD041881 (OR 2.37; [1.64-3.41]), diseaseD002764 (OR 1.74; [1.26-2.4]), and choledocholithiais and/or diseaseD042882 (OR 2.24; [1.41-3.57]). CONCLUSIONS: Seventy-three percent 9606 with diseaseD000755 have advanced clinical presentation at the time of their cholecystectomy. Following cholecystectomy, peri-operative diseaseD001157 events were significantly increased in 9606 with advanced clinical presentation. These data support screening abdominal ultrasounds and early cholecystectomy for diseaseD002769 in 9606 with diseaseD000755.
38223313	Predictors of hospital readmissions in adult 9606 with diseaseD000755.BACKGROUND: diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) is the most common diseaseD025861, affecting primarily Black and Hispanic individuals. In 2016, 30-day readmissions incurred 95,445 extra days of hospitalization, $152 million in total hospitalization costs, and $609 million in total hospitalization charges. OBJECTIVES: 1) To estimate hospital readmissions within 30 days among 9606 with diseaseD000755 in the State of California. 2) Identify the factors associated with readmission within 30 days for diseaseD000755 9606 in California. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study of adult diseaseD000755 9606 hospitalized in California between 2005 and 2014. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models were used to examine significant differences in 9606 characteristics and their association with hospital readmissions. RESULTS: From 2,728 individual index admissions, 70% presented with single admission, 10% experienced one readmission, and 20% experienced   two readmissions within 30 days. Significant predictors associated with zero vs. one readmission were male gender (OR=1.37, CI: 1.06-1.77), Black ethnicity (OR=3.27, CI: 1.71-6.27) and having Medicare coverage (OR=1.89, CI: 1.30-2.75). Lower likelihood of readmission was found in those with a Charlson Comorbidity index of three or more (OR=0.53, CI: 0.29-0.97). For zero vs.   two readmissions, significant predictors were male gender (OR=1.43, CI: 1.17-1.74), Black ethnicity (OR=6.90, CI: 3.41-13.97), Hispanic ethnicity (OR=2.33, CI: 1.05-5.17), Medicare coverage (OR=3.58, CI: 2.68-4.81) and Medi-Cal coverage (OR=1.70, CI: 1.31-2.20). Lower likelihood for having two or more readmissions were associated with individuals aged 65+ (OR=0.97, CI: 0.96-0.98) and those with self-payment status (OR=0.32, CI: 0.12-0.54). CONCLUSIONS: In California, male, Black, and Hispanic 9606, as well as those covered by Medicare or Medi-Cal, were found to have an increased risk of hospital readmissions. Redirecting 9606 goals to address these 9606 populations and risk factors is crucial for reducing readmission rates.
38181478	Perspectives on diseaseD000740: Factors confounding understanding of past occurrence.OBJECTIVE: This paper reviews factors confounding the understanding of the past occurrence of diseaseD000740. Using the evidence gathered, a framework is presented of ways forward to enable greater confidence in diagnosing acquired diseaseD000740 in paleopathology, facilitating insights into longer-term perspectives on this globally relevant condition. RESULTS: To date, porotic lesions have been central to paleopathological investigations of diseaseD000740. The fact that porotic diseaseD001847 are omnipresent and have multiple causes but are likely to have a relatively low, age-related frequency in individuals with diseaseD000740, a condition that will have been common in past communities, is confounding. METHODS: Establishing frameworks that move away from porotic lesions is proposed to facilitate higher levels of more accurate diseaseD000740 diagnoses in paleopathology. SIGNIFICANCE: Acceptance of the fundamental principle that diseaseD000740 may be better considered as a condition requiring metric evaluation of bone structures, supplemented by careful consideration of lesions, will advance understanding of acquired diseaseD000740 in past communities. Such an approach would provide a clear basis for further consideration of congenital conditions causing diseaseD000740, such as diseaseD000755 and diseaseD013789. LIMITATIONS: This paper simply opens the conversation on the better diagnosis of diseaseD000740 in paleopathology; it starts the iterative process of achieving some consensus and progress on diagnosing diseaseD000740 in paleopathology. SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH: Engagement with ideas presented, sharing data and development of metric parameters will assist in identifying the effects of diseaseD006965 on bone, enabling more robust work on the important topic of diseaseD000740.
38205646	Management of a 9606 with diseaseD000755 and multiple red blood cell alloantibodies in preparation for a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is currently the only widely available curative option for 9606 with diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755). Alloimmunization in this population is frequent and can complicate transfusion management during the HSCT period. The case of a pediatric 9606 with severe diseaseD000755 clinical phenotype, multiple alloantibodies (9), and diseaseD013577 who underwent haploidentical HSCT is described. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The 9606 was known for an anti-e, despite RHCE*01.01 allele, which predicts a C- c+ E- weak e+ phenotype. Donors matching the 9606's extended phenotype were targeted for ncbi6006 genotyping. RESULTS: Donors homozygotes or heterozygotes for RHCE*01.01 were selected for compatibility analyses and ranked based on strength of reactions. Discordance between zygosity and strength of reactions was observed, as the most compatible donors were heterozygotes for RHCE*01.01. In total, the 9606 received seven RBC units from two different donors during HSCT process without transfusion reaction or development of new alloantibodies. Six months post-HSCT, his hemoglobin level is stable at around 120 g/L and his chimerism is 100%. DISCUSSION: This case highlights the complexity of transfusion management during HSCT of alloimmunized 9606 with diseaseD000755. Collecting sufficient compatible units requires early involvement of transfusion medicine teams and close communication with the local blood provider. Genotyping of donors self-identifying as Black is useful for identifying compatible blood for those 9606 but has some limitations. HSCT for heavily alloimmunized 9606 is feasible and safe with early involvement of transfusion medicine specialists. Further research on the clinical impact of genotypic matching is needed.
38187369	Is cost of surgery and hospital length of stay increased for diseaseD000755 9606 undergoing total joint replacement surgeries? Systematic review and multivariate meta-analysis.BACKGROUND: diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) 9606 undergo major joint replacement surgeries with significant improvement in quality of life. Previous literature have tried to explore differences in hospital charges and length of stay between 9606 with and without diseaseD000755. The aim of this meta-analysis is to find out if both outcomes are increased for 9606 with diseaseD000755 9606 compared to those without diseaseD000755. METHODS: Literature search was conducted and studies that compared hospital charges and length of stay between 9606 with and without diseaseD000755 following major arthroplasties were retrieved. A multivariate meta-analysis was conducted using Random-Effect model with the Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) using the Metafor Package in R and Rstudio. RESULTS: Four observational studies were found eligible for the study. The estimated average mean difference based on the random effect model for hospital charges was 7548.50 (95 % CI: 3779.65 to 11317.65) and for length of stay was 2.28 (95 % CI: 1.32 to 3.24) while the prediction interval for the true mean difference for both outcomes were -1810.56 to 16907.56 and -0.01 to 4.57 respectively. CONCLUSION: This present study showed that hospital charges and length of stay are increased for 9606 with diseaseD000755 compared to 9606 without.
38178227	In vitro delayed response to dihydroartemisinin of diseaseD008288 infecting diseaseD000755 cell erythocytes.BACKGROUND: Decreased efficacy of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for Plasmodium falciparum malaria has been previously reported in 9606 with diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755). The main purpose of this study was to investigate the in vitro susceptibility of isolates to dihydro-artemisinin (DHA) to provide a hypothesis to explain this treatment failure. METHODS: Isolates were collected from 9606 attending health centres in Abidjan with uncomplicated diseaseD016778. The haemoglobin type has been identified and in vitro drug sensitivity tests were conducted with the ring stage assay and maturation inhibition assay. RESULTS: 134 isolates were obtained. Parasitaemia and haemoglobin levels at inclusion were lower in 9606 with haemoglobin HbSS and HbSC than in 9606 with normal HbAA. After ex vivo RSA and drug inhibition assays, the lowest rate of parasitic growth was found with isolates from HbAS red cells. Conversely, a significantly higher survival rate of parasites ranging from 15 to 34% were observed in isolates from HbSS. Isolates with in vitro reduced DHA sensitivity correlate with lower RBC count and haematocrit and higher parasitaemia at inclusion compared to those with isolates with normal DHA sensitivity. However, this decrease of in vitro sensitivity to DHA was not associated with Kelch 13-Propeller gene polymorphism. CONCLUSION: This study highlights an in vitro decreased sensitivity to DHA, for isolates collected from HbSS 9606, not related to the Pfkelch13 gene mutations. These results are in line with recent studies pointing out the role of the redox context in the efficacy of the drug. Indeed, diseaseD000755 red cells harbour a highly different ionic and redox context in comparison with normal red cells. This study offers new insights into the understanding of artemisinin selective pressure on the diseaseD008288 parasite in the context of haemoglobinopathies in Africa.
38181784	In vivo measurement of RBC survival in 9606 with diseaseD000755 before or after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.Stable, mixed donor-recipient chimerism after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for 9606 with diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) is sufficient for phenotypic disease reversal and results from differences in donor/recipient red blood cell (RBC) survival. Understanding variability and predictors of RBC survival among 9606 with diseaseD000755 before and after HSCT is critical for gene therapy research which seeks to generate sufficient corrected hemoglobin to reduce polymerization thereby overcoming the red cell pathology of diseaseD000755. This study utilized biotin-labeling of RBCs to determine the lifespan of RBCs in 9606 with diseaseD000755 compared to 9606 who have successfully undergone curative HSCT, participants with diseaseD012805 (HbAS), and healthy (HbAA) donors (NCT04476277). Twenty participants were included in the analysis (N=6 diseaseD000755 pre-HSCT, N=5 diseaseD000755 post-HSCT, N=6 HbAS, N=3 HbAA). The average RBC lifespan was significantly shorter for participants with diseaseD000755 pre-HSCT (64.1 days, range 35-91) compared to those with diseaseD000755 post-HSCT (113.4 days, range 105-119), HbAS (126.0 days, range 119-147), and HbAA (123.7 days, range 91-147) (p<0.001). RBC lifespan correlated with various hematologic parameters, and strongly correlated with the average final fraction of sickled RBCs after deoxygenation (p<0.001). No adverse events were attributable to the use of biotin and related procedures. Biotin labeling of RBCs is a safe and feasible methodology to evaluate RBC survival in 9606 with diseaseD000755 before and after HSCT. Understanding differences in RBC survival may ultimately guide gene therapy protocols to determine hemoglobin composition required to reverse the diseaseD000755 phenotype as it relates directly to RBC survival.
38171495	disease603663, diseaseD010146 and likelihood of diseaseD009293 among adults with diseaseD000755.diseaseD003866 are prevalent in individuals living with diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) and may exacerbate diseaseD010146. This study examines whether higher diseaseD003866 are associated with diseaseD010146 outcomes, diseaseD010146 catastrophizing, interference and potential diseaseD009293 in a large cohort of adults with diseaseD000755. The study utilized baseline data from the 'CaRISMA' trial, which involved 357 diseaseD000755 adults with diseaseD059350. Baseline assessments included diseaseD010146 intensity, daily mood, the 9606 Health Questionnaire (PHQ), the diseaseC000726808 scale, PROMIS diseaseD010146 Interference, diseaseD010146 Catastrophizing Scale, the Adult Sickle Cell Quality of Life Measurement Information System and the Current diseaseD009293 Measure. Participants were categorized into 'high' or 'low' diseaseD003866 groups based on PHQ scores. Higher diseaseD003866 were significantly associated with increased daily diseaseD010146 intensity, negative daily mood, higher diseaseD010146 interference and catastrophizing, poorer quality of life and a higher likelihood of diseaseD009293 (all p < 0.01). diseaseD000755 9606 with more severe diseaseD003866 experienced poorer diseaseD010146 outcomes, lower quality of life and increased risk of diseaseD009293. Longitudinal data from this trial will determine whether addressing diseaseD003866 may potentially reduce diseaseD010146 frequency and severity in diseaseD000755.
38202591	New Synthetic Isoxazole Derivatives Acting as Potent Inducers of Fetal Hemoglobin in Erythroid Precursor Cells Isolated from b-Thalassemic 9606.Induction of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is highly beneficial for 9606 carrying diseaseD013789, and novel HbF inducers are highly needed. Here, we describe a new class of promising HbF inducers characterized by an isoxazole chemical skeleton and obtained through modification of two natural molecules, geldanamycin and radicicol. After preliminary biological assays based on benzidine staining and RT-qPCR conducted on 9606 erythroleukemic 0004 cells, we employed erythroid precursors cells (D046) isolated from diseaseD013789 9606. D046 weretreated with appropriate concentrations of isoxazole derivatives. The accumulation of globin mRNAs was studied by RT-qPCR, and hemoglobin production by HPLC. We demonstrated the high efficacy of isozaxoles in inducing HbF. Most of these derivatives displayed an activity similar to that observed using known HbF inducers, such as hydroxyurea (HU) or rapamycin; some of the analyzed compounds were able to induce HbF with more efficiency than HU. All the compounds were active in reducing the excess of free a-globin in treated D046. All the compounds displayed a lack of genotoxicity. These novel isoxazoles deserve further pre-clinical study aimed at verifying whether they are suitable for the development of therapeutic protocols for diseaseD013789.
38204310	Newborn screening for diseaseD000755 in Antalya, Turkiye.BACKGROUND: In a screening study conducted on adults, the prevalence of diseaseD000755 traits in Antalya was found to be 0.24%. Since no screening studies have been conducted in the neonatal period in our region, the exact incidence has not been determined. In this study, we aim to report our experience of neonatal screening for diseaseD000755 in Antalya, Turkiye. METHODS: During a 14-month period, 2562 heel prick blood samples, taken on filter paper from Akdeniz University Hospital, Antalya Education and Research Hospital and Antalya Ataturk State Hospital and four other healthcare centers, were studied using the high pressure liquid chromatography method. Blood samples were studied using the `diseaseD000755 Short Program` test method on a Bio Rad Variant device. RESULTS: In the study, no 9606 with diseaseD000755 were identified. Four newborns who were diseaseD000755 carriers (0.15%) and two newborns who were Hemoglobin D carriers (0.08 %), were found. CONCLUSION: Considering the efficiency and cost calculations made as a result of the data obtained from our study, it was concluded that diseaseD000755 screening would not be effective in newborns. It seems more effective and economical to screen the children of parents, who are found to be at risk for Hemoglobin S carriage as a result of premarital tests.
38237718	Metabolic Regulation of diseaseD002658.The formation of new red blood cells (erythropoiesis) has served as a paradigm for understanding cellular differentiation and developmental control of gene expression. The metabolic regulation of this complex, coordinated process remains poorly understood. Each step of erythropoiesis, including lineage specification of hematopoietic stem cells, proliferation, differentiation, and terminal maturation into highly specialized oxygen-carrying cells, has unique metabolic requirements. Developing erythrocytes in mammals are also characterized by unique metabolic events such as loss of mitochondria with switch to glycolysis, ejection of nucleus and organelles, high level heme and hemoglobin synthesis, and antioxidant requirement to protect hemoglobin molecules. Genetic defects in metabolic enzymes including pyruvate kinase and ncbi2539 cause common diseaseD012010 disorders, whereas other diseaseD030342 such as diseaseD000755 and diseaseD013789 display diseaseD008659 associated with disease pathophysiology. Here we describe recent discoveries on the metabolic control of red blood cell formation and function, highlight emerging concepts in understanding the erythroid metabolome, and discuss potential therapeutic benefits of targeting metabolism for red cell disorders.
38168584	Evaluating 9940 hemoglobins with MD simulations as an animal model for diseaseD000755.diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) affects millions worldwide, yet there are few therapeutic options. To develop effective treatments, preclinical models that recapitulate 9606 physiology and diseaseD000755 pathophysiology are needed. diseaseD000755 arises from a single variant##p.E6V in the b subunit of hemoglobin (Hb), promoting Hb polymerization and subsequent disease. 9940 share important physiological and developmental characteristics with 9606, including the same developmental pattern of fetal to adult Hb switching. Herein, we investigated whether introducing the diseaseD000755 mutation into the 9940 b-globin locus would recapitulate diseaseD000755's complex pathophysiology by generating high quality SWISS-MODEL 9940 Hb structures and performing MD simulations of normal/sickle 9606 (huHbA/huHbS) and 9940 (shHbB/shHbS) Hb, establishing how accurately shHbS mimics huHbS behavior. shHbS, like huHbS, remained stable with low RMSD, while huHbA and shHbB had higher and fluctuating RMSD. shHbB and shHbS also behaved identically to huHbA and huHbS with respect to b<sub>2</sub>-Glu6 and b<sub>1</sub>-Asp73 (b<sub>1</sub>-Asn72 in 9940) solvent interactions. These data demonstrate that introducing the single diseaseD000755-causing Glu-to-Val substitution into 9940 b-globin causes alterations consistent with the Hb polymerization that drives RBC sickling, supporting the development of a diseaseD000755 9940 model to pave the way for alternative cures for this debilitating, globally impactful disease.
38216623	Crowdsourced 9606-based computational approach for tagging peripheral blood smear sample images from diseaseD000755 9606 using non-expert users.In this paper, we present a 9606-based computation approach for the analysis of peripheral blood smear (PBS) images images in 9606 with diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755). We used the Mechanical Turk microtask market to crowdsource the labeling of PBS images. We then use the expert-tagged erythrocytesIDB dataset to assess the accuracy and reliability of our proposal. Our results showed that when a robust consensus is achieved among the Mechanical Turk workers, probability of error is very low, based on comparison with expert analysis. This suggests that our proposed approach can be used to annotate datasets of PBS images, which can then be used to train automated methods for the diagnosis of diseaseD000755. In future work, we plan to explore the potential integration of our findings with outcomes obtained through automated methodologies. This could lead to the development of more accurate and reliable methods for the diagnosis of diseaseD000755.
38222852	Clinical and Laboratory Correlates of QTc Duration in Adult and Pediatric diseaseD000755.BACKGROUND: diseaseD000755, a common diseaseD030342 in African Americans, manifests an increased risk of diseaseD003645, the basis of which is incompletely understood. Prolongation of heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval on the electrocardiogram, a standard clinical measure of cardiac repolarization, may contribute to diseaseD003645 by predisposing to <i>diseaseD016171</i> diseaseD017180. METHODS: We established a cohort study of 293 adult and 121 pediatric diseaseD000755 9606 drawn from the same geographic region as the Jackson Heart Study (JHS) cohort, in which significant correlates of QT duration have been characterized and quantitatively modeled. Herein, we establish clinical and laboratory correlates of QTc duration in our cohort using stepwise multivariate linear regression analysis. We then compared our adult diseaseD000755 data to effect-size predictions from the published JHS statistical model of QT interval duration. RESULTS: In adult diseaseD000755, gender, diuretic use, QRS duration, serum ALT levels, anion gap, and diastolic blood pressure show positive correlation; hemoglobin levels show inverse correlation; in pediatric diseaseD000755, age, hemoglobin levels, and serum bicarbonate and creatinine levels show inverse correlation. The mean QTc in our adult diseaseD000755 cohort is 7.8 milliseconds longer than in the JHS cohort, even though the JHS statistical model predicts that the mean QTc in our cohort should be > 11 milliseconds shorter than in the much older JHS cohort, a differential of > 18 milliseconds. CONCLUSION: diseaseD000755 9606 have substantial diseaseD008133 relative to their age, driven by factors some overlapping, in adult and pediatric diseaseD000755, and distinct from those that have been defined in the general African American community.
38237001	Perspectives of Adolescents and Young Adults With diseaseD000755 and Clinicians on Improving Transition Readiness With a Video Game Intervention.We aimed to learn the experiences of clinicians and adolescents and young adults with diseaseD000755 (AYA-diseaseC536778) with managing their disease at home and making medical decisions as they transition from pediatric to adult care, and their perceptions of a video game intervention to positively impact these skills. We conducted individual, semistructured interviews with 9606 (AYA-diseaseC536778 ages 15 to 26 years) and clinicians who provide care to AYA-diseaseC536778 at an urban, quaternary-care hospital. Interviews elicited 9606' and clinicians' experiences with AYA-diseaseC536778, barriers and facilitators to successful home management, and their perspectives on shared decision-making and a video game intervention. To identify themes, we conducted an inductive analysis until data saturation was reached. Participants (16 9606 and 21 clinicians) identified 4 main themes: (1) self-efficacy as a critical skill for a successful transition from pediatric to adult care, (2) the importance of 9606 engagement in making medical decisions, (3) multilevel determinants of optimal self-efficacy and 9606 engagement, and (4) support for a video game intervention which, by targeting potential determinants of AYA-diseaseC536778 achieving optimal self-efficacy and engagement in decision-making, may improve these important skills.
38182466	Clinical, laboratory, and molecular characteristics of a cohort of children with diseaseD006453/diseaseD017086.INTRODUCTION: diseaseD006453 (HbSb-thal) has a wide range of clinical and laboratory severity. There is limited information on the natural history of HbSb-thal and its modulating factors. We described the molecular, hematological, and clinical characteristics of a cohort of children with HbSb-thal and estimated its incidence in Minas Gerais, Brazil. METHODS: Laboratory and clinical data were retrieved from medical records. Molecular analysis was performed by ncbi3043 gene sequencing, PCR-RFLP, gap-PCR, and MLPA. RESULTS: Eighty-nine children were included in the study. Fourteen alleles of b-thal mutations were identified. The incidence of HbSb-thal in the state was 1 per 22,250 newborns. The most common b<sup>S</sup>-haplotypes were ncbi653108 and Benin. The most frequent b<sup>thal</sup>-haplotypes were V, II, and I. Coexistence of 3.7 kb HBA1/HBA2 deletion was present in 21.3 % of children. diseaseD013789 mutations were associated with several clinical and laboratory features. In general, the incidence of clinical events per 100 9606-years was similar for children with HbSb<sup>0</sup>-thal, IVS-Ivariant#653108#c.-5G>A, and IVS-Ivariant#653108#c.-110G>A. Children with HbSb<sup>+</sup>-intermediate phenotypes had a more severe laboratory and clinical profile when compared with those with HbSb<sup>+</sup>-mild ones. b<sup>S</sup>-haplotypes and diseaseD013789 did not meaningfully influence the phenotype of children with HbSb-thal. CONCLUSION: The early identification of diseaseD013789 alleles may help the clinical management of these children.
38173541	diseaseD009461 in 9606 With diseaseD000755 Without a History of Major diseaseD009461 Events.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: 9606 with diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) are prone to symptomatic diseaseD002493. Previous studies reported accrual of diseaseD014947 starting at early age, even without having symptomatic diseaseD009461 events. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and risk factors of diseaseD009461 in 9606 with diseaseD000755 with no history of major symptomatic diseaseD009461 events. METHODS: Our study extracted 9606 diagnosed with diseaseD000755 from the Cooperative Study of diseaseD000755. 9606 who underwent a diseaseD009461 evaluation were included in our analysis. 9606 with previous documented major symptomatic diseaseD009461 events were excluded. We compared 9606 with diseaseD000755 with diseaseD009461 with those without in terms of clinical and laboratory parameters using multivariate binary logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 3,573 9606 with diseaseD000755 were included (median age = 11 [IQR = 19] years, male = 1719 [48.1%]). 519 (14.5%) 9606 had at least one abnormal diseaseD009461 finding. The most common findings in descending order were abnormal reflexes, diseaseD020233, diseaseD002526, diseaseD007806, diseaseD009759, diseaseD009122, diseaseD005150, diseaseD006732, and diseaseC565406. History of diseaseD005128 (odds ratio [OR] = 2.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.63-4.68) and history of diseaseD010019 (OR = 2.55, 95% CI 1.34-4.84) were the strongest predictors of diseaseD009461, followed by smoking (OR = 1.59, 95% CI 1.08-2.33), diseaseD010020 (OR = 1.57, 95% CI 1.06-2.33), diseaseD060831 (OR = 1.48, 95% CI 1.04-2.12), and male sex (OR = 1.42, 95% CI 1.01-2.02). DISCUSSION: diseaseD009461 are relatively common in 9606 with diseaseD000755, even without documented major diseaseD009461. They range from peripheral and diseaseC535922 to central and diseaseD003072. 9606 with diseaseD000755 should have early regular diseaseD009461 evaluations and risk factor modification, particularly actively promoting smoking cessation.
38215146	Understanding apoptosis in diseaseD000755 9606: Mechanisms and implications.diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) is a diseaseD025861 characterized by the presence of abnormal hemoglobin, leading to the formation of sickle-shaped red blood cells. While much research has focused on the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of diseaseD000755, recent attention has turned to the role of apoptosis, or programmed cell death, in the disease progression. This review aims to elucidate the intricate mechanisms of apoptosis in diseaseD000755 9606 and explore its implications in disease severity, complications, and potential therapeutic interventions. Different research search engines such as PubMed central, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, ResearchGate, Academia Edu, etc were utilized in writing this paper. Apoptosis, a highly regulated cellular process, plays a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis by eliminating damaged or dysfunctional cells. In diseaseD000755, the imbalance between pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic signals contributes to increased erythrocyte apoptosis, exacerbating diseaseD000740 and diseaseD013224. Various factors, including oxidative stress, diseaseD007249, and altered cell signaling pathways, converge to modulate the apoptotic response in diseaseD000755. Furthermore, the interaction between apoptotic cells and the vascular endothelium contributes to diseaseD014652, promoting the pathogenesis of diseaseD000090122 and diseaseD000092124 seen in diseaseD000755 9606. In conclusion, unraveling the complexities of apoptosis in diseaseD000755 provides valuable insights into the disease pathophysiology and offers novel avenues for therapeutic interventions.
38241664	diseaseD000208 in 9606.BACKGROUND: diseaseD034161 has been reported in 3%-14% of diseaseD000208 (diseaseD000208) cases in 9606. One guideline suggests need for a longer antibiotic course in diseaseD034161 diseaseD000208, however, recent data are lacking. We describe the clinical course of 9606 with diseaseD034161 diseaseD000208 and compare it to nonpelvic diseaseD000208. METHODS: A retrospective review of 9606 with a diagnosis of diseaseD000208 admitted to Texas 9606's Hospital from January 2012 to December 2020 was conducted. 9606 6 months-<19 years old and with  14 days of symptoms at admission were eligible. 9606 with diseaseD000755 or immunocompromised were excluded. Wilcoxon rank-sum test assessed for differences between continuous variables and Fisher exact for categorical variables using STATA 17. RESULTS: We compared 104 cases of diseaseD034161 diseaseD000208 to 314 cases of nonpelvic diseaseD000208. 9606 had similar microbiology, length of stay and length of antibiotic therapy. 9606 with diseaseD034161 diseaseD000208 had diseaseD052880 identified by magnetic resonance imaging more often (28.8 vs. 9.4%, P < 0.001) and diseaseD000038 less often (22.1 vs. 46.5%, P < 0.001). Rates of chronic complications were comparable between 9606 with diseaseD034161 diseaseD000208 and nonpelvic diseaseD000208 (8.4% vs. 15.1%, P = 0.1). Nineteen 9606 (18.3%) with diseaseD034161 diseaseD000208 received  30 antibiotic days without complications, but they had less need for intensive care or diseaseD000038 than 9606 treated longer. CONCLUSIONS: diseaseD034161 diseaseD000208 in 9606 may be more frequent than previously reported but is not associated with more complications. Four weeks of therapy may be sufficient in selected 9606. Prospective studies to compare outcomes with different lengths of therapy are needed.

38171625	THromboprophylaxis In diseaseD000755 with central venous catheters (THIS): an internal pilot randomised controlled trial protocol.INTRODUCTION: Individuals with diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) and central venous catheters (CVC) are at high risk for diseaseD054556 (diseaseD054556). Minimal data exist regarding the use of anticoagulation as thromboprophylaxis of diseaseD054556 in this demographic, and as a result, clinical equipoise exists. Prophylactic dose rivaroxaban, a direct oral anticoagulant, is efficacious and safe as thromboprophylaxis in other demographics, and may be an optimal agent in diseaseD000755 with CVC. Prior to conducting a full clinical trial to assess rivaroxaban as thromboprophylaxis in diseaseD000755 with CVC, a pilot study is needed to gauge its feasibility. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: THromboprophylaxis In diseaseD000755 pilot trial is an investigator-initiated, multicentre, double-blinded, randomised controlled trial (RCT) assessing if it is feasible and safe to conduct an adequately powered RCT comparing rivaroxaban to matching placebo as thromboprophylaxis in those with diseaseD000755 and CVC. Fifty adult 9606 with diseaseD000755 and CVC will be randomised to receive either rivaroxaban 10 mg daily or matching placebo for the duration of the CVC in situ for up to 1 year. After randomisation, follow-up visits will occur every 3 months. The primary outcomes pertain to the feasibility of a full trial and include numbers of eligible and recruited participants. Exploratory outcomes include overall incidence of diseaseD054556 and diseaseD006470 complications, as well as quality of life. If the full trial is feasible, blinding will be maintained and 9606 in the pilot study will be included in the full trial. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial was initially approved by the University Health Network Research Ethics Board (REB) in Toronto, Canada. All sites will obtain approval from their respective REB prior to commencement of study activities. Study results will be disseminated through presentations at medical conferences and peer-reviewed publications. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT05033314.
38188902	An Unusual Case of diseaseD013577 and Delayed diseaseD006461 Transfusion Reaction due to Anti-Jk(a) and Anti-P1 Antibodies.BACKGROUND: diseaseD013577 (diseaseD013577) is a severe diseaseD006461 transfusion reaction that can cause hemoglobin and hematocrit levels to drop below pretransfusion levels, leading to severe diseaseD000740. diseaseD013577 most commonly occurs in 9606 with a pre-existing diseaseD006453 such as diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) or diseaseD017086. METHODS: We report a case of diseaseD013577, occurring in the absence of diseaseD006453, making the diagnosis challenging. The 9606 reported was also affected by a ncbi23152-rearranged diseaseD012509. As part of the workup, the 9606 received a bone marrow biopsy for suspected diseaseD051359. RESULTS: This provided a rare biopsy specimen to correlate reticulocytopenia with marked diseaseD006965 in the marrow, supporting the hypothesis of reticulocyte destruction as a contributing cause of diseaseD000740 in these 9606. This 9606 had demonstrable alloantibodies to the Jk(a) and P1 antigens as potential triggers for diseaseD013577. CONCLUSIONS: It is vital that a diagnosis of diseaseD013577 be correctly made in these 9606 with severe diseaseD000740, as blood transfusions generally lead to worsening of their conditions.
38167227	Successful Conservative Therapy for diseaseD007239 Penile Implants: A Case Series.BACKGROUND Traditionally, diseaseD010409 have been treated by removal followed by immediate or delayed replacement. The use of antibiotics in conservative therapy has recently attracted attention. CASE REPORT We report our experience with 4 cases of diseaseD007239 penile implants managed conservatively. Case 1 was a 41-year-old with diseaseD000755 who presented with low-grade diseaseD005334 and diseaseD019522 that started 1 month postoperatively and lasted for 3 weeks. He had left graft after fibrotic tissue excision with 14-mm collection in the left corpus cavernosum. He was managed with IV pipracillin/tazobactam and vancomycin for 13 days. Follow-up after 23 weeks showed complete wound healing. Case 2 was a 62-year-old with diseaseD003920 who had diseaseD019522 that started 41 days postoperatively and lasted for 1 week. He received 5 days of IV vancomycin and gentamycin. Follow-up after 4 weeks showed marked improvement of the wound. Case 3 was a 61-year-old with diseaseD003920 and diseaseD017202. He presented 30 days postoperatively with diseaseD005334, diseaseD019522 for 5 days. He received a total of 10 days of IV vancomycin and gentamycin. Follow-up 3 weeks after discharge showed complete wound healing. Case 4 was a 61-year-old with diseaseD003920 and diseaseD017202. He presented 1 month postoperatively with diseaseD005334 and diseaseD013492 for 1 week. He completed 10 days of IV vancomycin and gentamycin. Follow-up after 1 week showed marked wound healing. CONCLUSIONS Choosing 9606 with early superficial diseaseD007239 penile prosthesis for conservative management should be tailored to selected 9606 who does not have diseaseD007964, signs of diseaseD018805, high-grade diseaseD005334, or an exposed device.

38189099	diseaseD019851 in diseaseD000755: A Thrombo-diseaseD007249 Mechanism.diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) is a group of diseaseD030342 characterized by the presence of abnormal hemoglobin S. 9606 with diseaseD000755 suffer from frequent episodes of diseaseD000740, diseaseD006461, diseaseD010146, and diseaseD001157. Additionally, diseaseD000755 is associated with diverse and serious clinical complications, including diseaseD013927, which can lead to diseaseD009102, increased morbidity, and eventually, mortality. diseaseD000755 is known to be a diseaseD019851, and the cause of diseaseD019851 is multifactorial, with the molecular basis of hemoglobin S being the main driver. The presence of hemoglobin S induces sickling of the RBCs and their subsequent diseaseD006461, as well as oxidative stress. Both of these processes can alter the hemostatic system, through the activation of platelets, coagulation system, and fibrinolysis, as well as depletion of coagulation inhibitors. These changes can also induce the formation of microvesicles and expression of tissue factor, leading to activation of WBCs, endothelial cell damage, and diseaseD007249 response. Understanding the various factors that drive diseaseD019851 as a thrombo-diseaseD007249 mechanism in diseaseD000755 can help provide explanations for the pathogenesis and other complications of the disease.
