input_text: 'Posterior Fascicular Ventricular Tachycardia: A Rare Cause of Tachycardia.
  A 13-year male patient with a history of tachycardia attacks was diagnosed to have
  left posterior fascicular ventricular tachycardia (VT) according to the electrocardiogram
  (ECG) obtained at the emergency service. This diagnosis was confirmed with advanced
  electrophysiological studies and the case was diagnosed by genetic evaluation, which
  was performed to reveal the underlying cause, to have Brugada type 2 syndrome that
  might be associated with sudden cardiac death. Underlying causes should be evaluated,
  although idiopathic VTs generally have a good prognosis. Key Words: Brugada syndrome,
  Posterior fascicular ventricular tachycardia, Right bundle branch block.'
