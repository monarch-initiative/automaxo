input_text: '[Sudden cardiac death during exercise due to Brugada syndrome. Report
  of one case]. We report a 20-year-old male athlete who while running, presented
  a sudden death due to ventricular fibrillation. He was successfully rescued by cardiopulmonary
  resuscitation maneuvers and an automatic external defibrillator. Without evidence
  of structural heart disease, Brugada syndrome was diagnosed as the cause, after
  which a subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator was indicated. We discuss
  the subject of sudden cardiac death in athletes and its unusual relationship with
  exercise in this channelopathy.'
