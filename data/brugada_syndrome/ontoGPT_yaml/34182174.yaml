input_text: 'Role of endocardial ablation in eliminating an epicardial arrhythmogenic
  substrate in patients with Brugada syndrome. BACKGROUND: Epicardial ablation is
  occasionally limited by coronary artery (CA) injuries or epicardial fat (EF). OBJECTIVE:
  The purpose of this study was to evaluate the anatomic obstacles that prevent ablation
  of epicardial abnormal potentials (EAPs) in patients with Brugada syndrome (BrS)
  and to investigate the feasibility of EAP elimination by endocardial right ventricular
  (RV) ablation. METHODS: This study included 16 BrS patients with previous ventricular
  fibrillation (VF), including 10 with an electrical storm. Data from multidetector
  computed tomography were assessed, and the proximity of the CA and EF was correlated
  with EAPs. RESULTS: EAPs were present in the epicardial RV outflow tract and RV
  inferior wall in all patients and 12 patients (75%), respectively. These EAPs were
  present within 5 mm of the main body and branches of the right CA in 14 patients
  (87.5%). However, only 1.4% +- 2.9% of the EAP area was covered with thick EF (>=8
  mm). Partial EAP elimination by endocardial RV ablation was feasible in all 10 patients,
  with 53.3% successful endocardial RV radiofrequency applications for eliminating
  EAPs. After the procedure, VF remained inducible in 37.5% of the patients. During
  the 25.1 +- 29.1 months of follow-up, no patients experienced an electrical storm,
  and VF burden significantly decreased (median VF episodes before and after ablation:
  7 and 0, respectively). CONCLUSION: EAPs are near the CA in most BrS patients, thereby
  requiring caution during epicardial ablation, whereas EF is less of an issue. Endocardial
  ablation is feasible to eliminate some EAPs and may be combined with epicardial
  ablation.'
