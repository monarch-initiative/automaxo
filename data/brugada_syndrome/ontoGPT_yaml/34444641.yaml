input_text: Impact of Dietary Factors on Brugada Syndrome and Long QT Syndrome. A
  healthy regime is fundamental for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVD).
  In inherited channelopathies, such as Brugada syndrome (BrS) and Long QT syndrome
  (LQTS), unfortunately, sudden cardiac death could be the first sign for patients
  affected by these syndromes. Several known factors are used to stratify the risk
  of developing cardiac arrhythmias, although none are determinative. The risk factors
  can be affected by adjusting lifestyle habits, such as a particular diet, impacting
  the risk of arrhythmogenic events and mortality. To date, the importance of understanding
  the relationship between diet and inherited channelopathies has been underrated.
  Therefore, we describe herein the effects of dietary factors on the development
  of arrhythmia in patients affected by BrS and LQTS. Modifying the diet might not
  be enough to fully prevent arrhythmias, but it can help lower the risk.
