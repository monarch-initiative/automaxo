input_text: 'Comparative Effectiveness of Implantable Defibrillators for Asymptomatic
  Brugada Syndrome: A Decision-Analytic Model. Background Optimal management of asymptomatic
  Brugada syndrome (BrS) with spontaneous type I electrocardiographic pattern is uncertain.
  Methods and Results We developed an individual-level simulation comprising 2 000
  000 average-risk individuals with asymptomatic BrS and spontaneous type I electrocardiographic
  pattern. We compared (1) observation, (2) electrophysiologic study (EPS)-guided
  implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), and (3) upfront ICD, each using either
  subcutaneous or transvenous ICD, resulting in 6 strategies tested. The primary outcome
  was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), with cardiac deaths (arrest or procedural-related)
  as a secondary outcome. We varied BrS diagnosis age and underlying arrest rate.
  We assessed cost-effectiveness at $100 000/QALY. Compared with observation, EPS-guided
  subcutaneous ICD resulted in 0.35 QALY gain/individual and 4130 cardiac deaths avoided/100
  000 individuals, and EPS-guided transvenous ICD resulted in 0.26 QALY gain and 3390
  cardiac deaths avoided. Compared with observation, upfront ICD reduced cardiac deaths
  by a greater margin (subcutaneous ICD, 8950; transvenous ICD, 6050), but only subcutaneous
  ICD improved QALYs (subcutaneous ICD, 0.25 QALY gain; transvenous ICD, 0.01 QALY
  loss), and complications were higher. ICD-based strategies were more effective at
  younger ages and higher arrest rates (eg, using subcutaneous devices, upfront ICD
  was the most effective strategy at ages 20-39.4 years and arrest rates >1.37%/year;
  EPS-guided ICD was the most effective strategy at ages 39.5-51.3 years and arrest
  rates 0.47%-1.37%/year, and observation was the most effective strategy at ages
  >51.3 years and arrest rates <0.47%/year). EPS-guided subcutaneous ICD was cost-effective
  ($80 508/QALY). Conclusions Device-based approaches (with or without EPS risk stratification)
  can be more effective than observation among selected patients with asymptomatic
  BrS. BrS management should be tailored to patient characteristics.'
