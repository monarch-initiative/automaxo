input_text: 'Long-Term Outcomes of Brugada Substrate Ablation: A Report from BRAVO
  (Brugada Ablation of VF Substrate Ongoing Multicenter Registry). BACKGROUND: Treatment
  options for high-risk Brugada syndrome (BrS) with recurrent ventricular fibrillation
  (VF) are limited. Catheter ablation is increasingly performed but a large study
  with long-term outcome data is lacking. We report the results of the multicenter,
  international BRAVO (Brugada Ablation of VF Substrate Ongoing Registry) for treatment
  of high-risk symptomatic BrS. METHODS: We enrolled 159 patients (median age 42 years;
  156 male) with BrS and spontaneous VF in BRAVO; 43 (27%) of them had BrS and early
  repolarization pattern. All but 5 had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator
  for cardiac arrest (n=125) or syncope (n=34). A total of 140 (88%) had experienced
  numerous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks for spontaneous VF before
  ablation. All patients underwent a percutaneous epicardial substrate ablation with
  electroanatomical mapping except for 8 who underwent open-thoracotomy ablation.
  RESULTS: In all patients, VF/BrS substrates were recorded in the epicardial surface
  of the right ventricular outflow tract; 45 (29%) patients also had an arrhythmic
  substrate in the inferior right ventricular epicardium and 3 in the posterior left
  ventricular epicardium. After a single ablation procedure, 128 of 159 (81%) patients
  remained free of VF recurrence; this number increased to 153 (96%) after a repeated
  procedure (mean 1.2+-0.5 procedures; median=1), with a mean follow-up period of
  48+-29 months from the last ablation. VF burden and frequency of shocks decreased
  significantly from 1.1+-2.1 per month before ablation to 0.003+-0.14 per month after
  the last ablation (P<0.0001). The Kaplan-Meier VF-free survival beyond 5 years after
  the last ablation was 95%. The only variable associated with a VF-free outcome in
  multivariable analysis was normalization of the type 1 Brugada ECG, both with and
  without sodium-channel blockade, after the ablation (hazard ratio, 0.078 [95% CI,
  0.008 to 0.753]; P=0.0274). There were no arrhythmic or cardiac deaths. Complications
  included hemopericardium in 4 (2.5%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Ablation treatment is
  safe and highly effective in preventing VF recurrence in high-risk BrS. Prospective
  studies are needed to determine whether it can be an alternative treatment to implantable
  cardioverter-defibrillator implantation for selected patients with BrS. REGISTRATION:
