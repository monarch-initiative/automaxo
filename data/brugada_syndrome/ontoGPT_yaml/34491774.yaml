input_text: 'Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia: Terminology, Mechanism, Diagnosis,
  and Emergency Therapy. Polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmias are highly lethal
  arrhythmias. Several types of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia have similar electrocardiographic
  characteristics but have different modes of therapy. In fact, medications considered
  the treatment of choice for one form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, are
  contraindicated for the other. Yet confusion about terminology, and thus diagnosis
  and therapy, continues. We present an in-depth review of the different forms of
  polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and propose a practical step-by-step approach
  for distinguishing these malignant arrhythmias.'

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
  object: <A sign or symptom associated with the disease and targeted by the medical action. For example, Low serum calcitriol, hypoplasia of the thymus, chronic cough, aortic stiffness, low pulse pressure>
  qualifier: <The primary disease the relationship is about, or specifically the disease the symptom is related to. For example, Beck-Fahrner syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, progeria, diabetes mellitus, infectious otitis media>
  subject_qualifier: <An optional qualifier or modifier for the subject of the statement, e.g. "high dose" or "intravenously administered">
  object_qualifier: <An optional qualifier or modifier for the object of the statement, e.g. "severe" or "with additional complications">
