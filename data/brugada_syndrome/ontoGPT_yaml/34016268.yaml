input_text: 'Precision Medicine Approaches to Cardiac Arrhythmias: JACC Focus Seminar
  4/5. In the initial 3 papers in this Focus Seminar series, the fundamentals and
  key concepts of precision medicine were reviewed, followed by a focus on precision
  medicine in the context of vascular disease and cardiomyopathy. For the remaining
  2 papers, we focus on precision medicine in the context of arrhythmias. Specifically,
  in this fourth paper we focus on long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, and atrial
  fibrillation. The final (fifth) paper will deal with catecholaminergic polymorphic
  ventricular tachycardia. These arrhythmias represent a spectrum of disease ranging
  from common to relatively rare, with very different genetic and environmental causative
  factors, and with differing clinical manifestations that range from almost no consequences
  to lethality in childhood or adolescence if untreated. Accordingly, the emerging
  precision medicine approaches to these arrhythmias vary significantly, but several
  common themes include increased use of genetic testing, avoidance of triggers, and
  personalized risk stratification to guide the use of arrhythmia-specific therapies.'

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
  object: <A sign or symptom associated with the disease and targeted by the medical action. For example, Low serum calcitriol, hypoplasia of the thymus, chronic cough, aortic stiffness, low pulse pressure>
  qualifier: <The primary disease the relationship is about, or specifically the disease the symptom is related to. For example, Beck-Fahrner syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, progeria, diabetes mellitus, infectious otitis media>
  subject_qualifier: <An optional qualifier or modifier for the subject of the statement, e.g. "high dose" or "intravenously administered">
  object_qualifier: <An optional qualifier or modifier for the object of the statement, e.g. "severe" or "with additional complications">
