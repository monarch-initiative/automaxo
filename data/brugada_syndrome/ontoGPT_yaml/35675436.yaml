input_text: Gene therapy targeting protein trafficking regulator MOG1 in mouse models
  of Brugada syndrome, arrhythmias, and mild cardiomyopathy. Brugada syndrome (BrS)
  is a fatal arrhythmia that causes an estimated 4% of all sudden death in high-incidence
  areas. SCN5A encodes cardiac sodium channel NaV1.5 and causes 25 to 30% of BrS cases.
  Here, we report generation of a knock-in (KI) mouse model of BrS (Scn5aG1746R/+).
  Heterozygous KI mice recapitulated some of the clinical features of BrS, including
  an ST segment abnormality (a prominent J wave) on electrocardiograms and development
  of spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTs), seizures, and sudden death. VTs
  were caused by shortened cardiac action potential duration and late phase 3 early
  afterdepolarizations associated with reduced sodium current density (INa) and increased
  Kcnd3 and Cacna1c expression. We developed a gene therapy using adeno-associated
  virus serotype 9 (AAV9) vector-mediated MOG1 delivery for up-regulation of MOG1,
  a chaperone that binds to NaV1.5 and traffics it to the cell surface. MOG1 was chosen
  for gene therapy because the large size of the SCN5A coding sequence (6048 base
  pairs) exceeds the packaging capacity of AAV vectors. AAV9-MOG1 gene therapy increased
  cell surface expression of NaV1.5 and ventricular INa, reversed up-regulation of
  Kcnd3 and Cacna1c expression, normalized cardiac action potential abnormalities,
  abolished J waves, and blocked VT in Scn5aG1746R/+ mice. Gene therapy also rescued
  the phenotypes of cardiac arrhythmias and contractile dysfunction in heterozygous
  humanized KI mice with SCN5A mutation p.D1275N. Using a small chaperone protein
  may have broad implications for targeting disease-causing genes exceeding the size
  capacity of AAV vectors.
