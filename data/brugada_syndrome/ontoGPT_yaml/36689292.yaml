input_text: A Transient Inferolateral ST-Segment Elevation on the Electrocardiogram
  Due to an Iatrogenic Left-Sided Pneumothorax After an Urgent Tracheostomy in a Patient
  with Metastatic Hypopharynx Cancer. The presence of ST-segment elevation on the
  electrocardiogram alerts physicians in patients with chest pain. Emergency coronary
  angiography is usually performed in these patients. However, there are many conditions
  that cause ST-segment elevation on the electrocardiogram, such as pericarditis,
  hyperkalemia, Brugada syndrome, hypothermia, and early repolarization. Pneumothorax
  is a rare complication of tracheostomy and its symptoms are sudden chest pain and
  dyspnea. Also, it has been known that pneumothorax may cause ST-segment changes
  on the electrocardiogram. We presented a transient inferolateral ST-segment elevation
  on the electrocardiogram due to an iatrogenic left-sided pneumothorax after an urgent
  tracheostomy in a patient with metastatic hypopharynx cancer and normal coronary
  angiogram.
