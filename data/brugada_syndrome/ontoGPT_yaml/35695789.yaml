input_text: 'Fever following Covid-19 vaccination in subjects with Brugada syndrome:
  Incidence and management. BACKGROUND: Fever is a potential side effect of the Covid-19
  vaccination. Patients with Brugada syndrome (BrS) have an increased risk of life-threatening
  arrhythmias when experiencing fever. Prompt treatment with antipyretic drugs is
  suggested in these patients. AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the incidence and management
  of fever within 48 h from Covid-19 vaccination among BrS patients. METHODS: One
  hundred sixty-three consecutive patients were enrolled in a prospective registry
  involving five European hospitals with a dedicated inherited disease ambulatory.
  RESULTS: The mean age was 50 +- 14 years and 121 (75%) patients were male. Prevalence
  of Brugada electrocardiogram (ECG) pattern type-1, -2, and -3 was 32%, 44%, and
  24%, respectively. Twenty-eight (17%) patients had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator
  (ICD). Fever occurred in 32 (19%) BrS patients after 16 +- 10 h from vaccination,
  with a peak of body temperature of 37.9  +- 0.5 . Patients with fever were younger
  (39 +- 13 vs. 48 +- 13 years, p = .04). No additional differences in terms of sex
  and cardiovascular risk factors were found between patients with fever and not.
  Twenty-seven (84%) out of 32 patients experienced mild fever and five (16%) moderate
  fever. Pharmacological treatment with antipyretic drugs was required in 18 (56%)
  out of 32 patients and was associated with the resolution of symptoms. No patient
  required hospital admission and no arrhythmic episode was recorded in patients with
  ICD within 48 h after vaccination. No induced type 1 BrS ECG pattern and new ECG
  features were found among patients with moderate fever. CONCLUSION: Fever is a common
  side effect in BrS patients after the Covid-19 vaccination. Careful evaluation of
  body temperature and prompt treatment with antipyretic drugs may be needed.'
