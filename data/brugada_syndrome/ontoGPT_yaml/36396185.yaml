input_text: Advances in Ventricular Arrhythmia Ablation for Brugada Syndrome. Three
  decades have passed since the Brugada syndrome (BrS) clinical entity was introduced
  in the early 1990s. During the first 2 decades, treatment of patients with BrS was
  challenging because there were limited treatment options, and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator
  was the only choice for high-risk patients with BrS, that is, those who had aborted
  sudden cardiac death or had previous ventricular fibrillation episodes. In this
  article, the authors focus on these advances and how to treat patients with BrS
  with catheter ablation.
