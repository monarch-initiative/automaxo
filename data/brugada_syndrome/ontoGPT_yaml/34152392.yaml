input_text: "Epicardial origin of cardiac arrhythmias: clinical evidences and pathophysiology.
  Recent developments in imaging, mapping, and ablation techniques have shown that
  the epicardial region of the heart is a key player in the occurrence of ventricular
  arrhythmic events in several cardiac diseases, such as Brugada syndrome, arrhythmogenic
  cardiomyopathy, or dilated cardiomyopathy. At the atrial level as well, the epicardial
  region has emerged as an important determinant of the substrate of atrial fibrillation,
  pointing to common underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Alteration in the gradient
  of repolarization between myocardial layers favouring the occurrence of re-entry
  circuits has largely been described. The fibro-fatty infiltration of the subepicardium
  is another shared substrate between ventricular and atrial arrhythmias. Recent data
  have emphasized the role of the epicardial reactivation in the formation of this
  arrhythmogenic substrate. There are new evidences supporting this structural remodelling
  process to be regulated by the recruitment of epicardial progenitor cells that can
  differentiate into adipocytes or fibroblasts under various stimuli. In addition,
  immune-inflammatory processes can also contribute to fibrosis of the subepicardial
  layer. A better understanding of such 'electrical fragility' of the epicardial area
  will open perspectives for novel biomarkers and therapeutic strategies. In this
  review article, a pathophysiological scheme of epicardial-driven arrhythmias will
  be proposed."
