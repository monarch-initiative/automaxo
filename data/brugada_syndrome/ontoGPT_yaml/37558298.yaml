input_text: 'Novelties in Brugada Syndrome: Complex Genetics, Risk Stratification,
  and Catheter Ablation. Brugada syndrome (BrS) is an inherited arrhythmia syndrome
  with distinctive electrocardiographic abnormalities in the right precordial leads
  and predisposes to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death in otherwise
  healthy patients. Its complex genetic architecture and pathophysiological mechanism
  are not yet completely understood, and risk stratification remains challenging,
  particularly in patients at intermediate risk of arrhythmic events. Further understanding
  of its complex genetic architecture may help improving future risk stratification,
  and advances in management may contribute to alternatives to implantable cardioverter-defibrillators.
  Here, the authors review the latest insights and developments in BrS.'
