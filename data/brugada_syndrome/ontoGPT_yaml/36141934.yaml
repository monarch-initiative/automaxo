input_text: 'Subcutaneous Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators for the Prevention
  of Sudden Cardiac Death: Pediatric Single-Center Experience. BACKGROUND: The subcutaneous
  implantable cardioverter defibrillator (S-ICD) was developed as an alternative to
  the transvenous ICD, to prevent lead-related complications associated with the latter.
  The absence of intravascular or intracardiac components offers potential advantages
  to pediatric patients. AIMS: The aim of the study is to present an overview of our
  experience with S-ICDs in the pediatric center that, currently, has performed the
  largest number of implantations in children in Poland. METHODS: Retrospective analysis
  of data from medical history, qualification, implantation procedure, and S-ICD post-implantation
  observations in 11 pediatric patients were performed. RESULTS: S-ICDs were implanted
  in 11 patients, 8 boys and 3 girls, aged 12-17 years. The S-ICD was implanted for
  primary prevention in seven patients: four with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM),
  two with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and one with arrhythmogenic right ventricular
  cardiomyopathy (ARVC). It was implanted for secondary prevention in four patients:
  two with sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) in the course of idiopathic ventricular fibrillation
  (IVF), one with long QT syndrome (LQTS) after probable SCA, and one with Brugada
  syndrome after SCA. In all patients, the device was implanted intramuscularly. One
  patient did not have a defibrillation test performed due to the presence of an intracardiac
  thrombus. In one patient, during screening, it was decided to implant an electrode
  on the right side of the sternum. There were no early or late complications with
  any of the procedures. So far, no inadequate discharges have been observed. CONCLUSIONS:
  Our results prove the efficacy of the S-ICD treatment option along with technically
  simple surgery, which supports its further and more widespread application in children.'
