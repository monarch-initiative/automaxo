input_text: 'Subcutaneous versus transvenous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator
  among drug-induced type-1 ECG pattern Brugada syndrome: a propensity score matching
  analysis from IBRYD study. No real-world data are available about the complications
  rate in drug-induced type 1 Brugada Syndrome (BrS) patients with an implantable
  cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). Aim of our study is to compare the device-related
  complications, infections, and inappropriate therapies among drug-induced type 1
  BrS patients with transvenous- ICD (TV-ICD) versus subcutaneous-ICD (S-ICD). Data
  for this study were sourced from the IBRYD (Italian BRugada sYnDrome) registry which
  includes 619 drug-induced type-1 BrS patients followed at 20 Italian tertiary referral
  hospitals. For the present analysis, we selected 258 consecutive BrS patients implanted
  with ICD. 198 patients (76.7%) received a TV-ICD, while 60 a S-ICD (23.4%). And
  were followed-up for a median time of 84.3 [46.5-147] months. ICD inappropriate
  therapies were experienced by 16 patients (6.2%). 14 patients (7.1%) in the TVICD
  group and 2 patients (3.3%) in S-ICD group (log-rank P = 0.64). ICD-related complications
  occurred in 31 patients (12%); 29 (14.6%) in TV-ICD group and 2 (3.3%) in S-ICD
  group (log-rank P = 0.41). ICD-related infections occurred in 10 patients (3.88%);
  9 (4.5%) in TV-ICD group and 1 (1.8%) in S-ICD group (log-rank P = 0.80). After
  balancing for potential confounders using the propensity score matching technique,
  no differences were found in terms of clinical outcomes between the two groups.
  In a real-world setting of drug-induced type-1 BrS patients with ICD, no significant
  differences in inappropriate ICD therapies, device-related complications, and infections
  were shown among S-ICD vs TV-ICD. However, a reduction in lead-related complications
  was observed in the S-ICD group. In conclusion, our evidence suggests that S-ICD
  is at least non-inferior to TV-ICD in this population and may also reduce the risk
  of lead-related complications which can expose the patients to the necessity of
  lead extractions.'
