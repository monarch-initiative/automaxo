input_text: 'Aborted sudden cardiac death in patient with concealed Brugada syndrome
  early after skin tattoo. We report a case of 40-year-old healthy patient presented
  with aborted sudden cardiac death. Echocardiography and coronarography were normal.
  ECG showed minimal non-specific changes in right precordial leads. A concealed Brugada
  syndrome was considered. We performed a provocative ajmaline test with Brugada-specific
  lead placement in 2nd, 3rd and 4th intercostal spaces at both parasternal sides.
  The test has confirmed the supposed diagnose. Detailed history taking revealed that
  the patient underwent a calf tattoo procedure on the same day. In this case report,
  we describe a new mechanism in Brugada patients, possibly leading to sudden cardiac
  death. The skin tattoo procedure is in more than 7 % of cases accompanied with a
  "tattoo flu syndrome", manifesting with fever, headache and fatigue. The fever is
  well described as a provoking factor for malignant arrhythmias in Brugada patients.
  Thus, a simple and safe procedure like skin tattoo can potentially lead to death
  in concealed Brugada syndrome population (Fig. 7, Ref. 9). Keywords: adical gastrectomy,
  D2 lymph node dissection, neoadjuvant therapy.'
