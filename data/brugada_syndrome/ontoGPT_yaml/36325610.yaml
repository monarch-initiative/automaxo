input_text: COVID-19 Vaccination-Induced Ventricular Fibrillation in an Afebrile Patient
  With Brugada Syndrome. A 43-year-old man presented with cardiac arrest 2 days after
  the second coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination with an mRNA vaccine.
  Electrocardiograms showed ventricular fibrillation and type 1 Brugada pattern ST
  segment elevation. The patient reported having no symptoms, including febrile sensation.
  There were no known underlying cardiac diseases to explain such electrocardiographic
  abnormalities. ST segment elevation completely disappeared in two weeks. Although
  there were no genetic mutations or personal or family history typical of Brugada
  syndrome, flecainide administration induced type 1 Brugada pattern ST segment elevation.
  This case suggests that COVID-19 vaccination may induce cardiac ion channel dysfunction
  and cause life threatening ventricular arrhythmias in specific patients with Brugada
  syndrome.
