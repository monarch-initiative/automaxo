input_text: Transcranial direct current stimulation in patient with J wave syndrome
  and implantable cardioverter defibrillator. J wave syndrome is a spectrum of proarrhythmic
  disorders including Brugada syndrome and early repolarization syndrome (ERS), that
  are prone to ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death (SCD). In this case
  report we present a patient with ERS and aborted SCD complicated with cognitive
  impairment. We also investigated whether performing transcranial direct current
  stimulation to target his cognitive impairment, interfered with the function of
  his implantable cardioverter defibrillator.
