input_text: Precision Medicine and Cardiac Channelopathies:Human iPSCs take the lead.
  Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, usually
  involving young people. SCD remains a critical public health problem accounting
  for 185,000 - 450,000 deaths annually, representing around 7% to 18% of all deaths
  globally. As per evidence, ~2-54% of sudden unexpected deaths in people under the
  age of 35 years fail to show evidence of structural cardiac abnormalities at autopsy,
  making ion channelopathies the probable causes in such cases. The most generally
  recognized cardiac ion channelopathies with genetic testing are long QT syndrome
  (LQTS), Brugada syndrome (BrS), short QT syndrome (SQTS), and catecholaminergic
  polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). The substantial progress in understanding
  the genetics of ion channelopathies in the last two decades has obliged the early
  diagnosis and prevention of SCD to a certain extent. In this review, we examine
  some of the critical challenges and recent advancements in the identification, risk
  stratification, and clinical management of potentially fatal cardiac ion channel
  disorders. We highlight the application of precision medicine (PM) and artificial
  intelligence (AI) for comprehending the underlying genetic mechanisms, especially
  the role of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) based platforms to solve
  major intractable clinical problems associated with channelopathies.
