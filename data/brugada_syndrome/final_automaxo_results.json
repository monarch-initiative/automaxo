Catheter ablation is increasingly performed but a large study with long-term outcome data is lacking. We report the results of the multicenter, international BRAVO (Brugada Ablation of VF Substrate Ongoing Registry) for treatment of high-risk symptomatic BrS. METHODS: We enrolled 159 patients (median age 42 years; 156 male) with BrS and spontaneous VF in BRAVO; 43 (27%) of them had BrS and early repolarization pattern. All but 5 had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator for cardiac arrest (n=125) or syncope (n=34). A total of 140 (88%) had experienced numerous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks for spontaneous VF before ablation. All patients underwent a percutaneous epicardial substrate ablation with electroanatomical mapping except for 8 who underwent open-thoracotomy ablation. RESULTS: In all patients, VF/BrS substrates were recorded in the epicardial surface of the right ventricular outflow tract; 45 (29%) patients also had an arrhythmic substrate in the inferior right ventricular epicardium and 3 in the posterior left ventricular epicardium. After a single ablation procedure, 128 of 159 (81%) patients remained free of VF recurrence; this number increased to 153 (96%) after a repeated procedure (mean 1.2+-0.5 procedures; median=1), with a mean follow-up period of 48+-29 months from the last ablation. VF burden and frequency of shocks decreased significantly from 1.1+-2.1 per month before ablation to 0.003+-0.14 per month after the last ablation (P<0.0001). The Kaplan-Meier VF-free survival beyond 5 years after the last ablation was 95%. The only variable associated with a VF-free outcome in multivariable analysis was normalization of the type 1 Brugada ECG, both with and without sodium-channel blockade, after the ablation (hazard ratio, 0.078 [95% CI, 0.008 to 0.753]; P=0.0274). There were no arrhythmic or cardiac deaths. Complications included hemopericardium in 4 (2.5%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Ablation treatment is safe and highly effective in preventing VF recurrence in high-risk BrS.

SCN5A encodes cardiac sodium channel NaV1.5 and causes 25 to 30% of BrS cases. Here, we report generation of a knock-in (KI) mouse model of BrS (Scn5aG1746R/+). Heterozygous KI mice recapitulated some of the clinical features of BrS, including an ST segment abnormality (a prominent J wave) on electrocardiograms and development of spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTs), seizures, and sudden death. VTs were caused by shortened cardiac action potential duration and late phase 3 early afterdepolarizations associated with reduced sodium current density (INa) and increased Kcnd3 and Cacna1c expression. We developed a gene therapy using adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) vector-mediated MOG1 delivery for up-regulation of MOG1, a chaperone that binds to NaV1.5 and traffics it to the cell surface. MOG1 was chosen for gene therapy because the large size of the SCN5A coding sequence (6048 base pairs) exceeds the packaging capacity of AAV vectors. AAV9-MOG1 gene therapy increased cell surface expression of NaV1.5 and ventricular INa, reversed up-regulation of Kcnd3 and Cacna1c expression, normalized cardiac action potential abnormalities, abolished J waves, and blocked VT in Scn5aG1746R/+ mice. Gene therapy also rescued the phenotypes of cardiac arrhythmias and contractile dysfunction in heterozygous humanized KI mice with SCN5A mutation p.D1275N. Using a small chaperone protein may have broad implications for targeting disease-causing genes exceeding the size capacity of AAV vectors.",

In inherited channelopathies, such as Brugada syndrome (BrS) and Long QT syndrome (LQTS), unfortunately, sudden cardiac death could be the first sign for patients affected by these syndromes. Several known factors are used to stratify the risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias, although none are determinative. The risk factors can be affected by adjusting lifestyle habits, such as a particular diet, impacting the risk of arrhythmogenic events and mortality. To date, the importance of understanding the relationship between diet and inherited channelopathies has been underrated. Therefore, we describe herein the effects of dietary factors on the development of arrhythmia in patients affected by BrS and LQTS. Modifying the diet might not be enough to fully prevent arrhythmias, but it can help lower the risk.",

The final (fifth) paper will deal with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. These arrhythmias represent a spectrum of disease ranging from common to relatively rare, with very different genetic and environmental causative factors, and with differing clinical manifestations that range from almost no consequences to lethality in childhood or adolescence if untreated. Accordingly, the emerging precision medicine approaches to these arrhythmias vary significantly, but several common themes include increased use of genetic testing, avoidance of triggers, and personalized risk stratification to guide the use of arrhythmia-specific therapies.",

SCN5A encodes cardiac sodium channel NaV1.5 and causes 25 to 30% of BrS cases. Here, we report generation of a knock-in (KI) mouse model of BrS (Scn5aG1746R/+). Heterozygous KI mice recapitulated some of the clinical features of BrS, including an ST segment abnormality (a prominent J wave) on electrocardiograms and development of spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTs), seizures, and sudden death. VTs were caused by shortened cardiac action potential duration and late phase 3 early afterdepolarizations associated with reduced sodium current density (INa) and increased Kcnd3 and Cacna1c expression.

Catheter ablation is increasingly performed but a large study with long-term outcome data is lacking. We report the results of the multicenter, international BRAVO (Brugada Ablation of VF Substrate Ongoing Registry) for treatment of high-risk symptomatic BrS. METHODS: We enrolled 159 patients (median age 42 years; 156 male) with BrS and spontaneous VF in BRAVO; 43 (27%) of them had BrS and early repolarization pattern. All but 5 had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator for cardiac arrest (n=125) or syncope (n=34). A total of 140 (88%) had experienced numerous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks for spontaneous VF before ablation. All patients underwent a percutaneous epicardial substrate ablation with electroanatomical mapping except for 8 who underwent open-thoracotomy ablation. RESULTS: In all patients, VF/BrS substrates were recorded in the epicardial surface of the right ventricular outflow tract; 45 (29%) patients also had an arrhythmic substrate in the inferior right ventricular epicardium and 3 in the posterior left ventricular epicardium. After a single ablation procedure, 128 of 159 (81%) patients remained free of VF recurrence; this number increased to 153 (96%) after a repeated procedure (mean 1.2+-0.5 procedures; median=1), with a mean follow-up period of 48+-29 months from the last ablation. VF burden and frequency of shocks decreased significantly from 1.1+-2.1 per month before ablation to 0.003+-0.14 per month after the last ablation (P<0.0001). The Kaplan-Meier VF-free survival beyond 5 years after the last ablation was 95%. The only variable associated with a VF-free outcome in multivariable analysis was normalization of the type 1 Brugada ECG, both with and without sodium-channel blockade, after the ablation (hazard ratio, 0.078 [95% CI, 0.008 to 0.753]; P=0.0274). There were no arrhythmic or cardiac deaths. Complications included hemopericardium in 4 (2.5%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Ablation treatment is safe and highly effective in preventing VF recurrence in high-risk BrS. Prospective studies are needed to determine whether it can be an alternative treatment to implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation for selected patients with BrS.

SCD remains a critical public health problem accounting for 185,000 - 450,000 deaths annually, representing around 7% to 18% of all deaths globally. As per evidence, ~2-54% of sudden unexpected deaths in people under the age of 35 years fail to show evidence of structural cardiac abnormalities at autopsy, making ion channelopathies the probable causes in such cases. The most generally recognized cardiac ion channelopathies with genetic testing are long QT syndrome (LQTS), Brugada syndrome (BrS), short QT syndrome (SQTS), and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). The substantial progress in understanding the genetics of ion channelopathies in the last two decades has obliged the early diagnosis and prevention of SCD to a certain extent. In this review, we examine some of the critical challenges and recent advancements in the identification, risk stratification, and clinical management of potentially fatal cardiac ion channel disorders. We highlight the application of precision medicine (PM) and artificial intelligence (AI) for comprehending the underlying genetic mechanisms, especially the role of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) based platforms to solve major intractable clinical problems associated with channelopathies.",

Methods and Results We developed an individual-level simulation comprising 2 000 000 average-risk individuals with asymptomatic BrS and spontaneous type I electrocardiographic pattern. We compared (1) observation, (2) electrophysiologic study (EPS)-guided implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), and (3) upfront ICD, each using either subcutaneous or transvenous ICD, resulting in 6 strategies tested. The primary outcome was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), with cardiac deaths (arrest or procedural-related) as a secondary outcome. We varied BrS diagnosis age and underlying arrest rate. We assessed cost-effectiveness at $100 000/QALY. Compared with observation, EPS-guided subcutaneous ICD resulted in 0.35 QALY gain/individual and 4130 cardiac deaths avoided/100 000 individuals, and EPS-guided transvenous ICD resulted in 0.26 QALY gain and 3390 cardiac deaths avoided. Compared with observation, upfront ICD reduced cardiac deaths by a greater margin (subcutaneous ICD, 8950; transvenous ICD, 6050), but only subcutaneous ICD improved QALYs (subcutaneous ICD, 0.25 QALY gain; transvenous ICD, 0.01 QALY loss), and complications were higher. ICD-based strategies were more effective at younger ages and higher arrest rates (eg, using subcutaneous devices, upfront ICD was the most effective strategy at ages 20-39.4 years and arrest rates >1.37%/year; EPS-guided ICD was the most effective strategy at ages 39.5-51.3 years and arrest rates 0.47%-1.37%/year, and observation was the most effective strategy at ages >51.3 years and arrest rates <0.47%/year). EPS-guided subcutaneous ICD was cost-effective ($80 508/QALY). Conclusions Device-based approaches (with or without EPS risk stratification) can be more effective than observation among selected patients with asymptomatic BrS. BrS management should be tailored to patient characteristics.",

                    "abstract": "Digital precision medicine is gaining increasing importance in rhythmology, especially in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. This trend is driven by the advancing digitization in healthcare and the availability of large amounts of data from various sources such as electrocardiograms (ECGs), implants like pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), as well as wearables like smartwatches and fitness trackers. Through the analysis of this data, physicians can develop more precise and individualized diagnoses and treatment strategies for patients with cardiac arrhythmias. For example, subtle changes in ECGs can be identified, indicating potentially dangerous arrhythmias. Genetic analyses and resulting large datasets also play an increasingly significant role, especially in hereditary ion channel disorders such as long QT syndrome (LQTS) and Brugada syndrome (BrS), as well as in lone atrial fibrillation (AF). Precision medicine enables the development of individualized treatment approaches tailored to the specific needs and risk factors of each patient. This can help improve screening strategies, reduce adverse events, and ultimately enhance the quality of life for patients. Technological advancements such as big data, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and predictive analytics play a crucial role in predicting the risk of arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. These concepts enable more precise and personalized predictions and support physicians in the treatment and monitoring of their patients.",

                    "abstract": "Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, usually involving young people. SCD remains a critical public health problem accounting for 185,000 - 450,000 deaths annually, representing around 7% to 18% of all deaths globally. As per evidence, ~2-54% of sudden unexpected deaths in people under the age of 35 years fail to show evidence of structural cardiac abnormalities at autopsy, making ion channelopathies the probable causes in such cases. The most generally recognized cardiac ion channelopathies with genetic testing are long QT syndrome (LQTS), Brugada syndrome (BrS), short QT syndrome (SQTS), and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). The substantial progress in understanding the genetics of ion channelopathies in the last two decades has obliged the early diagnosis and prevention of SCD to a certain extent. In this review, we examine some of the critical challenges and recent advancements in the identification, risk stratification, and clinical management of potentially fatal cardiac ion channel disorders. We highlight the application of precision medicine (PM) and artificial intelligence (AI) for comprehending the underlying genetic mechanisms, especially the role of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) based platforms to solve major intractable clinical problems associated with channelopathies.",

Methods and Results We developed an individual-level simulation comprising 2 000 000 average-risk individuals with asymptomatic BrS and spontaneous type I electrocardiographic pattern. We compared (1) observation, (2) electrophysiologic study (EPS)-guided implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), and (3) upfront ICD, each using either subcutaneous or transvenous ICD, resulting in 6 strategies tested. The primary outcome was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), with cardiac deaths (arrest or procedural-related) as a secondary outcome. We varied BrS diagnosis age and underlying arrest rate. We assessed cost-effectiveness at $100 000/QALY. Compared with observation, EPS-guided subcutaneous ICD resulted in 0.35 QALY gain/individual and 4130 cardiac deaths avoided/100 000 individuals, and EPS-guided transvenous ICD resulted in 0.26 QALY gain and 3390 cardiac deaths avoided. Compared with observation, upfront ICD reduced cardiac deaths by a greater margin (subcutaneous ICD, 8950; transvenous ICD, 6050), but only subcutaneous ICD improved QALYs (subcutaneous ICD, 0.25 QALY gain; transvenous ICD, 0.01 QALY loss), and complications were higher. ICD-based strategies were more effective at younger ages and higher arrest rates (eg, using subcutaneous devices, upfront ICD was the most effective strategy at ages 20-39.4 years and arrest rates >1.37%/year; EPS-guided ICD was the most effective strategy at ages 39.5-51.3 years and arrest rates 0.47%-1.37%/year, and observation was the most effective strategy at ages >51.3 years and arrest rates <0.47%/year). EPS-guided subcutaneous ICD was cost-effective ($80 508/QALY). Conclusions Device-based approaches (with or without EPS risk stratification) can be more effective than observation among selected patients with asymptomatic BrS. BrS management should be tailored to patient characteristics.",

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the anatomic obstacles that prevent ablation of epicardial abnormal potentials (EAPs) in patients with Brugada syndrome (BrS) and to investigate the feasibility of EAP elimination by endocardial right ventricular (RV) ablation. METHODS: This study included 16 BrS patients with previous ventricular fibrillation (VF), including 10 with an electrical storm. Data from multidetector computed tomography were assessed, and the proximity of the CA and EF was correlated with EAPs. RESULTS: EAPs were present in the epicardial RV outflow tract and RV inferior wall in all patients and 12 patients (75%), respectively. These EAPs were present within 5 mm of the main body and branches of the right CA in 14 patients (87.5%). However, only 1.4% +- 2.9% of the EAP area was covered with thick EF (>=8 mm). Partial EAP elimination by endocardial RV ablation was feasible in all 10 patients, with 53.3% successful endocardial RV radiofrequency applications for eliminating EAPs. After the procedure, VF remained inducible in 37.5% of the patients. During the 25.1 +- 29.1 months of follow-up, no patients experienced an electrical storm, and VF burden significantly decreased (median VF episodes before and after ablation: 7 and 0, respectively). CONCLUSION: EAPs are near the CA in most BrS patients, thereby requiring caution during epicardial ablation, whereas EF is less of an issue. Endocardial ablation is feasible to eliminate some EAPs and may be combined with epicardial ablation.",

SCN5A encodes cardiac sodium channel NaV1.5 and causes 25 to 30% of BrS cases. Here, we report generation of a knock-in (KI) mouse model of BrS (Scn5aG1746R/+). Heterozygous KI mice recapitulated some of the clinical features of BrS, including an ST segment abnormality (a prominent J wave) on electrocardiograms and development of spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTs), seizures, and sudden death. VTs were caused by shortened cardiac action potential duration and late phase 3 early afterdepolarizations associated with reduced sodium current density (INa) and increased Kcnd3 and Cacna1c expression. We developed a gene therapy using adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) vector-mediated MOG1 delivery for up-regulation of MOG1, a chaperone that binds to NaV1.5 and traffics it to the cell surface. MOG1 was chosen for gene therapy because the large size of the SCN5A coding sequence (6048 base pairs) exceeds the packaging capacity of AAV vectors. AAV9-MOG1 gene therapy increased cell surface expression of NaV1.5 and ventricular INa, reversed up-regulation of Kcnd3 and Cacna1c expression, normalized cardiac action potential abnormalities, abolished J waves, and blocked VT in Scn5aG1746R/+ mice. Gene therapy also rescued the phenotypes of cardiac arrhythmias and contractile dysfunction in heterozygous humanized KI mice with SCN5A mutation p.D1275N. Using a small chaperone protein may have broad implications for targeting disease-causing genes exceeding the size capacity of AAV vectors.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Treatment options for high-risk Brugada syndrome (BrS) with recurrent ventricular fibrillation (VF) are limited. Catheter ablation is increasingly performed but a large study with long-term outcome data is lacking. We report the results of the multicenter, international BRAVO (Brugada Ablation of VF Substrate Ongoing Registry) for treatment of high-risk symptomatic BrS. METHODS: We enrolled 159 patients (median age 42 years; 156 male) with BrS and spontaneous VF in BRAVO; 43 (27%) of them had BrS and early repolarization pattern. All but 5 had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator for cardiac arrest (n=125) or syncope (n=34). A total of 140 (88%) had experienced numerous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks for spontaneous VF before ablation. All patients underwent a percutaneous epicardial substrate ablation with electroanatomical mapping except for 8 who underwent open-thoracotomy ablation. RESULTS: In all patients, VF/BrS substrates were recorded in the epicardial surface of the right ventricular outflow tract; 45 (29%) patients also had an arrhythmic substrate in the inferior right ventricular epicardium and 3 in the posterior left ventricular epicardium. After a single ablation procedure, 128 of 159 (81%) patients remained free of VF recurrence; this number increased to 153 (96%) after a repeated procedure (mean 1.2+-0.5 procedures; median=1), with a mean follow-up period of 48+-29 months from the last ablation. VF burden and frequency of shocks decreased significantly from 1.1+-2.1 per month before ablation to 0.003+-0.14 per month after the last ablation (P<0.0001). The Kaplan-Meier VF-free survival beyond 5 years after the last ablation was 95%. The only variable associated with a VF-free outcome in multivariable analysis was normalization of the type 1 Brugada ECG, both with and without sodium-channel blockade, after the ablation (hazard ratio, 0.078 [95% CI, 0.008 to 0.753]; P=0.0274). There were no arrhythmic or cardiac deaths. Complications included hemopericardium in 4 (2.5%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Ablation treatment is safe and highly effective in preventing VF recurrence in high-risk BrS. Prospective studies are needed to determine whether it can be an alternative treatment to implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation for selected patients with BrS.

Data for this study were sourced from the IBRYD (Italian BRugada sYnDrome) registry which includes 619 drug-induced type-1 BrS patients followed at 20 Italian tertiary referral hospitals. For the present analysis, we selected 258 consecutive BrS patients implanted with ICD. 198 patients (76.7%) received a TV-ICD, while 60 a S-ICD (23.4%). And were followed-up for a median time of 84.3 [46.5-147] months. ICD inappropriate therapies were experienced by 16 patients (6.2%). 14 patients (7.1%) in the TVICD group and 2 patients (3.3%) in S-ICD group (log-rank P = 0.64). ICD-related complications occurred in 31 patients (12%); 29 (14.6%) in TV-ICD group and 2 (3.3%) in S-ICD group (log-rank P = 0.41). ICD-related infections occurred in 10 patients (3.88%); 9 (4.5%) in TV-ICD group and 1 (1.8%) in S-ICD group (log-rank P = 0.80). After balancing for potential confounders using the propensity score matching technique, no differences were found in terms of clinical outcomes between the two groups. In a real-world setting of drug-induced type-1 BrS patients with ICD, no significant differences in inappropriate ICD therapies, device-related complications, and infections were shown among S-ICD vs TV-ICD. However, a reduction in lead-related complications was observed in the S-ICD group. In conclusion, our evidence suggests that S-ICD is at least non-inferior to TV-ICD in this population and may also reduce the risk of lead-related complications which can expose the patients to the necessity of lead extractions.",

                    "abstract": "Brugada syndrome (BrS) is a fatal arrhythmia that causes an estimated 4% of all sudden death in high-incidence areas. SCN5A encodes cardiac sodium channel NaV1.5 and causes 25 to 30% of BrS cases. Here, we report generation of a knock-in (KI) mouse model of BrS (Scn5aG1746R/+). Heterozygous KI mice recapitulated some of the clinical features of BrS, including an ST segment abnormality (a prominent J wave) on electrocardiograms and development of spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTs), seizures, and sudden death. VTs were caused by shortened cardiac action potential duration and late phase 3 early afterdepolarizations associated with reduced sodium current density (INa) and increased Kcnd3 and Cacna1c expression. We developed a gene therapy using adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) vector-mediated MOG1 delivery for up-regulation of MOG1, a chaperone that binds to NaV1.5 and traffics it to the cell surface. MOG1 was chosen for gene therapy because the large size of the SCN5A coding sequence (6048 base pairs) exceeds the packaging capacity of AAV vectors. AAV9-MOG1 gene therapy increased cell surface expression of NaV1.5 and ventricular INa, reversed up-regulation of Kcnd3 and Cacna1c expression, normalized cardiac action potential abnormalities, abolished J waves, and blocked VT in Scn5aG1746R/+ mice. Gene therapy also rescued the phenotypes of cardiac arrhythmias and contractile dysfunction in heterozygous humanized KI mice with SCN5A mutation p.D1275N.

This trend is driven by the advancing digitization in healthcare and the availability of large amounts of data from various sources such as electrocardiograms (ECGs), implants like pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), as well as wearables like smartwatches and fitness trackers. Through the analysis of this data, physicians can develop more precise and individualized diagnoses and treatment strategies for patients with cardiac arrhythmias. For example, subtle changes in ECGs can be identified, indicating potentially dangerous arrhythmias. Genetic analyses and resulting large datasets also play an increasingly significant role, especially in hereditary ion channel disorders such as long QT syndrome (LQTS) and Brugada syndrome (BrS), as well as in lone atrial fibrillation (AF). Precision medicine enables the development of individualized treatment approaches tailored to the specific needs and risk factors of each patient. This can help improve screening strategies, reduce adverse events, and ultimately enhance the quality of life for patients. Technological advancements such as big data, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and predictive analytics play a crucial role in predicting the risk of arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. These concepts enable more precise and personalized predictions and support physicians in the treatment and monitoring of their patients.",

In inherited channelopathies, such as Brugada syndrome (BrS) and Long QT syndrome (LQTS), unfortunately, sudden cardiac death could be the first sign for patients affected by these syndromes. Several known factors are used to stratify the risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias, although none are determinative. The risk factors can be affected by adjusting lifestyle habits, such as a particular diet, impacting the risk of arrhythmogenic events and mortality. To date, the importance of understanding the relationship between diet and inherited channelopathies has been underrated. Therefore, we describe herein the effects of dietary factors on the development of arrhythmia in patients affected by BrS and LQTS. Modifying the diet might not be enough to fully prevent arrhythmias, but it can help lower the risk.",

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the anatomic obstacles that prevent ablation of epicardial abnormal potentials (EAPs) in patients with Brugada syndrome (BrS) and to investigate the feasibility of EAP elimination by endocardial right ventricular (RV) ablation. METHODS: This study included 16 BrS patients with previous ventricular fibrillation (VF), including 10 with an electrical storm. Data from multidetector computed tomography were assessed, and the proximity of the CA and EF was correlated with EAPs. RESULTS: EAPs were present in the epicardial RV outflow tract and RV inferior wall in all patients and 12 patients (75%), respectively. These EAPs were present within 5 mm of the main body and branches of the right CA in 14 patients (87.5%). However, only 1.4% +- 2.9% of the EAP area was covered with thick EF (>=8 mm). Partial EAP elimination by endocardial RV ablation was feasible in all 10 patients, with 53.3% successful endocardial RV radiofrequency applications for eliminating EAPs. After the procedure, VF remained inducible in 37.5% of the patients. During the 25.1 +- 29.1 months of follow-up, no patients experienced an electrical storm, and VF burden significantly decreased (median VF episodes before and after ablation: 7 and 0, respectively). CONCLUSION: EAPs are near the CA in most BrS patients, thereby requiring caution during epicardial ablation, whereas EF is less of an issue. Endocardial ablation is feasible to eliminate some EAPs and may be combined with epicardial ablation.",

Methods and Results We developed an individual-level simulation comprising 2 000 000 average-risk individuals with asymptomatic BrS and spontaneous type I electrocardiographic pattern. We compared (1) observation, (2) electrophysiologic study (EPS)-guided implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), and (3) upfront ICD, each using either subcutaneous or transvenous ICD, resulting in 6 strategies tested. The primary outcome was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), with cardiac deaths (arrest or procedural-related) as a secondary outcome. We varied BrS diagnosis age and underlying arrest rate. We assessed cost-effectiveness at $100 000/QALY. Compared with observation, EPS-guided subcutaneous ICD resulted in 0.35 QALY gain/individual and 4130 cardiac deaths avoided/100 000 individuals, and EPS-guided transvenous ICD resulted in 0.26 QALY gain and 3390 cardiac deaths avoided. Compared with observation, upfront ICD reduced cardiac deaths by a greater margin (subcutaneous ICD, 8950; transvenous ICD, 6050), but only subcutaneous ICD improved QALYs (subcutaneous ICD, 0.25 QALY gain; transvenous ICD, 0.01 QALY loss), and complications were higher. ICD-based strategies were more effective at younger ages and higher arrest rates (eg, using subcutaneous devices, upfront ICD was the most effective strategy at ages 20-39.4 years and arrest rates >1.37%/year; EPS-guided ICD was the most effective strategy at ages 39.5-51.3 years and arrest rates 0.47%-1.37%/year, and observation was the most effective strategy at ages >51.3 years and arrest rates <0.47%/year). EPS-guided subcutaneous ICD was cost-effective ($80 508/QALY). Conclusions Device-based approaches (with or without EPS risk stratification) can be more effective than observation among selected patients with asymptomatic BrS. BrS management should be tailored to patient characteristics.",

Catheter ablation is increasingly performed but a large study with long-term outcome data is lacking. We report the results of the multicenter, international BRAVO (Brugada Ablation of VF Substrate Ongoing Registry) for treatment of high-risk symptomatic BrS. METHODS: We enrolled 159 patients (median age 42 years; 156 male) with BrS and spontaneous VF in BRAVO; 43 (27%) of them had BrS and early repolarization pattern. All but 5 had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator for cardiac arrest (n=125) or syncope (n=34). A total of 140 (88%) had experienced numerous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks for spontaneous VF before ablation. All patients underwent a percutaneous epicardial substrate ablation with electroanatomical mapping except for 8 who underwent open-thoracotomy ablation. RESULTS: In all patients, VF/BrS substrates were recorded in the epicardial surface of the right ventricular outflow tract; 45 (29%) patients also had an arrhythmic substrate in the inferior right ventricular epicardium and 3 in the posterior left ventricular epicardium. After a single ablation procedure, 128 of 159 (81%) patients remained free of VF recurrence; this number increased to 153 (96%) after a repeated procedure (mean 1.2+-0.5 procedures; median=1), with a mean follow-up period of 48+-29 months from the last ablation. VF burden and frequency of shocks decreased significantly from 1.1+-2.1 per month before ablation to 0.003+-0.14 per month after the last ablation (P<0.0001). The Kaplan-Meier VF-free survival beyond 5 years after the last ablation was 95%. The only variable associated with a VF-free outcome in multivariable analysis was normalization of the type 1 Brugada ECG, both with and without sodium-channel blockade, after the ablation (hazard ratio, 0.078 [95% CI, 0.008 to 0.753]; P=0.0274). There were no arrhythmic or cardiac deaths. Complications included hemopericardium in 4 (2.5%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Ablation treatment is safe and highly effective in preventing VF recurrence in high-risk BrS.

For the remaining 2 papers, we focus on precision medicine in the context of arrhythmias. Specifically, in this fourth paper we focus on long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, and atrial fibrillation. The final (fifth) paper will deal with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. These arrhythmias represent a spectrum of disease ranging from common to relatively rare, with very different genetic and environmental causative factors, and with differing clinical manifestations that range from almost no consequences to lethality in childhood or adolescence if untreated. Accordingly, the emerging precision medicine approaches to these arrhythmias vary significantly, but several common themes include increased use of genetic testing, avoidance of triggers, and personalized risk stratification to guide the use of arrhythmia-specific therapies.",

SCD remains a critical public health problem accounting for 185,000 - 450,000 deaths annually, representing around 7% to 18% of all deaths globally. As per evidence, ~2-54% of sudden unexpected deaths in people under the age of 35 years fail to show evidence of structural cardiac abnormalities at autopsy, making ion channelopathies the probable causes in such cases. The most generally recognized cardiac ion channelopathies with genetic testing are long QT syndrome (LQTS), Brugada syndrome (BrS), short QT syndrome (SQTS), and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). The substantial progress in understanding the genetics of ion channelopathies in the last two decades has obliged the early diagnosis and prevention of SCD to a certain extent. In this review, we examine some of the critical challenges and recent advancements in the identification, risk stratification, and clinical management of potentially fatal cardiac ion channel disorders. We highlight the application of precision medicine (PM) and artificial intelligence (AI) for comprehending the underlying genetic mechanisms, especially the role of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) based platforms to solve major intractable clinical problems associated with channelopathies.",

We performed a provocative ajmaline test with Brugada-specific lead placement in 2nd, 3rd and 4th intercostal spaces at both parasternal sides. The test has confirmed the supposed diagnose. Detailed history taking revealed that the patient underwent a calf tattoo procedure on the same day. In this case report, we describe a new mechanism in Brugada patients, possibly leading to sudden cardiac death. The skin tattoo procedure is in more than 7 % of cases accompanied with a \"tattoo flu syndrome\", manifesting with fever, headache and fatigue. The fever is well described as a provoking factor for malignant arrhythmias in Brugada patients. Thus, a simple and safe procedure like skin tattoo can potentially lead to death in concealed Brugada syndrome population (Fig. 7, Ref. 9).

Aim of our study is to compare the device-related complications, infections, and inappropriate therapies among drug-induced type 1 BrS patients with transvenous- ICD (TV-ICD) versus subcutaneous-ICD (S-ICD). Data for this study were sourced from the IBRYD (Italian BRugada sYnDrome) registry which includes 619 drug-induced type-1 BrS patients followed at 20 Italian tertiary referral hospitals. For the present analysis, we selected 258 consecutive BrS patients implanted with ICD. 198 patients (76.7%) received a TV-ICD, while 60 a S-ICD (23.4%). And were followed-up for a median time of 84.3 [46.5-147] months. ICD inappropriate therapies were experienced by 16 patients (6.2%). 14 patients (7.1%) in the TVICD group and 2 patients (3.3%) in S-ICD group (log-rank P = 0.64). ICD-related complications occurred in 31 patients (12%); 29 (14.6%) in TV-ICD group and 2 (3.3%) in S-ICD group (log-rank P = 0.41). ICD-related infections occurred in 10 patients (3.88%); 9 (4.5%) in TV-ICD group and 1 (1.8%) in S-ICD group (log-rank P = 0.80). After balancing for potential confounders using the propensity score matching technique, no differences were found in terms of clinical outcomes between the two groups. In a real-world setting of drug-induced type-1 BrS patients with ICD, no significant differences in inappropriate ICD therapies, device-related complications, and infections were shown among S-ICD vs TV-ICD. However, a reduction in lead-related complications was observed in the S-ICD group. In conclusion, our evidence suggests that S-ICD is at least non-inferior to TV-ICD in this population and may also reduce the risk of lead-related complications which can expose the patients to the necessity of lead extractions.",

SCN5A encodes cardiac sodium channel NaV1.5 and causes 25 to 30% of BrS cases. Here, we report generation of a knock-in (KI) mouse model of BrS (Scn5aG1746R/+). Heterozygous KI mice recapitulated some of the clinical features of BrS, including an ST segment abnormality (a prominent J wave) on electrocardiograms and development of spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTs), seizures, and sudden death. VTs were caused by shortened cardiac action potential duration and late phase 3 early afterdepolarizations associated with reduced sodium current density (INa) and increased Kcnd3 and Cacna1c expression. We developed a gene therapy using adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) vector-mediated MOG1 delivery for up-regulation of MOG1, a chaperone that binds to NaV1.5 and traffics it to the cell surface. MOG1 was chosen for gene therapy because the large size of the SCN5A coding sequence (6048 base pairs) exceeds the packaging capacity of AAV vectors. AAV9-MOG1 gene therapy increased cell surface expression of NaV1.5 and ventricular INa, reversed up-regulation of Kcnd3 and Cacna1c expression, normalized cardiac action potential abnormalities, abolished J waves, and blocked VT in Scn5aG1746R/+ mice. Gene therapy also rescued the phenotypes of cardiac arrhythmias and contractile dysfunction in heterozygous humanized KI mice with SCN5A mutation p.D1275N. Using a small chaperone protein may have broad implications for targeting disease-causing genes exceeding the size capacity of AAV vectors.",

SCD remains a critical public health problem accounting for 185,000 - 450,000 deaths annually, representing around 7% to 18% of all deaths globally. As per evidence, ~2-54% of sudden unexpected deaths in people under the age of 35 years fail to show evidence of structural cardiac abnormalities at autopsy, making ion channelopathies the probable causes in such cases. The most generally recognized cardiac ion channelopathies with genetic testing are long QT syndrome (LQTS), Brugada syndrome (BrS), short QT syndrome (SQTS), and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). The substantial progress in understanding the genetics of ion channelopathies in the last two decades has obliged the early diagnosis and prevention of SCD to a certain extent. In this review, we examine some of the critical challenges and recent advancements in the identification, risk stratification, and clinical management of potentially fatal cardiac ion channel disorders. We highlight the application of precision medicine (PM) and artificial intelligence (AI) for comprehending the underlying genetic mechanisms, especially the role of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) based platforms to solve major intractable clinical problems associated with channelopathies.",

Methods and Results We developed an individual-level simulation comprising 2 000 000 average-risk individuals with asymptomatic BrS and spontaneous type I electrocardiographic pattern. We compared (1) observation, (2) electrophysiologic study (EPS)-guided implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), and (3) upfront ICD, each using either subcutaneous or transvenous ICD, resulting in 6 strategies tested. The primary outcome was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), with cardiac deaths (arrest or procedural-related) as a secondary outcome. We varied BrS diagnosis age and underlying arrest rate. We assessed cost-effectiveness at $100 000/QALY. Compared with observation, EPS-guided subcutaneous ICD resulted in 0.35 QALY gain/individual and 4130 cardiac deaths avoided/100 000 individuals, and EPS-guided transvenous ICD resulted in 0.26 QALY gain and 3390 cardiac deaths avoided. Compared with observation, upfront ICD reduced cardiac deaths by a greater margin (subcutaneous ICD, 8950; transvenous ICD, 6050), but only subcutaneous ICD improved QALYs (subcutaneous ICD, 0.25 QALY gain; transvenous ICD, 0.01 QALY loss), and complications were higher. ICD-based strategies were more effective at younger ages and higher arrest rates (eg, using subcutaneous devices, upfront ICD was the most effective strategy at ages 20-39.4 years and arrest rates >1.37%/year; EPS-guided ICD was the most effective strategy at ages 39.5-51.3 years and arrest rates 0.47%-1.37%/year, and observation was the most effective strategy at ages >51.3 years and arrest rates <0.47%/year). EPS-guided subcutaneous ICD was cost-effective ($80 508/QALY). Conclusions Device-based approaches (with or without EPS risk stratification) can be more effective than observation among selected patients with asymptomatic BrS. BrS management should be tailored to patient characteristics.",

The final (fifth) paper will deal with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. These arrhythmias represent a spectrum of disease ranging from common to relatively rare, with very different genetic and environmental causative factors, and with differing clinical manifestations that range from almost no consequences to lethality in childhood or adolescence if untreated.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fever is a potential side effect of the Covid-19 vaccination. Patients with Brugada syndrome (BrS) have an increased risk of life-threatening arrhythmias when experiencing fever. Prompt treatment with antipyretic drugs is suggested in these patients. AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the incidence and management of fever within 48 h from Covid-19 vaccination among BrS patients. METHODS: One hundred sixty-three consecutive patients were enrolled in a prospective registry involving five European hospitals with a dedicated inherited disease ambulatory. RESULTS: The mean age was 50 +- 14 years and 121 (75%) patients were male. Prevalence of Brugada electrocardiogram (ECG) pattern type-1, -2, and -3 was 32%, 44%, and 24%, respectively. Twenty-eight (17%) patients had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). Fever occurred in 32 (19%) BrS patients after 16 +- 10 h from vaccination, with a peak of body temperature of 37.9  +- 0.5 . Patients with fever were younger (39 +- 13 vs. 48 +- 13 years, p = .04). No additional differences in terms of sex and cardiovascular risk factors were found between patients with fever and not. Twenty-seven (84%) out of 32 patients experienced mild fever and five (16%) moderate fever. Pharmacological treatment with antipyretic drugs was required in 18 (56%) out of 32 patients and was associated with the resolution of symptoms. No patient required hospital admission and no arrhythmic episode was recorded in patients with ICD within 48 h after vaccination. No induced type 1 BrS ECG pattern and new ECG features were found among patients with moderate fever. CONCLUSION: Fever is a common side effect in BrS patients after the Covid-19 vaccination. Careful evaluation of body temperature and prompt treatment with antipyretic drugs may be needed.",

For the remaining 2 papers, we focus on precision medicine in the context of arrhythmias. Specifically, in this fourth paper we focus on long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, and atrial fibrillation. The final (fifth) paper will deal with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. These arrhythmias represent a spectrum of disease ranging from common to relatively rare, with very different genetic and environmental causative factors, and with differing clinical manifestations that range from almost no consequences to lethality in childhood or adolescence if untreated. Accordingly, the emerging precision medicine approaches to these arrhythmias vary significantly, but several common themes include increased use of genetic testing, avoidance of triggers, and personalized risk stratification to guide the use of arrhythmia-specific therapies.",

                    "abstract": "A 43-year-old man presented with cardiac arrest 2 days after the second coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination with an mRNA vaccine. Electrocardiograms showed ventricular fibrillation and type 1 Brugada pattern ST segment elevation. The patient reported having no symptoms, including febrile sensation. There were no known underlying cardiac diseases to explain such electrocardiographic abnormalities. ST segment elevation completely disappeared in two weeks. Although there were no genetic mutations or personal or family history typical of Brugada syndrome, flecainide administration induced type 1 Brugada pattern ST segment elevation. This case suggests that COVID-19 vaccination may induce cardiac ion channel dysfunction and cause life threatening ventricular arrhythmias in specific patients with Brugada syndrome.",
