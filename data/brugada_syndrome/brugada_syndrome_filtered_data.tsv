35030269	Transcranial direct current stimulation in patient with J wave syndrome and implantable cardioverter defibrillator.	J wave syndrome is a spectrum of proarrhythmic disorders including Brugada syndrome and early repolarization syndrome (ERS), that are prone to ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death (SCD). In this case report we present a patient with ERS and aborted SCD complicated with cognitive impairment. We also investigated whether performing transcranial direct current stimulation to target his cognitive impairment, interfered with the function of his implantable cardioverter defibrillator.
36689292	A Transient Inferolateral ST-Segment Elevation on the Electrocardiogram Due to an Iatrogenic Left-Sided Pneumothorax After an Urgent Tracheostomy in a Patient with Metastatic Hypopharynx Cancer.	The presence of ST-segment elevation on the electrocardiogram alerts physicians in patients with chest pain. Emergency coronary angiography is usually performed in these patients. However, there are many conditions that cause ST-segment elevation on the electrocardiogram, such as pericarditis, hyperkalemia, Brugada syndrome, hypothermia, and early repolarization. Pneumothorax is a rare complication of tracheostomy and its symptoms are sudden chest pain and dyspnea. Also, it has been known that pneumothorax may cause ST-segment changes on the electrocardiogram. We presented a transient inferolateral ST-segment elevation on the electrocardiogram due to an iatrogenic left-sided pneumothorax after an urgent tracheostomy in a patient with metastatic hypopharynx cancer and normal coronary angiogram.
36325610	COVID-19 Vaccination-Induced Ventricular Fibrillation in an Afebrile Patient With Brugada Syndrome.	A 43-year-old man presented with cardiac arrest 2 days after the second coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination with an mRNA vaccine. Electrocardiograms showed ventricular fibrillation and type 1 Brugada pattern ST segment elevation. The patient reported having no symptoms, including febrile sensation. There were no known underlying cardiac diseases to explain such electrocardiographic abnormalities. ST segment elevation completely disappeared in two weeks. Although there were no genetic mutations or personal or family history typical of Brugada syndrome, flecainide administration induced type 1 Brugada pattern ST segment elevation. This case suggests that COVID-19 vaccination may induce cardiac ion channel dysfunction and cause life threatening ventricular arrhythmias in specific patients with Brugada syndrome.
36141934	Subcutaneous Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators for the Prevention of Sudden Cardiac Death: Pediatric Single-Center Experience.	BACKGROUND: The subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator (S-ICD) was developed as an alternative to the transvenous ICD, to prevent lead-related complications associated with the latter. The absence of intravascular or intracardiac components offers potential advantages to pediatric patients. AIMS: The aim of the study is to present an overview of our experience with S-ICDs in the pediatric center that, currently, has performed the largest number of implantations in children in Poland. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of data from medical history, qualification, implantation procedure, and S-ICD post-implantation observations in 11 pediatric patients were performed. RESULTS: S-ICDs were implanted in 11 patients, 8 boys and 3 girls, aged 12-17 years. The S-ICD was implanted for primary prevention in seven patients: four with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), two with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and one with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). It was implanted for secondary prevention in four patients: two with sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) in the course of idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF), one with long QT syndrome (LQTS) after probable SCA, and one with Brugada syndrome after SCA. In all patients, the device was implanted intramuscularly. One patient did not have a defibrillation test performed due to the presence of an intracardiac thrombus. In one patient, during screening, it was decided to implant an electrode on the right side of the sternum. There were no early or late complications with any of the procedures. So far, no inadequate discharges have been observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our results prove the efficacy of the S-ICD treatment option along with technically simple surgery, which supports its further and more widespread application in children.
37495059	Precision Medicine and Cardiac Channelopathies:Human iPSCs take the lead.	Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, usually involving young people. SCD remains a critical public health problem accounting for 185,000 - 450,000 deaths annually, representing around 7% to 18% of all deaths globally. As per evidence, ~2-54% of sudden unexpected deaths in people under the age of 35 years fail to show evidence of structural cardiac abnormalities at autopsy, making ion channelopathies the probable causes in such cases. The most generally recognized cardiac ion channelopathies with genetic testing are long QT syndrome (LQTS), Brugada syndrome (BrS), short QT syndrome (SQTS), and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). The substantial progress in understanding the genetics of ion channelopathies in the last two decades has obliged the early diagnosis and prevention of SCD to a certain extent. In this review, we examine some of the critical challenges and recent advancements in the identification, risk stratification, and clinical management of potentially fatal cardiac ion channel disorders. We highlight the application of precision medicine (PM) and artificial intelligence (AI) for comprehending the underlying genetic mechanisms, especially the role of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) based platforms to solve major intractable clinical problems associated with channelopathies.

37558298	Novelties in Brugada Syndrome: Complex Genetics, Risk Stratification, and Catheter Ablation.	Brugada syndrome (BrS) is an inherited arrhythmia syndrome with distinctive electrocardiographic abnormalities in the right precordial leads and predisposes to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death in otherwise healthy patients. Its complex genetic architecture and pathophysiological mechanism are not yet completely understood, and risk stratification remains challenging, particularly in patients at intermediate risk of arrhythmic events. Further understanding of its complex genetic architecture may help improving future risk stratification, and advances in management may contribute to alternatives to implantable cardioverter-defibrillators. Here, the authors review the latest insights and developments in BrS.

34444641	Impact of Dietary Factors on Brugada Syndrome and Long QT Syndrome.	A healthy regime is fundamental for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). In inherited channelopathies, such as Brugada syndrome (BrS) and Long QT syndrome (LQTS), unfortunately, sudden cardiac death could be the first sign for patients affected by these syndromes. Several known factors are used to stratify the risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias, although none are determinative. The risk factors can be affected by adjusting lifestyle habits, such as a particular diet, impacting the risk of arrhythmogenic events and mortality. To date, the importance of understanding the relationship between diet and inherited channelopathies has been underrated. Therefore, we describe herein the effects of dietary factors on the development of arrhythmia in patients affected by BrS and LQTS. Modifying the diet might not be enough to fully prevent arrhythmias, but it can help lower the risk.
35686416	Posterior Fascicular Ventricular Tachycardia: A Rare Cause of Tachycardia.	A 13-year male patient with a history of tachycardia attacks was diagnosed to have left posterior fascicular ventricular tachycardia (VT) according to the electrocardiogram (ECG) obtained at the emergency service. This diagnosis was confirmed with advanced electrophysiological studies and the case was diagnosed by genetic evaluation, which was performed to reveal the underlying cause, to have Brugada type 2 syndrome that might be associated with sudden cardiac death. Underlying causes should be evaluated, although idiopathic VTs generally have a good prognosis. Key Words: Brugada syndrome, Posterior fascicular ventricular tachycardia, Right bundle branch block.
34751355	[Sudden cardiac death during exercise due to Brugada syndrome. Report of one case].	We report a 20-year-old male athlete who while running, presented a sudden death due to ventricular fibrillation. He was successfully rescued by cardiopulmonary resuscitation maneuvers and an automatic external defibrillator. Without evidence of structural heart disease, Brugada syndrome was diagnosed as the cause, after which a subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator was indicated. We discuss the subject of sudden cardiac death in athletes and its unusual relationship with exercise in this channelopathy.
34182174	Role of endocardial ablation in eliminating an epicardial arrhythmogenic substrate in patients with Brugada syndrome.	BACKGROUND: Epicardial ablation is occasionally limited by coronary artery (CA) injuries or epicardial fat (EF). OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the anatomic obstacles that prevent ablation of epicardial abnormal potentials (EAPs) in patients with Brugada syndrome (BrS) and to investigate the feasibility of EAP elimination by endocardial right ventricular (RV) ablation. METHODS: This study included 16 BrS patients with previous ventricular fibrillation (VF), including 10 with an electrical storm. Data from multidetector computed tomography were assessed, and the proximity of the CA and EF was correlated with EAPs. RESULTS: EAPs were present in the epicardial RV outflow tract and RV inferior wall in all patients and 12 patients (75%), respectively. These EAPs were present within 5 mm of the main body and branches of the right CA in 14 patients (87.5%). However, only 1.4% +- 2.9% of the EAP area was covered with thick EF (>=8 mm). Partial EAP elimination by endocardial RV ablation was feasible in all 10 patients, with 53.3% successful endocardial RV radiofrequency applications for eliminating EAPs. After the procedure, VF remained inducible in 37.5% of the patients. During the 25.1 +- 29.1 months of follow-up, no patients experienced an electrical storm, and VF burden significantly decreased (median VF episodes before and after ablation: 7 and 0, respectively). CONCLUSION: EAPs are near the CA in most BrS patients, thereby requiring caution during epicardial ablation, whereas EF is less of an issue. Endocardial ablation is feasible to eliminate some EAPs and may be combined with epicardial ablation.
34152392	Epicardial origin of cardiac arrhythmias: clinical evidences and pathophysiology.	Recent developments in imaging, mapping, and ablation techniques have shown that the epicardial region of the heart is a key player in the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmic events in several cardiac diseases, such as Brugada syndrome, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, or dilated cardiomyopathy. At the atrial level as well, the epicardial region has emerged as an important determinant of the substrate of atrial fibrillation, pointing to common underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Alteration in the gradient of repolarization between myocardial layers favouring the occurrence of re-entry circuits has largely been described. The fibro-fatty infiltration of the subepicardium is another shared substrate between ventricular and atrial arrhythmias. Recent data have emphasized the role of the epicardial reactivation in the formation of this arrhythmogenic substrate. There are new evidences supporting this structural remodelling process to be regulated by the recruitment of epicardial progenitor cells that can differentiate into adipocytes or fibroblasts under various stimuli. In addition, immune-inflammatory processes can also contribute to fibrosis of the subepicardial layer. A better understanding of such 'electrical fragility' of the epicardial area will open perspectives for novel biomarkers and therapeutic strategies. In this review article, a pathophysiological scheme of epicardial-driven arrhythmias will be proposed.
36960730	Long-Term Outcomes of Brugada Substrate Ablation: A Report from BRAVO (Brugada Ablation of VF Substrate Ongoing Multicenter Registry).	BACKGROUND: Treatment options for high-risk Brugada syndrome (BrS) with recurrent ventricular fibrillation (VF) are limited. Catheter ablation is increasingly performed but a large study with long-term outcome data is lacking. We report the results of the multicenter, international BRAVO (Brugada Ablation of VF Substrate Ongoing Registry) for treatment of high-risk symptomatic BrS. METHODS: We enrolled 159 patients (median age 42 years; 156 male) with BrS and spontaneous VF in BRAVO; 43 (27%) of them had BrS and early repolarization pattern. All but 5 had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator for cardiac arrest (n=125) or syncope (n=34). A total of 140 (88%) had experienced numerous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks for spontaneous VF before ablation. All patients underwent a percutaneous epicardial substrate ablation with electroanatomical mapping except for 8 who underwent open-thoracotomy ablation. RESULTS: In all patients, VF/BrS substrates were recorded in the epicardial surface of the right ventricular outflow tract; 45 (29%) patients also had an arrhythmic substrate in the inferior right ventricular epicardium and 3 in the posterior left ventricular epicardium. After a single ablation procedure, 128 of 159 (81%) patients remained free of VF recurrence; this number increased to 153 (96%) after a repeated procedure (mean 1.2+-0.5 procedures; median=1), with a mean follow-up period of 48+-29 months from the last ablation. VF burden and frequency of shocks decreased significantly from 1.1+-2.1 per month before ablation to 0.003+-0.14 per month after the last ablation (P<0.0001). The Kaplan-Meier VF-free survival beyond 5 years after the last ablation was 95%. The only variable associated with a VF-free outcome in multivariable analysis was normalization of the type 1 Brugada ECG, both with and without sodium-channel blockade, after the ablation (hazard ratio, 0.078 [95% CI, 0.008 to 0.753]; P=0.0274). There were no arrhythmic or cardiac deaths. Complications included hemopericardium in 4 (2.5%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Ablation treatment is safe and highly effective in preventing VF recurrence in high-risk BrS. Prospective studies are needed to determine whether it can be an alternative treatment to implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation for selected patients with BrS.

34491774	Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia: Terminology, Mechanism, Diagnosis, and Emergency Therapy.	Polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmias are highly lethal arrhythmias. Several types of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia have similar electrocardiographic characteristics but have different modes of therapy. In fact, medications considered the treatment of choice for one form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, are contraindicated for the other. Yet confusion about terminology, and thus diagnosis and therapy, continues. We present an in-depth review of the different forms of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and propose a practical step-by-step approach for distinguishing these malignant arrhythmias.
36418560	Subcutaneous versus transvenous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator among drug-induced type-1 ECG pattern Brugada syndrome: a propensity score matching analysis from IBRYD study.	No real-world data are available about the complications rate in drug-induced type 1 Brugada Syndrome (BrS) patients with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). Aim of our study is to compare the device-related complications, infections, and inappropriate therapies among drug-induced type 1 BrS patients with transvenous- ICD (TV-ICD) versus subcutaneous-ICD (S-ICD). Data for this study were sourced from the IBRYD (Italian BRugada sYnDrome) registry which includes 619 drug-induced type-1 BrS patients followed at 20 Italian tertiary referral hospitals. For the present analysis, we selected 258 consecutive BrS patients implanted with ICD. 198 patients (76.7%) received a TV-ICD, while 60 a S-ICD (23.4%). And were followed-up for a median time of 84.3 [46.5-147] months. ICD inappropriate therapies were experienced by 16 patients (6.2%). 14 patients (7.1%) in the TVICD group and 2 patients (3.3%) in S-ICD group (log-rank P = 0.64). ICD-related complications occurred in 31 patients (12%); 29 (14.6%) in TV-ICD group and 2 (3.3%) in S-ICD group (log-rank P = 0.41). ICD-related infections occurred in 10 patients (3.88%); 9 (4.5%) in TV-ICD group and 1 (1.8%) in S-ICD group (log-rank P = 0.80). After balancing for potential confounders using the propensity score matching technique, no differences were found in terms of clinical outcomes between the two groups. In a real-world setting of drug-induced type-1 BrS patients with ICD, no significant differences in inappropriate ICD therapies, device-related complications, and infections were shown among S-ICD vs TV-ICD. However, a reduction in lead-related complications was observed in the S-ICD group. In conclusion, our evidence suggests that S-ICD is at least non-inferior to TV-ICD in this population and may also reduce the risk of lead-related complications which can expose the patients to the necessity of lead extractions.
34387130	Comparative Effectiveness of Implantable Defibrillators for Asymptomatic Brugada Syndrome: A Decision-Analytic Model.	Background Optimal management of asymptomatic Brugada syndrome (BrS) with spontaneous type I electrocardiographic pattern is uncertain. Methods and Results We developed an individual-level simulation comprising 2 000 000 average-risk individuals with asymptomatic BrS and spontaneous type I electrocardiographic pattern. We compared (1) observation, (2) electrophysiologic study (EPS)-guided implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), and (3) upfront ICD, each using either subcutaneous or transvenous ICD, resulting in 6 strategies tested. The primary outcome was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), with cardiac deaths (arrest or procedural-related) as a secondary outcome. We varied BrS diagnosis age and underlying arrest rate. We assessed cost-effectiveness at $100 000/QALY. Compared with observation, EPS-guided subcutaneous ICD resulted in 0.35 QALY gain/individual and 4130 cardiac deaths avoided/100 000 individuals, and EPS-guided transvenous ICD resulted in 0.26 QALY gain and 3390 cardiac deaths avoided. Compared with observation, upfront ICD reduced cardiac deaths by a greater margin (subcutaneous ICD, 8950; transvenous ICD, 6050), but only subcutaneous ICD improved QALYs (subcutaneous ICD, 0.25 QALY gain; transvenous ICD, 0.01 QALY loss), and complications were higher. ICD-based strategies were more effective at younger ages and higher arrest rates (eg, using subcutaneous devices, upfront ICD was the most effective strategy at ages 20-39.4 years and arrest rates >1.37%/year; EPS-guided ICD was the most effective strategy at ages 39.5-51.3 years and arrest rates 0.47%-1.37%/year, and observation was the most effective strategy at ages >51.3 years and arrest rates <0.47%/year). EPS-guided subcutaneous ICD was cost-effective ($80 508/QALY). Conclusions Device-based approaches (with or without EPS risk stratification) can be more effective than observation among selected patients with asymptomatic BrS. BrS management should be tailored to patient characteristics.

34016268	Precision Medicine Approaches to Cardiac Arrhythmias: JACC Focus Seminar 4/5.	In the initial 3 papers in this Focus Seminar series, the fundamentals and key concepts of precision medicine were reviewed, followed by a focus on precision medicine in the context of vascular disease and cardiomyopathy. For the remaining 2 papers, we focus on precision medicine in the context of arrhythmias. Specifically, in this fourth paper we focus on long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, and atrial fibrillation. The final (fifth) paper will deal with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. These arrhythmias represent a spectrum of disease ranging from common to relatively rare, with very different genetic and environmental causative factors, and with differing clinical manifestations that range from almost no consequences to lethality in childhood or adolescence if untreated. Accordingly, the emerging precision medicine approaches to these arrhythmias vary significantly, but several common themes include increased use of genetic testing, avoidance of triggers, and personalized risk stratification to guide the use of arrhythmia-specific therapies.
36254633	Aborted sudden cardiac death in patient with concealed Brugada syndrome early after skin tattoo.	"We report a case of 40-year-old healthy patient presented with aborted sudden cardiac death. Echocardiography and coronarography were normal. ECG showed minimal non-specific changes in right precordial leads. A concealed Brugada syndrome was considered. We performed a provocative ajmaline test with Brugada-specific lead placement in 2nd, 3rd and 4th intercostal spaces at both parasternal sides. The test has confirmed the supposed diagnose. Detailed history taking revealed that the patient underwent a calf tattoo procedure on the same day. In this case report, we describe a new mechanism in Brugada patients, possibly leading to sudden cardiac death. The skin tattoo procedure is in more than 7 % of cases accompanied with a ""tattoo flu syndrome"", manifesting with fever, headache and fatigue. The fever is well described as a provoking factor for malignant arrhythmias in Brugada patients. Thus, a simple and safe procedure like skin tattoo can potentially lead to death in concealed Brugada syndrome population (Fig. 7, Ref. 9). Keywords: adical gastrectomy, D2 lymph node dissection, neoadjuvant therapy."

35695789	Fever following Covid-19 vaccination in subjects with Brugada syndrome: Incidence and management.	BACKGROUND: Fever is a potential side effect of the Covid-19 vaccination. Patients with Brugada syndrome (BrS) have an increased risk of life-threatening arrhythmias when experiencing fever. Prompt treatment with antipyretic drugs is suggested in these patients. AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the incidence and management of fever within 48 h from Covid-19 vaccination among BrS patients. METHODS: One hundred sixty-three consecutive patients were enrolled in a prospective registry involving five European hospitals with a dedicated inherited disease ambulatory. RESULTS: The mean age was 50 +- 14 years and 121 (75%) patients were male. Prevalence of Brugada electrocardiogram (ECG) pattern type-1, -2, and -3 was 32%, 44%, and 24%, respectively. Twenty-eight (17%) patients had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). Fever occurred in 32 (19%) BrS patients after 16 +- 10 h from vaccination, with a peak of body temperature of 37.9  +- 0.5 . Patients with fever were younger (39 +- 13 vs. 48 +- 13 years, p = .04). No additional differences in terms of sex and cardiovascular risk factors were found between patients with fever and not. Twenty-seven (84%) out of 32 patients experienced mild fever and five (16%) moderate fever. Pharmacological treatment with antipyretic drugs was required in 18 (56%) out of 32 patients and was associated with the resolution of symptoms. No patient required hospital admission and no arrhythmic episode was recorded in patients with ICD within 48 h after vaccination. No induced type 1 BrS ECG pattern and new ECG features were found among patients with moderate fever. CONCLUSION: Fever is a common side effect in BrS patients after the Covid-19 vaccination. Careful evaluation of body temperature and prompt treatment with antipyretic drugs may be needed.
34709237	[Brugada syndrome and early repolarization syndrome: similarities and differences. The lesson from case reports].	In subjects with cardiac arrest and aborted sudden death, the presence of an ECG pattern (spontaneous or drug-induced) suggesting a Brugada syndrome (BrS) is generally considered the proof of a BrS. We present three case reports of patients with resuscitated sudden death in whom a BrS was diagnosed, but in whom the real cause was probably an early repolarization syndrome (ERS). This distinction is not only theoretical but has also practical consequences. In fact, the arrhythmic substrate is different in the two conditions: right ventricular outflow tract in BrS, inferior ventricular wall in ERS. As a consequence, catheter ablation of the right ventricular outflow tract may be useful in BrS, whereas it is useless in ERS.
36396185	Advances in Ventricular Arrhythmia Ablation for Brugada Syndrome.	Three decades have passed since the Brugada syndrome (BrS) clinical entity was introduced in the early 1990s. During the first 2 decades, treatment of patients with BrS was challenging because there were limited treatment options, and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was the only choice for high-risk patients with BrS, that is, those who had aborted sudden cardiac death or had previous ventricular fibrillation episodes. In this article, the authors focus on these advances and how to treat patients with BrS with catheter ablation.
