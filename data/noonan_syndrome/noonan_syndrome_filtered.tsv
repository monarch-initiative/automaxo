26993353	Continent Catheterizable Vesicostomy: An Alternative Surgical Modality for Pediatric Patients With Large Bladder Capacity.	OBJECTIVE: To present a modified technique and early outcomes of a continent catheterizable vesicostomy in pediatric patients with either flaccid neurogenic bladder or intractable voiding dysfunction and large capacity bladder. METHODS: Six patients underwent the procedure from October 2014 to December 2015. A 4-cm Pfannenstiel incision was made, avoiding intraperitoneal dissection. After adequate mobilization, a 2-cm vertical flap at the dome of the bladder was identified and tubularized over a 12Fr catheter with 4-0 vicryl suture. The tubularized flap was then intussuscepted into the bladder with four 4-0 polydioxanone sutures, creating a continent mechanism. The catheterizable channel was then tunneled to the umbilicus, the channel ostomy matured, and the cystotomy closed in two layers. RESULTS: The median patient age was 8 (interquartile range [IQR] 12) years. All patients had urinary dysfunction requiring drainage from etiologies that included Eagle-Barrett syndrome (n = 2), Noonan syndrome (n = 1), Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (n = 1), and Spina bifida (n = 2). Median hospital length of stay was 8 (IQR 3) days. One patient had a superficial wound infection treated with antibiotics, and 1 patient required balloon dilation of the catheterizable channel at 3 months postoperatively, secondary to difficulty self-catheterizing. Five patients were successfully self-catheterizing at last follow-up. Median follow-up was 6 (IQR 5) months and there were no intra- or perioperative complications. CONCLUSION: Continent catheterizable vesicostomy is a novel technique for urinary drainage in patients with large bladder capacity that spares use of the appendix or ileum. Early results are encouraging, providing a catheterizable channel through the umbilicus without urinary leakage between catheterization.
28330516	Treatment of severe refractory valvar pulmonary stenosis with primary transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation.	Some patients with pulmonary valve stenosis do not respond to balloon valvuloplasty and must undergo surgical repair. We report the case of a 12-year-old child with pulmonary valve stenosis and Noonan syndrome in whom we performed transcatheter Melody pulmonary valve implantation after balloon dilation failed. The result was excellent. This technique can be proposed as an alternative to surgery in such cases.
29109363	Efficacy and safety of two doses of Norditropin  (somatropin) in short stature due to Noonan syndrome: a 2-year randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial in Japanese patients.	This randomized double-blind multicenter trial (NCT01927861) evaluated the growth-promoting effect and safety of Norditropin  (NN220; somatropin) in Japanese children with short stature due to Noonan syndrome. Prepubertal children aged 3-<11 years (boys) or 3-<10 years (girls) with Noonan syndrome were randomized to receive GH 0.033 mg/kg/day (n = 25, mean age 6.57 years, 11 females) or 0.066 mg/kg/day (n = 26, mean age 6.06 years, eight females) for 104 weeks. Change in height standard deviation score (HSDS) from baseline was analyzed based on an ANCOVA model. Baseline HSDS was -3.24. Estimated change in HSDS [95% CI] after 104 weeks' treatment was 0.84 [0.66, 1.02] and 1.47 [1.29, 1.64] for the lower and higher doses, respectively; estimated mean difference 0.63 [0.38, 0.88], p < 0.0001. Rates and patterns of adverse events (AEs) were similar between groups. Most were mild and reported as unlikely to be related to Norditropin . There were no withdrawals due to AEs. Insulin-like growth factor-I SDS increased from -1.71 to -0.64 (0.033 mg/kg/day) and to 0.63 (0.066 mg/kg/day). HbA1c increased slightly (0.033 mg/kg/day: +0.14%; 0.066 mg/kg/day: +0.13%); glucose profiles were almost unchanged; insulin profiles increased in both groups in the oral glucose tolerance test. There were no clinically significant abnormal electrocardiogram or echocardiography findings. We conclude that Norditropin  at doses of 0.033 mg/kg/day or 0.066 mg/kg/day for 104 weeks increases height in Japanese children with short stature due to Noonan syndrome, with a favorable safety profile. The effect was greater with 0.066 mg/kg/day compared with 0.033 mg/kg/day.
26911351	Adults with germline CBL mutation complicated with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia at infancy.	Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) appears to be a life-threatening disease and showed poor prognosis even after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) because of high relapse rate. On the other hand, recent molecular analysis revealed the heterogeneity of JMML. Here we report that two JMML patients survived >20 years without HSCT and both patients had uniparental disomy of 11q23 where CBL is located without the phenomenon found in neither Noonan syndrome nor Noonan syndrome-like disorder. We think that some JMML patients with CBL mutation might show the good prognosis in later life after remission of JMML. 
21205420	Sudden death in a patient with Noonan syndrome.	We report here the case of a 27-year-old woman with Noonan syndrome presenting with ventricular fibrillation. After successful defibrillation, echocardiography revealed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy associated with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Normal echocardiographic cardiac structure and function were reported 11 years ago. This case emphasises the importance of regular follow-up in patients with congenital disorders in which cardiac manifestations might develop in early adulthood or later.
35569947	[SEVERE INFANTILE ASTHMA TREATED WITH LONG-ACTING MUSCARINIC ANTAGONIST: A CASE SERIES].	BACKGROUND: Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) are used for long-term treatment of bronchial asthma in adults. Its use in the management of pediatric bronchial asthma, however, is currently not approved in Japan. Nonetheless, there have been a few reports of its use in children, particularly in cases of severe bronchial asthma or those without atopic disease that are refractory to existing treatment protocols. We report the progress of LAMA in infantile asthma patients. CASES: Three out of four patients had LAMA introduced at 3 to 5 years of age after being diagnosed with asthma at 1 to 3 years old. Three patients had non-IgE-related asthma and an underlying disease, such as Apert and Noonan syndrome, while one patient had severe IgE-related asthma without a pre-existing disease. In all cases, conventional long-term medications such as medium to high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonists, were given. However, severe bronchial asthma persisted, with some patients having uncontrolled secretions. Since uncontrolled severe-persistent bronchial asthma results in repeated hospitalization and intensive care unit admission, we introduced LAMA, specifically 2.5mug/day of tiotropium (Tio). After the introducing Tio, none of the patients had an acute exacerbation that required hospitalization and the frequency of wheezing was reduced. LAMA was administered for up to 19 months, with no adverse events. CONCLUSION: The results of this series suggest that LAMA is an effective and safe option for uncontrolled infantile asthma.
16299871	Growth hormone treatment in 35 prepubertal children with achondroplasia: a five-year dose-response trial.	BACKGROUND: Achondroplasia is a skeletal dysplasia with extreme, disproportionate, short stature. AIM: In a 5-y growth hormone (GH) treatment study including 1 y without treatment, we investigated growth and body proportion response in 35 children with achondroplasia. METHODS: Patients were randomized to either 0.1 IU/kg (n = 18) or 0.2 IU/kg (n = 17) per day. GH treatment was interrupted for 12 mo after 2 y of treatment in prepubertal patients to study catch-down growth. Mean height SDS (HSDS) at start was -5.6 and -5.2 for the low- and high-dose groups, respectively, and mean age 7.3 and 6.6 y. RESULTS: Mean growth velocity (baseline 4.5/4.6 cm/y for the groups) increased significantly by 1.9/3.6 cm/y during the first year and by 0.5/1.5 cm/y during the second year. During the third year, a decrease of growth velocity was observed at 1.9/1.3 cm/y below baseline values. HSDS increased significantly by 0.6/0.8 during the first year of treatment and in total by 1.3/1.6 during the 5 y of study. Sitting height SDS improved significantly from -2.1/-1.7 to -0.8/0.2 during the study. Body proportion (sitting height/total height) or arm span did not show any significant change. CONCLUSION: GH treatment of children with achondroplasia improves height during 4 y of therapy without adverse effect on trunk-leg disproportion. The short-term effect is comparable to that reported in Turner and Noonan syndrome and in idiopathic short stature.

25041545	Noonan syndrome with bilateral acute angle-closure.	
1266891	Aortic regurgitation and pigmentation - unusual features of Noonan syndrome.	A patient with typical features of Noonan's syndrome showed aortic regurgitation and widespread diffuse hyperpigmentation, features not previously associated with this syndrome. Detailed endocrine and dermatological studies failed to delineate the cause of hyperpigmentation. In addition to mild aortic regurgitation, cardiac catheterization revealed mild left ventricular dysfunction, probably due to primary myocardial disease. Other interesting findings included lymphedema and sexual infantilism despite normal testosterone levels.

34636896	Approach to the Patient: Safety of Growth Hormone Replacement in Children and Adolescents.	The use of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) in children and adolescents has expanded since its initial approval to treat patients with severe GH deficiency (GHD) in 1985. rhGH is now approved to treat several conditions associated with poor growth and short stature. Recent studies have raised concerns that treatment during childhood may affect morbidity and mortality in adulthood, with specific controversies over cancer risk and cerebrovascular events. We will review 3 common referrals to a pediatric endocrinology clinic, followed by a summary of short- and long-term effects of rhGH beyond height outcomes. Methods to mitigate risk will be reviewed. Finally, this information will be applied to each clinical case, highlighting differences in counseling and clinical outcomes. rhGH therapy has been used for more than 3 decades. Data are largely reassuring, yet we still have much to learn about pharmaceutical approaches to growth in children and the lifelong effect of treatment.
14528108	Radiation therapy in the treatment of Gorham disease.	An adolescent male with Noonan syndrome presented with a nonhealing fracture of the proximal right humerus. Over a 7-month period there was progressive loss of bone in this region, resulting in a flail arm at 9 months. Radiographic review was consistent with Gorham disease. In addition, there was significant bleeding in the soft tissues and pain. Radiation was delivered. Seven years passed, until the patient re-presented with right hemithorax near collapse secondary to chylothorax. A chest tube was placed with temporary relief, but significant effusion remained. Radiation was again administered, and by the end of therapy the chest tube was removed. The effusion has not recollected at last follow-up, which is now 6 months. The use of radiation in the treatment of Gorham disease has been demonstrated to have excellent palliative ability.
31208451	Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and survival in a patient with Noonan syndrome and multiple lentigines: a case report.	BACKGROUND: A 9-year-old Arabic boy attending middle school presented with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation recorded by Holter electrocardiographic monitoring. He had a background history of Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (also known as LEOPARD syndrome), a rare condition of autosomal dominant inheritance with approximately 200 cases reported worldwide. CASE PRESENTATION: Apart from characteristic features, the boy was known to have asymmetric septal hypertrophy with a maximum wall thickness of 24 mm measured by cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. A day prior to the event, he attended cardiology follow-up at our institution, and Holter monitoring was commenced. Following cardiopulmonary resuscitation by bystanders and paramedics, he reverted back into sinus rhythm after a total downtime of 24 min. He was initially treated in the intensive care unit and underwent implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation. He has made a full recovery and remains at the top of his class. CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates that sudden cardiac arrest in patients with secondary forms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is not necessarily protected by apparently favorable phenotypes and that events may be preceded by non-sustained ventricular tachycardia observed by Holter monitoring. Implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation plays a critical role in both primary and secondary prevention in patients at high risk of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
10206464	Neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome and acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a report of two cases.	Two boys with neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome in whom acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) developed are described. Both patients demonstrated B-lineage leukemias with normal cytogenetics. They were treated with combination chemotherapy and remain in remission off therapy. Patients with neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome may be at increased risk for ALL.

The first case of combined procedure of catheter-based balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty and atrial septal defect closure using Amplatzer Septal Occluder, in a patient with Noonan syndrome, is reported. The literature regarding prevalence, genetics, pattern of involvement, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of this syndrome is reviewed.

36339399	Genetic conditions of short stature: A review of three classic examples.	Noonan, Turner, and Prader-Willi syndromes are classical genetic disorders that are marked by short stature. Each disorder has been recognized for several decades and is backed by extensive published literature describing its features, genetic origins, and optimal treatment strategies. These disorders are accompanied by a multitude of comorbidities, including cardiovascular issues, endocrinopathies, and infertility. Diagnostic delays, syndrome-associated comorbidities, and inefficient communication among the members of a patient's health care team can affect a patient's well-being from birth through adulthood. Insufficient information is available to help patients and their multidisciplinary team of providers transition from pediatric to adult health care systems. The aim of this review is to summarize the clinical features and genetics associated with each syndrome, describe best practices for diagnosis and treatment, and emphasize the importance of multidisciplinary teams and appropriate care plans for the pediatric to adult health care transition.
28192847	[Gastroparesis in Noonan syndrome].	We present a case of a 26-year-old female patient with bloating, postprandial nausea and recurrent vomiting after solid food intake. A gastric emptying scintigraphy showed a delayed gastric emptying, defining gastroparesis. Because of her past medical history of short stature and pulmonary stenosis, we initiated genetic counseling where the diagnosis of Noonan syndrome was made. Dietary therapy and medication with domperidone quickly led to relief of the discomfort due to gastroparesis. However, prokinetics are not indicated for long-term therapy, as cardiac arrhythmia may occur. A risk-benefit assessment should be done. There are several novel approaches which need to be further investigated.
25708222	Rapidly progressive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in an infant with Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines: palliative treatment with a rapamycin analog.	Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (NSML) frequently manifests with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Recently, it was demonstrated that mTOR inhibition reverses HCM in NSML mice. We report for the first time on the effects of treatment with a rapamycin analog in an infant with LS and malignant HCM. In the boy, progressive HCM was diagnosed during the first week of life and a diagnosis of NSML was established at age 20 weeks by showing a heterozygous Q510E mutation in PTPN11. Immunoblotting with antibodies against pERK, pAkt, and pS6RP in fibroblasts demonstrated enhanced Akt/mTOR pathway activity. Because of the patient's critical condition, everolimus therapy was started at age 24 weeks and continued until heart transplantation at age 36 weeks. Prior to surgery, heart failure improved from NYHA stage IV to II and brain natriuretic peptide values decreased from 9,600 to <1,000 pg/ml, but no reversal of cardiac hypertrophy was observed. Examination of the explanted heart revealed severe hypertrophy and myofiber disarray with extensive perivascular fibrosis. These findings provide evidence that Akt/mTOR activity is enhanced in NSML with HCM and suggest that rapamycin treatment could principally be feasible for infantile NSML. The preliminary experiences made in this single patient indicate that therapy should start early to prevent irreversible cardiac remodelling.
16078230	Therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia in a child with Noonan syndrome and clonal duplication of the germline PTPN11 mutation.	A 4-year-old girl with Noonan syndrome (NS) and constitutive PTPN11 mutation presented with stage 4 neuroblastoma and was treated by intensive chemotherapy. During the treatment, cytogenetic analysis revealed the development of a hyperdiploid clone with duplication of the germline PTPN11 mutation in a morphologically normal bone marrow. A few months later, the patient developed acute myelomonoblastic leukemia with an additional clonal deletion of 7q. Although, we cannot conclude whether there is an association between NS and neuroblastoma, this case suggests that duplication of germline PTPN11 mutations, potentially induced by chemotherapy, contributes to leukemogenesis in patients with NS.
31264394	Impact of Noonan Syndrome on admissions for pediatric cardiac surgery.	BACKGROUND: Noonan Syndrome is the second most common genetic syndrome associated with congenital heart disease. Many patients with Noonan Syndrome will require a cardiac intervention. This study aimed to characterize the difference in cardiac surgery admissions in patients with and without Noonan Syndrome. METHODS: Data regarding hospital admissions was collected using the Kids' Inpatient Database from 1997 to 2012. A cross-sectional study was conducted comparing baseline characteristics, cardiac morphology, cardiac surgery, and other comorbidities between those with and without Noonan Syndrome. Regression analysis was conducted to determine factors related to Noonan Syndrome and risk factors for increased length of hospitalization, need for ECMO, and inpatient mortality using Noonan Syndrome as the independent variable. RESULTS: A total of 46,169 admissions with cardiac surgery under 18 years of age were included in the final analyses. Of these 778 (1.6%) had Noonan Syndrome. Pulmonary stenosis, coronary anomalies, and valvuloplasty without valve replacement were independently associated with Noonan Syndrome. Those with Noonan Syndrome were 90% more likely to have chylothorax. Pediatric cardiac surgery admissions tended to be 4.5 days longer and cost $54,296 more in total charges with Noonan Syndrome. Inpatient mortality is also increased by Noonan Syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Noonan Syndrome is present in a relatively small proportion of pediatric cardiac surgery admissions. Noonan Syndrome is independently associated with increased length and cost of such admissions as well as inpatient mortality.
30576779	Early Outcomes of Cardiac Surgery in Patients with Noonan Syndrome.	There is a paucity of cardiac surgery outcomes data for patients with Noonan syndrome (NS). Our objective was to evaluate early results in these patients. Between January 1999 and December 2015, 29 patients (18 males, 62%) with NS underwent cardiac surgery at our institution. Mean age was 23 +- 17.9 years; 12 (41%) were under 18 years of age. Fourteen patients (48%) had prior sternotomies. The primary operations for the main diagnosis were pulmonary valve/conduit replacement/repair (n = 14, 48%), septal myectomy for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (n = 7, 24%), aortic valve replacement/repair (n = 4, 14%), atrial septal defect (ASD) repair (n = 2, 7%), and cardiac transplantation (n = 2, 7%). Concomitant procedures were performed in 24 patients (83%), most commonly right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction (n = 13, 45%), mitral valve repair/replacement (n = 7, 24%), and ASD repair (n = 6, 21%). Mean bypass and cross-clamp times were 88.8 +- 51 minutes and 54.7 +- 67 minutes, respectively. There was 1 early death (3%). Postoperative morbidity occurred in 18 patients (62%), most commonly arrhythmias (n = 14, 48%) or respiratory insufficiency/pneumonia (n = 6, 21%). There were 2 early reoperations and 4 early readmissions. Univariate factors associated with morbidity included male gender (P = 0.03) and longer cross-clamp time (P = 0.02). Median length of hospital stay was 6 days (interquartile range 5-10.5 days). Patients with NS frequently have multiple cardiac lesions requiring a broad spectrum of operations. Early mortality is low despite procedure complexity. Although early postoperative morbidity is common, patients overall do well with reasonable hospital lengths of stay. Additional studies are needed to evaluate long-term outcomes and quality of life.
16636503	Hemodynamic consequences of a swinging, infarcted ventricular septum.	Noonan syndrome presents with dysmorphic facial features, short stature, and cardiac abnormalities (most commonly pulmonic stenosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). This report describes a rare case accompanied by a secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) and a ventricular septal aneurysm causing right ventricular (RV) pressure gradient. A 29-year-old mentally retarded man was admitted to hospital with exertional dyspnea. His somatic features included short stature (148 cm), hypertelorism, a shield chest, and thoracic scoliosis. Echocardiogram showed a secundum ASD with bidirectional shunting and a ventricular septum bulging toward the left ventricle in diastole, and then toward the RV in systole causing obliteration of the RV. The peak pressure gradient measured across the RV outflow by continuous wave Doppler was 30 mmHg. Cardiac catheterization revealed an elevated RV pressure without pulmonary hypertension and confirmed the pressure gradient. Right ventriculography revealed the septal excursion toward the RV in systole, leaving only a small residual cavity in the inflow and outflow regions of the RV. The ASD was closed with an autologous pericardial patch. A thin, fibrous portion of the ventricular septum was resected and replaced with a Dacron patch. From the histological examination, the RV cavity obliteration turned out to be produced by the excursion of the infarcted ventricular septum.
17483716	Rhabdomyosarcoma in a patient with Noonan syndrome phenotype and review of the literature.	An increased risk of different types of malignancy has been reported in patients with Noonan syndrome (NS). We describe a patient with short stature, dysmorphic features, developmental delay, and congenital cardiomyopathy. At 5 years old, he presented with abdominal pain, constipation, and evaluation with ultrasound and computed tomography scan demonstrated the presence of an abdominal mass. Total resection of the mass and consequent histology revealed an embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. Rhabdomyosarcoma is a rare tumor in NS patients and to the best of our knowledge only 2 cases have been reported so far. The presentation underlines the importance of frequent follow-up of patients with NS, since the incidence of malignancy is low but existing.
30236064	Epileptic spasms in PPP1CB-associated Noonan-like syndrome: a case report with clinical and therapeutic implications.	BACKGROUND: Noonan syndrome-like disorder with loose anagen hair-2 (NSLH2) is an extremely rare disease caused by a heterozygous mutation in the PPP1CB gene on chromosome 2p23. The syndrome causes not only numerous dysmorphic features but also hypotonia, developmental delay, and even intellectual disability. We report the first case of NSLH2 in Asia and the 16th in the world. Moreover, the first case of PPP1CB-related infantile spasms. The clinical and therapeutic significance is outlined in this paper. CASE PRESENTATION: We found a male infant presented with severe intractable epileptic spasms. Although certain clinical features of somatic dysmorphism were noted, numerous laboratory and neuroimaging studies failed to identify the cause. To determine the underlying etiology, whole-exome sequencing was conducted. We identified a de novo heterozygous mutation, NM_206876.1: c.548A > C (p.Glu183Ala), in the PPP1CB gene. His seizures were almost refractory to conventional antiepileptic drugs but relative seizure control was eventually achieved with a ketogenic diet. CONCLUSION: This result expands the clinical spectrum of NSLH2 and strengthens the association between the PPP1CB gene and epileptic seizures. Furthermore, we suggest that the ketogenic diet can offer seizure reduction in particular drug-resistant epilepsy syndromes. Additional studies are warranted to clarify the pathogenic mechanisms underlying this PPP1CB mutation in epileptic seizures.

26030966	"[The conference, ""rare diseases not only in the curriculum"" in Szczecin]."	The conference 'Rare diseases not only in the curriculum', organised on 12th May, 2014 in Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin, had a scientific and educational character. Representatives of patient organizations, medical students, junior doctors and physiotherapist were active participants of the meeting. There were rare diseases presented--from the medical curriculum, e.g., Wilson disease, Noonan syndrome and Diamond Blackfan anemia--and diseases that are not discussed in the course of medical studies in Poland, as Costello syndrome, Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome and cholestasis familiaris groenlandica--Byler-like disease.The importance of physiotherapy of children with spinal muscular atrophy was discussed.The place ofthe issue of rare diseases in the idea of personalized medicine was specified and difficulties in the care of patients with rare diseases, including muscle and metabolic diseases, in Poland were explained.
32972603	RASopathies.	RASopathies are a group of disorders characterized by mutations in the RAS-MAPK pathway. RAS-MAP signaling plays a critical role in cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival. Germline mutations can result in distinctive syndromes, including Noonan syndrome, Costello syndrome, and neurofibromatosis type 1. Mosaic RASopathies can present as localized cutaneous lesions like epidermal nevi and nevus sebaceous, or more extensive conditions such as encephalocraniocutaneous lipomatosis. We review the heterogenous presentation of RAS mutations, discuss new targeted therapies, and highlight areas of uncertainty, including carcinogenesis risk and appropriate screening.
12738133	King syndrome in pregnancy.	BACKGROUND: King syndrome is characterized by the presence of a nonspecific myopathy, a susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia, and dysmorphic features similar to the phenotype seen in Noonan syndrome. CASE: A young primigravida with King syndrome presented at 19 weeks' gestation. The patient required nocturnal mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy, and there was concern that the patient would become increasingly dependent on mechanical ventilation during pregnancy. The patient underwent a forceps-assisted delivery at 35 weeks' gestation, and both the patient and her infant did well and were discharged on postpartum day 3. CONCLUSION: In the gravida with King syndrome, agents that may trigger malignant hyperthermia should be avoided. Significant myopathy may result in respiratory compromise, and a multidisciplinary approach is necessary to optimize maternal and fetal outcome.

26226731	Transcatheter closure of atrial septal defect in a patient with Noonan syndrome after corrective surgery.	INTRODUCTION: Transcatheter atrial septal defect (ASD) closure is considered to be a gold standard for patients with the suitable anatomy as compared to cardiac surgery. Reocurrence of ASD after surgical closure is a very rare late complication which can be successfully managed with transcatheter procedure. CASE REPORT: We reported a female patient with Noonan syndrome who presented with hemodinamically significant ASD 37 years after the corrective cardiac surgery. Due to numerous comorbidities which included severe kyphoscoliosis, pectus excavatum and multiple surgeries we decided to perform transcatheter closure of ASD. The procedure itself was very challenging due to the patient's short stature and heart's orientation in the chest, but was performed successfully. The subsequent follow-up was uneventful and the patient reported improvement in the symptoms. CONCLUSION: Transcatheter closure of ASD in a patient with Noonan syndrome with the history of surgically corrected ASD can be performed successfully, despite challenging chest anatomy.
17711156	Anesthetic management in a pediatric patient with Noonan syndrome, mastocytosis, and von Willebrand disease: a case report.	This case report describes anesthetic considerations for a 6-year-old boy, admitted for adenoidectomy under general anesthesia, who had a complicated medical history, including mastocytosis, Noonan syndrome, and von Willebrand disease. Each affected the anesthetic plan and was addressed preoperatively among all surgical and anesthesia providers. Mastocytosis created a major concern, with its increased numbers of histamine-filled mast cells. Each drug that was added or eliminated from the anesthetic plan, to prevent histamine release by the activation of triggers, was considered. Patient handling and temperature control were also concerns. One of Noonan syndrome's characteristics is heart anomalies. This patient had a history of a patent foramen ovale and pulmonary stenosis; therefore, air was carefully removed from all intravenous lines and syringes. The main concern for bleeding difficulties was attributed to the history of von Willebrand disease, which results in prolonged bleeding time and can lead to delayed bleeding or serious postsurgical hemorrhage. Desmopressin was administered preoperatively to increase platelet aggregation and the von Willebrand factor level. The use of aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was avoided. We discuss the clinical and anesthetic management of this case with a review of pertinent literature.
17088764	[Emergency thoraco amniotic shunting in cases with compressive pleural effusion with hydrops: A retrospective study of 60 cases].	OBJECTIVES: To study perinatal outcome following thoraco-amniotic shunting for fetal pleural effusions with hydrops. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective study (1984-2004) to evaluate a policy of emergency thracoamniotic shunting in hydropic fetuses with suspected chylothorax, on the basis of the rationale that mediastinal compression could lead to acute fetal distress. RESULTS: Shunting was performed immediately following diagnosis, and was successful in all 60 cases attempted. There were 7 pregnancy terminations, 10 in utero deaths, and 43 live births, of which 7 children died in the neonatal period and 36 survived (33 without sequels). Among the liveborn, 26 were delivered preterm (72%), of which 7 (19%) had preterm premature rupture of membranes and 4 (11%) had chorioamnionitis. Perinatal death (24/60, 40%) was related to underlying anomalies (7 cases), pulmonary hypoplasia (5 cases), chorioamnionitis (2 cases), or treatment failure for unknown reasons (10 cases). All 36 survivors had chylothorax, 33 of which were primary, and 3 were secondary to right congenital diaphragmatic hernia, pulmonary sequestration, or Noonan syndrome. CONCLUSION: Following shunting, pleural effusion with hydrops has survival rate >50%, but still have a high rate of morbidity and mortality.
29907801	Comparative assessment of gene-specific variant distribution in prenatal and postnatal cohorts tested for Noonan syndrome and related conditions.	PURPOSE: To compare the pattern of gene-specific involvement and the spectrum of variants observed in prenatal and postnatal (mean +- SD, 8.9 +- 9.4 years) cohorts tested for Noonan syndrome and related conditions. METHODS: Outcomes of sequencing panel testing were compared between prenatal (n = 845) and postnatal (n = 409) cohorts. RESULTS: PTPN11 and SOS1 harbored the majority of observed variants in both prenatal and postnatal cohorts, and BRAF, HRAS, KRAS, MAP2K1, MAP2K2, RAF1, and SHOC2 had similarities in their pattern of involvement in both cohorts. PTPN11 was the largest contributor of pathogenic variants and had the lowest frequency of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). SOS1 had the highest VUS frequency in both cohorts. The overall VUS frequency was twice as high in prenatal specimens (58.1 vs. 29.3%). PTPN11 and SOS1 had a 1.5-fold higher VUS frequency in the prenatal cohort (10.7 vs. 7.4% and 95 vs. 61.1%, respectively). The diagnostic yield was 3.7% for prenatal samples, with a higher yield of 12.3% in fetuses with cystic hygroma as a sole finding, and 21.3% for postnatal. CONCLUSION: Comparison of prenatal versus postnatal specimens demonstrates that the pattern of specific gene involvement is similar, whereas the classification spectrum of observed variants differs considerably.
27585781	Correction of a severe Class II malocclusion in a patient with Noonan syndrome.	Noonan syndrome is a developmental disorder characterized by a dysmorphic facial structure, short stature, and mild mental retardation, with associated cardiac defects and skeletal malformations. It may be sporadic or inherited as an autosomal dominant or recessive trait. The incidence of occurrence is 1 in 1000 to 2500 live births. The responsible gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 12. Diagnosis of the syndrome is made by both clinical inspection and karyotype. This is the case report of a 10-year-old Mexican boy who was referred for correction of orofacial and occlusal defects.

20306897	Percutaneous pulmonary valvuloplasty and atrial septal defect closure in a 69-year-old patient with Noonan's syndrome.	We present the case of a patient with Noonan syndrome who was seen for the first time at the age of 69 years with combined pulmonary valve stenosis and atrial septal defect. The patient was treated by a staged percutaneous approach. The treatment of these combined congenital heart defects remains challenging because their haemodynamics interact directly. In this case report we discuss both the underlying pathophysiology and haemodynamics.
15592290	Thoracoamniotic shunting for fetal pleural effusions with hydrops.	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate perinatal outcome after thoracoamniotic shunting for fetal pleural effusions with hydrops. STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective study. RESULTS: Shunting was performed immediately after diagnosis and was successful in all 54 of the cases that were attempted. There were 7 pregnancy terminations, 9 in utero deaths, and 38 live births, of which 7 children died in the neonatal period and 31 children survived. Among the liveborn infants, 27 infants were delivered preterm (71%), of whom 7 infants (15%) had preterm premature rupture of membranes and 4 infants (8.5%) had chorioamnionitis. Perinatal death (23/54 infants; 43%) was related to underlying anomalies (7 cases), pulmonary hypoplasia (5 cases), chorioamnionitis (2 cases), or treatment failure for unknown reasons (9 cases). All 31 survivors had chylothorax; for 28 of the survivors, the chylothorax was primary, and for 3 survivors, the chylothorax was the result of right congenital diaphragmatic hernia, pulmonary sequestration, or Noonan syndrome. CONCLUSION: After the shunting, pleural effusion with hydrops has a 57% survival rate; premature delivery is the leading source of morbidity.
10224677	Palinopsia with bacterial brain abscess and Noonan syndrome.	Though positive visual symptoms can be psychological in nature, or can result from a perceptive or anxious patients recognizing optical principals in the eye itself, this case illustrates how a thorough history is required to delineate those rarer signs which accompany serious macular or neuro-ophthalmic pathology.
9113612	Revision spine surgery in children with cerebral palsy.	Ten children with neuromuscular scoliosis and pelvic obliquity had revision spinal instrumentations and fusions performed at an average age of 14.7 years. The initial spinal deformity in all children was the result of static encephalopathy with nine children diagnosed as having spastic cerebral palsy without another specific diagnosis and one child diagnosed as also having Noonan syndrome. All 10 children had a revision performed after the first surgery, and two of the 10 children underwent a second revision because of failure of rod cross-links. The indications for revision surgery were symptomatic recurrent deformity, symptomatic pseudoarthrosis, or perforation of one leg of the unit rod through the pelvis. The average time between the first and second surgery was 2.7 years, and from revision to final follow-up was 2.5 years. The goal of providing symptomatic relief and correction of deformity was accomplished in nine of 10 children; however, two of the nine required two revisions. One patient continues to have a residual painful pseudoarthrosis. The two postoperative complications requiring further surgery were related to the failure of rod connectors.
8677117	Laser treatment of recurrent vulvar angiokeratoma associated with Noonan syndrome.	BACKGROUND: Vulvar angiokeratoma is often confused with other, more common perineal lesions. Chronically elevated venous pressures may contribute to this rare disorder. Laser treatment may lend palliation for several years. CASE: A woman with the characteristic cardiac abnormalities of Noonan syndrome initially responded to Argon laser treatment of vulvar angiokeratoma. Excessive recurrent disease was treated satisfactorily with the Nd:YAG laser. CONCLUSION: Recurrent vulvar angiokeratoma in Noonan syndrome supports the premise that increased persistent central venous pressure may be involved in the disease process.
30693642	Occurrence of high-grade glioma in Noonan syndrome: Report of two cases.	Noonan syndrome (NS) is an autosomal dominant disorder commonly caused by PTPN11 germline mutations. Patients are characterized by short stature, congenital heart defects, facial dysmorphism, and increased risk of malignancies including brain tumors. Commonly associated brain tumors are dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor and low-grade glioma. We report two cases of anaplastic astrocytoma with PTPN11-related NS. We conducted a systematic search of medical databases looking for other reported cases of high-grade glioma associated with NS and identified 24 cases of brain tumors, all of which were low-grade glial or glioneuronal tumors except for one case of medulloblastoma.
16440718	[Anesthetic management of a child with Noonan syndrome and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy].	Noonan syndrome is characterized by facial, skeletal and cardiovascular anomalies. We describe the anesthetic management of a one-year-old boy with Noonan syndrome and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy scheduled for tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy under general anesthesia. He had a history of congestive heart failure at 5 months of age. Preoperative echocardiogram revealed a hypertrophied septum (12.8 mm) with concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle. Mild mitral regurgitation was also noted. Our anesthetic goal was set to maintaining adequate preload and afterload as well as adequate anesthesia depth to avoid LV outflow tract obstruction. Intravenous fluid was started the day before surgery. Anesthesia was induced with fentanyl 30 microg and midazolam 2 mg and maintained with propofol 8 mg x kg(-1) x hr(-1), fentanyl 30 microg, ketamine 4 mg, and sevoflurane 1-2%. Intraoperative monitoring included 12-lead electrocardiogram and direct measurement of arterial pressure. Intra- and post-operative course was uneventful.
11108676	Cutaneous oozing of lymphatic fluid after interventional cardiac catheterization in a patient with Noonan syndrome.	A 15-year-old girl with Noonan syndrome, intestinal lymphangiectasia and severe valvar pulmonary stenosis had an abnormal lymphangioscintigram that showed intense activity in the inguinal regions bilaterally. Cutaneous oozing of lymphatic fluid from the groin wound complicated percutaneous balloon pulmonary valvoplasty. This previously unreported complication highlights the risk of damage to abnormal lymphatic channels in patients with Noonan syndrome who undergo interventional catheterization.
31932988	GH and IGF-1 Replacement in Children.	In this chapter, we want to give an overview on what we have learned from more than 30 years ago on the use of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) and later recombinant human IGF-1 which was introduced for the treatment of short children and what are the safety issues concerned with this treatment. However, rhGH is used not solely in conditions where short stature is the consequence of GH deficiency but also in various disorders without a proven GH deficiency. In clinical studies, growth responses to various forms of rhGH therapy were analyzed, adding to our concept about the physiology of growth. Most patients under rhGH treatment show a considerable short-term effect; however, the long-term gain of height in a child obtained by a year-long treatment until final height remains controversial in some of the growth disorders that have been treated with rhGH or IGF-1. Today the first studies on the long-term safety of rhGH treatment have been published and raising some questions whether this treatment is similarly safe for all the patient groups treated with rhGH. Although there is a long-standing safety record for these hormone replacement therapies, in the face of the considerable costs involved, the discussion about the risk to benefit ratio is continuing. Newer developments of rhGH treatment include long-term preparations, which have only to be injected once a week. Although some of these drugs already have proven their non-inferiority to conventional rhGH treatment, we have to await further results to see whether they show improvements in treatment adherence of the patients and prove their long-term safety.
550483	Lymphatic abnormalities in Noonan syndrome: A case report.	Lymphatic abnormalities are not generally recognized as part of the Noonan syndrome. A child with this condition in whom unique and widespread lymphatic abnormalities were demonstrated by lymphography is described. Both T and B lymphocytes were detected in chylous fluid drained from the thorax. In addition, the child was found to have a protein-losing enteropathy and cardiovascular defects. The clinical spectrum of the Noonan syndrome may include animalies of the lymphatic system.
15889278	A novel mutation in the PTPN11 gene in a patient with Noonan syndrome and rapidly progressive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.	UNLABELLED: A male infant with clinical features of Noonan syndrome and rapidly progressive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is reported. He manifested severe heart failure and failure to thrive. Administration of propranolol and cibenzoline improved ventricular outflow tract obstruction, leading to catch-up growth. Genetic analysis of the patient revealed a novel missense mutation in the PTPN11 gene. CONCLUSION: This is the first description of a patient with a Gln510Glu mutation in the protein-tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 11 gene. This specific mutation may be associated with a rapidly progressive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
30141192	Dermatological manifestations in cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome: a prospective multicentric study of 45 mutation-positive patients.	BACKGROUND: Data on dermatological manifestations of cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome (CFCS) remain heterogeneous and almost without expert dermatological classification. OBJECTIVES: To describe the dermatological manifestations of CFCS; to compare them with the literature findings; to assess those discriminating CFCS from other RASopathies, including Noonan syndrome (NS) and Costello syndrome (CS); and to test for dermatological phenotype-genotype correlations. METHODS: We performed a 4-year, large, prospective, multicentric, collaborative dermatological and genetic study. RESULTS: Forty-five patients were enrolled. Hair abnormalities were ubiquitous, including scarcity or absence of eyebrows and wavy or curly hair in 73% and 69% of patients, respectively. Keratosis pilaris (KP), ulerythema ophryogenes (UO), palmoplantar hyperkeratosis (PPHK) and multiple melanocytic naevi (MMN; over 50 naevi) were noted in 82%, 44%, 27% and 29% of patients, respectively. Scarcity or absence of eyebrows, association of UO and PPHK, diffuse KP and MMN best differentiated CFCS from NS and CS. Oral acitretin may be highly beneficial for therapeutic management of PPHK, whereas treatment of UO by topical sirolimus 1% failed. No significant dermatological phenotype-genotype correlation was determined. CONCLUSIONS: A thorough knowledge of CFCS skin manifestations would help in making a positive diagnosis and differentiating CFCS from CS and NS.
9343272	Growth hormone therapy in pre-pubertal children with Noonan syndrome: first year growth response and comparison with Turner syndrome.	We studied the growth-promoting effect of treatment with recombinant human growth hormone in 23 pre-pubertal children with Noonan syndrome, aged between 5.4 and 14.3 y, and all with a height < 1.4 SD for Tanner standards. The growth response and skeletal maturation after 1 y of recombinant human growth hormone treatment (0.15 U/kg/day given by daily injection) in the Noonan syndrome patients was compared with the auxological changes observed in a group of 17 girls with Turner syndrome with a comparable age and height deficit who were treated with recombinant human growth hormone in a similar way. During 1 y of treatment, the mean +/- SD height velocity increased by 4.0 +/- 1.6 cm/y in the Noonan syndrome group and by 3.6 +/- 1.3 cm/y in the Turner syndrome group. Height SDS for chronological age in the Noonan syndrome group increased by 0.53 +/- 0.46 (p < 0.001). In the Noonan syndrome patients the changes in height velocity were positively related to birthweight (r = 0.48, p < 0.05). The changes in height velocity or height SDS were not related to the age, height deficit or a delay in bone age maturation at start of treatment. In neither the patients with Noonan syndrome nor Turner syndrome was an acceleration of bone maturation found. We conclude that treatment with recombinant human growth hormone in pre-pubertal NS patients induces an increase in height velocity and height SDS comparable to that observed in Turner syndrome girls.
38640176	Indocyanine green lymphography in the congenital chylothorax and chylous ascites.	BACKGROUND: The prognosis of congenital chylothorax and ascites ranges from spontaneous resolution to death, but no established examination exists to predict the prognosis. We aimed to develop a clinically useful method to evaluate lymphatic abnormalities using indocyanine green (ICG) lymphography in infants with congenital chylothorax and ascites. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated infants with congenital chylothorax and chylous ascites who underwent ICG lymphography in our hospital between 2012 and 2022. The ICG lymphography findings was evaluated. We defined the dermal backflow in the trunk as the lymphatic flow from the end of the limb back through the lymphatic vessels on the surface of the trunk. The association between the dermal backflow in the trunk and clinical outcomes, as follows, are investigated: the duration of the drainage period, the duration of endotracheal intubation, and the length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Twenty infants had a dermal backflow in the trunk, and ten did not. Clinical outcomes in infants with and without dermal backflow in the trunk were as follows (median): the duration of the drainage period (20 vs. 0 days, p = 0.001), the duration of endotracheal intubation (12 vs. 2 days, p = 0.04), and the length of hospital stay (62 vs. 41 days, p = 0.04), respectively. In multivariate linear regression analysis adjusted for gestational age, the duration of the drainage period was correlated with the dermal backflow in the trunk [exp(B) = 2.62; p = 0.003]. CONCLUSIONS: The dermal backflow in the trunk in ICG lymphography was useful in predicting the clinical course of congenital chylothorax and ascites.
23182818	Spectrum of insulin-like growth factor deficiency.	There are eight known genetic causes of short stature characterized by low serum IGF-1 (IGF-1 deficiency, IGFD) and normal GH secretion. One of these (GHSR defect) is a form of secondary IGFD, although the GH peak in provocation tests can be normal. Bioinactive GH (GH1 mutations) can disturb GH secretion, but also GH binding and signaling. The remaining conditions are classified as primary IGFD (GH insensitivity). The clinical phenotype of GH receptor (GHR) defects is variable. Of the three GH signal transduction defects, a STAT5B defect is well established, but abnormalities in the MAPK pathway (such as PTPN11 mutations in Noonan syndrome) and NF-kB pathway (IkBalpha mutation) may also cause IGFD. Homozygous IGFALS defects are relatively common, and lead to moderate growth failure, very low serum IGF-1 and even lower IGFBP-3, while a heterozygous IGFALS mutation decreases height by 1 SD. Most cases with a homozygous IGF1 defect are very short, microcephalic, and deaf, but heterozygous mutations may also lead to short stature. IGFD can also have a digenic or oligogenic origin. The diagnostic yield of genetic testing in children with a height <-2.5 SDS and a serum IGF-1 <-2 appears sufficient to perform genetic tests for known candidate genes.
21983781	Two cases of Noonan syndrome: aortic coarctation causing a giant aneurysm of the descending aorta.	
34242782	Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in a patient with Noonan syndrome: A rare autoinflammatory complication or coincidence?	We describe a 13-years-old girl, previously diagnosed with PTPN11-associated Noonan Syndrome (NS), who presented to the pediatric emergency department for fever and drowsiness, which gradually worsened within 48 h. On admission, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed diffuse, symmetric, multiple, poorly demarcated, confluent hyperintense lesions on MRI T2w-images, located in the Central Nervous System (CNS). In the absence of a better explanation and according to the current diagnostic criteria, a diagnosis of Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM) was performed. The patient was first treated with intravenous methylprednisolone, then with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Owing to the poor clinical response, three sessions of therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) were finally performed, with a progressive improvement. Follow-up MRI performed after three months from the onset revealed a considerable reduction in brain lesions, while cervical and dorsal ones were substantially unmodified. Neurological examination showed a full recovery of cognitive function and improved strength and tone of the upper limbs, while tetrahyporeflexia and proximal weakness of lower limbs were still appreciable. To date, this is the first described case of ADEM occurring in a patient with NS.
7500608	[Pulmonary lymphangiectasis with spontaneous chylothorax in Noonan syndrome].	We report a case of Noonan syndrome associated with pulmonary stenosis and major lymphedema of the lower extremities. At the age of 15 yr spontaneous chylothorax with increasing dyspnea occurred> Chest-x-ray demonstrated increased interstitial markings restricted to the right lower lobe representing pulmonary lymphangiectasia. The chylothorax did not respond to repeated thoracocentesis and medium-chain-triglyceride diet. When a chest tube was inserted and total parenteral nutrition was supplied, the chylous effusion decreased within 32 days. The patient is still on diet and asymptomatic effusion remained during 12 months follow up. In conclusion, pulmonary lympgangiectasia should be considered in patients with Noonan syndrome and an abnormal interstitial pulmonary pattern similar to pulmonary congestion (without any hemodynamic abnormalities). In case of pleural effusion, chylothorax should be considered.
1456257	Spontaneous chylothorax in Noonan syndrome. Treatment with prednisone.	OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of spontaneous chylothorax in a child with Noonan syndrome successfully treated with prednisone. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: A pediatric cardiology referral center for the Rocky Mountain region. PATIENT: An 18-month-old girl with Noonan's syndrome, pulmonary stenosis, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who presented with spontaneous chylothorax. INTERVENTIONS: The child's chylothorax did not respond to thoracic duct ligation, tetracycline pleurodesis, and pleurectomy during a 2-month period. A low-fat diet was helpful but did not eliminate the problem. Prednisone was started orally at 1 mg/kg per dose twice daily and slowly tapered during 3 months. The chylothorax did not recur during 8 months of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Prednisone may be useful in the treatment of chylothorax in Noonan syndrome. A controlled clinical trial would be helpful but would be difficult in such a rare complication of an uncommon syndrome.
32111381	The Evaluation of Hematologic Screening and Perioperative Management in Patients with Noonan Syndrome: A Retrospective Chart Review.	OBJECTIVES: To assess the potential impact of using screening recommendations for bleeding disorders in patients with Noonan syndrome on perioperative bleeding complications. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a retrospective, single-site cohort study; patients were identified by query of the electronic medical record. All patients with a clinical diagnosis of Noonan syndrome over a 10-year period were included. Data on surgeries, hematologic evaluation, bleeding symptoms, and bleeding complications were extracted. Surgeries were graded as major or minor. RESULTS: We identified 101 patients with Noonan syndrome, 70 of whom required surgery for a total of 164 procedures. Nine patients (9/70; 12.8%) had bleeding complications, occurring in those without comprehensive testing or perioperative intervention and undergoing major or dental surgery. Based on these findings, the risk of a bleeding complication for patients with Noonan syndrome who did not have comprehensive testing or perioperative intervention was 6.2% (95% CI 2.3%-10.1%), indicating the number needed to treat or screen would be 16 to prevent 1 bleeding complication (95% CI 9.9-43.9). The majority of patients had either no or incomplete evaluation (59 of 101; 58.4%). CONCLUSIONS: With proper evaluation and management, the bleeding risk in patients with Noonan syndrome can be minimized. Efforts are needed to address the knowledge and implementation gap in this evaluation.
23763990	Impaired motor cortex plasticity in patients with Noonan syndrome.	OBJECTIVE: Noonan syndrome (NS; OMIM 163950) is a developmental disorder caused by activating mutations in various components of the RAS-MAPK pathway. Recent in vitro studies demonstrated impairment of synaptic plasticity caused by RAS-MAPK pathway hyperactivity. Induction of synaptic plasticity critically depends on the level of attention. We therefore studied the induction of synaptic plasticity in patients with NS and healthy volunteers under different conditions of attention using transcranial magnetic stimulation. METHODS: We investigated 10 patients with NS and healthy controls (HC) using paired associative stimulation (PAS) with different attention levels (unspecific, visual and electrical attention control). Changes in motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes were assessed immediately after as well as 30 and 60 min after PAS. RESULTS: We demonstrated that MEP amplitudes of healthy controls significantly increased from 1.00 +- 0.17 to 1.74 +- 0.50 mV (p=0.001), which was not seen in patients with Noonan-Syndrome (0.88 +- 0.09 to 1.10 +- 0.48 mV, p=0.148) and there was a significant difference between both groups (p=0.003) when using an unspecific attention control. Under specific electrical attention control, MEP amplitudes decreased significantly in patients with NS, whereas a visual attention focus diminished synaptic plasticity in healthy controls. CONCLUSION: Our study provides evidence that synaptic plasticity is impaired in patients with NS, which is probably a consequence of constitutive activity of the RAS-MAPK pathway. The induction of synaptic plasticity in these patients critically depends on attention. SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first study that indicates reduced synaptic plasticity in patients with a RAS-pathway disorder. Our results may have direct implications for learning and memory strategies in patients with a RAS-pathway disorder.
10668781	Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation in a patient with Noonan syndrome.	Noonan syndrome, an autosomal dominant disease occurring with an incidence of 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 2,500 live births, is characterized by its particular cardiovascular abnormalities, including pulmonic valve stenosis, pulmonary artery stenosis, and, more rarely, septal defects and coarctation of the aorta. The case of a 20-year-old man admitted for inpatient cardiopulmonary rehabilitation after pulmonic valve repair, left pulmonary artery angioplasty, and pectus excavatum repair is presented. His endurance was markedly decreased, thus limiting his ability to perform activities of daily living and reducing his exercise tolerance. With participation in a comprehensive cardiopulmonary rehabilitation program, he experienced marked improvement with independence in his activities of daily living and an increase in his metabolic equivalent levels from to 2.8 to 5.4. After inpatient rehabilitation, he underwent left pulmonary stent placement before being discharged home. Subsequent outpatient cardiopulmonary rehabilitation has continued to improve significantly his overall exercise tolerance. Given that Noonan syndrome is viewed as the most common syndrome associated with congenital heart disease after Down syndrome, physiatrists must be familiar with its presentation, its associated abnormalities, and the treatment approach to optimize the patient's cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal, and psychological status.
30410095	Nonimmune hydrops fetalis: identifying the underlying genetic etiology.	PURPOSE: Numerous etiologies may lead to nonimmune hydrops fetalis (NIHF), and the underlying cause often remains unclear. We aimed to determine the proportion of NIHF cases in which the etiology was clearly determined in a large, contemporary, and diverse cohort, as well as to describe the etiologies with a focus on genetic causes. METHODS: Retrospective review of NIHF cases between 2015 and 2017 from the five University of California Fetal-Maternal Consortium sites. Singleton pregnancies with prenatally diagnosed NIHF were included, and cases with maternal alloimmunization were excluded. Cases were categorized as being of confirmed, suspected, or unknown etiology. RESULTS: Sixty-five NIHF cases were identified. Forty-six percent (30/65) remained of unknown etiology, while 9.2% (6/65) had a suspected etiology and 44.6% (29/65) were of confirmed etiology. Among confirmed cases, 11 resulted from aneuploidy; 7 from fetal structural anomalies; 2 each from fetal arrhythmia, Noonan syndrome, and generalized lymphatic dysplasia; and 1 each from arthrogryposis, parvovirus, neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia, fetal goiter, and Kasabach-Merritt syndrome. CONCLUSION: In this contemporary, multicenter study, the cause of prenatally diagnosed NIHF was confirmed in only 44% of cases, and a genetic etiology was found in only 25% of those that received standard of care genetic testing.
27565148	Impaired synaptic plasticity in RASopathies: a mini-review.	Synaptic plasticity in the form of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) is considered to be the neurophysiological correlate of learning and memory. Impairments are discussed to be one of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of developmental disorders. In so-called RASopathies [e.g., neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1)], neurocognitive impairments are frequent and are affected by components of the RAS pathway which lead to impairments in synaptic plasticity. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) provides a non-invasive method to investigate synaptic plasticity in humans. Here, we review studies using TMS to evaluate synaptic plasticity in patients with RASopathies. Patients with NF1 and Noonan syndrome (NS) showed reduced cortical LTP-like synaptic plasticity. In contrast, increased LTP-like synaptic plasticity has been shown in Costello syndrome. Notably, lovastatin normalized impaired LTP-like plasticity and increased intracortical inhibition in patients with NF1. TMS has been shown to be a safe and efficient method to investigate synaptic plasticity and intracortical inhibition in patients with RASopathies. Deeper insights in impairments of synaptic plasticity in RASopathies could help to develop new options for the therapy of learning deficits in these patients.
28524213	[Update on the treatment of RASopathies].	INTRODUCTION: The term 'RASopathies' covers a series of diseases that present mutations in the genes that code for the proteins of the RAS/MAPK pathway. These diseases include neurofibromatosis type 1, Noonan syndrome, Legius syndrome, LEOPARD syndrome, Costello syndrome and cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome. Involvement of the RAS/MAPK pathway not only increases predisposition to develop tumours, but also determines the presence of phenotypic anomalies and alterations in learning processes. AIM: To review the use of therapeutic strategies with mechanisms that have a selective action on RASopathies. DEVELOPMENT: The fact that the RAS pathway is involved in a third of all neoplasms has led to the development and study of different drugs at this level. Some of these pharmaceutical agents have been tested in RASopathies, mainly in neurofibromatosis type 1. Here we analyse the use of different antitarget treatments: drugs that act on the membrane receptors, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, in the mTOR pathway or MEK inhibitors. These latter have shown potential benefits in recent studies conducted on different RASopathies. CONCLUSIONS: Today, thanks to the results from the first studies conducted with MEK inhibitor based mainly on animal models, a number of promising clinical trials are being carried out.
26347436	A Novel Use of Methylene Blue in the Pediatric ICU.	Methylene blue (MB) is a medication commonly used to treat methemoglobinemia, reducing methemoglobin to hemoglobin. A novel use of MB, as detailed here, is in the treatment of refractory hypotension. A number of reports have detailed use of MB for this purpose in adults, but few data in pediatrics. A 22-month-old girl with Noonan syndrome, biventricular hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and chronic positive pressure ventilation developed shock with tachycardia, hypotension, and fever after 3 days of diarrhea. She was critically ill, with warm extremities, bounding pulses, and brisk capillary refill. Laboratory tests revealed metabolic acidosis, low mixed venous oxygen saturation, and leukocytosis with bandemia. Treatment of severe septic shock was initiated with fluid resuscitation, inotropic support, sedation, and paralysis. She remained hypotensive despite norepinephrine at 0.7 mug/kg per minute, dopamine at 20 mug/kg per minute, and vasopressin at 0.04 U/kg per hour. Her vasoplegic shock worsened, despite aggressive conventional therapy. Intravenous MB was initiated, with a loading dose of 1 mg/kg followed by a continuous infusion at 0.25 mg/kg per hour. Upon initiation of MB, her systolic blood pressure increased by 33 points (40% increase), and diastolic blood pressure increased by 20 points (46% increase). She was able to wean off all inotropes quickly after initiation of MB. MB should be considered in the setting of refractory vasoplegic shock in the PICU. 
31913576	Advancing RAS/RASopathy therapies: An NCI-sponsored intramural and extramural collaboration for the study of RASopathies.	RASopathies caused by germline pathogenic variants in genes that encode RAS pathway proteins. These disorders include neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), Noonan syndrome (NS), cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome (CFC), and Costello syndrome (CS), and others. RASopathies are characterized by heterogenous manifestations, including congenital heart disease, failure to thrive, and increased risk of cancers. Previous work led by the NCI Pediatric Oncology Branch has altered the natural course of one of the key manifestations of the RASopathy NF1. Through the conduct of a longitudinal cohort study and early phase clinical trials, the MEK inhibitor selumetinib was identified as the first active therapy for the NF1-related peripheral nerve sheath tumors called plexiform neurofibromas (PNs). As a result, selumetinib was granted breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA for the treatment of PN. Other RASopathy manifestations may also benefit from RAS targeted therapies. The overall goal of Advancing RAS/RASopathy Therapies (ART), a new NCI initiative, is to develop effective therapies and prevention strategies for the clinical manifestations of the non-NF1 RASopathies and for tumors characterized by somatic RAS mutations. This report reflects discussions from a February 2019 initiation meeting for this project, which had broad international collaboration from basic and clinical researchers and patient advocates.
11316696	Short stature in Noonan syndrome: response to growth hormone therapy.	BACKGROUND: Growth hormone (GH) has been used to promote growth in both the short and long term in a number of dysmorphic syndromes, including Turner syndrome. As this condition shares many clinical features with Noonan syndrome, it would seem logical to treat the latter group with GH. AIMS: To assess the short and long term response to GH therapy in patients with Noonan syndrome. METHODS: Analysis of patients with Noonan syndrome in the Pharmacia & Upjohn International Growth Study (this post-marketing database contains data on the majority of patients currently treated with GH in the UK). A questionnaire was also sent to participating clinicians. RESULTS: Data on 66 patients (54 males) were available for study. At the start of GH therapy children were short, compared with both normal and Noonan children. During the first year of GH therapy height velocity increased from a mean of 4.9 to 7.2 cm per year. For patients treated long term with GH, mean height SDS increased from -2.9 pretreatment to -2.6 after one year and -2.3 after five years. Of the 10 patients at near final height, only one had a height above the 3rd centile for normal adults and above the mean for untreated Noonan patients. The mean increment in final height was 3.1 cm (range -1.1 to 6.5 cm). CONCLUSIONS: GH therapy in patients with Noonan syndrome will improve height velocity in the short term. Longer-term therapy results in a waning of effect; initial indications are that final height is not improved substantially in most patients.
18837814	Percutaneous transluminal septal myocardial ablation in a child with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and Noonan syndrome.	We report an 8-year-old child presenting with classical features of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and Noonan syndrome with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III symptoms. Due to progressively worsening symptoms, the child was taken up for percutaneous transluminal septal myocardial ablation, which was successfully performed. Postextrasystolic gradient fell down from 125 to 35 mm Hg. Other than postprocedure bifascicular block, no complications were encountered till 1 year of follow-up.
34363648	Disseminated lymphangiomas as a cutaneous manifestation of Noonan syndrome.	Lymphangioma is a known, but rare manifestation of Noonan syndrome. We present the case of disseminated and circumscribed cutaneous lymphangiomas in the context of Noonan syndrome. Oral rapamycin is a promising treatment in these extensive and morbidity-causing cases.
8992869	Cardiovascular abnormalities in Noonan syndrome: the clinical findings and treatments.	The clinical findings and treatment of cardiovascular abnormalities in 33 patients with Noonan syndrome are reviewed. Major cardiovascular abnormalities were pulmonary valvular stenosis in 17 patients (51.1%), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in 11 (33.3%), and atrial septal defect in 9 (27.3%). Dysplastic pulmonary valve was seen in 6 (35.3%). Balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty was performed for 4 patients with dysplastic pulmonary valves. Two patients were successfully treated. Surgical treatment was performed in 13 patients, 11 alive and 2 died. Two patients with HCM and arrhythmia died suddenly. In conclusion, balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty should be the initial palliation for dysplastic pulmonary valve in Noonan syndrome, and HCM is the risk factor for sudden death in Noonan syndrome.
34446079	Dietary treatment of congenital chylothorax with skimmed breast milk.	BACKGROUND: Congenital chylothorax (CC) is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition in newborns. It is defined as an accumulation of chyle in the pleural cavity. The few publications regarding medical management and therapeutic dietary intervention motivated us to share our experience. METHODS: Neonates diagnosed with congenital chylothorax and treated at Innsbruck Medical University Hospital between 2013 and 2020 (n = 6, gestational age: 36 3/7, 32 5/7, 36 4/7, 35 0/7, 35 4/7, 37 3/7 weeks) were eligible for this report. The cornerstones of treatment for chylothorax conventionally consist of chest tube drainage (CTD), respiratory support, dietary restriction of long-chain triglycerides (LCT) or total parenteral nutrition (TPN). In further course the introduction of a medium-chain triglyceride (MCT)-based formula followed by an overlapping switch to a formula with low LCT and high MCT, containing the essential long-chain fatty acids (LCFA), is attempted. In three patients we used fat-modified (skimmed) breast milk to provide a high protein and low fat diet and to avoid the discontinuation of breast milk. RESULTS: The outcome of an early introduction of LCFA in the form of skimmed breast milk after resolution of chylothorax diverse. One patient had a favourable outcome, meaning no recurrence of pleural effusion, adequate weight gain and a content mother, while another patient had a relapse of pleural effusion after the administration of skimmed milk and was therefore transitioned back to Basic F  . The CC of patient 5 was difficult due to Noonan syndrome. Two weeks after the introduction of skimmed breast milk the mother wanted to stop to express breast milk, so nutrition was changed to Basic F . CONCLUSION: The first-line therapy of chylothorax is a combination of respiratory stabilization and dietary modification. The use of skimmed breast milk is advisable in CC and feasible by means of a simple milk defatting procedure. It offers benefits to mothers who wish to resume breast feeding after resolution of chylothorax and has proven positive effects, above all in preterm infants as optimal nutrition with protective components superior to formula feeding. However, the nutritional analysis of the skimmed milk and the correlation to a re-accumulation of pleural fluid remains a question to be answered.
17028394	[Clinical symptoms and molecular pathogenesis of Noonan syndrome--current concepts].	Noonan syndrome (NS; MIM 163950) is an autosomal dominant disorder. With incidence of 1/1000 to 1/2500 live births, NS belongs to the most common genetic disorders. Typical features of NS are: short stature, chest deformities, congenital heart defects, cryptorchidism and dysmorphic features. Mutations of PTPN11 gene (located on chromosome 12q24.1) are responsible for NS and are identified in 33-60% cases. Less than half of the cases are familial. This paper presents current opinion on clinical symptoms, molecular pathogenesis and possibilities of growth hormone therapy. The genotype--phenotype correlation is also discussed.

32569210	Warfarin-induced impairment of bone material quality in a patient undergoing maintenance hemodialysis: A case report.	INTRODUCTION: The use of warfarin in patients undergoing hemodialysis is associated with decreased bone mineral density and an increased incidence of bone fracture. However, no studies to date have directly estimated bone quality with bone histomorphometry in patients with bone abnormalities who are taking warfarin and undergoing hemodialysis. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 47-year-old female with Noonan syndrome presented with progressive bilateral lower extremity pain on walking, and skin sclerosis. She had been undergoing maintenance hemodialysis for 25 years following 2 years of peritoneal dialysis for chronic glomerulonephritis. She had been taking warfarin as an anticoagulant agent for 13 years after she underwent an aortic valve replacement. DIAGNOSIS: Warfarin-induced impairment of bone material quality. INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOMES: Histomorphometric analysis of the bone biopsy specimens showed impairment in bone calcification processes, a high turnover of bone remodeling, low bone volume, and mild fibrosis. The bone abnormality could not be categorized into any type of representative bone disease classification such as osteitis fibrosa, osteomalacia, adynamic bone disease, uremic osteodystrophy, or hyperparathyroidism, but was consistent with warfarin-induced impairment of bone material quality. CONCLUSION: Warfarin can induce impairment of bone material quality in a patient undergoing hemodialysis.

30382642	[General Anesthesia for Septal Myectomy in a Patient with Noonan Syndrome, Severe Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy and Right Ventricular Outflow Tract Obstruction].	We report a case of an 18-year-old man with Noonan syndrome, severe hypertrophic obstructive cardiomy- opathy and right ventricular outflow tract obstruction who underwent septal myectomy under general anes- thesia. In our case, the ventricular outflow tract pres- sure gradients were 108 mmHg at left and 79 mmHg at right. General anesthesia was induced deliberately by fentanyl, midazolam and sevoflurane. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane. For treatment of hypotension, we performed volume loading and admin- istration of phenylephrine. We did not use drugs that increase heart rate or contractility. Preload and after- load were well maintained, and the operation and gen- eral anesthesia were completed without serious prob- lem.
26803093	Noonan Syndrome Complicated by Primary Pulmonary Lymphangiectasia.	Noonan syndrome is a genetic disorder that has several features common to other conditions, making diagnosis a challenge. This column summarizes the case of a neonate with an atypical presentation of Noonan syndrome involving a fatal type of lymphangiectasia resulting in persistent pleural effusions. Radiographic features of this condition are presented along with the complexities of diagnosis and treatment. 
38309657	Congenital ectropion in Noonan syndrome.	Ten-year-old female patient, with facial dysmorphia, scoliosis, short stature, muscular hypotonia, patent foramen ovale and maturational delay, presented for correction of bilateral congenital ectropion. Ophthalmological examination revealed bilateral lower eyelid ectropion, euryblepharon and lagophthalmos, with a positive Bell's phenomenon. She was treated with full-thickness autologous skin grafts on the lower eyelids with bilateral lateral canthoplasty, resolving the ectropion and improving eyelid occlusion. Subsequently, a genetic study was performed that revealed a mutation in the PTPN11 gene and allowed, together with the clinical picture, to make the diagnosis of Noonan syndrome. Noonan syndrome is a multisystem genetic disorder with a wide variety of phenotypes, which usually presents with ocular and periocular disorders. Eyelid ectropion, a distinctive feature of this patient, is a rare ophthalmological manifestation of this syndrome that can be corrected with full-thickness skin graft and lateral canthoplasty.
8662049	Noonan syndrome with double-chambered right ventricle.	The association of Noonan syndrome and a double-chambered right ventricle has not been reported previously in the medical literature. We report two patients with Noonan syndrome associated with pulmonary valve stenosis and double-chambered right ventricle due to anomalous hypertrophied muscle bundles. Pulmonary valve stenosis was operated on. However, hypertrophied muscle bundles were not resected, as they caused no obstruction to blood passage. Postoperative follow-up examinations revealed no symptoms. In conclusion, in those with Noonan syndrome there may be anomalous muscle bundles in the right ventricular cavity. It may not be necessary to resect them if they do not obstruct the right ventricular outflow tract.
25575339	Surgical Orthodontic Treatment for Open Bite in Noonan Syndrome Patient: A Case Report.	Noonan syndrome, characterized by short stature, facial anomalies, and congenital heart defects, may also be associated with hematopoietic disorders. Craniofacial anomalies in affected patients include hypertelorism and severe open bite associated with masticatory dysfunction. We treated a Noonan syndrome patient with a skeletal open bite. Surgical orthodontic treatment including two-jaw surgery established a good occlusal relationship after correction of severe anemia. Both upper and lower incisors were moved to upright positions, while clockwise rotation of the palatal plane and decreased mandibular plane angle were accomplished. Lower masticatory activity may affect posttreatment occlusion in such cases.
8417053	Five-year follow-up after balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty.	OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess results 5 years after balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty. BACKGROUND: Since the technique of balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty was first reported in 1982, it has become the treatment of choice for pulmonary valve stenosis. In contrast to surgical valvotomy, the long-term outcome after balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty is unknown. METHODS: We reviewed the findings in 34 patients 5.2 +/- 0.8 (mean +/- SD) years after balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty: 27 with isolated pulmonary stenosis, 5 with Noonan syndrome and 2 with previous surgical valvotomy. In eight patients (three with Noonan syndrome), a second balloon valvuloplasty was the index procedure for analysis. RESULTS: The transpulmonary gradient (mm Hg) was 74 +/- 34 before balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty, 36 +/- 26 immediately after, 22 +/- 9 at cardiac catheterization in 29 patients 6 +/- 0.6 months later and 19 +/- 10 by Doppler study at 5 years. At 5 years 26 patients (group A) had a residual gradient of < or = 20 mm Hg; the remaining 8 (group B) had a gradient of > 20 mm Hg. Four group B patients had Noonan syndrome (p = 0.01). Balloon/pulmonary valve diameter ratio was larger for group A patients than for group B patients with isolated pulmonary stenosis (1.20 +/- 0.10 vs. 1.00 +/- 0.07, p = 0.005); larger balloons were used in group B patients with Noonan syndrome (1.30 +/- 0.10). Group A patients were more likely than group B patients to have significant pulmonary incompetence (6 of 24 vs. 0 of 8) and had a greater right ventricle/left ventricle long-axis diastolic dimension ratio (0.47 +/- 0.10 vs. 0.35 +/- 0.04, p = 0.05). In the subgroup of five patients with Noonan syndrome and two with prior surgical valvotomy, the transpulmonary gradient was reduced from 74 +/- 24 mm Hg before balloon valvuloplasty to 23 +/- 12 mm Hg at 5 years. In addition, two patients with isolated pulmonary valve stenosis had pulmonary valve dysplasia by angiographic criteria: transpulmonary gradients of 85 and 56 mm Hg were reduced to 20 and 11 mm Hg, respectively, at 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Relief of obstruction persists at 5 years especially if oversized balloons are used. Acceptable results can be obtained in patients with a dysplastic valve. More complete relief of right ventricular outflow gradient is associated with increased right ventricular dimension, probably because more pulmonary incompetence is induced. This is well tolerated at 5 years but may be important in the longer term.
29642153	DRESS syndrome with thrombotic microangiopathy revealing a Noonan syndrome: Case report.	RATIONALE: The life-threatening drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome occurs most commonly after exposure to drugs, clinical features mimic those found with other serious systemic disorders. It is rarely associated with thrombotic microangiopathy. PATIENT CONCERNS: We describe the unique case of a 44-year-old man who simultaneously experienced DRESS syndrome with thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) after a 5 days treatment with fluindione. DIAGNOSES: Clinical evaluation leads to the discovery of an underlying lymphangiomatosis, due to a Noonan syndrome. INTERVETIONS: The anticoagulant was withdrawn, and corticosteroids (1 mg/kg/day) and acenocoumarol were started. OUTCOMES: Clinical improvement ensued. At follow-up the patient is well. LESSONS: The association of DRESS with TMA is a rare condition; we believe that the presence of the underlying Noonan syndrome could have been the trigger. Moreover, we speculate about the potential interrelations between these entities.
26967823	Biopsy-Induced Duodenal Hematoma Is Not an Infrequent Complication Favored by Bone Marrow Transplantation.	OBJECTIVES: Intraduodenal hematoma (IDH) is an uncommon complication of endoscopic duodenal biopsy that can cause severe obstruction of the digestive, biliary, or pancreatic tracts. We aimed to analyze the risk factors and outcomes of biopsy-induced IDH in our series. METHODS: Between 2010 and 2014, a retrospective chart review was conducted for all children younger than 18 years of age treated for IDH. We collected their data in our tertiary pediatric center and compared them to those of controls matched for age, sex, and pathology. RESULTS: Among 2705 upper nontherapeutic endoscopies and 1163 duodenal biopsies, 7 IDH occurred in 6 children suspected of developing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and in 1 patient with Noonan syndrome. The IDH prevalence was significantly higher after BMT compared to children who did not undergo grafting (7% vs 0.1%; P = 7.9 x 10; odds ratio = 82). After a median delay of 48 hours, patients developed intestinal obstruction with abdominal pain and vomiting. The diagnosis was confirmed by using ultrasonography or computed tomography scans. Acute pancreatitis was determined in 3 out of 7 patients. Conservative treatment allowed complete resolution in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: IDH is not an infrequent complication of endoscopic duodenal biopsy, especially in patients who undergo BMT. Endoscopists should be especially careful during the duodenal biopsy procedure in these patients. With no early perforation due to post-biopsy IDH reported, the prognosis is good and conservative management generally leads to resolution of the symptoms in 2 to 3 weeks.
20200638	Pulmonary stenosis as a predisposing factor for infective endocarditis in a patient with Noonan syndrome.	Noonan syndrome is an autosomal dominant dysmorphic syndrome. Pulmonary stenosis is the most common cardiac anomaly in Noonan patients, with an incidence of 60%. A 9-year-old girl was referred to our institution with pericardial effusion. Transthoracic echocardiography indeed confirmed massive pericardial effusion and revealed, further, valvular and arterial pulmonary vegetations that accompanied a dysplastic tricuspid pulmonary valve. We decided to perform emergency pericardial tube drainage and to continue the anti-biotic regimen for 2 more weeks before undertaking open-heart surgery. After 2 weeks, the patient underwent an operation wherein the valvular vegetations were excised and a pulmonary valve commissurotomy was performed, yielding a competent pulmonary valve with 3 distinct but moderately dysplastic cusps. In addition to the pulmonary valve, the main, left, and right pulmonary arteries were filled with mobile vegetations, which were removed during the procedure. In this patient, a dysplastic and stenotic pulmonary valve may have contributed to the progression of endocarditis and to the growth of vegetations that occupied the pulmonary arteries. In conclusion, we hypothesize that although pulmonary stenosis is not considered a common predisposing factor for infective endocarditis, it can contribute to the progression of infective endocarditis in Noonan patients.
22499187	Prenatal management and thoracoamniotic shunting in primary fetal pleural effusions: a single centre experience.	OBJECTIVE: Primary fetal pleural effusions are rare. If severe, thoracoamniotic shunting is needed. Our objective was to study the management and outcomes of pleural effusions in our unit. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of primary fetal hydrothorax between 1991 and 2010. RESULTS: Of 41 cases, 23 (56%) were hydropic, and 27 (66%) required shunting. Overall, 2 (4.8%) were diagnosed with a chromosomal condition and 4 (9.6%) with a congenital condition (3 Noonan syndrome, 1 mild structural cardiac defect). There were 5 terminations of pregnancy (TOP), 3 in utero deaths and 33 liveborn neonates (80%). Intact survival rate was 44% (12/27) among those shunted, 56% (23/41) among all cases and 70% (23/33) among all liveborn neonates. Most (87.5%) neonatal deaths occurred in newborns delivered before 34 weeks of gestation. The survival rate was higher in nonhydropic compared with hydropic fetuses (85% vs 47%). There were no procedure-related fetal losses. One in utero death was complicated by fatal maternal amniotic embolism. CONCLUSION: Fetuses with pleural effusions should undergo expert prenatal workup. Hydropic fetuses and those with massive effusions are candidates for thoracoamniotic shunting.
33625084	Therapy-related Myeloid Neoplasms in Children: A Single-institute Study.	Therapy-related myeloid neoplasm (t-MN) in the pediatric population is not well characterized. We studied 12 pediatric patients diagnosed with t-MN in our institution since 2006. The median age at the t-MN diagnoses was 14.8 years (range, 9 to 20 y). The primary malignancies included 9 solid tumors and 3 hematopoietic malignancies. Rhabdomyosarcoma (n=4) was the most common primary malignancy. Five of the 9 patients with solid tumors and all 3 patients with hematopoietic malignancies had primary neoplasms involving bone marrow. The median latency period was 5.2 years (range, 1.8 to 13.8 y). Thrombocytopenia was present in all patients at the t-MN diagnoses. Complete or partial monosomy of chromosome 5 or 7 were the 2 most common cytogenetic abnormalities. A quarter of patients demonstrated a genetic predisposition to t-MN: 1 with Li-Fraumeni syndrome with a germline TP53 R248Q mutation, 1 with Noonan syndrome with a somatic mutation (PTPN11 S502T), and 1 with a constitutive chromosomal translocation [t(X;9)(p22;q34)] and a germline TP53 L130V mutation. Outcomes remain poor. Two patients survived 3 and 5.1 years after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
36709748	Fetal hydrothorax treated with pleuro-amniotic shunting: fetal and maternal complication and long-term outcomes.	Introduction We aimed to identify maternal and fetal complications and investigate post-natal and long-term outcomes of fetal hydrothorax (FHT) treated with pleuro-amniotic shunting (shunt). Methods Single-center retrospective observational cohort of shunt cases performed from 2000 to 2021. Risk factors for maternal complications, fetal demise, neonatal death (NND), and post-natal outcomes were identified. Results Out of 88 cases, 70 (79.5%) were complicated by hydrops, with an average gestational age (GA) at diagnosis of 27 weeks (range 16-34). In 16 cases, definitive etiology of FHT was identified; five cases of Noonan syndrome and three cases of monogenic disorders diagnosed by whole exome sequencing (EPHB4, VEGFR3, RASA1). Shunt was performed at an average GA of 28 weeks (20-34), with a dislodgement in 10 cases (11.4%). Maternal complications occurred in three cases; survival rate was 76.1% (67/88). Follow-up data were available for 57/67 (85.1%) children. Incidence of severe neurodevelopmental impairment and pneumopathy (broncho dysplasia, persistent pulmonary hypertension of newborn, and asthma) was 5.3% and 8.8%, respectively. Post-treatment persistence of hydrops, FHT associated with genetic syndromes, and GA at birth were risk factors for fetal demise, NND, and post-natal complications. Conclusion In truly isolated FHT, whenever indicated, pleuro-amniotic shunting is a safe procedure associated with good survival rate and long-term outcome.
28728859	[Multiple granular cell tumours in a patient with Noonan's syndrome and juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia].	BACKGROUND: Granular cell tumour (GCT) is a rare form of tumour comprising Schwann cells. Herein, we report a case of a child presenting Noonan syndrome complicated by juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML) and who also developed a multiple form of GCT. We discussed the molecular mechanisms that might account for this association. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A six-year-old boy with Noonan syndrome complicated by JMML presented three asymptomatic subcutaneous nodules on his back, forearm and neck. Histological analysis revealed GCT. A literature review revealed seven cases of Noonan syndrome presenting GCT, none of which were associated with JMML. Mutation of gene PTPN11, via hyperactivation of intracellular Ras signalling may cause the development of GCT and JMML in children presenting Noonan syndrome. DISCUSSION: Detailed clinical examination is recommended in children presenting GCT to screen for multiple forms and for signs of malformation suggestive of a genetic syndrome. Ours is the first case to be described of Noonan syndrome complicated by JMML associated with multiple GCT. This association once again raises the important question of the role of the Ras-MAPK signalling pathway in the development of benign and malignant tumours of solid organs or blood, associated with genetic syndromes.
12679651	Orbital rhabdomyosarcoma in Noonan syndrome.	The incidence of various benign and malignant tumors is increased in patients with Noonan syndrome compared with the general population. We present a 9-year-old boy with the typical features of Noonan syndrome and an acute nonaxial proptosis of the right eye. An ultrasound scan, a computed tomography scan, and magnetic resonance imaging raised suspicion of rhabdomyosarcoma. Biopsy confirmed the diagnosis. The tumor was consequently treated with combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Rhabdomyosarcoma is a rare but important differential diagnosis of tumor formation in children with Noonan syndrome and may arise in the orbit.
26061577	Repeated General Anesthesia in a Patient With Noonan Syndrome.	Noonan syndrome (NS) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by facial anomalies, short stature, chest deformity, congenital heart diseases, and other comorbidities. The challenges faced during anesthetic management of patients with NS could be due to congenital heart diseases, hemostatic disorders, and airway anomalies. Here we describe dental treatment under general anesthesia performed for a 28-year-old man with NS. He had characteristic features of NS along with mild pulmonary valve stenosis. Dental treatment under general anesthesia was performed successfully on 13 occasions with nasotracheal intubation under curve-tipped suction catheter guidance or insertion of a reinforced laryngeal mask airway. This case suggests that for patients with NS, who might present several challenges, dental anesthesiologists should consider the extent of the patient's disorders to enable them to perform dental treatment safely under general anesthesia. 
19927903	Genetic evaluation and management of fetal chylothorax: review and insights from a case of Noonan syndrome.	Fetal chylothorax is one of a very few syndromes that can be treated in utero with thoracoamniotic shunting or pleurodesis by OK-432 as two major therapeutic modalities. We report on a fetus with Noonan syndrome and a missense mutation c.182A > C (p.Asp61Ala) of PTPN11 who responded poorly to antenatal pleurodesis by OK-432. Based on our previous publication and this case study, we propose that fetal chylothorax of a distinct genetic origin may respond poorly to OK-432 pleurodesis.
33760797	Liver Transplantation From a Donor With Noonan Syndrome: Caveat Emptor.	
25480460	Congenital chylothorax: a prospective nationwide epidemiological study in Germany.	BACKGROUND: Congenital chylothorax (CCT) is a rare disease of unknown aetiology. Treatment approaches vary; none has been evaluated prospectively. OBJECTIVE: To prospectively determine incidence, treatment and outcome of infants with CCT born in Germany in 2012. DESIGN: CCT was defined as non-traumatic chylous pleural effusion within 28 days after birth. As part of the Surveillance Unit for Rare Pediatric Conditions in Germany (Erhebungseinheit fur seltene padiatrische Erkrankungen in Deutschland), all paediatric departments (n=432) received monthly reporting cards to notify the study centre of CCT cases, which were analysed based on anonymised questionnaires and discharge summaries. Data are shown as median (range) or n/N. RESULTS: Of 37 cases reported, 28 met inclusion criteria. Questionnaires and/or discharge summaries were available for 27/28. Assuming complete reporting, the incidence of CCT was 1:24 000. Nine infants suffered from proven or suspected syndromal anomalies, most frequently Noonan syndrome (5/9). Postnatally, 23 required mechanical ventilation, 3 continuous positive airway pressure; only 1 had no respiratory support. 17 infants were treated with inotropes/vasopressors, 25 required pleural drainage for 11 (1-36) days. In 13 infants, enteral feeds were withheld initially; 25 received medium-chain triglyceride diet at some time, 9 were treated with octreotide or somatostatin. 18 infants survived without, 6 with sequelae attributable to the underlying disorder; 3 infants died (median age at death 37 (2-144) days). Duration of hospital stay in survivors was 51 (20-127) days. Infants treated with octreotide or somatostatin had similar outcomes compared with those not treated. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this small observational study, CCT seems to have a favourable prognosis if not associated with genetic disorders.
22044365	Sudden onset of Chiari malformation Type I in previously asymptomatic patients.	Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I) is usually suspected in patients with slowly progressing neurological symptoms. However, in some instances, especially if syringomyelia is associated, an abrupt clinical onset is reported and is accompanied by an acknowledged risk of potentially severe clinical signs or even sudden death. Little is known about such a critical course in CM-I/syringomyelia complex.   The authors describe 3 challenging cases of the abrupt onset of CM-I/syringomyelia to reveal more information on the clinical presentation and pathogenetic mechanisms of this sudden and potentially severe clinical phenomenon: a 38-year-old man experienced acute respiratory failure requiring intubation following acute decompensation of hydrocephalus associated with Noonan syndrome, a 1-year-old boy had sudden hemiparesis and Horner syndrome after a minor head/neck injury, and a 2.5-year-old boy presented with quickly progressing tetraplegia and dyspnea after a mild flexion and extension neck injury a few hours before. All 3 patients showed a CM-I/syringomyelia complex at diagnosis, and all of them had a good neurological outcome after surgery despite the ominous clinical presentation.
37729965	Central giant cell granuloma: off-label treatment with Denosumab in a patient with Noonan syndrome.	This study aims to describe the utilization of Denosumab , a human monoclonal antibody against the RANK-L receptor, in a mandibular giant cell granuloma (GCG) with a significant local aggressiveness component that was unresponsive to surgical treatment. We present a case of a 19-year-old male patient diagnosed with Noonan syndrome, who presented a multifocal giant cell granuloma with aggressive behavior resistant to surgical treatment. Due to the functional and aesthetic implications associated with a surgical procedure, a decision was made to initiate medical treatment using Denosumab . Throughout the treatment, the patient presented excellent clinical and analytical tolerance, with no reported adverse effects. Surgical intervention remains the preferred approach for GCG. Denosumab  emerges as an alternative, either as neoadjuvant treatment or as definitive therapy for unresectable or resectable tumors associated with significant morbidity. It leads to size stabilization and regression of the tumor stage.
25894171	Fatal outcome after renal transplant in a pediatric patient with Noonan syndrome.	Noonan syndrome is a congenital, common, hereditary disorder. Facial dysmorphism, growth retardation, and various heart defects are typical clinical features. In patients with minor cardiac pathology, life expectancy is normal. We report a case of renal transplant in a pediatric patient with Noonan syndrome that ended with death of the patient. Our patient presented with unexpected and refractory postoperative neurological complications that were unresponsive to intensive therapy, and the patient died because of secondary complications. 
28296370	[Use of recombinant Human Growth Hormone (rHGH)].	Recombinant human growth hormone, synthesized in E.coli or mammalian cells cultures, is since 1985, a useful therapeutic resource to increase growth velocity and final height. In this paper are discussed the four phases (aims, security and efficacy, utility and efficiency) indispensables to define the start of treatment, as well as the absolute, relative and metabolic indications and the transitory and permanent conditions that contraindicate its use. It is commented the way to optimize the results (simple but indispensables indications for the physician, the patients and their family). Finally it is analyzed the results of treatment in patients with growth hormone deficiency, Turner syndrome, chronic renal failure, Prader-Willi syndrome, Noonan syndrome, SHOX deficiency, intrauterine growth retardation and idiopathic short stature.
135673	Total anomalous pulmonary venous return with associated patent ductus arteriosus. Two cases with successful correction.	A large patent ductus arteriosus associated with total anomalous pulmonary venous return results in a unique hemodynamic pattern, and long-term survival has been rare. Two patients, aged five and 18 years, underwent successful surgical repair of supracardiac total anomalous pulmonary venous return and an associated large patent ductus arteriosus. The association of the Noonan syndrome in the 18-year-old woman is of additional interest.
25721697	The impact of growth hormone therapy on adult height in noonan syndrome: a systematic review.	BACKGROUND: Recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) is being used to promote linear growth in short children with Noonan syndrome. However, its efficacy is still controversial. AIMS: To systematically determine the impact of rhGH therapy on adult height in children with Noonan syndrome. METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ISI Web of Science, MEDLINE, and the bibliographic references from all retrieved articles published until April 2014. Studies reporting adult/near-adult height in children with Noonan syndrome treated with rhGH or reporting at least a 3-year follow-up were analysed. Quality and strength of recommendation were assessed according to the Endocrine Society criteria. RESULTS: No controlled trials reporting adult height were available. Five studies were identified reporting adult height or near adult height. Data comparison showed inter-individual variability in the response to rhGH, mean height gain standard deviation score ranging between 0.6 and 1.4 according to national standards, and between 0.6 and 2 according to Noonan standards. Significant biases affected all the studies. CONCLUSIONS: High-quality controlled trials on the impact of rhGH therapy on adult height are lacking, and the robustness of available data is not sufficient to recommend such therapy in children with Noonan syndrome.
29490994	Long-Term Outcomes of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Diagnosed During Childhood: Results From a National Population-Based Study.	BACKGROUND: Late survival and symptomatic status of children with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have not been well defined. We examined long-term outcomes for pediatric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. METHODS: The National Australian Childhood Cardiomyopathy Study is a longitudinal population-based cohort study of children (0-10 years of age) diagnosed with cardiomyopathy between 1987 and 1996. The primary study end point was time to death or cardiac transplantation. RESULTS: There were 80 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, with a median age at diagnosis of 0.48 (interquartile range, 0.1, 2.5) years. Freedom from death/transplantation was 86% (95% confidence interval [CI], 77.0-92.0) 1 year after presentation, 80% (95% CI, 69.0-87.0) at 10 years, and 78% (95% CI, 67.0-86.0) at 20 years. From multivariable analyses, risk factors for death/transplantation included symmetrical left ventricular hypertrophy at the time of diagnosis (hazard ratio, 4.20; 95% CI, 1.60-11.05; P=0.004), Noonan syndrome (hazard ratio, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.02-8.08; P=0.045), higher posterior wall thickness z score (hazard ratio, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.22-1.73; P<0.001), and lower fractional shortening z score (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.74-0.95; P=0.005) during follow-up. Nineteen (23%) subjects underwent left ventricular myectomy. At a median of 15.7 years of follow-up, 27 (42%) of 63 survivors were treated with beta-blocker, and 13 (21%) had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. CONCLUSIONS: The highest risk of death or transplantation for children with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is within 1 year after diagnosis, with low attrition rates thereafter.

20974441	Pectus carinatum.	Pectus carinatum or keel chest is a spectrum of progressive inborn anomalies of the anterior chest wall, named after the keel (carina) of ancient Roman ships. It defines a wide spectrum of inborn protrusion anomalies of the sternum and/or the adjacent costal cartilages. Pectus carinatum is often associated with various conditions, notably Marfan disease, homocystinuria, prune belly, Morquio syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, Noonan syndrome, and mitral valve prolapse. Treatment of pectus carinatum by nonsurgical methods such as exercise and casting has not been worthwhile, whereas surgical management is simple and successful.

10424998	Brom's three-patch technique for repair of supravalvular aortic stenosis.	OBJECTIVE: Case histories of all patients (n = 29) operated on for supravalvular aortic stenosis from 1962 to the present were reviewed to study different techniques and outcomes. The technique of symmetric aortoplasty with 3 patches (1 in each sinus) is described and compared with other methods. METHODS: Case reports were reviewed and follow-up was completed by contacting the patient's (pediatric) cardiologist. We aimed for a last follow-up visit, including Doppler echocardiographic studies, in a period no more than 12 months earlier than December 1997. Supravalvular aortic stenosis was discrete in 25 and diffuse with involvement of the aortic arch and arch vessels in 4 patients. Additional anomalies were bicuspid aortic valve (n = 5), coarctation (n = 3), ascending aortic aneurysm (n = 1), mitral valve insufficiency (n = 2), pulmonary valvular stenosis (n = 1), and peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis (n = 2). Eleven patients had Williams syndrome and 1 patient had Noonan syndrome. Symmetric aortoplasty with 3 patches (1 in each sinus) was used in 13 patients, whereas other nonsymmetric methods (1, 2, or Y-shaped patches) were used in 16 patients. Mean follow-up was 10.5 years (range: 4 months-36 years). RESULTS: All techniques adequately decreased the pressure gradient. Progression of preoperative aortic valve insufficiency or de novo regurgitation was not observed except in 1 patient in whom the patches inserted were too large. CONCLUSIONS: No difference could be demonstrated in outcome for any surgical technique; however, reconstruction of the aortic root with autologous pericardial patches in each sinus after transection of the aorta has the advantage of symmetry while restoring the normal aortic root anatomy.
24605344	Ulerythema ophryogenes: updates and insights.	Ulerythema ophryogenes is a rare cutaneous atrophic disorder that occasionally is associated with Noonan syndrome, de Lange syndrome, Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, and cardiofaciocutaneous (CFC) syndrome. Often presenting in pediatric patients, the pathogenesis of ulerythema ophryogenes remains unclear, though several genetic causes have been suggested. Treatment recommendations remain anecdotal, but clearance has been noted as the patient ages. Although topical agents have been the mainstay of therapy, recent advancement in laser intervention for treatment of ulerythema ophryogenes is promising.

7784245	Unusual combination of congenital heart defects in an infant with Noonan syndrome.	Congenital heart disease occurs in 35-50% of patients diagnosed with Noonan syndrome. We present an infant with an unusual combination of congenital heart defects not previously reported, including partial atrioventricular septal defect, polyvalvular dysplasia, and progressive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We discuss the possible interaction between these lesions that may have led to the patient's rapid demise.

18617316	Acute myocarditis secondary to Campylobacter jejuni enterocolitis.	Myocarditis is a rare condition that can mimic an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). We present the case of a 24-year-old male with Noonan syndrome who presented with a diarrhoeal pro-dromal illness, acute onset chest pain, elevated cardiac biomarkers and an abnormal ECG with ST elevation in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease. The patient had acute myocarditis secondary to Campylobacter jejuni enterocolitis. Infective myocarditis is most commonly due to a viral infection. Myocarditis is very rarely due to a bacterial infection with only isolated reports of myocarditis induced by Campylobacter jejuni infection. At follow-up he remains well. Myocarditis should be considered in all patients presenting with acute onset chest pain and elevated cardiac biomarkers.
14717883	Prevention and management of complications of airway surgery in children.	Preventing and managing complications of airway surgery in children requires proactive attention to both surgical and anaesthetic aspects of the planned procedure. Preoperative evaluation should include a thorough physical examination and, especially in children with multiple congenital anomalies, flexible fibreoptic nasopharyngolaryngoscopy, direct laryngoscopy and rigid or flexible bronchoscopy. The goal is to identify dynamic abnormalities such as laryngomalacia or vocal cord paralysis, tracheal or bronchial lesions, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), aspiration, laryngotracheal stenosis, totally obstructing tracheostomy-associated granulation tissue and Noonan syndrome preoperatively, and then to plan surgical management to achieve the best possible outcome for each patient.
6467657	Fetoscopy in prenatal diagnosis of the Majewski and the Saldino-Noonan types of the Short Rib-Polydactyly syndromes.	Fetoscopy was performed in three pregnancies at risk for the Majewski syndrome and in one pregnancy at risk for the Saldino-Noonan syndrome of the fetus. One case of Majewski syndrome and two normal fetuses were correctly diagnosed. In the remaining case the amniotic fluid was blood-stained and the fetus could not be visualized. Patients previously carrying a fetus with a Short Rib-Polydactyly syndrome of the Majewski or Saldino-Noonan types are at a high risk of recurrence (25%) and should be offered prenatal diagnosis in subsequent pregnancies. Polydactyly is consistently present in these syndromes, and is easily seen through the fetoscope. Fetoscopy offers a safe and instant diagnosis as early as 15-16 weeks of gestation.
35810017	Kidney Transplantation in a Patient With Noonan Syndrome: A Case Report.	Noonan syndrome (NS) is a congenital genetic abnormality characterized by short stature, delayed onset of puberty, cardiac malformations, and characteristic external malformations. Congenital chromosomal or genetic abnormalities are sometimes associated with carcinomas. Furthermore, they are difficult to manage perioperatively because of multiple complications and mental retardation. The safety of kidney transplantation for patients with NS has not been established. We are reporting the case of a 31-year-old man with NS who received a kidney transplantation after a donor's brain death. He received kidney transplantation safely and was discharged without issues. Kidney transplantation for patients with congenital chromosomal or genetic abnormalities is feasible without serious complications, with a regular follow-up, and psychological support from patients and families.
22863686	Concurrent orthopedic and neurosurgical procedures in pediatric patients with spinal deformity.	The management of pediatric patients with complex spinal deformity often requires both an orthopedic and a neurosurgical intervention. The reasons for multiple subspecialty involvement include, but are not limited to, the presence of a tethered cord requiring release or a syrinx requiring decompression. It has been common practice to perform these procedures in a staged manner, although there is little evidence in the literature to support separate interventions. We reviewed a series of consecutive patients who underwent spinal deformity correction and a neurosurgical intervention concurrently in an attempt to assess the safety, efficacy, and possible complications associated with such an approach. Eleven patients were reviewed who underwent concurrent orthopedic and neurosurgical procedures. Data were collected for patient demographics, preoperative diagnosis, procedures performed, intraoperative and perioperative complications, as well as any unexpected return to the operating room for any reason. Operative notes and anesthesia records were reviewed to determine estimated blood loss, surgical time, and the use of intraoperative neurological monitoring. Patient diagnoses included myelodysplasia (N=6), congenital scoliosis and/or kyphosis (N=4), and scoliosis associated with Noonan syndrome (N=1). Age at the time of surgery averaged 9 years 2 months (range=14 months to 17 years 2 months). Estimated blood loss averaged 605 ml (range=50-3000 ml). The operative time averaged 313 min (range=157-477 min). There were no intraoperative complications, including incidental dural tears or deterioration in preoperative neurological status. One patient developed a sore associated with postoperative cast immobilization that led to a deep wound infection. It appears that concurrent orthopedic and neurosurgical procedures in pediatric patients with significant spinal deformities can be performed safely and with minimal intraoperative and postoperative complications when utilizing modern surgical and neuromonitoring techniques. Level of evidence=Level IV.
9294988	Echocardiographic predictors of poor outcome in infants with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.	Although hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC) is readily diagnosed by echocardiography in infants with isolated ventricular hypertrophy, echocardiographic predictors of outcome have not been described in this age group. To identify echocardiographic predictors of poor outcome of infants with HC, we reviewed medical records and echocardiograms of all 19 patients with HC aged <1 year seen at the University of California, San Francisco, from January 1981 through December 1995. Thickness of the ventricular septum and the left ventricular (LV) posterior wall, ventricular septum/LV posterior wall ratio, LV mass, LV volume, LV mass/volume ratio, LV ejection fraction, and right ventricular anterior wall thickness were measured. The median age at diagnosis was 1 day; 11 were boys and 8 were girls. Within 1 year after birth, 10 patients died: the other 9 patients have survived to > 12 months of age. At the initial postnatal examination, the Z value for LV posterior wall was larger (median, 5.2 vs 1.3, p <0.04) and, consequently, the ventricular septum/LV posterior wall ratio was lower (1.6 vs 2.3, p <0.04) in nonsurvivors than in survivors. In serial studies, the Z value for both the ventricular septum and the LV posterior wall thickness increased in nonsurvivors, but decreased in survivors. Nonsurvivors had intrinsic metabolic disease or Noonan syndrome. Survivors had classic HC or maternal diabetes. We conclude that, in infants with HC, early or progressive hypertrophy of the LV posterior wall is a predictor of poor outcome, regardless of associated disease.
29092974	Breast reconstruction in a patient with Noonan syndrome.	Noonan syndrome (NS) is a relatively common genetic disorder with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern affecting 1 in 1000-2500 births. Patients with this syndrome present with characteristic facial, musculoskeletal, cardiac and endocrine abnormalities. Lack of postpubertal breast development is a common manifestation of this syndrome and may result in severe hypomastia and a masculine appearance of the female chest. We report the first case of breast reconstruction in a 24-year-old woman with NS who lacked postpubertal breast development. Technical considerations for addressing the existing chest wall deformity, implant pocket selection as well as emphasis on the role of the plastic surgeon are presented.
30908877	First International Conference on RASopathies and Neurofibromatoses in Asia: Identification and advances of new therapeutics.	The neurofibromatoses, which include neurofibromatosis type I (NF1), neurofibromatosis type II (NF2), and schwannomatosis, are a group of syndromes characterized by tumor growth in the nervous system. The RASopathies are a group of syndromes caused by germline mutations in genes that encode components of the RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The RASopathies include NF1, Noonan syndrome, Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines, Costello syndrome, cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome, Legius syndrome, capillary malformation arterio-venous malformation syndrome, and SYNGAP1 autism. Due to their common underlying pathogenetic etiology, all these syndromes have significant phenotypic overlap of which one common feature include a predisposition to tumors, which may be benign or malignant. Together as a group, they represent one of the most common multiple congenital anomaly syndromes estimating to affect approximately one in 1000 individuals worldwide. The subcontinent of India represents one of the largest populations in the world, yet remains underserved from an aspect of clinical genetics services. In an effort to bridge this gap, the First International Conference on RASopathies and Neurofibromatoses in Asia: Identification and Advances of New Therapeutics was held in Kochi, Kerala, India. These proceedings chronicle this timely and topical international symposium directed at discussing the best practices and therapies for individuals with neurofibromatoses and RASopathies.
10912404	Pregnancy in women with Noonan syndrome: report of two cases.	BACKGROUND: Noonan syndrome is similar phenotypically to Turner syndrome, accounting for one in 1000-2500 live births. Two thirds of patients have cardiac anomalies, half with pulmonary stenosis. Two cases of Noonan syndrome in pregnancy are presented, each woman with a different cardiac anomaly. CASES: The first patient sought preconception counseling for pulmonary stenosis. She conceived within a year and had a cesarean because of prolonged rupture of membranes, transverse lie, and variable decelerations. The second patient presented at 14 weeks' gestation with an unrepaired coarctation of the aorta. She had an assisted vaginal delivery at 38 weeks. CONCLUSION: Successful pregnancy was possible in women with Noonan syndrome. A coordinated multidisciplinary team approach improved the likelihood of a successful outcome.
29362165	Preoperative Detailed Coagulation Tests Are Required in Patients With Noonan Syndrome.	PURPOSE: Patients with Noonan syndrome often require surgery at young ages. They are at high risk of perioperative bleeding from coagulation defects that might not have been detected by routine screening. These risks are rarely described in the oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMS) literature. The aim of this study was to evaluate the perioperative bleeding risks associated with Noonan syndrome and to propose preoperative guidelines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This report describes a retrospective case series of patients with Noonan syndrome who underwent OMS procedures during a continuous observational period (2013 through 2016) in the authors' center. Clinical data, blood screening test results, and perioperative bleeding were analyzed. RESULTS: Five patients (age, 4 to 20 yr) with Noonan syndrome who underwent OMS procedures were included in this study. One patient presented a spontaneous bleeding tendency (epistaxis requiring cauterization). Blood screening showed clotting defects in 3 patients. One patient presented abnormal perioperative bleeding owing to a mild defect in factor XI. CONCLUSION: Patients with Noonan syndrome must be referred to a hematologist for specific preoperative investigations and for adapted perioperative management.
24124081	GH Therapy and first final height data in Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair (Mazzanti syndrome).	Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair (NS/LAH or Mazzanti Syndrome) is caused by a single missense mutation in SHOC2 promoting tN-myristoylation of the encoded protein. Cardinal features include facial features resembling NS, short stature often associated with proven growth hormone deficiency (GHD), typical ectodermal anomalies, and distinctive behavior. Overall, the clinical features are more severe than those generally observed in NS, even though the phenotype improves with age. We report on growth and pubertal trend in seven patients heterozygous for a mutated SHOC2 allele, treated with long-term GH-therapy, and final height (FH) in three of them. They were approximately -3 SDS below the Italian general population standards, they had very low IGF1 levels at baseline and GHD at pharmacological tests. All patients were treated with GH (0.035 mg/kg/day) for a mean period of 8.49 +- 5.72 years. After the 1st year of GH-therapy, IGF1 level and height velocity had increased. Three of 7 patients reached the FH (-2.34 +- 0.12 SDS) at 18.25 +- 0.73 years, after GH administration for 12.39 +- 2.12 years. Pubertal development was variable, showing a prolonged and delayed puberty or rapid pubertal progression that could impair the FH. Overall, our data in this small cohort suggest that NS/LAH patients benefit from long-term GH-therapy, although they do not show the characteristic catch-up growth of isolated GHD. While the observed growth and pubertal behavior is consistent with a dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, the functional link between SHOC2 and the GH/IGF signaling pathways remains to be clarified.
