  abnormalities are not generally recognized as part of the Noonan syndrome. A child
  with this condition in whom unique and widespread lymphatic abnormalities were demonstrated
  by lymphography is described. Both T and B lymphocytes were detected in chylous
  fluid drained from the thorax. In addition, the child was found to have a protein-losing
  enteropathy and cardiovascular defects. The clinical spectrum of the Noonan syndrome
  may include animalies of the lymphatic system.'
