input_text: 'Growth hormone therapy in pre-pubertal children with Noonan syndrome:
  first year growth response and comparison with Turner syndrome. We studied the growth-promoting
  effect of treatment with recombinant human growth hormone in 23 pre-pubertal children
  with Noonan syndrome, aged between 5.4 and 14.3 y, and all with a height < 1.4 SD
  for Tanner standards. The growth response and skeletal maturation after 1 y of recombinant
  human growth hormone treatment (0.15 U/kg/day given by daily injection) in the Noonan
  syndrome patients was compared with the auxological changes observed in a group
  of 17 girls with Turner syndrome with a comparable age and height deficit who were
  treated with recombinant human growth hormone in a similar way. During 1 y of treatment,
  the mean +/- SD height velocity increased by 4.0 +/- 1.6 cm/y in the Noonan syndrome
  group and by 3.6 +/- 1.3 cm/y in the Turner syndrome group. Height SDS for chronological
  age in the Noonan syndrome group increased by 0.53 +/- 0.46 (p < 0.001). In the
  Noonan syndrome patients the changes in height velocity were positively related
  to birthweight (r = 0.48, p < 0.05). The changes in height velocity or height SDS
  were not related to the age, height deficit or a delay in bone age maturation at
  start of treatment. In neither the patients with Noonan syndrome nor Turner syndrome
  was an acceleration of bone maturation found. We conclude that treatment with recombinant
  human growth hormone in pre-pubertal NS patients induces an increase in height velocity
  and height SDS comparable to that observed in Turner syndrome girls.'
