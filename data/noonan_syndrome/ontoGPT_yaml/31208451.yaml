input_text: 'Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and survival in a patient with Noonan
  syndrome and multiple lentigines: a case report. BACKGROUND: A 9-year-old Arabic
  boy attending middle school presented with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due
  to ventricular fibrillation recorded by Holter electrocardiographic monitoring.
  He had a background history of Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (also known
  as LEOPARD syndrome), a rare condition of autosomal dominant inheritance with approximately
  200 cases reported worldwide. CASE PRESENTATION: Apart from characteristic features,
  the boy was known to have asymmetric septal hypertrophy with a maximum wall thickness
  of 24 mm measured by cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. A day prior to the
  event, he attended cardiology follow-up at our institution, and Holter monitoring
  was commenced. Following cardiopulmonary resuscitation by bystanders and paramedics,
  he reverted back into sinus rhythm after a total downtime of 24 min. He was initially
  treated in the intensive care unit and underwent implantable cardioverter defibrillator
  implantation. He has made a full recovery and remains at the top of his class. CONCLUSION:
  This case demonstrates that sudden cardiac arrest in patients with secondary forms
  of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is not necessarily protected by apparently favorable
  phenotypes and that events may be preceded by non-sustained ventricular tachycardia
  observed by Holter monitoring. Implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation
  plays a critical role in both primary and secondary prevention in patients at high
  risk of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.'
