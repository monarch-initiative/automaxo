input_text: "Spontaneous chylothorax in Noonan syndrome. Treatment with prednisone.
  OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of spontaneous chylothorax in a child with Noonan
  syndrome successfully treated with prednisone. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: A pediatric
  cardiology referral center for the Rocky Mountain region. PATIENT: An 18-month-old
  girl with Noonan's syndrome, pulmonary stenosis, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
  who presented with spontaneous chylothorax. INTERVENTIONS: The child's chylothorax
  did not respond to thoracic duct ligation, tetracycline pleurodesis, and pleurectomy
  during a 2-month period. A low-fat diet was helpful but did not eliminate the problem.
  Prednisone was started orally at 1 mg/kg per dose twice daily and slowly tapered
  during 3 months. The chylothorax did not recur during 8 months of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS:
  Prednisone may be useful in the treatment of chylothorax in Noonan syndrome. A controlled
  clinical trial would be helpful but would be difficult in such a rare complication
  of an uncommon syndrome."
