input_text: "Rapidly progressive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in an infant with Noonan
  syndrome with multiple lentigines: palliative treatment with a rapamycin analog.
  Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (NSML) frequently manifests with hypertrophic
  cardiomyopathy (HCM). Recently, it was demonstrated that mTOR inhibition reverses
  HCM in NSML mice. We report for the first time on the effects of treatment with
  a rapamycin analog in an infant with LS and malignant HCM. In the boy, progressive
  HCM was diagnosed during the first week of life and a diagnosis of NSML was established
  at age 20 weeks by showing a heterozygous Q510E mutation in PTPN11. Immunoblotting
  with antibodies against pERK, pAkt, and pS6RP in fibroblasts demonstrated enhanced
  Akt/mTOR pathway activity. Because of the patient's critical condition, everolimus
  therapy was started at age 24 weeks and continued until heart transplantation at
  age 36 weeks. Prior to surgery, heart failure improved from NYHA stage IV to II
  and brain natriuretic peptide values decreased from 9,600 to <1,000 pg/ml, but no
  reversal of cardiac hypertrophy was observed. Examination of the explanted heart
  revealed severe hypertrophy and myofiber disarray with extensive perivascular fibrosis.
  These findings provide evidence that Akt/mTOR activity is enhanced in NSML with
  HCM and suggest that rapamycin treatment could principally be feasible for infantile
  NSML. The preliminary experiences made in this single patient indicate that therapy
  should start early to prevent irreversible cardiac remodelling."
