input_text: RASopathies. RASopathies are a group of disorders characterized by mutations
  in the RAS-MAPK pathway. RAS-MAP signaling plays a critical role in cell differentiation,
  proliferation, and survival. Germline mutations can result in distinctive syndromes,
  including Noonan syndrome, Costello syndrome, and neurofibromatosis type 1. Mosaic
  RASopathies can present as localized cutaneous lesions like epidermal nevi and nevus
  sebaceous, or more extensive conditions such as encephalocraniocutaneous lipomatosis.
  We review the heterogenous presentation of RAS mutations, discuss new targeted therapies,
  and highlight areas of uncertainty, including carcinogenesis risk and appropriate
  screening.
