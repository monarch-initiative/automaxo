input_text: 'Protein tyrosine phosphatases as novel targets in breast cancer therapy.
  Breast cancer is linked to hyperactivation of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), and
  recent studies have unveiled that selective tyrosine dephosphorylation by protein
  tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) of specific substrates, including PTKs, may activate
  or inactivate oncogenic pathways in human breast cancer cell growth-related processes.
  Here, we review the current knowledge on the involvement of PTPs in breast cancer,
  as major regulators of breast cancer therapy-targeted PTKs, such as HER1/EGFR, HER2/Neu,
  and Src. The functional interplay between PTKs and PTK-activating or -inactivating
  PTPs, and its implications in novel breast cancer therapies based on targeting of
  specific PTPs, are discussed. '

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
