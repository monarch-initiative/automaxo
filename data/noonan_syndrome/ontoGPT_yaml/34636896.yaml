input_text: 'Approach to the Patient: Safety of Growth Hormone Replacement in Children
  and Adolescents. The use of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) in children
  and adolescents has expanded since its initial approval to treat patients with severe
  GH deficiency (GHD) in 1985. rhGH is now approved to treat several conditions associated
  with poor growth and short stature. Recent studies have raised concerns that treatment
  during childhood may affect morbidity and mortality in adulthood, with specific
  controversies over cancer risk and cerebrovascular events. We will review 3 common
  referrals to a pediatric endocrinology clinic, followed by a summary of short- and
  long-term effects of rhGH beyond height outcomes. Methods to mitigate risk will
  be reviewed. Finally, this information will be applied to each clinical case, highlighting
  differences in counseling and clinical outcomes. rhGH therapy has been used for
  more than 3 decades. Data are largely reassuring, yet we still have much to learn
  about pharmaceutical approaches to growth in children and the lifelong effect of
  treatment.'
