input_text: '[Gastroparesis in Noonan syndrome]. We present a case of a 26-year-old
  female patient with bloating, postprandial nausea and recurrent vomiting after solid
  food intake. A gastric emptying scintigraphy showed a delayed gastric emptying,
  defining gastroparesis. Because of her past medical history of short stature and
  pulmonary stenosis, we initiated genetic counseling where the diagnosis of Noonan
  syndrome was made. Dietary therapy and medication with domperidone quickly led to
  relief of the discomfort due to gastroparesis. However, prokinetics are not indicated
  for long-term therapy, as cardiac arrhythmia may occur. A risk-benefit assessment
  should be done. There are several novel approaches which need to be further investigated.'
