input_text: Aortic regurgitation and pigmentation - unusual features of Noonan syndrome.
  A patient with typical features of Noonan's syndrome showed aortic regurgitation
  and widespread diffuse hyperpigmentation, features not previously associated with
  this syndrome. Detailed endocrine and dermatological studies failed to delineate
  the cause of hyperpigmentation. In addition to mild aortic regurgitation, cardiac
  catheterization revealed mild left ventricular dysfunction, probably due to primary
  myocardial disease. Other interesting findings included lymphedema and sexual infantilism
  despite normal testosterone levels.
