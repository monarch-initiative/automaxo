input_text: Combined catheter-based pulmonary valvuloplasty and atrial septal defect
  closure in Noonan syndrome. A case report and literature review. The first case
  of combined procedure of catheter-based balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty and atrial
  septal defect closure using Amplatzer Septal Occluder, in a patient with Noonan
  syndrome, is reported. The literature regarding prevalence, genetics, pattern of
  involvement, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of this syndrome is reviewed.
