input_text: 'Growth hormone treatment in 35 prepubertal children with achondroplasia:
  a five-year dose-response trial. BACKGROUND: Achondroplasia is a skeletal dysplasia
  with extreme, disproportionate, short stature. AIM: In a 5-y growth hormone (GH)
  treatment study including 1 y without treatment, we investigated growth and body
  proportion response in 35 children with achondroplasia. METHODS: Patients were randomized
  to either 0.1 IU/kg (n = 18) or 0.2 IU/kg (n = 17) per day. GH treatment was interrupted
  for 12 mo after 2 y of treatment in prepubertal patients to study catch-down growth.
  Mean height SDS (HSDS) at start was -5.6 and -5.2 for the low- and high-dose groups,
  respectively, and mean age 7.3 and 6.6 y. RESULTS: Mean growth velocity (baseline
  4.5/4.6 cm/y for the groups) increased significantly by 1.9/3.6 cm/y during the
  first year and by 0.5/1.5 cm/y during the second year. During the third year, a
  decrease of growth velocity was observed at 1.9/1.3 cm/y below baseline values.
  HSDS increased significantly by 0.6/0.8 during the first year of treatment and in
  total by 1.3/1.6 during the 5 y of study. Sitting height SDS improved significantly
  from -2.1/-1.7 to -0.8/0.2 during the study. Body proportion (sitting height/total
  height) or arm span did not show any significant change. CONCLUSION: GH treatment
  of children with achondroplasia improves height during 4 y of therapy without adverse
  effect on trunk-leg disproportion. The short-term effect is comparable to that reported
  in Turner and Noonan syndrome and in idiopathic short stature.'
