input_text: Noonan syndrome with double-chambered right ventricle. The association
  of Noonan syndrome and a double-chambered right ventricle has not been reported
  previously in the medical literature. We report two patients with Noonan syndrome
  associated with pulmonary valve stenosis and double-chambered right ventricle due
  to anomalous hypertrophied muscle bundles. Pulmonary valve stenosis was operated
  on. However, hypertrophied muscle bundles were not resected, as they caused no obstruction
  to blood passage. Postoperative follow-up examinations revealed no symptoms. In
  conclusion, in those with Noonan syndrome there may be anomalous muscle bundles
  in the right ventricular cavity. It may not be necessary to resect them if they
  do not obstruct the right ventricular outflow tract.
