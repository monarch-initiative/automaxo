input_text: Revision spine surgery in children with cerebral palsy. Ten children with
  neuromuscular scoliosis and pelvic obliquity had revision spinal instrumentations
  and fusions performed at an average age of 14.7 years. The initial spinal deformity
  in all children was the result of static encephalopathy with nine children diagnosed
  as having spastic cerebral palsy without another specific diagnosis and one child
  diagnosed as also having Noonan syndrome. All 10 children had a revision performed
  after the first surgery, and two of the 10 children underwent a second revision
  because of failure of rod cross-links. The indications for revision surgery were
  symptomatic recurrent deformity, symptomatic pseudoarthrosis, or perforation of
  one leg of the unit rod through the pelvis. The average time between the first and
  second surgery was 2.7 years, and from revision to final follow-up was 2.5 years.
  The goal of providing symptomatic relief and correction of deformity was accomplished
  in nine of 10 children; however, two of the nine required two revisions. One patient
  continues to have a residual painful pseudoarthrosis. The two postoperative complications
  requiring further surgery were related to the failure of rod connectors.
