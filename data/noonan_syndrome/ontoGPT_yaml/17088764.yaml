input_text: '[Emergency thoraco amniotic shunting in cases with compressive pleural
  effusion with hydrops: A retrospective study of 60 cases]. OBJECTIVES: To study
  perinatal outcome following thoraco-amniotic shunting for fetal pleural effusions
  with hydrops. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective study (1984-2004) to evaluate
  a policy of emergency thracoamniotic shunting in hydropic fetuses with suspected
  chylothorax, on the basis of the rationale that mediastinal compression could lead
  to acute fetal distress. RESULTS: Shunting was performed immediately following diagnosis,
  and was successful in all 60 cases attempted. There were 7 pregnancy terminations,
  10 in utero deaths, and 43 live births, of which 7 children died in the neonatal
  period and 36 survived (33 without sequels). Among the liveborn, 26 were delivered
  preterm (72%), of which 7 (19%) had preterm premature rupture of membranes and 4
  (11%) had chorioamnionitis. Perinatal death (24/60, 40%) was related to underlying
  anomalies (7 cases), pulmonary hypoplasia (5 cases), chorioamnionitis (2 cases),
  or treatment failure for unknown reasons (10 cases). All 36 survivors had chylothorax,
  33 of which were primary, and 3 were secondary to right congenital diaphragmatic
  hernia, pulmonary sequestration, or Noonan syndrome. CONCLUSION: Following shunting,
  pleural effusion with hydrops has survival rate >50%, but still have a high rate
  of morbidity and mortality.'
