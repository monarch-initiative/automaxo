input_text: Fetoscopy in prenatal diagnosis of the Majewski and the Saldino-Noonan
  types of the Short Rib-Polydactyly syndromes. Fetoscopy was performed in three pregnancies
  at risk for the Majewski syndrome and in one pregnancy at risk for the Saldino-Noonan
  syndrome of the fetus. One case of Majewski syndrome and two normal fetuses were
  correctly diagnosed. In the remaining case the amniotic fluid was blood-stained
  and the fetus could not be visualized. Patients previously carrying a fetus with
  a Short Rib-Polydactyly syndrome of the Majewski or Saldino-Noonan types are at
  a high risk of recurrence (25%) and should be offered prenatal diagnosis in subsequent
  pregnancies. Polydactyly is consistently present in these syndromes, and is easily
  seen through the fetoscope. Fetoscopy offers a safe and instant diagnosis as early
  as 15-16 weeks of gestation.
