input_text: Therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia in a child with Noonan syndrome
  and clonal duplication of the germline PTPN11 mutation. A 4-year-old girl with Noonan
  syndrome (NS) and constitutive PTPN11 mutation presented with stage 4 neuroblastoma
  and was treated by intensive chemotherapy. During the treatment, cytogenetic analysis
  revealed the development of a hyperdiploid clone with duplication of the germline
  PTPN11 mutation in a morphologically normal bone marrow. A few months later, the
  patient developed acute myelomonoblastic leukemia with an additional clonal deletion
  of 7q. Although, we cannot conclude whether there is an association between NS and
  neuroblastoma, this case suggests that duplication of germline PTPN11 mutations,
  potentially induced by chemotherapy, contributes to leukemogenesis in patients with
  NS.
