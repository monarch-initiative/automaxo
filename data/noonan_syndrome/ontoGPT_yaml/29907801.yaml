input_text: 'Comparative assessment of gene-specific variant distribution in prenatal
  and postnatal cohorts tested for Noonan syndrome and related conditions. PURPOSE:
  To compare the pattern of gene-specific involvement and the spectrum of variants
  observed in prenatal and postnatal (mean +- SD, 8.9 +- 9.4 years) cohorts tested
  for Noonan syndrome and related conditions. METHODS: Outcomes of sequencing panel
  testing were compared between prenatal (n = 845) and postnatal (n = 409) cohorts.
  RESULTS: PTPN11 and SOS1 harbored the majority of observed variants in both prenatal
  and postnatal cohorts, and BRAF, HRAS, KRAS, MAP2K1, MAP2K2, RAF1, and SHOC2 had
  similarities in their pattern of involvement in both cohorts. PTPN11 was the largest
  contributor of pathogenic variants and had the lowest frequency of variants of uncertain
  significance (VUS). SOS1 had the highest VUS frequency in both cohorts. The overall
  VUS frequency was twice as high in prenatal specimens (58.1 vs. 29.3%). PTPN11 and
  SOS1 had a 1.5-fold higher VUS frequency in the prenatal cohort (10.7 vs. 7.4% and
  95 vs. 61.1%, respectively). The diagnostic yield was 3.7% for prenatal samples,
  with a higher yield of 12.3% in fetuses with cystic hygroma as a sole finding, and
  21.3% for postnatal. CONCLUSION: Comparison of prenatal versus postnatal specimens
  demonstrates that the pattern of specific gene involvement is similar, whereas the
  classification spectrum of observed variants differs considerably.'
