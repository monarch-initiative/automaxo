input_text: Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation in a patient with Noonan syndrome. Noonan
  syndrome, an autosomal dominant disease occurring with an incidence of 1 in 1,000
  to 1 in 2,500 live births, is characterized by its particular cardiovascular abnormalities,
  including pulmonic valve stenosis, pulmonary artery stenosis, and, more rarely,
  septal defects and coarctation of the aorta. The case of a 20-year-old man admitted
  for inpatient cardiopulmonary rehabilitation after pulmonic valve repair, left pulmonary
  artery angioplasty, and pectus excavatum repair is presented. His endurance was
  markedly decreased, thus limiting his ability to perform activities of daily living
  and reducing his exercise tolerance. With participation in a comprehensive cardiopulmonary
  rehabilitation program, he experienced marked improvement with independence in his
  activities of daily living and an increase in his metabolic equivalent levels from
  to 2.8 to 5.4. After inpatient rehabilitation, he underwent left pulmonary stent
  placement before being discharged home. Subsequent outpatient cardiopulmonary rehabilitation
  has continued to improve significantly his overall exercise tolerance. Given that
  Noonan syndrome is viewed as the most common syndrome associated with congenital
  heart disease after Down syndrome, physiatrists must be familiar with its presentation,
  its associated abnormalities, and the treatment approach to optimize the patient's
  cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal, and psychological status.
