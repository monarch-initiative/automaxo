input_text: Cutaneous oozing of lymphatic fluid after interventional cardiac catheterization
  in a patient with Noonan syndrome. A 15-year-old girl with Noonan syndrome, intestinal
  lymphangiectasia and severe valvar pulmonary stenosis had an abnormal lymphangioscintigram
  that showed intense activity in the inguinal regions bilaterally. Cutaneous oozing
  of lymphatic fluid from the groin wound complicated percutaneous balloon pulmonary
  valvoplasty. This previously unreported complication highlights the risk of damage
  to abnormal lymphatic channels in patients with Noonan syndrome who undergo interventional
  catheterization.
