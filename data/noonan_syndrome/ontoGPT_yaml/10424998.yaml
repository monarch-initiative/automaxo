input_text: "Brom's three-patch technique for repair of supravalvular aortic stenosis.
  OBJECTIVE: Case histories of all patients (n = 29) operated on for supravalvular
  aortic stenosis from 1962 to the present were reviewed to study different techniques
  and outcomes. The technique of symmetric aortoplasty with 3 patches (1 in each sinus)
  is described and compared with other methods. METHODS: Case reports were reviewed
  and follow-up was completed by contacting the patient's (pediatric) cardiologist.
  We aimed for a last follow-up visit, including Doppler echocardiographic studies,
  in a period no more than 12 months earlier than December 1997. Supravalvular aortic
  stenosis was discrete in 25 and diffuse with involvement of the aortic arch and
  arch vessels in 4 patients. Additional anomalies were bicuspid aortic valve (n =
  5), coarctation (n = 3), ascending aortic aneurysm (n = 1), mitral valve insufficiency
  (n = 2), pulmonary valvular stenosis (n = 1), and peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis
  (n = 2). Eleven patients had Williams syndrome and 1 patient had Noonan syndrome.
  Symmetric aortoplasty with 3 patches (1 in each sinus) was used in 13 patients,
  whereas other nonsymmetric methods (1, 2, or Y-shaped patches) were used in 16 patients.
  Mean follow-up was 10.5 years (range: 4 months-36 years). RESULTS: All techniques
  adequately decreased the pressure gradient. Progression of preoperative aortic valve
  insufficiency or de novo regurgitation was not observed except in 1 patient in whom
  the patches inserted were too large. CONCLUSIONS: No difference could be demonstrated
  in outcome for any surgical technique; however, reconstruction of the aortic root
  with autologous pericardial patches in each sinus after transection of the aorta
  has the advantage of symmetry while restoring the normal aortic root anatomy."
