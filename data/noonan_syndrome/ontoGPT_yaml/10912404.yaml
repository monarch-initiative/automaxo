input_text: "Pregnancy in women with Noonan syndrome: report of two cases. BACKGROUND:
  Noonan syndrome is similar phenotypically to Turner syndrome, accounting for one
  in 1000-2500 live births. Two thirds of patients have cardiac anomalies, half with
  pulmonary stenosis. Two cases of Noonan syndrome in pregnancy are presented, each
  woman with a different cardiac anomaly. CASES: The first patient sought preconception
  counseling for pulmonary stenosis. She conceived within a year and had a cesarean
  because of prolonged rupture of membranes, transverse lie, and variable decelerations.
  The second patient presented at 14 weeks' gestation with an unrepaired coarctation
  of the aorta. She had an assisted vaginal delivery at 38 weeks. CONCLUSION: Successful
  pregnancy was possible in women with Noonan syndrome. A coordinated multidisciplinary
  team approach improved the likelihood of a successful outcome."
