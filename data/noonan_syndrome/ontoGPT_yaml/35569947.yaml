input_text: '[SEVERE INFANTILE ASTHMA TREATED WITH LONG-ACTING MUSCARINIC ANTAGONIST:
  A CASE SERIES]. BACKGROUND: Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) are used for
  long-term treatment of bronchial asthma in adults. Its use in the management of
  pediatric bronchial asthma, however, is currently not approved in Japan. Nonetheless,
  there have been a few reports of its use in children, particularly in cases of severe
  bronchial asthma or those without atopic disease that are refractory to existing
  treatment protocols. We report the progress of LAMA in infantile asthma patients.
  CASES: Three out of four patients had LAMA introduced at 3 to 5 years of age after
  being diagnosed with asthma at 1 to 3 years old. Three patients had non-IgE-related
  asthma and an underlying disease, such as Apert and Noonan syndrome, while one patient
  had severe IgE-related asthma without a pre-existing disease. In all cases, conventional
  long-term medications such as medium to high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting
  beta-agonists, were given. However, severe bronchial asthma persisted, with some
  patients having uncontrolled secretions. Since uncontrolled severe-persistent bronchial
  asthma results in repeated hospitalization and intensive care unit admission, we
  introduced LAMA, specifically 2.5mug/day of tiotropium (Tio). After the introducing
  Tio, none of the patients had an acute exacerbation that required hospitalization
  and the frequency of wheezing was reduced. LAMA was administered for up to 19 months,
  with no adverse events. CONCLUSION: The results of this series suggest that LAMA
  is an effective and safe option for uncontrolled infantile asthma.'
