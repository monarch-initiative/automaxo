input_text: 'Continent Catheterizable Vesicostomy: An Alternative Surgical Modality
  for Pediatric Patients With Large Bladder Capacity. OBJECTIVE: To present a modified
  technique and early outcomes of a continent catheterizable vesicostomy in pediatric
  patients with either flaccid neurogenic bladder or intractable voiding dysfunction
  and large capacity bladder. METHODS: Six patients underwent the procedure from October
  2014 to December 2015. A 4-cm Pfannenstiel incision was made, avoiding intraperitoneal
  dissection. After adequate mobilization, a 2-cm vertical flap at the dome of the
  bladder was identified and tubularized over a 12Fr catheter with 4-0 vicryl suture.
  The tubularized flap was then intussuscepted into the bladder with four 4-0 polydioxanone
  sutures, creating a continent mechanism. The catheterizable channel was then tunneled
  to the umbilicus, the channel ostomy matured, and the cystotomy closed in two layers.
  RESULTS: The median patient age was 8 (interquartile range [IQR] 12) years. All
  patients had urinary dysfunction requiring drainage from etiologies that included
  Eagle-Barrett syndrome (n = 2), Noonan syndrome (n = 1), Lennox-Gastaut syndrome
  (n = 1), and Spina bifida (n = 2). Median hospital length of stay was 8 (IQR 3)
  days. One patient had a superficial wound infection treated with antibiotics, and
  1 patient required balloon dilation of the catheterizable channel at 3 months postoperatively,
  secondary to difficulty self-catheterizing. Five patients were successfully self-catheterizing
  at last follow-up. Median follow-up was 6 (IQR 5) months and there were no intra-
  or perioperative complications. CONCLUSION: Continent catheterizable vesicostomy
  is a novel technique for urinary drainage in patients with large bladder capacity
  that spares use of the appendix or ileum. Early results are encouraging, providing
  a catheterizable channel through the umbilicus without urinary leakage between catheterization.'
