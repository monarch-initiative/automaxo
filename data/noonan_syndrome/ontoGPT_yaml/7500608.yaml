input_text: '[Pulmonary lymphangiectasis with spontaneous chylothorax in Noonan syndrome].
  We report a case of Noonan syndrome associated with pulmonary stenosis and major
  lymphedema of the lower extremities. At the age of 15 yr spontaneous chylothorax
  with increasing dyspnea occurred> Chest-x-ray demonstrated increased interstitial
  markings restricted to the right lower lobe representing pulmonary lymphangiectasia.
  The chylothorax did not respond to repeated thoracocentesis and medium-chain-triglyceride
  diet. When a chest tube was inserted and total parenteral nutrition was supplied,
  the chylous effusion decreased within 32 days. The patient is still on diet and
  asymptomatic effusion remained during 12 months follow up. In conclusion, pulmonary
  lympgangiectasia should be considered in patients with Noonan syndrome and an abnormal
  interstitial pulmonary pattern similar to pulmonary congestion (without any hemodynamic
  abnormalities). In case of pleural effusion, chylothorax should be considered.'
