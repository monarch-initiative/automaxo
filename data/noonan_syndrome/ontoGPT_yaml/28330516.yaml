input_text: Treatment of severe refractory valvar pulmonary stenosis with primary
  transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation. Some patients with pulmonary valve stenosis
  do not respond to balloon valvuloplasty and must undergo surgical repair. We report
  the case of a 12-year-old child with pulmonary valve stenosis and Noonan syndrome
  in whom we performed transcatheter Melody pulmonary valve implantation after balloon
  dilation failed. The result was excellent. This technique can be proposed as an
  alternative to surgery in such cases.
