input_text: 'Adults with germline CBL mutation complicated with juvenile myelomonocytic
  leukemia at infancy. Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) appears to be a life-threatening
  disease and showed poor prognosis even after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
  (HSCT) because of high relapse rate. On the other hand, recent molecular analysis
  revealed the heterogeneity of JMML. Here we report that two JMML patients survived
  >20 years without HSCT and both patients had uniparental disomy of 11q23 where CBL
  is located without the phenomenon found in neither Noonan syndrome nor Noonan syndrome-like
  disorder. We think that some JMML patients with CBL mutation might show the good
  prognosis in later life after remission of JMML. '
