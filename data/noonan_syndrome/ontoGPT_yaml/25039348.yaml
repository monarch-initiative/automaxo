input_text: 'Structure, function, and pathogenesis of SHP2 in developmental disorders
  and tumorigenesis. Src homology 2 (SH2)-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase
  2 (SHP2), encoded by the human PTPN11 gene, is a ubiquitously expressed protein
  tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) that consists of two tandem Src homology (SH2) domains
  (N-SH2 and C-SH2), a PTP catalytic domain, and a C-terminal tail with tyrosyl phosphorylation
  sites. It plays critical roles in numerous cellular processes through the regulation
  of various signaling pathways in PTP catalytic activity-dependent and -independent
  manners. Dysfunction of SHP2 resulting from pathogenic mutations and aberrant expression
  leads to the dysregulation of multiple signaling pathways, thus contributing to
  different human disorders. Germline and somatic mutations in PTPN11 are involved
  in Noonan syndrome (NS), LEOPARD syndrome (LS), and hematological malignancies,
  as well as several solid tumors. In this report, we provide an overview of the current
  knowledge of the structure and function of SHP2, and further discuss the molecular
  and pathogenic mechanism of SHP2 in human diseases, with a special focus on tumorigenesis.
  Furthermore, we summarize that SHP2 might itself represent a potential drug target
  for cancer prevention and treatment. Ongoing research and development of SHP2-specific
  inhibitors would enhance this potential. '
