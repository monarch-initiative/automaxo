input_text: Early Outcomes of Cardiac Surgery in Patients with Noonan Syndrome. There
  is a paucity of cardiac surgery outcomes data for patients with Noonan syndrome
  (NS). Our objective was to evaluate early results in these patients. Between January
  1999 and December 2015, 29 patients (18 males, 62%) with NS underwent cardiac surgery
  at our institution. Mean age was 23 +- 17.9 years; 12 (41%) were under 18 years
  of age. Fourteen patients (48%) had prior sternotomies. The primary operations for
  the main diagnosis were pulmonary valve/conduit replacement/repair (n = 14, 48%),
  septal myectomy for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (n = 7, 24%), aortic
  valve replacement/repair (n = 4, 14%), atrial septal defect (ASD) repair (n = 2,
  7%), and cardiac transplantation (n = 2, 7%). Concomitant procedures were performed
  in 24 patients (83%), most commonly right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction
  (n = 13, 45%), mitral valve repair/replacement (n = 7, 24%), and ASD repair (n =
  6, 21%). Mean bypass and cross-clamp times were 88.8 +- 51 minutes and 54.7 +- 67
  minutes, respectively. There was 1 early death (3%). Postoperative morbidity occurred
  in 18 patients (62%), most commonly arrhythmias (n = 14, 48%) or respiratory insufficiency/pneumonia
  (n = 6, 21%). There were 2 early reoperations and 4 early readmissions. Univariate
  factors associated with morbidity included male gender (P = 0.03) and longer cross-clamp
  time (P = 0.02). Median length of hospital stay was 6 days (interquartile range
  5-10.5 days). Patients with NS frequently have multiple cardiac lesions requiring
  a broad spectrum of operations. Early mortality is low despite procedure complexity.
  Although early postoperative morbidity is common, patients overall do well with
  reasonable hospital lengths of stay. Additional studies are needed to evaluate long-term
  outcomes and quality of life.
