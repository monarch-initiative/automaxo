input_text: "Efficacy and safety of two doses of Norditropin  (somatropin) in short
  stature due to Noonan syndrome: a 2-year randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial
  in Japanese patients. This randomized double-blind multicenter trial (NCT01927861)
  evaluated the growth-promoting effect and safety of Norditropin  (NN220; somatropin)
  in Japanese children with short stature due to Noonan syndrome. Prepubertal children
  aged 3-<11 years (boys) or 3-<10 years (girls) with Noonan syndrome were randomized
  to receive GH 0.033 mg/kg/day (n = 25, mean age 6.57 years, 11 females) or 0.066
  mg/kg/day (n = 26, mean age 6.06 years, eight females) for 104 weeks. Change in
  height standard deviation score (HSDS) from baseline was analyzed based on an ANCOVA
  model. Baseline HSDS was -3.24. Estimated change in HSDS [95% CI] after 104 weeks'
  treatment was 0.84 [0.66, 1.02] and 1.47 [1.29, 1.64] for the lower and higher doses,
  respectively; estimated mean difference 0.63 [0.38, 0.88], p < 0.0001. Rates and
  patterns of adverse events (AEs) were similar between groups. Most were mild and
  reported as unlikely to be related to Norditropin . There were no withdrawals due
  to AEs. Insulin-like growth factor-I SDS increased from -1.71 to -0.64 (0.033 mg/kg/day)
  and to 0.63 (0.066 mg/kg/day). HbA1c increased slightly (0.033 mg/kg/day: +0.14%;
  0.066 mg/kg/day: +0.13%); glucose profiles were almost unchanged; insulin profiles
  increased in both groups in the oral glucose tolerance test. There were no clinically
  significant abnormal electrocardiogram or echocardiography findings. We conclude
  that Norditropin  at doses of 0.033 mg/kg/day or 0.066 mg/kg/day for 104 weeks increases
  height in Japanese children with short stature due to Noonan syndrome, with a favorable
  safety profile. The effect was greater with 0.066 mg/kg/day compared with 0.033
  mg/kg/day."
