input_text: "Impact of Noonan Syndrome on admissions for pediatric cardiac surgery.
  BACKGROUND: Noonan Syndrome is the second most common genetic syndrome associated
  with congenital heart disease. Many patients with Noonan Syndrome will require a
  cardiac intervention. This study aimed to characterize the difference in cardiac
  surgery admissions in patients with and without Noonan Syndrome. METHODS: Data regarding
  hospital admissions was collected using the Kids' Inpatient Database from 1997 to
  2012. A cross-sectional study was conducted comparing baseline characteristics,
  cardiac morphology, cardiac surgery, and other comorbidities between those with
  and without Noonan Syndrome. Regression analysis was conducted to determine factors
  related to Noonan Syndrome and risk factors for increased length of hospitalization,
  need for ECMO, and inpatient mortality using Noonan Syndrome as the independent
  variable. RESULTS: A total of 46,169 admissions with cardiac surgery under 18 years
  of age were included in the final analyses. Of these 778 (1.6%) had Noonan Syndrome.
  Pulmonary stenosis, coronary anomalies, and valvuloplasty without valve replacement
  were independently associated with Noonan Syndrome. Those with Noonan Syndrome were
  90% more likely to have chylothorax. Pediatric cardiac surgery admissions tended
  to be 4.5 days longer and cost $54,296 more in total charges with Noonan Syndrome.
  Inpatient mortality is also increased by Noonan Syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Noonan Syndrome
  is present in a relatively small proportion of pediatric cardiac surgery admissions.
  Noonan Syndrome is independently associated with increased length and cost of such
  admissions as well as inpatient mortality."
