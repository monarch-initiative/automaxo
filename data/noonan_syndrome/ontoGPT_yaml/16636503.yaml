input_text: Hemodynamic consequences of a swinging, infarcted ventricular septum.
  Noonan syndrome presents with dysmorphic facial features, short stature, and cardiac
  abnormalities (most commonly pulmonic stenosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy).
  This report describes a rare case accompanied by a secundum atrial septal defect
  (ASD) and a ventricular septal aneurysm causing right ventricular (RV) pressure
  gradient. A 29-year-old mentally retarded man was admitted to hospital with exertional
  dyspnea. His somatic features included short stature (148 cm), hypertelorism, a
  shield chest, and thoracic scoliosis. Echocardiogram showed a secundum ASD with
  bidirectional shunting and a ventricular septum bulging toward the left ventricle
  in diastole, and then toward the RV in systole causing obliteration of the RV. The
  peak pressure gradient measured across the RV outflow by continuous wave Doppler
  was 30 mmHg. Cardiac catheterization revealed an elevated RV pressure without pulmonary
  hypertension and confirmed the pressure gradient. Right ventriculography revealed
  the septal excursion toward the RV in systole, leaving only a small residual cavity
  in the inflow and outflow regions of the RV. The ASD was closed with an autologous
  pericardial patch. A thin, fibrous portion of the ventricular septum was resected
  and replaced with a Dacron patch. From the histological examination, the RV cavity
  obliteration turned out to be produced by the excursion of the infarcted ventricular
  septum.
