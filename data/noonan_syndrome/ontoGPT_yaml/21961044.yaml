input_text: Erk1 positively regulates osteoclast differentiation and bone resorptive
  activity. The extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1 and 2) are widely-expressed
  and they modulate proliferation, survival, differentiation, and protein synthesis
  in multiple cell lineages. Altered ERK1/2 signaling is found in several genetic
  diseases with skeletal phenotypes, including Noonan syndrome, Neurofibromatosis
  type 1, and Cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome, suggesting that MEK-ERK signals regulate
  human skeletal development. Here, we examine the consequence of Erk1 and Erk2 disruption
  in multiple functions of osteoclasts, specialized macrophage/monocyte lineage-derived
  cells that resorb bone. We demonstrate that Erk1 positively regulates osteoclast
  development and bone resorptive activity, as genetic disruption of Erk1 reduced
  osteoclast progenitor cell numbers, compromised pit formation, and diminished M-CSF-mediated
  adhesion and migration. Moreover, WT mice reconstituted long-term with Erk1(-/-)
  bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) demonstrated increased bone mineral density
  as compared to recipients transplanted with WT and Erk2(-/-) BMMNCs, implicating
  marrow autonomous, Erk1-dependent osteoclast function. These data demonstrate Erk1
  plays an important role in osteoclast functions while providing rationale for the
  development of Erk1-specific inhibitors for experimental investigation and/or therapeutic
  modulation of aberrant osteoclast function.
