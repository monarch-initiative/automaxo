input_text: Patient-specific induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived models of LEOPARD
  syndrome. The generation of reprogrammed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)
  from patients with defined genetic disorders holds the promise of increased understanding
  of the aetiologies of complex diseases and may also facilitate the development of
  novel therapeutic interventions. We have generated iPSCs from patients with LEOPARD
  syndrome (an acronym formed from its main features; that is, lentigines, electrocardiographic
  abnormalities, ocular hypertelorism, pulmonary valve stenosis, abnormal genitalia,
  retardation of growth and deafness), an autosomal-dominant developmental disorder
  belonging to a relatively prevalent class of inherited RAS-mitogen-activated protein
  kinase signalling diseases, which also includes Noonan syndrome, with pleomorphic
  effects on several tissues and organ systems. The patient-derived cells have a mutation
  in the PTPN11 gene, which encodes the SHP2 phosphatase. The iPSCs have been extensively
  characterized and produce multiple differentiated cell lineages. A major disease
  phenotype in patients with LEOPARD syndrome is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We show
  that in vitro-derived cardiomyocytes from LEOPARD syndrome iPSCs are larger, have
  a higher degree of sarcomeric organization and preferential localization of NFATC4
  in the nucleus when compared with cardiomyocytes derived from human embryonic stem
  cells or wild-type iPSCs derived from a healthy brother of one of the LEOPARD syndrome
  patients. These features correlate with a potential hypertrophic state. We also
  provide molecular insights into signalling pathways that may promote the disease
  phenotype.
