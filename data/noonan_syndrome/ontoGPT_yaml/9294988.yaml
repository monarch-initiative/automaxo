input_text: 'Echocardiographic predictors of poor outcome in infants with hypertrophic
  cardiomyopathy. Although hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC) is readily diagnosed by
  echocardiography in infants with isolated ventricular hypertrophy, echocardiographic
  predictors of outcome have not been described in this age group. To identify echocardiographic
  predictors of poor outcome of infants with HC, we reviewed medical records and echocardiograms
  of all 19 patients with HC aged <1 year seen at the University of California, San
  Francisco, from January 1981 through December 1995. Thickness of the ventricular
  septum and the left ventricular (LV) posterior wall, ventricular septum/LV posterior
  wall ratio, LV mass, LV volume, LV mass/volume ratio, LV ejection fraction, and
  right ventricular anterior wall thickness were measured. The median age at diagnosis
  was 1 day; 11 were boys and 8 were girls. Within 1 year after birth, 10 patients
  died: the other 9 patients have survived to > 12 months of age. At the initial postnatal
  examination, the Z value for LV posterior wall was larger (median, 5.2 vs 1.3, p
  <0.04) and, consequently, the ventricular septum/LV posterior wall ratio was lower
  (1.6 vs 2.3, p <0.04) in nonsurvivors than in survivors. In serial studies, the
  Z value for both the ventricular septum and the LV posterior wall thickness increased
  in nonsurvivors, but decreased in survivors. Nonsurvivors had intrinsic metabolic
  disease or Noonan syndrome. Survivors had classic HC or maternal diabetes. We conclude
  that, in infants with HC, early or progressive hypertrophy of the LV posterior wall
  is a predictor of poor outcome, regardless of associated disease.'
