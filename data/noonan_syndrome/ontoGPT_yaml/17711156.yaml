input_text: "Anesthetic management in a pediatric patient with Noonan syndrome, mastocytosis,
  and von Willebrand disease: a case report. This case report describes anesthetic
  considerations for a 6-year-old boy, admitted for adenoidectomy under general anesthesia,
  who had a complicated medical history, including mastocytosis, Noonan syndrome,
  and von Willebrand disease. Each affected the anesthetic plan and was addressed
  preoperatively among all surgical and anesthesia providers. Mastocytosis created
  a major concern, with its increased numbers of histamine-filled mast cells. Each
  drug that was added or eliminated from the anesthetic plan, to prevent histamine
  release by the activation of triggers, was considered. Patient handling and temperature
  control were also concerns. One of Noonan syndrome's characteristics is heart anomalies.
  This patient had a history of a patent foramen ovale and pulmonary stenosis; therefore,
  air was carefully removed from all intravenous lines and syringes. The main concern
  for bleeding difficulties was attributed to the history of von Willebrand disease,
  which results in prolonged bleeding time and can lead to delayed bleeding or serious
  postsurgical hemorrhage. Desmopressin was administered preoperatively to increase
  platelet aggregation and the von Willebrand factor level. The use of aspirin and
  other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was avoided. We discuss the clinical
  and anesthetic management of this case with a review of pertinent literature."
