input_text: 'Laser treatment of recurrent vulvar angiokeratoma associated with Noonan
  syndrome. BACKGROUND: Vulvar angiokeratoma is often confused with other, more common
  perineal lesions. Chronically elevated venous pressures may contribute to this rare
  disorder. Laser treatment may lend palliation for several years. CASE: A woman with
  the characteristic cardiac abnormalities of Noonan syndrome initially responded
  to Argon laser treatment of vulvar angiokeratoma. Excessive recurrent disease was
  treated satisfactorily with the Nd:YAG laser. CONCLUSION: Recurrent vulvar angiokeratoma
  in Noonan syndrome supports the premise that increased persistent central venous
  pressure may be involved in the disease process.'
