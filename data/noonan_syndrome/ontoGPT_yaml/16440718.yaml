input_text: '[Anesthetic management of a child with Noonan syndrome and hypertrophic
  obstructive cardiomyopathy]. Noonan syndrome is characterized by facial, skeletal
  and cardiovascular anomalies. We describe the anesthetic management of a one-year-old
  boy with Noonan syndrome and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy scheduled for
  tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy under general anesthesia. He had a history of congestive
  heart failure at 5 months of age. Preoperative echocardiogram revealed a hypertrophied
  septum (12.8 mm) with concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle. Mild mitral
  regurgitation was also noted. Our anesthetic goal was set to maintaining adequate
  preload and afterload as well as adequate anesthesia depth to avoid LV outflow tract
  obstruction. Intravenous fluid was started the day before surgery. Anesthesia was
  induced with fentanyl 30 microg and midazolam 2 mg and maintained with propofol
  8 mg x kg(-1) x hr(-1), fentanyl 30 microg, ketamine 4 mg, and sevoflurane 1-2%.
  Intraoperative monitoring included 12-lead electrocardiogram and direct measurement
  of arterial pressure. Intra- and post-operative course was uneventful.'
