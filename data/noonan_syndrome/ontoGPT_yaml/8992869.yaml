input_text: 'Cardiovascular abnormalities in Noonan syndrome: the clinical findings
  and treatments. The clinical findings and treatment of cardiovascular abnormalities
  in 33 patients with Noonan syndrome are reviewed. Major cardiovascular abnormalities
  were pulmonary valvular stenosis in 17 patients (51.1%), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
  (HCM) in 11 (33.3%), and atrial septal defect in 9 (27.3%). Dysplastic pulmonary
  valve was seen in 6 (35.3%). Balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty was performed for 4
  patients with dysplastic pulmonary valves. Two patients were successfully treated.
  Surgical treatment was performed in 13 patients, 11 alive and 2 died. Two patients
  with HCM and arrhythmia died suddenly. In conclusion, balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty
  should be the initial palliation for dysplastic pulmonary valve in Noonan syndrome,
  and HCM is the risk factor for sudden death in Noonan syndrome.'
