input_text: 'Epileptic spasms in PPP1CB-associated Noonan-like syndrome: a case report
  with clinical and therapeutic implications. BACKGROUND: Noonan syndrome-like disorder
  with loose anagen hair-2 (NSLH2) is an extremely rare disease caused by a heterozygous
  mutation in the PPP1CB gene on chromosome 2p23. The syndrome causes not only numerous
  dysmorphic features but also hypotonia, developmental delay, and even intellectual
  disability. We report the first case of NSLH2 in Asia and the 16th in the world.
  Moreover, the first case of PPP1CB-related infantile spasms. The clinical and therapeutic
  significance is outlined in this paper. CASE PRESENTATION: We found a male infant
  presented with severe intractable epileptic spasms. Although certain clinical features
  of somatic dysmorphism were noted, numerous laboratory and neuroimaging studies
  failed to identify the cause. To determine the underlying etiology, whole-exome
  sequencing was conducted. We identified a de novo heterozygous mutation, NM_206876.1:
  c.548A > C (p.Glu183Ala), in the PPP1CB gene. His seizures were almost refractory
  to conventional antiepileptic drugs but relative seizure control was eventually
  achieved with a ketogenic diet. CONCLUSION: This result expands the clinical spectrum
  of NSLH2 and strengthens the association between the PPP1CB gene and epileptic seizures.
  Furthermore, we suggest that the ketogenic diet can offer seizure reduction in particular
  drug-resistant epilepsy syndromes. Additional studies are warranted to clarify the
  pathogenic mechanisms underlying this PPP1CB mutation in epileptic seizures.'
