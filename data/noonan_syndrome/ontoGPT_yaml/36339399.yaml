input_text: "Genetic conditions of short stature: A review of three classic examples.
  Noonan, Turner, and Prader-Willi syndromes are classical genetic disorders that
  are marked by short stature. Each disorder has been recognized for several decades
  and is backed by extensive published literature describing its features, genetic
  origins, and optimal treatment strategies. These disorders are accompanied by a
  multitude of comorbidities, including cardiovascular issues, endocrinopathies, and
  infertility. Diagnostic delays, syndrome-associated comorbidities, and inefficient
  communication among the members of a patient's health care team can affect a patient's
  well-being from birth through adulthood. Insufficient information is available to
  help patients and their multidisciplinary team of providers transition from pediatric
  to adult health care systems. The aim of this review is to summarize the clinical
  features and genetics associated with each syndrome, describe best practices for
  diagnosis and treatment, and emphasize the importance of multidisciplinary teams
  and appropriate care plans for the pediatric to adult health care transition."
