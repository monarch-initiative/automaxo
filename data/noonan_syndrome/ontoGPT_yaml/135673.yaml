input_text: Total anomalous pulmonary venous return with associated patent ductus
  arteriosus. Two cases with successful correction. A large patent ductus arteriosus
  associated with total anomalous pulmonary venous return results in a unique hemodynamic
  pattern, and long-term survival has been rare. Two patients, aged five and 18 years,
  underwent successful surgical repair of supracardiac total anomalous pulmonary venous
  return and an associated large patent ductus arteriosus. The association of the
  Noonan syndrome in the 18-year-old woman is of additional interest.
