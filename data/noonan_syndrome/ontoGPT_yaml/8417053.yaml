input_text: 'Five-year follow-up after balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty. OBJECTIVES:
  The aim of this study was to assess results 5 years after balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty.
  BACKGROUND: Since the technique of balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty was first reported
  in 1982, it has become the treatment of choice for pulmonary valve stenosis. In
  contrast to surgical valvotomy, the long-term outcome after balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty
  is unknown. METHODS: We reviewed the findings in 34 patients 5.2 +/- 0.8 (mean +/-
  SD) years after balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty: 27 with isolated pulmonary stenosis,
  5 with Noonan syndrome and 2 with previous surgical valvotomy. In eight patients
  (three with Noonan syndrome), a second balloon valvuloplasty was the index procedure
  for analysis. RESULTS: The transpulmonary gradient (mm Hg) was 74 +/- 34 before
  balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty, 36 +/- 26 immediately after, 22 +/- 9 at cardiac
  catheterization in 29 patients 6 +/- 0.6 months later and 19 +/- 10 by Doppler study
  at 5 years. At 5 years 26 patients (group A) had a residual gradient of < or = 20
  mm Hg; the remaining 8 (group B) had a gradient of > 20 mm Hg. Four group B patients
  had Noonan syndrome (p = 0.01). Balloon/pulmonary valve diameter ratio was larger
  for group A patients than for group B patients with isolated pulmonary stenosis
  (1.20 +/- 0.10 vs. 1.00 +/- 0.07, p = 0.005); larger balloons were used in group
  B patients with Noonan syndrome (1.30 +/- 0.10). Group A patients were more likely
  than group B patients to have significant pulmonary incompetence (6 of 24 vs. 0
  of 8) and had a greater right ventricle/left ventricle long-axis diastolic dimension
  ratio (0.47 +/- 0.10 vs. 0.35 +/- 0.04, p = 0.05). In the subgroup of five patients
  with Noonan syndrome and two with prior surgical valvotomy, the transpulmonary gradient
  was reduced from 74 +/- 24 mm Hg before balloon valvuloplasty to 23 +/- 12 mm Hg
  at 5 years. In addition, two patients with isolated pulmonary valve stenosis had
  pulmonary valve dysplasia by angiographic criteria: transpulmonary gradients of
  85 and 56 mm Hg were reduced to 20 and 11 mm Hg, respectively, at 5 years. CONCLUSIONS:
  Relief of obstruction persists at 5 years especially if oversized balloons are used.
  Acceptable results can be obtained in patients with a dysplastic valve. More complete
  relief of right ventricular outflow gradient is associated with increased right
  ventricular dimension, probably because more pulmonary incompetence is induced.
  This is well tolerated at 5 years but may be important in the longer term.'
