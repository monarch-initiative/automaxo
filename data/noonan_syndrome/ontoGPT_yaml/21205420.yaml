input_text: Sudden death in a patient with Noonan syndrome. We report here the case
  of a 27-year-old woman with Noonan syndrome presenting with ventricular fibrillation.
  After successful defibrillation, echocardiography revealed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
  associated with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Normal echocardiographic
  cardiac structure and function were reported 11 years ago. This case emphasises
  the importance of regular follow-up in patients with congenital disorders in which
  cardiac manifestations might develop in early adulthood or later.
