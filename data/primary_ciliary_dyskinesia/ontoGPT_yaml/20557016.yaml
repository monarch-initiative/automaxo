input_text: '[Primary ciliary dyskinesia in highlights of consensus statement. Presentation
  of pediatric cases]. UNLABELLED: Cilia are evolutionarily conserved structures that
  play a role in diverse cell types. Motile cilia are involved in the most prominent
  ciliopathy called primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), which combines oto-sino-pulmonary
  symptoms (impaired mucociliary clearance that is important innate defense mechanism),
  male infertility and in nearly 50% cases situs inversus. Disease is usually inherited
  as autosomal recessive disorder, concerning mainly outer and/or inner dynein arms
  of cilia. Diagnosis of PCD requires the presence of characteristic clinical phenotype
  and confirmation the diagnosis by either identification of specific defect in electron
  microscopy or other evidence of abnormal ciliary function. The diagnosis of PCD
  may be delayed, missed or made incorrectly. The first ERS consensus statement which
  formulates recommendations regarding diagnostic as well as therapeutic approaches
  to children with PCD, is a very helpful tool in the management of this patients.
  We present our own experience with three children with PCD diagnosed in our Department.
  CONCLUSION: in children with clinical symptoms suggesting PCD, even with negative
  screening tests, the estimation of specific cilia defect in electron microscopy
  is indicated.'
