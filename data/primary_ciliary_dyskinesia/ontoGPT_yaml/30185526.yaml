input_text: RSPH6A is required for sperm flagellum formation and male fertility in
  mice. The flagellum is an evolutionarily conserved appendage used for sensing and
  locomotion. Its backbone is the axoneme and a component of the axoneme is the radial
  spoke (RS), a protein complex implicated in flagellar motility regulation. Numerous
  diseases occur if the axoneme is improperly formed, such as primary ciliary dyskinesia
  (PCD) and infertility. Radial spoke head 6 homolog A (RSPH6A) is an ortholog of
  Chlamydomonas RSP6 in the RS head and is evolutionarily conserved. While some RS
  head proteins have been linked to PCD, little is known about RSPH6A. Here, we show
  that mouse RSPH6A is testis-enriched and localized in the flagellum. Rsph6a knockout
  (KO) male mice are infertile as a result of their short immotile spermatozoa. Observation
  of the KO testis indicates that the axoneme can elongate but is disrupted before
  accessory structures are formed. Manchette removal is also impaired in the KO testis.
  Further, RSPH9, another radial spoke protein, disappeared in the Rsph6a KO flagella.
  These data indicate that RSPH6A is essential for sperm flagellar assembly and male
  fertility in mice.This article has an associated First Person interview with the
  first author of the paper.
