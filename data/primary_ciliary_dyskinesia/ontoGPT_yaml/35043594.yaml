input_text: Variations in infection control practices suggest a need for guidelines
  in primary ciliary dyskinesia patient care. Primary ciliary dyskinesis (PCD) is
  an autosomal recessive disorder associated with impaired mucociliary clearance caused
  by defects in ciliary structure and function. The major clinical feature of PCD
  is recurring or persistent respiratory tract infection. Respiratory tract colonization
  with drug-resistant organisms impacts the frequency of infections and lung function
  decline. Protective gear has been employed by caregivers in an attempt to control
  respiratory tract bacterial spread between patients with cystic fibrosis, but use
  in PCD is not known. We conducted a web-based survey to investigate infection control
  and prevention practices of PCD centers in North America, and how practices have
  been influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. The response rate was 87.0%. Before the
  COVID-19 pandemic, glove, gown, and mask use were variable, and only 3.7% of centers
  used masks during encounters with PCD outpatients. After COVID-19 mandates are lifted,
  48.1% of centers plan to continue to use masks during outpatient care, while the
  practice regarding the use of gloves and gowns was not influenced by the current
  pandemic. There is no uniform practice for infection control in PCD care indicating
  the need for practice guidelines. Mitigation of respiratory virus transmission learned
  during the COVID-19 pandemic may impact future infection control approaches used
  for patients with PCD and other lung diseases.
