input_text: In vivo Evaluation of Mucociliary Clearance in Mice. Respiratory motile
  cilia, specialized organelles of the cell, line the apical surface of epithelial
  cells lining the respiratory tract. By beating in a metachronal, synchronal fashion,
  these multiple, motile, actin-based organelles generate a cephalad fluid flow clearing
  the respiratory tract of inhaled pollutants and pathogens. With increasing environmental
  pollution, novel viral pathogens and emerging multi-drug resistant bacteria, cilia
  generated mucociliary clearance (MCC) is essential for maintaining lung health.
  MCC is also depressed in multiple congenital disorders like primary ciliary dyskinesia,
  cystic fibrosis as well as acquired disorders like chronic obstructive pulmonary
  disease. All these disorders have established, in some case multiple, mouse models.
  In this publication, we detail a method using a small amount of radioactivity and
  dual-modality SPECT/CT imaging to accurately and reproducibly measure MCC in mice
  in vivo. The method allows for recovery of mice after imaging, making serial measurements
  possible, and testing potential therapeutics longitudinally over time. The data
  in wild-type mice demonstrates the reproducibility of the MCC measurement as long
  as adequate attention to detail is paid, and the protocol strictly adhered to.
