input_text: 'Inhaled amikacin for treatment of refractory pulmonary nontuberculous
  mycobacterial disease. RATIONALE: Treatment of pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacteria,
  especially Mycobacterium abscessus, requires prolonged, multidrug regimens with
  high toxicity and suboptimal efficacy. Options for refractory disease are limited.
  OBJECTIVES: We reviewed the efficacy and toxicity of inhaled amikacin in patients
  with treatment-refractory nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease. METHODS: Records
  were queried to identify patients who had inhaled amikacin added to failing regimens.
  Lower airway microbiology, symptoms, and computed tomography scan changes were assessed
  together with reported toxicity. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The majority (80%)
  of the 20 patients who met entry criteria were women; all had bronchiectasis, two
  had cystic fibrosis and one had primary ciliary dyskinesia. At initiation of inhaled
  amikacin, 15 were culture positive for M. abscessus and 5 for Mycobacterium avium
  complex and had received a median (range) of 60 (6, 190) months of mycobacterial
  treatment. Patients were followed for a median of 19 (1, 50) months. Eight (40%)
  patients had at least one negative culture and 5 (25%) had persistently negative
  cultures. A decrease in smear quantity was noted in 9 of 20 (45%) and in mycobacterial
  culture growth for 10 of 19 (53%). Symptom scores improved in nine (45%), were unchanged
  in seven (35%), and worsened in four (20%). Improvement on computed tomography scans
  was noted in 6 (30%), unchanged in 3 (15%), and worsened in 11 (55%). Seven (35%)
  stopped amikacin due to: ototoxicity in two (10%), hemoptysis in two (10%), and
  nephrotoxicity, persistent dysphonia, and vertigo in one each. CONCLUSIONS: In some
  patients with treatment-refractory pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial disease,
  the addition of inhaled amikacin was associated with microbiologic and/or symptomatic
  improvement; however, toxicity was common. Prospective evaluation of inhaled amikacin
  for mycobacterial disease is warranted.'
