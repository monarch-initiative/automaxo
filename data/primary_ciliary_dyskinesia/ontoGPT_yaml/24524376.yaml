input_text: 'Management of plastic bronchitis with nebulized tissue plasminogen activator:
  another brick in the wall. Plastic bronchitis is a rare complication of a variety
  of respiratory diseases and congenital heart disease surgery, particularly Fontan
  procedure. Bronchial casts with rubber-like consistency develop acutely and may
  cause severe life-threatening respiratory distress. The management of plastic bronchitis
  is yet not well defined. Early intermittent, self-administered nebulization of tissue
  plasminogen activator was found to be effective in preventing deterioration of acute
  respiratory symptoms in a patient with primary ciliary dyskinesia and recurrent
  cast formation. Further investigation into new therapeutic strategies for this devastating
  disease is advocated. '
