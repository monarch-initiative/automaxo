input_text: Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells for Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia Modeling
  and Personalized Medicine. Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare and heterogeneous
  genetic disorder that affects the structure and function of motile cilia. In the
  airway epithelium, impaired ciliary motion results in reduced or absent mucociliary
  clearance that leads to the appearance of chronic airway infection, sinusitis, and
  bronchiectasis. Currently, there is no effective treatment for PCD, and research
  is limited by the lack of convenient models to study this disease and investigate
  innovative therapies. Furthermore, the high heterogeneity of PCD genotypes is likely
  to hinder the development of a single therapy for all patients. The generation of
  patient-derived, induced pluripotent stem cells, and their differentiation into
  airway epithelium, as well as genome editing technologies, could represent major
  tools for in vitro PCD modeling and for developing personalized therapies. Here,
  we review PCD pathogenesis and then discuss how human induced pluripotent stem cells
  could be used to model this disease for the development of innovative, patient-specific
  biotherapies.
