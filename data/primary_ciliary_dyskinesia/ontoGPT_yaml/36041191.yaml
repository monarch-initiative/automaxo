input_text: "Physical activity, respiratory physiotherapy practices, and nutrition
  among people with primary ciliary dyskinesia in Switzerland - a cross-sectional
  survey. AIMS OF THE STUDY: We know little about the level of physical activity,
  respiratory physiotherapy practices and nutritional status of people with primary
  ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), although these are important aspects of patients with
  chronic respiratory disease. We assessed physical activity, respiratory physiotherapy
  practices and nutritional status among people with primary ciliary dyskinesia in
  Switzerland, investigated how these vary by age and identified factors associated
  with regular physical activity. METHODS: We sent a postal questionnaire survey to
  people with primary ciliary dyskinesia enrolled in the Swiss PCD registry (CH-PCD),
  based on the standardised FOLLOW-PCD patient questionnaire. We collected information
  about physical activity, physiotherapy, respiratory symptoms and nutritional status.
  We calculated the metabolic equivalent (MET) to better reflect the intensity of
  the reported physical activities. To assess nutritional status, we extracted information
  from CH-PCD and calculated participants' body mass index (BMI). RESULTS: Of the
  86 questionnaires we sent, 74 (86% response rate) were returned from 24 children
  and 50 adults. The median age at survey completion was 23 years (IQR [interquartile
  range] 15-51), and 51% were female. Among all 74 participants, 48 (65%) performed
  sports regularly. Children were vigorously active (median MET 9.1; IQR 7.9-9.6)
  and adults were moderately active (median MET 5.5; IQR 4.3-6.9). Fifty-nine participants
  (80%) reported performing some type of respiratory physiotherapy. However, only
  30% of adults saw a professional physiotherapist, compared with 75% of children.
  Half of the participants had normal BMI; one child (4%) and two adults (4%) were
  underweight. People who were regularly physically active reported seeing a physiotherapist
  more often. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to provide patient-reported data
  about physical activity, respiratory physiotherapy and nutrition among people with
  primary ciliary dyskinesia. Our results highlight that professional respiratory
  physiotherapy, exercise recommendations and nutritional advice are often not implemented
  in the care of people with primary ciliary dyskinesia in Switzerland. Multidisciplinary
  care in specialised centres by teams including physiotherapists and nutrition consultants
  could improve the quality of life of people with primary ciliary dyskinesia."
