input_text: Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia as a Cause of Repeating Atelectasis in the
  Neonatal Period. BACKGROUND Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a disease characterized
  by motor ciliary dysfunction, which leads to the accumulation of secretions in the
  lower airways and, consequently, to atelectasis and repeated infections. During
  the neonatal period, diagnosis can be difficult because the symptoms are frequently
  associated with other respiratory diseases common in neonates. The laterality defects
  should warn the clinician of the need for further investigation using clinical criteria,
  but the confirmation depends on a genetic test. CASE REPORT The objective of this
  report is to present a case of PCD manifesting in the neonatal period that was diagnosed
  due to respiratory failure associated with recurrent atelectasis and situs inversus
  totalis. CONCLUSIONS This disease is not well known by neonatologists, but early
  diagnosis decreases morbidity and improves patient quality of life.
