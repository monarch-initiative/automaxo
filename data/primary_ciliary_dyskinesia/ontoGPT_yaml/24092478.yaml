input_text: 'Acute hypoxemia in a parturient with primary ciliary dyskinesia following
  the administration of intravenous oxytocin: a case report. PURPOSE: We present the
  case of a parturient diagnosed with primary ciliary dyskinesia with secondary bronchiectasis
  who developed significant hypoxemia following administration of intravenous oxytocin
  during Cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia. This case suggests that oxytocin
  can affect pulmonary vascular tone and interfere with the protective effects of
  hypoxic vasoconstriction. CLINICAL FEATURES: A 35-yr-old primigravida at 37 weeks
  gestation presented for a scheduled Cesarean delivery due to breech positioning
  and fetal abnormalities. The patient had a diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia
  and had undergone a right middle lobectomy seven years earlier for resultant bronchiectasis.
  Pulmonary function testing in the month prior to delivery showed a 4% decline in
  her baseline FEV1 to 1.06 L (32% of predicted value) but she was functionally well.
  The patient initially had an uneventful spinal anesthetic and maintained an oxygen
  saturation of 97% on room air in the supine position until delivery of her baby.
  An intravenous infusion of oxytocin for uterine contraction was started following
  removal of the placenta. The patient then became acutely hypoxemic with a drop in
  room air saturation to 84% but with no other accompanying hemodynamic instability.
  Maternal oxygen saturation did not improve with the addition of supplemental oxygen,
  and the patient had a significant arterial-alveolar oxygen gradient suggesting an
  intrapulmonary shunt. No supporting clinical, radiologic, or laboratory evidence
  of a thrombotic, air, or amniotic fluid embolism or mucous plug was detected. The
  patient remained hypoxemic during the postoperative period with gradual improvement
  back to baseline saturation in approximately 48 hr. CONCLUSION: The vasodilatory
  effects of intravenous oxytocin on the pulmonary vasculature may worsen shunting
  and interfere with hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, producing clinically significant
  hypoxemia in patients with comorbid lung disease. Oxytocin should be used with caution
  in patients with compromised lung function.'
