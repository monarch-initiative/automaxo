input_text: 'Does the effect of comprehensive respiratory physiotherapy home-program
  differ in children with cystic fibrosis and non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis?
  Bronchiectasis is a form of airway damage as a consequence of endobronchial infection
  and inflammation and may be present in different diseases. The underlying aetiologies
  include both cystic fibrosis (CF) and a group of non-cystic fibrosis diseases (NCFB)
  such as immunodeficiency, primary ciliary dyskinesia, or severe pulmonary infection.
  Although children with CF and non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB) have many
  similar clinical features, their responses to exercise may be different. The aim
  of this study was to compare the efficacy of a comprehensive respiratory physiotherapy
  (CRP) home-program in children with CF and NCFB. Thirty children with CF and thirty
  children with NCFB were included in the study. Both groups performed the CRP home-program
  twice daily for 8 weeks. Pulmonary function, exercise capacity, and respiratory
  and peripheral muscle strength were assessed at baseline and after 8 weeks of training.
  Both groups experienced significant improvements in pulmonary function, exercise
  capacity, and respiratory and peripheral muscle strength (p < 0.001). Maximum expiratory
  pressure, exercise capacity, and peripheral muscle strength were further improved
  in NCFB group compared to CF (p < 0.05); however, there was a great variability
  in the improvements for each variable. CONCLUSION: CRP is beneficial both for children
  with CF and NCFB and adherence to the program was high in both groups. WHAT IS KNOWN:   Different
  physiotherapy approaches in the management of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis
  have been based on the experience gained from the research studies performed in
  cystic fibrosis.   Although having similar pathophysiology, these two diseases show
  variation in some pulmonary and extrapulmonary features. WHAT IS NEW:   The respiratory
  muscle strength and the efficacy of comprehensive respiratory physiotherapy have
  been compared for the first time in children with cystic fibrosis and non-cystic
  fibrosis bronchiectasis.   Comprehensive respiratory physiotherapy provides higher
  increases in children with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis in exercise capacity
  and expiratory and peripheral muscle strength; however, there was a great variability
  in these improvements. Nevertheless, it can be concluded that both groups significantly
  benefited from the CRP program.'
