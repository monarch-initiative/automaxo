input_text: "National survey on pediatric respiratory physiotherapy U nits: primary
  ciliary dyskinesia and non-CF bronchiectasis. BACKGROUND: Currently, there is a
  lack of data concerning the organization and characteristics of Italian pediatric
  physiotherapy units for the treatment of patients with chronic lung diseases, especially
  those with rare conditions such as Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) and non-Cystic
  Fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB). METHODS: A national descriptive study based on a
  survey questionnaire was conducted. The questionnaire consisted of three different
  sections: distribution and characteristics of the centres, services provided by
  respiratory therapists, physiotherapists' perception of the unit. The survey was
  distributed to all healthcare providers via an online platform, and a descriptive
  data analysis was performed. RESULTS: The survey had a response rate of 97.5% with
  twenty-nine responses collected. The centers are heterogeneously distributed: thirteen
  in the northern regions, eight in the central regions and eight in the southern
  regions. Of the 29 centers with a physiotherapy unit, 19 had a specialized respiratory
  therapy unit. Respiratory therapy was provided in different care settings: regular
  wards (28/29 centers, 97%), outpatient service (29/29 centers, 100%), and intensive
  or semi-intensive care units (17/29 centers, 59%). The interventions provided by
  respiratory therapists involved more than just airway clearance (29/29). More specific
  interventions, such as pulmonary function tests (23/29), functional tests (27/29),
  educational training (26/29), management of workout exercise programs (25/29) and
  interventions developed in collaboration with physicians such as non-invasive ventilation
  (NIV) (23/29) and oxygen titration (21/29) are performed. It is interesting to note
  that therapists are also involved in various activities, such as telemedicine, physiotherapists'
  research projects, and supporting alongside physicians, for the prescription at
  home of medical devices. Perception of the unit was also evaluated. CONCLUSIONS:
  The involved centers are heterogeneous in terms of distribution and treatments offered.
  The role of respiratory physiotherapists still seems to be fragmented. This first
  descriptive analysis of the physiotherapy units and the main differences between
  centers opens queries on the clinical approaches used for pediatric patients with
  PCD in terms of respiratory physiotherapy. However,in response to evolving treatment
  needs, a more specialized and standardized approach to patient care is required."
