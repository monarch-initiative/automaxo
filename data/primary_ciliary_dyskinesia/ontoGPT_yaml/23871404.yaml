input_text: '[Congenital ciliary dyskinesia. Focus]. Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD)
  is a rare autosomal recessive disease, caused by specific primary structural and/or
  functional abnormalities of the motile cilia. Prevalence, about 1/15,000 to 1/30,000,
  is probably underestimated, as diagnosis might not be evocated in absence of Kartagener
  syndrome. Diagnosis is confirmed in presence of abnormal ciliary motility as well
  as ciliary ultrastructure. Disease-causing mutations in at least 16 genes have already
  been identified; analysis will be guided by the type of ultrastructural abnormalities.
  An early and adequate diagnosis and therapy can theoretically improve the prognosis
  of the disease. '
