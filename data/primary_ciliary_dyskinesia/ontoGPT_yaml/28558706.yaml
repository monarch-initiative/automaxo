input_text: Electronic applications for the CFQ-R scoring. Patient reported outcomes
  (PROs) have become widely accepted outcome measures in cystic fibrosis (CF) and
  other respiratory diseases. The Cystic Fibrosis-Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) is
  the best validated and most widely used PRO for CF. Data collection can be time-intensive,
  and electronic platforms would greatly facilitate the feasibility, utility and accuracy
  of administration of the CFQ-R. Given that the CFQ-R is utilized in virtually all
  clinical trials worldwide and is increasingly integrated into clinical practice,
  we developed a software application that will help users to administer, score and
  save CFQ-R data for all versions. All codes are open access, which will enable other
  PRO users to design similar applications for other respiratory diseases, such as
  primary ciliary dyskinesia and non-CF bronchiectasis.

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
  object: <A sign or symptom associated with the disease and targeted by the medical action. For example, Low serum calcitriol, hypoplasia of the thymus, chronic cough, aortic stiffness, low pulse pressure>
  qualifier: <The primary disease the relationship is about, or specifically the disease the symptom is related to. For example, Beck-Fahrner syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, progeria, diabetes mellitus, infectious otitis media>
  subject_qualifier: <An optional qualifier or modifier for the subject of the statement, e.g. "high dose" or "intravenously administered">
