input_text: Life-long functional regeneration of in vivo airway epithelium by the
  engraftment of airway basal stem cells. Durable and functional regeneration of the
  airway epithelium in vivo with transplanted stem cells has the potential to reconstitute
  healthy tissue in diseased airways, such as in cystic fibrosis or primary ciliary
  dyskinesia. Here, we present detailed protocols for the preparation and culture
  expansion of murine primary and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived airway basal
  stem cells (iBCs) and methods for their intra-airway transplantation into polidocanol-conditioned
  murine recipients to achieve durable in vivo airway regeneration. Reconstitution
  of the airway tissue resident epithelial stem cell compartment of immunocompetent
  mice with syngeneic donor cells leverages the extensive self-renewal and multipotent
  differentiation properties of basal stem cells (BCs) to durably generate a broad
  diversity of mature airway epithelial lineages in vivo. Engrafted donor-derived
  cells re-establish planar cell polarity as well as functional ciliary transport.
  By using this same approach, human primary BCs or iBCs transplanted into NOD-SCID
  gamma recipient mice similarly display engraftment and multilineage airway epithelial
  differentiation in vivo. The time to generate mouse or human iBCs takes ~60 d, which
  can be reduced to ~20 d if previously differentiated cells are thawed from cryopreserved
  iBC archives. The tracheal conditioning regimen and cell transplantation procedure
  is completed in 1 d. A competent graduate student or postdoctoral trainee should
  be able to perform the procedures listed in this protocol.
