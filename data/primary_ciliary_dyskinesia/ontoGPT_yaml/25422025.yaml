input_text: 'Primary ciliary dyskinesia and neonatal respiratory distress. BACKGROUND
  AND OBJECTIVE: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare inherited disease affecting
  motile cilia lining the respiratory tract. Despite neonatal respiratory distress
  as an early feature, diagnosis is typically delayed until late childhood. Our objective
  was to identify characteristics that differentiate PCD from common causes of term
  neonatal respiratory distress. METHODS: This was a case-control study. Patients
  with PCD born after 1994 attending a regional PCD clinic who had a history of neonatal
  respiratory distress (n = 46) were included. Controls (n = 46), term neonates with
  respiratory distress requiring a chest radiograph, were randomly selected from hospital
  birth records and matched on gender, birth month/year, and mode of delivery. Multiple
  logistic regression was used to determine the association between neonatal characteristics
  and PCD diagnosis. The diagnostic performance of the best predictive variables was
  estimated by calculating sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: PCD cases required
  more oxygen therapy (39 cases, 29 controls, P = .01), longer duration of oxygen
  therapy (PCD mean = 15.2 days, control mean = 0.80 days, P < .01), had later onset
  of neonatal respiratory distress (PCD median = 12 hours, control median = 1 hour,
  P < .001), and higher frequency of lobar collapse and situs inversus (PCD = 70%
  and 48% respectively, control = 0% for both, P < .001). Situs inversus, lobar collapse,
  or oxygen need for >2 days had 87% (95% confidence interval: 74-94) sensitivity
  and 96% (95% confidence interval: 85-99) specificity for PCD. CONCLUSIONS: When
  encountering term neonates with unexplained respiratory distress, clinicians should
  consider PCD in those with lobar collapse, situs inversus, and/or prolonged oxygen
  therapy (>2 days).'
