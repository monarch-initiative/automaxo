input_text: Delivery of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin to Airways. Treatment with exogenous alpha-1
  antitrypsin (AAT), a potent serine protease inhibitor, was developed originally
  for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease associated with AAT deficiency; however,
  other lung conditions involving neutrophilic inflammation and proteolytic tissue
  injury related to neutrophil elastase and other serine proteases may also be considered
  for AAT therapy. These conditions include bronchiectasis caused by primary ciliary
  dyskinesia, cystic fibrosis, and other diseases associated with an increased free
  elastase activity in the airways. Inhaled AAT may be a viable option to counteract
  proteolytic tissue damage. This form of treatment requires efficient drug delivery
  to the targeted pulmonary compartment. Aerosol technology meeting this requirement
  is currently available and offers an alternative therapeutic approach to systemic
  AAT administration. To date, early studies in humans have shown biochemical efficacy
  and have established the safety of inhaled AAT. However, to bring aerosol AAT therapy
  to patients, large phase 3 protocols in carefully selected patient populations (i.e.,
  subgroups of patients with AAT deficiency, cystic fibrosis, or other lung diseases
  with bronchiectasis) will be needed with clinical end points in addition to the
  measurement of proteolytic activity in the airway. The outcomes likely will have
  to include lung function, lung structure assessed by computed tomography imaging,
  disease exacerbations, health status, and mortality.
