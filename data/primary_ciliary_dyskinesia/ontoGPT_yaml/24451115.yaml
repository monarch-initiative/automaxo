input_text: 'Restoring ciliary function to differentiated primary ciliary dyskinesia
  cells with a lentiviral vector. Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetically
  heterogenous autosomal recessive disease in which mutations disrupt ciliary function,
  leading to impaired mucociliary clearance and life-long lung disease. Mouse tracheal
  cells with a targeted deletion in the axonemal dynein intermediate chain 1 (Dnaic1)
  gene differentiate normally in culture but lack ciliary activity. Gene transfer
  to undifferentiated cultures of mouse Dnaic1(-/-) cells with a lentiviral vector
  pseudotyped with avian influenza hemagglutinin restored Dnaic1 expression and ciliary
  activity. Importantly, apical treatment of well-differentiated cultures of mouse
  Dnaic1(-/-) cells with lentiviral vector also restored ciliary activity, demonstrating
  successful gene transfer from the apical surface. Treatment of Dnaic1(flox/flox)
  mice expressing an estrogen-responsive Cre recombinase with different doses of tamoxifen
  indicated that restoration of ~20% of ciliary activity may be sufficient to prevent
  the development of rhinosinusitis. However, although administration of a beta-galactosidase-expressing
  vector into control mice demonstrated efficient gene transfer to the nasal epithelium,
  treatment of Dnaic1(-/-) mice resulted in a low level of gene transfer, demonstrating
  that the severe rhinitis present in these animals impedes gene transfer. The results
  demonstrate that gene replacement therapy may be a viable treatment option for PCD,
  but further improvements in the efficiency of gene transfer are necessary. '
