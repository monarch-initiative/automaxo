input_text: 'Correlation between COVID-19 infection and fetal situs inversus. BACKGROUND:
  Situs inversus is a rare congenital condition, defined by the mirror-image transposition
  of the abdominothoracic organs. It is linked to an increased risk of different disorders,
  for example, congenital heart defects and primary ciliary dyskinesia. Recently,
  some reports have been on the increased incidence of situs inversus after the COVID-19
  pandemic. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between maternal COVID-19 infection
  and fetal situs inversus occurrence risk. METHODS: All pregnant women who underwent
  fetal ultrasound examinations at Jinan Maternal and Child Health Hospital from January
  to May of 2022 and 2023 were recruited. A chi-square test was conducted to assess
  the association of maternal COVID-19 infection with the incidence rate of fetal
  situs inversus. RESULTS: A total of 8381 patients, including 25 with situs inversus
  fetuses were recruited. A total of 3956 patients had COVID-19, while 4400 did not.
  Among 25 mothers with situs inversus fetuses, 22 had COVID-19 and 3 without recent
  infection. Our analysis showed a strong link between COVID-19 and a higher risk
  of fetus situs inversus (P < .001, odds ratio 8.196). CONCLUSION: Maternal COVID-19
  infection in the early stages of the pregnancy is associated with an increased risk
  of fetal situs inversion occurrence. Therefore, further research in this field seems
  necessary.'
