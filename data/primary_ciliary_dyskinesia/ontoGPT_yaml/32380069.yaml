input_text: "Efficacy and safety of azithromycin maintenance therapy in primary ciliary
  dyskinesia (BESTCILIA): a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled
  phase 3 trial. BACKGROUND: Use of maintenance antibiotic therapy with the macrolide
  azithromycin is increasing in a number of chronic respiratory disorders including
  primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). However, evidence for its efficacy in PCD is lacking.
  We aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of azithromycin maintenance therapy
  for 6 months in patients with PCD. METHODS: The Better Experimental Screening and
  Treatment for Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (BESTCILIA) trial was a multicentre, double-blind,
  parallel group, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial done at 6 European
  PCD clinics (tertiary paediatric care centres and university hospitals in Denmark,
  Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland, and UK). Patients with a confirmed diagnosis
  of PCD, aged 7-50 years old, and predicted FEV1 greater than 40% were recruited.
  Participants were randomly assigned (1:1), stratified by age and study site, via
  a web-based randomisation system to azithromycin 250 mg or 500 mg as tablets according
  to bodyweight (</>= 40 kg) or identical placebo, three times a week for 6 months.
  The random allocation sequence was a permuted block randomisation, with a block
  size of four, generated by an external consultancy. Participants, investigators,
  and care providers were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was
  the number of respiratory exacerbations over 6 months. Analysis was by intention
  to treat. This study is registered in the EU Clinical Trials Register, EudraCT number
  2013-004664-58. FINDINGS: Between June 24, 2014, and Aug 23, 2016, 102 patients
  were screened, of whom 90 were randomly assigned to either azithromycin (n=49) or
  placebo (n=41). The study was ended without having included the planned number of
  participants due to recruitment difficulties. The mean number of respiratory exacerbations
  over 6 months was 0 75 (SD 1 12) in the azithromycin group compared with 1 62 (1
  64) in the placebo group, and participants receiving azithromycin had significantly
  lower rate of exacerbations during the individual treatment periods (rate ratio
  0 45 [95% CI 0 26-0 78]; p=0 004). Four serious adverse events were reported, occurring
  in one (2%) of 47 participants in the azithromycin group and in three (7%) of 41
  participants in the placebo group. Loose stools or diarrhoea were more common in
  the azithromycin group than in the placebo group (11 [23%] vs two [5%]). INTERPRETATION:
  This first multinational randomised controlled trial on pharmacotherapy in PCD showed
  that azithromycin maintenance therapy for 6 months was well tolerated and halved
  the rate of respiratory exacerbations. Azithromycin maintenance therapy is an option
  for patients with PCD with frequent exacerbations potentially leading to reduced
  need for additional antibiotic treatments and preventing irreversible lung damage.
