input_text: '[Orphan disease of the nose and paranasal sinuses]. Rare rhinological
  diseases are a diagnostic challenge. From the primary manifestation until the final
  diagnosis it may take several months or even up to years in which the disease progress
  is uncontrolled and the disease insufficiently treated. This results in (irreversible)
  damage and possibly life-threatening situations. The unexpected course of a (misdiagnosed)
  disease should lead to further diagnostic considerations and steps to detect the
  orphan disease at a stage as early as possible. In the present work granulomatous
  diseases of the nose and sinuses caused by mycobacteria, treponemes, klebsiella,
  fungi and protozoa as well as vasculitis, sarcoidosis, rosacea, the cocaine-induced
  midline destruction, the nasal extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma and cholesterol granuloma
  are discussed. Furthermore diseases with disorders of mucociliary clearance as the
  primary ciliary dyskinesia and cystic fibrosis are presented taking into account
  the current literature. '
