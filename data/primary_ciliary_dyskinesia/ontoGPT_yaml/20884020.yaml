input_text: "Increased postoperative and respiratory complications in patients with
  congenital heart disease associated with heterotaxy. OBJECTIVE: Patients with heterotaxy
  and complex congenital heart disease underwent cardiac surgery with high mortality
  and morbidity. Recent studies have revealed an association among heterotaxy, congenital
  heart disease, and primary ciliary dyskinesia. We undertook a retrospective review
  of patients undergoing cardiac surgery at Children's National Medical Center between
  2004 and 2008 to explore the hypothesis that there is increased mortality and respiratory
  complications in heterotaxy patients. METHODS: Retrospective review was performed
  on postsurgical outcomes of 87 patients with heterotaxy and congenital heart disease
  exhibiting the full spectrum of situs abnormalities associated with heterotaxy.
  As controls patients, 634 cardiac surgical patients with congenital heart disease,
  but without laterality defects, were selected, and surgical complexities were similar
  with a median Risk Adjustment in Congenital Heart Surgery-1 score of 3.0 for both
  groups. RESULTS: We found the mean length of postoperative hospital stay (17 vs
  11 days) and mechanical ventilation (11 vs 4 days) were significantly increased
  in the heterotaxy patients. Also elevated were rates of tracheostomies (6.9% vs
  1.6%; odds ratio, 4.6), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support (12.6% vs 4.9%:
  odds ratio, 2.8), prolonged ventilatory courses (23% vs 12.3%; odds ratio, 2.1)
  and postsurgical deaths (16.1% vs 4.7%; odds ratio, 3.9). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings
  show heterotaxy patients had more postsurgical events with increased postsurgical
  mortality and risk for respiratory complications as compared to control patients
  with similar Risk Adjustment in Congenital Heart Surgery-1 surgical complexity scores.
  We speculate that increased respiratory complications maybe due to ciliary dysfunction.
  Further studies are needed to explore the basis for the increased surgical risks
  for heterotaxy patients undergoing cardiac surgery."
