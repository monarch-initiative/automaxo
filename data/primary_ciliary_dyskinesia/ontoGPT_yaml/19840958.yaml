input_text: 'Respiratory medicines for children: current evidence, unlicensed use
  and research priorities. This European Respiratory Society task force has reviewed
  the evidence for paediatric medicines in respiratory disease occurring in adults
  and children. We describe off-licence use, research priorities and ongoing studies.
  Off-licence and off-label prescribing in children is widespread and potentially
  harmful. Research areas in asthma include novel formulations and regimens, and individualised
  prescribing. In cystic fibrosis, future studies will focus on screened infants and
  robust outcome measures are needed. Other areas include new enzyme and antibiotic
  formulations and the basic defect. Research into pneumonia should include evaluation
  of new antibacterials and regimens, rapid diagnostic tests and, in pleural infection,
  antibiotic penetration, fibrinolytics and surveillance. In uncommon conditions,
  such as primary ciliary dyskinesia, congenital pulmonary abnormalities or neuromuscular
  disorders, drugs indicated for other conditions (e.g. dornase alfa) are commonly
  used and trials are needed. In neuromuscular disorders, the beta-agonists may enhance
  muscle strength and are in need of evaluation. Studies of antibiotic prophylaxis,
  immunoglobulin and antifungal drugs are needed in immune deficiency. We hope that
  this summary of the evidence for respiratory medicines in children, highlighting
  gaps and research priorities, will be useful for the pharmaceutical industry, the
  paediatric committee of the European Medicines Agency, academic investigators and
  the lay public.'
