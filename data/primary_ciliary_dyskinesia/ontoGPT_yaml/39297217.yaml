input_text: 'Inhaled Medications for Maintenance Therapy in Pediatric Noncystic Fibrosis
  Bronchiectasis. OBJECTIVE: This review focuses on evaluating literature for the
  use of inhaled mucolytics (hypertonic saline, mannitol, and dornase alfa), inhaled
  antibiotics (tobramycin, aztreonam, colistin, and amikacin), and inhaled corticosteroids
  in pediatric noncystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. DATA SOURCES: A literature search
  via PubMed was conducted using the search terms "non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis,"
  "primary ciliary dyskinesia," and "bronchiectasis" in combination with each inhaled
  agent of interest. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Studies were included if
  they were specific to patients with a clinical diagnosis of noncystic fibrosis bronchiectasis
  published from 1998 to July 2024. DATA SYNTHESIS: Several inhaled medications can
  be considered as maintenance therapies for pediatric patients with noncystic fibrosis
  bronchiectasis. Hypertonic saline could be considered for its potential airway clearance
  benefits and low risk of causing harm. Inhaled antipseudomonal antibiotics should
  be considered in patients who are colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Inhaled
  corticosteroid therapy should be reserved for patients with concomitant asthma.
  Dornase alfa has shown worse outcomes in adults with noncystic fibrosis bronchiectasis
  and should be used with caution. Risks and benefits should be carefully considered
  when evaluating these therapies for use in noncystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, and
  patient-specific treatment regimens should be developed. RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE
  AND CLINICAL PRACTICE: Chronic management of pediatric noncystic fibrosis bronchiectasis
  remains challenging due to paucity of applicable literature. Risks and benefits
  of different agents are discussed in this article with recommendations for application
  to clinical practice based on studies performed in both adult and pediatric patients
  with noncystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. CONCLUSION: Several inhaled medications
  could be considered as maintenance therapies for pediatric patients with noncystic
  fibrosis bronchiectasis, with more robust evidence to support use of inhaled antipseudomonal
  antibiotics and hypertonic saline compared with other available agents. Further
  investigation is needed to identify a clear place in therapy for inhaled therapies
  in pediatric noncystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.'
