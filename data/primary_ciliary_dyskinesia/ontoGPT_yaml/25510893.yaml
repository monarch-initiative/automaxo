input_text: "Presentation of primary ciliary dyskinesia in children: 30 years' experience.
  AIM: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare (1:15,000) condition resulting in
  recurrent suppurative respiratory tract infections, progressive lung damage and
  hearing impairment. As the diagnosis is often delayed for years, the purpose of
  this study was to review the presenting features of children with PCD attending
  Australia's initial diagnostic PCD service over a 30-year period. METHOD: A retrospective
  review of the symptoms of children diagnosed with PCD at Concord Hospital between
  1982 and 2012 was undertaken. RESULTS: One thousand thirty-seven paediatric patients
  were referred for assessment and underwent nasal ciliary brushing. Eighty-four (8.1%)
  had PCD based on microscopic analysis of nasal cilia. This included 81 with ciliary
  ultrastructural abnormalities demonstrated on electron microscopy and 3 with a suggestive
  phenotype, reduced ciliary beat frequency and a family history of PCD. The median
  age at diagnosis was 6.4 years (range 0.1 to 18.2 years). Forty-six per cent had
  situs abnormalities and 31% had a family member with PCD. Recurrent cough (81%),
  rhinosinusitis (71%), recurrent otitis media (49%) and neonatal respiratory distress
  (57%) were reported. Bronchiectasis at presentation was documented in 32%. Situs
  abnormalities and neonatal respiratory distress were present together in 26%. CONCLUSION:
  PCD remains under-recognised by health-care workers. The combination of neonatal
  respiratory distress, chronic suppurative cough and rhinosinusitis was the most
  common documented symptom cluster at presentation in cases of PCD. A heightened
  awareness of the clinical features of the disease may help to lower the age at diagnosis,
  facilitate appropriate treatment and improve long-term outcomes."
