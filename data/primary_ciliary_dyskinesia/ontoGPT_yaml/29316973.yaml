input_text: "Kartagener's syndrome: a case report. BACKGROUND: Kartagener's syndrome
  is a subset of primary ciliary dyskinesia, an autosomal recessive inherited disorder
  characterized by the clinical triad of chronic sinusitis, bronchiectasis, and situs
  inversus. Abnormal ciliary structure or function leading to impaired ciliary motility
  is the main pathophysiologic problem in Kartagener's syndrome. CASE PRESENTATION:
  A 24-year-old man from Gondar town, North-West Ethiopia, presented to University
  of Gondar Hospital with recurrent episodes of nasal congestion with itching and
  paranasal discomfort, and productive cough for more than a decade. Clinical and
  imaging findings revealed chronic sinusitis, bronchiectasis, dextrocardia, and situs
  inversus. He was treated with orally administered antibiotics, mucolytic, and chest
  physiotherapy. He was symptomatically better with the above therapy, and started
  on a long-term low-dose prophylactic antibiotic. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Kartagener's
  syndrome exist in Ethiopia as cases of chronic recurrent sinopulmonary infections.
  As there is no easy, reliable non-invasive diagnostic test for Kartagener's syndrome
  and the correct diagnosis is often delayed by years, it may cause chronic respiratory
  problems with reduced quality of life. Genetic counseling and fertility issues should
  be addressed once Kartagener's syndrome is diagnosed."
