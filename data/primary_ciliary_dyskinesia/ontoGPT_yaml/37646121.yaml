input_text: 'The effect of inspiratory muscle training in PCD and CF patients: A pilot
  study. BACKGROUND: Effective work of breathing and bronchial hygiene requires synergy
  of inspiratory and expiratory muscles. Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) is a part
  of pulmonary rehabilitation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There
  is some evidence of its efficacy in cystic fibrosis (CF) and, recently, in long
  COVID-19. We are not aware of studies on IMT in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD).
  Our aim was to assess the effect of IMT on respiratory muscle strength and pulmonary
  function in PCD and CF patients. METHODS: A single center pilot study. Spirometry,
  lung clearance index (LCI), maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), and maximal expiratory
  pressure (MEP) were measured at baseline (visit 1), after a month of IMT with  POWERbreathe
  (visit 2), and at follow-up (visit 3). RESULTS: The cohort included 27 patients
  (19 PCD, 8 CF); mean age 18.4 +- 9.8 years. After a month of IMT, there was a significant
  increase in MIP and MIP% (6.19-7.44, p = .015; and 81.85%-100.41%, p = .046, respectively),
  which was sustained at visit 3. Compliance >=90% led to higher improvement in MIP.
  In sub-group analysis, improvement in MIP and MIP% remained significant for PCD
  patients (p = .026 and p = .049, respectively). No significant changes were found
  in spirometry, MEP or LCI. CONCLUSIONS: IMT was well-tolerated and led to improved
  inspiratory muscle strength in PCD patients. The clinical implication of improved
  MIP should be further investigated. Larger, long-term studies are needed to evaluate
  long-term effects of IMT on pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength, pulmonary
  exacerbations, and quality of life.'
