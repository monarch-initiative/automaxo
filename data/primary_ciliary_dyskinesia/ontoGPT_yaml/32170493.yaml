input_text: "Novel DNAAF6 variants identified by whole-exome sequencing cause male
  infertility and primary ciliary dyskinesia. PURPOSE: To identify the genetic cause
  of patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and male infertility from two
  unrelated Han Chinese families. METHODS: We conducted whole-exome sequencing of
  three individuals with PCD and male infertility from two unrelated Chinese families,
  and performed a targeted look-up for DNAAF6 variants in our previously reported
  cohort of 442 individuals (219 with isolated oligoasthenospermia and 223 fertile
  controls). Ultrastructural and immunostaining analyses of patients' spermatozoa
  were performed. The pathogenicity of the variants was validated using patient's
  spermatozoa and HEK293T cells. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment
  was conducted in two patients. RESULTS: We identified one novel hemizygous frameshift
  variant (NM_173494, c.319_329del: p.R107fs) of DNAAF6 gene (previously named PIH1D3)
  in family 1 and one novel hemizygous missense variant (c.290G>T: p.G97V) in family
  2. No hemizygous deleterious variants in DNAAF6 were detected in the control cohort
  of 442 individuals. Ultrastructural and immunostaining analyses of patients' spermatozoa
  showed the absence of outer and inner dynein arms in sperm flagella. Both variants
  were proven to lead to DNAAF6 protein degradation in HEK293T cells. Both patients
  carrying DNAAF6 variants underwent one ICSI cycle and delivered one healthy child
  each. CONCLUSION: We identified novel DNAAF6 variants causing male infertility and
  PCD in Han Chinese patients. This finding extended the spectrum of variants in DNAAF6
  and revealed new light on the impact of DNAAF6 variants in sperm flagella."
