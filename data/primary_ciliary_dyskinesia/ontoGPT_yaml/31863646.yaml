input_text: Identification of Potential Therapeutic Gene Markers in Nasopharyngeal
  Carcinoma Based on Bioinformatics Analysis. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a
  common cancer found in the nasopharynx with high metastatic and invasive nature.
  Increasing evidences have identified the critical role of gene therapy in NPC treatment.
  Hence, this study was designed to identify specific gene markers that affected NPC
  progression through gene expression profile analysis. NPC-related gene expression
  data set gene set enrichment (GSE)53819 were retrieved and analyzed to screen out
  differentially expressed genes (DEGs), followed by determination of their expression
  in noncancerous tissues and NPC specimens. Next, weighted gene co-expression network
  analysis (WGCNA) was conducted on DEGs to obtain tumor-associated gene modules.
  Genes in those modules were intersected with DEGs for gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes functional enrichment analysis. Then protein-protein interaction
  network of tumor-associated genes was constructed to select genes most closely linked
  to NPC. Afterward, expression of chromosome 9 open reading frame 24 (c9orf24), primary
  ciliary dyskinesia protein 1 (PCDP1), and leucine-rich repeat-containing protein
  46 (LRRC46) was detected in GSE53819 and further verified in GSE12452 and GSE64634.
  Differential analysis on GSE53819 found that 2,173 genes were aberrantly expressed
  in NPC, among which 917 genes are upregulated and 1,256 genes are downregulated.
  WGCNA showed that genes were enriched in 17 modules and 727 genes exhibited ectopic
  expression in NPC and enriched in cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, cytochrome
  P450, and chemical carcinogenesis signaling pathways, among which c9orf24, PCDP1,
  and LRRC46 were poorly expressed in NPC. Therefore, c9orf24, PCDP1, and LRRC46 might
  serve as prominent diagnostic markers for NPC, which presents new insights for NPC
  therapy.
