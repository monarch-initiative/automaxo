input_text: Clinical significance of respiratory isolates for Mycobacterium abscessus
  complex from pediatric patients. Mycobacterium abscessus complex is the most virulent
  of rapidly growing mycobacteria causing invasive lung disease. To better delineate
  clinical pediatric experience and outcomes with M. abscessus complex, we retrospectively
  gathered 5-year data on M. abscessus complex infection and outcomes in a large,
  hospital-based pediatric pulmonary center. Patients were selected from the database
  of the microbiology department at Miller Children's Hospital in Long Beach, CA.
  Patients had at least one positive pulmonary isolate for M. abscessus complex from
  February 2006 to May 2011. Treatment modality data were collected and successful
  therapy of disease was determined as clearance of M. abscessus complex infection
  after antibiotics proven by culture negative respiratory isolate within at least
  12 months of therapy initiation. Two cystic fibrosis patients with M. abscessus
  complex were identified, one with failed therapy and the other with stable pulmonary
  status despite persistent isolation. One primary ciliary dyskinesia patient had
  successful clearance of M. abscessus complex, however is now growing M. avium intracellulare.
  A patient with no prior medical history was successfully treated with antimycobacterial
  therapy. Eleven patients with neuromuscular disorders had tracheal aspirates positive
  for M. abscessus complex. None were treated due to stable lung status and all but
  two had spontaneous clearance of the mycobacteria. The two remaining persist with
  sporadic isolation of M. abscessus complex without clinical significance. We concluded
  that patients with tracheostomy associated M. abscessus complex infections do not
  appear to require treatment and often have spontaneous resolution. Cystic fibrosis
  or primary ciliary dyskinesia patients may have clinical disease warranting treatment,
  but current antimycobacterial therapy has not proven to be completely successful.
  As M. abscessus complex gains prevalence, standardized guidelines for diagnosis
  and therapy are needed in the pediatric population. Multicenter cohort analysis
  is necessary to achieve such guidelines.
