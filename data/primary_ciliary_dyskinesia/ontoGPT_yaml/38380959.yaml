input_text: 'The utility of nasal nitric oxide in the diagnostic evaluation of primary
  ciliary dyskinesia. BACKGROUND: There is no gold-standard test for primary ciliary
  dyskinesia (PCD), rather American Thoracic Society guidelines recommend starting
  with nasal nitric oxide (nNO) in children >=5 years old and confirming the diagnosis
  with genetic testing or ciliary biopsy with transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
  These guidelines have not been studied in a clinical setting. We present a case
  series describing the PCD diagnostic process at our pediatric PCD center. METHODS:
  Diagnostic data from 131 patients undergoing PCD consultation were reviewed. RESULTS:
  In all participants >= 5 years old and who completed nNO using resistor methodology,
  the first diagnostic test performed was nNO in 77% (73/95), genetic testing in 14%
  (13/95), and TEM in <1% (9/95). nNO was the only diagnostic test performed in 75%
  (55/73) of participants who completed nNO first. Seventy-five percent (55/73) had
  a single above the cutoff nNO value and PCD was determined to be unlikely in 91%
  (50/55) without performing additional confirmatory testing. Eleven percent (8/73)
  had multiple below the cutoff nNO values, with 38% (3/8) being diagnosed with PCD
  by confirmatory testing and 50% (4/8) with negative confirmatory testing, but being
  managed as PCD. The genetic testing positivity rate was 50% in participants who
  completed nNO first and 8% when genetic testing was completed first. CONCLUSION:
  nNO is useful in three situations: an initial above the cutoff nNO value makes PCD
  unlikely and prevents additional confirmatory testing, repetitively below the cutoff
  nNO values without positive confirmatory testing suggests a probable PCD diagnosis
  and the yield of genetic testing is higher when nNO is performed first.'
