                    "abstract": "Background: Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disorder requiring airway clearance techniques for mucus removal. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility and the effect of the active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT) versus oscillating positive expiratory pressure therapy (OPEP) in improving lung function and functional exercise capacity among children with PCD in Palestine. Methods: 32 PCD children (6-18 years) were included in a 12-week home-based feasibility study. They were assigned randomly into two groups: ACBT and OPEP. Data collection included spirometry measurements, and the six-minute walk test (6MWT). Results: After 12 weeks of regular airway clearance techniques (ACT), the FEV1, MEF25-75%, and the 6MWT demonstrated statistically significant differences (p = .02, p = .04, and p = .05 respectively) between the two groups, in favor of the OPEP group with the effect size of Cohen's d (0.86, 0.76, and 0.71) respectively. However, there was no significant difference (p > .05) between the two groups in FVC and FEV1/FVC. Additionally, only in the OPEP group, significant differences were recorded between pre and post-tests for FEV1 and 6MWT (p < .05). Conclusion: The randomized study design comparing ACBT and OPEP was feasible and acceptable to patients. OPEP demonstrates potential for managing respiratory health; however, treatments should be individualized to address each patient's specific needs. Further research with larger cohorts is needed to assess the effectiveness of both methods.",

We aimed to investigate the effects of active video games (AVGs) on pulmonary function, respiratory and peripheral muscle strength, exercise capacity, muscle oxygenation (SMO2), physical activity, activities of daily living (ADL), and quality of life (QOL) in PCD. Thirty-two PCD patients were randomly assigned to AVG group (n = 16) and the control group (n = 16). AVG group underwent AVGs using Xbox-Kinect-360 device for 40 min/day, 3 days/week for 8 weeks plus airway clearance techniques (ACT), and the control group was applied ACT only. Pulmonary function, respiratory and quadriceps muscle strength, exercise capacity (6-min walk test [6MWT], incremental shuttle walk test [ISWT]), and ADL (Glittre ADL test) were assessed. SMO2 during ISWT and ADL test was also recorded. Physical activity and QOL (PCD-QOL) were evaluated. Pulmonary function; respiratory and quadriceps muscle strength; 6MWT and ISWT distance; physical activity; ADL performance; SMO2; physical, emotional, and social functioning; treatment burden; and upper and lower symptom parameters of PCD-QOL significantly improved after 8 weeks in the AVG group (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in measured parameters except emotional function and upper respiratory symptom scores of PCD-QOL in the control group (p > 0.05).    Conclusion: The AVGs positively affect pulmonary (pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength) and extrapulmonary (peripheral muscle strength, exercise capacity, SMO2, physical activity, ADL, and QOL) characteristics in children with PCD. The AVGs may be added to the pulmonary rehabilitation program as an exercise training modality in patients with PCD.   Trial registration: This study registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with NCT03832491 on February 6, 2019. What is Known:   It is indicated that exercise capacity is increased with traditional exercise-training in a case report of Kartagener Syndrome. What is New:   No randomized controlled study investigated the effects of exercise-training in PCD.   8-week moderate-intensity active video gaming (AVGs) improves pulmonary and extrapulmonary features in children with PCD. AVGs may be preferable due to being enjoyable, providing visual and audial feedback in the pulmonary rehabilitation programs of PCD.",

We aimed to investigate the effects of active video games (AVGs) on pulmonary function, respiratory and peripheral muscle strength, exercise capacity, muscle oxygenation (SMO2), physical activity, activities of daily living (ADL), and quality of life (QOL) in PCD. Thirty-two PCD patients were randomly assigned to AVG group (n = 16) and the control group (n = 16). AVG group underwent AVGs using Xbox-Kinect-360 device for 40 min/day, 3 days/week for 8 weeks plus airway clearance techniques (ACT), and the control group was applied ACT only. Pulmonary function, respiratory and quadriceps muscle strength, exercise capacity (6-min walk test [6MWT], incremental shuttle walk test [ISWT]), and ADL (Glittre ADL test) were assessed. SMO2 during ISWT and ADL test was also recorded. Physical activity and QOL (PCD-QOL) were evaluated. Pulmonary function; respiratory and quadriceps muscle strength; 6MWT and ISWT distance; physical activity; ADL performance; SMO2; physical, emotional, and social functioning; treatment burden; and upper and lower symptom parameters of PCD-QOL significantly improved after 8 weeks in the AVG group (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in measured parameters except emotional function and upper respiratory symptom scores of PCD-QOL in the control group (p > 0.05).    Conclusion: The AVGs positively affect pulmonary (pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength) and extrapulmonary (peripheral muscle strength, exercise capacity, SMO2, physical activity, ADL, and QOL) characteristics in children with PCD. The AVGs may be added to the pulmonary rehabilitation program as an exercise training modality in patients with PCD.   Trial registration: This study registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with NCT03832491 on February 6, 2019. What is Known:   It is indicated that exercise capacity is increased with traditional exercise-training in a case report of Kartagener Syndrome. What is New:   No randomized controlled study investigated the effects of exercise-training in PCD.   8-week moderate-intensity active video gaming (AVGs) improves pulmonary and extrapulmonary features in children with PCD. AVGs may be preferable due to being enjoyable, providing visual and audial feedback in the pulmonary rehabilitation programs of PCD.",

Data collection can be time-intensive, and electronic platforms would greatly facilitate the feasibility, utility and accuracy of administration of the CFQ-R. Given that the CFQ-R is utilized in virtually all clinical trials worldwide and is increasingly integrated into clinical practice, we developed a software application that will help users to administer, score and save CFQ-R data for all versions. All codes are open access, which will enable other PRO users to design similar applications for other respiratory diseases, such as primary ciliary dyskinesia and non-CF bronchiectasis.",

Gastrointestinal complications are rare, especially during childhood. In adults, only two cases of peptic ulcer have been reported in neurofibromatosis, both due to Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) may be primary or secondary in nature and it may be life threatening in the acute phase due to the risk of perforation. A case of recurrent gastrointestinal hemorrhage in a child with systemic neurofibromatosis and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is presented. The upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed the presence of multiple gastric ulcers. The ulcers scarred after the long-term administration of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), but recurred after the suspension. Laboratory and imaging studies excluded Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and other known causes of PUD, suggesting a potential role of neurofibromatosis itself and primary ciliary dyskinesia in developing of recurrent PUD. As early diagnosis of PUD is vital for patient survival, this case report highlights the possible association of neurofibromatosis and PCD with this condition, responsive to PPI therapy and the potential need of gastric protection before complications arise.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: We present the case of a parturient diagnosed with primary ciliary dyskinesia with secondary bronchiectasis who developed significant hypoxemia following administration of intravenous oxytocin during Cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia. This case suggests that oxytocin can affect pulmonary vascular tone and interfere with the protective effects of hypoxic vasoconstriction. CLINICAL FEATURES: A 35-yr-old primigravida at 37 weeks gestation presented for a scheduled Cesarean delivery due to breech positioning and fetal abnormalities. The patient had a diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia and had undergone a right middle lobectomy seven years earlier for resultant bronchiectasis. Pulmonary function testing in the month prior to delivery showed a 4% decline in her baseline FEV1 to 1.06 L (32% of predicted value) but she was functionally well. The patient initially had an uneventful spinal anesthetic and maintained an oxygen saturation of 97% on room air in the supine position until delivery of her baby. An intravenous infusion of oxytocin for uterine contraction was started following removal of the placenta. The patient then became acutely hypoxemic with a drop in room air saturation to 84% but with no other accompanying hemodynamic instability. Maternal oxygen saturation did not improve with the addition of supplemental oxygen, and the patient had a significant arterial-alveolar oxygen gradient suggesting an intrapulmonary shunt. No supporting clinical, radiologic, or laboratory evidence of a thrombotic, air, or amniotic fluid embolism or mucous plug was detected. The patient remained hypoxemic during the postoperative period with gradual improvement back to baseline saturation in approximately 48 hr. CONCLUSION: The vasodilatory effects of intravenous oxytocin on the pulmonary vasculature may worsen shunting and interfere with hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, producing clinically significant hypoxemia in patients with comorbid lung disease. Oxytocin should be used with caution in patients with compromised lung function.",

METHODS: A national descriptive study based on a survey questionnaire was conducted. The questionnaire consisted of three different sections: distribution and characteristics of the centres, services provided by respiratory therapists, physiotherapists' perception of the unit. The survey was distributed to all healthcare providers via an online platform, and a descriptive data analysis was performed. RESULTS: The survey had a response rate of 97.5% with twenty-nine responses collected. The centers are heterogeneously distributed: thirteen in the northern regions, eight in the central regions and eight in the southern regions. Of the 29 centers with a physiotherapy unit, 19 had a specialized respiratory therapy unit. Respiratory therapy was provided in different care settings: regular wards (28/29 centers, 97%), outpatient service (29/29 centers, 100%), and intensive or semi-intensive care units (17/29 centers, 59%). The interventions provided by respiratory therapists involved more than just airway clearance (29/29). More specific interventions, such as pulmonary function tests (23/29), functional tests (27/29), educational training (26/29), management of workout exercise programs (25/29) and interventions developed in collaboration with physicians such as non-invasive ventilation (NIV) (23/29) and oxygen titration (21/29) are performed. It is interesting to note that therapists are also involved in various activities, such as telemedicine, physiotherapists' research projects, and supporting alongside physicians, for the prescription at home of medical devices. Perception of the unit was also evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: The involved centers are heterogeneous in terms of distribution and treatments offered. The role of respiratory physiotherapists still seems to be fragmented. This first descriptive analysis of the physiotherapy units and the main differences between centers opens queries on the clinical approaches used for pediatric patients with PCD in terms of respiratory physiotherapy.

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Bronchiectasis is usually a complication of previous lower respiratory infection and/or inflammation. It causes chronic cough, copious production of sputum (often purulent), and recurrent infections, and may cause airway obstruction bearing some similarities with that seen in COPD. It may complicate respiratory conditions such as asthma or COPD. It can be associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia, primary immunodeficiencies, certain systemic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis, and foreign body inhalation. Bronchiectasis can be due to cystic fibrosis but this is excluded from this review. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments in people with non-cystic fibrosis (non-CF) bronchiectasis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to January 2014 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. RESULTS: We found 23 studies that met our inclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: airway clearance techniques, corticosteroids (inhaled), exercise or physical training, hyperosmolar agents (inhaled), mucolytics, prolonged-use antibiotics, and surgery.",

Physiotherapy, in the form of airway clearance techniques and exercise is recommended to patients with PCD to facilitate sputum clearance. As children diagnosed with PCD develop into adults, understanding their experiences of growing up with this long-term condition and undertaking physiotherapy may help to provide insight to clinicians. No previous research has been published which explores the lived experiences of children and young people with PCD. The prevalence of PCD in Bradford in the North of the UK is unusually high, signifying the importance of understanding the experiences of this patient population. This qualitative study used Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis to allow the researcher, as a physiotherapist, to investigate the lived experiences of five paediatric patients with PCD. While patients' experiences are all unique, three themes emerged across the analysis of the interviews: (1) the experiences of day to day life with the symptoms and treatment burden of PCD; (2) participants' awareness of their own symptoms and knowledge of PCD; and (3) the development of mastery skills and devolution of management from the family to the growing child. The results from this study suggested that facilitation of disease acceptance, strategies to increase patient empowerment, the use of patient-centred communication and understanding the contextualisation of patients' experiences may all help to guide clinical practice.",

It causes chronic cough, copious production of sputum (often purulent), and recurrent infections, and may cause airway obstruction bearing some similarities with that seen in COPD. It may complicate respiratory conditions such as asthma or COPD. It can be associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia, primary immunodeficiencies, certain systemic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis, and foreign body inhalation. Bronchiectasis can be due to cystic fibrosis but this is excluded from this review. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments in people with non-cystic fibrosis (non-CF) bronchiectasis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to January 2014 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. RESULTS: We found 23 studies that met our inclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: airway clearance techniques, corticosteroids (inhaled), exercise or physical training, hyperosmolar agents (inhaled), mucolytics, prolonged-use antibiotics, and surgery.",

Airway infection management strategies are borrowed from cystic fibrosis. The aim of this study is to describe the management of airway infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( PA) in children and adults with PCD across European centers. An online survey questionnaire was sent electronically using SurveyMonkey  to 55 PCD centers in 36 European countries. Fifty-two responded from 43 centers in 26 countries, a response rate of 70%. Most (89%) countries did not have written guidelines for PCD management. Airway sampling for infection detection at each clinic visit was more likely when follow-up was frequent. Eighty-seven percent of centers chose to treat the first PA isolate, most prescribing combined oral ciprofloxacin and inhaled colistimethate sodium (43%, n = 18). The preferred treatment for chronic infection with PA was nebulized colistimethate in 51% ( n = 22). In summary, considerable variation exists across European centers in the frequency of patient follow-up and airway sampling for infection, treatment goals, and the management of PA infection. Few centers had written guidelines for PCD management. Clinical trials to determine optimal treatment of PA in PCD patients are urgently needed.",

Regular respiratory monitoring consists of lung function tests, adapted to the patient's age, and cough swab or sputum cultures. Chest X-rays are insensitive but the use of high-resolution computed tomography should be considered carefully to avoid excessive radiation. Treatment of the chronic suppuration of the lower airways relies on antibiotics to which the isolated bacteria are sensitive, together with respiratory physiotherapy and exercise to clear excessive bronchial secretions. Bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory agents have no proven benefit and should be prescribed, if at all, on an individual basis. Treatment of the lower airways should always be in conjunction with that of the upper airways.

To better delineate clinical pediatric experience and outcomes with M. abscessus complex, we retrospectively gathered 5-year data on M. abscessus complex infection and outcomes in a large, hospital-based pediatric pulmonary center. Patients were selected from the database of the microbiology department at Miller Children's Hospital in Long Beach, CA. Patients had at least one positive pulmonary isolate for M. abscessus complex from February 2006 to May 2011. Treatment modality data were collected and successful therapy of disease was determined as clearance of M. abscessus complex infection after antibiotics proven by culture negative respiratory isolate within at least 12 months of therapy initiation. Two cystic fibrosis patients with M. abscessus complex were identified, one with failed therapy and the other with stable pulmonary status despite persistent isolation. One primary ciliary dyskinesia patient had successful clearance of M. abscessus complex, however is now growing M. avium intracellulare. A patient with no prior medical history was successfully treated with antimycobacterial therapy. Eleven patients with neuromuscular disorders had tracheal aspirates positive for M. abscessus complex. None were treated due to stable lung status and all but two had spontaneous clearance of the mycobacteria. The two remaining persist with sporadic isolation of M. abscessus complex without clinical significance. We concluded that patients with tracheostomy associated M. abscessus complex infections do not appear to require treatment and often have spontaneous resolution. Cystic fibrosis or primary ciliary dyskinesia patients may have clinical disease warranting treatment, but current antimycobacterial therapy has not proven to be completely successful. As M. abscessus complex gains prevalence, standardized guidelines for diagnosis and therapy are needed in the pediatric population. Multicenter cohort analysis is necessary to achieve such guidelines.",

RESULTS: The patient had obstructive azoospermia, measurement of nasal NO exhalation at 84 ppb, and typical symptoms of PCD in nasal sinuses and lungs.

Regular respiratory monitoring consists of lung function tests, adapted to the patient's age, and cough swab or sputum cultures. Chest X-rays are insensitive but the use of high-resolution computed tomography should be considered carefully to avoid excessive radiation. Treatment of the chronic suppuration of the lower airways relies on antibiotics to which the isolated bacteria are sensitive, together with respiratory physiotherapy and exercise to clear excessive bronchial secretions. Bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory agents have no proven benefit and should be prescribed, if at all, on an individual basis. Treatment of the lower airways should always be in conjunction with that of the upper airways.

Congenital abnormality of the primary cilia results in situs inversus in 50% of patients. Decreased function of motile cilia causes chronic rhinosinusitis, otitis media with effusion, bronchiectasis and infertility. Cases with situs inversus are considered to show \"Kartagener's syndrome\", and diagnosis is not difficult. However, in cases without situs inversus, the diagnosis is much more troublesome. PCD without situs inversus is thus probably underdiagnosed. Prolonged chronic cough represents an important symptom that is seen in most patients. The diagnosis of PCD requires the presence of the characteristic clinical phenotypes and either: (1) specific ciliary ultrastructural defects identified by transmission electron microscopy in biopsy samples of respiratory epithelium; or (2) identification of mutation in one of the genes known to be associated with PCD. Nasal nitric oxide concentration is extremely low in PCD, and this could be useful for screening of the disease. At present, no fundamental therapies are available for PCD. Diagnosis in the early stages is important to prevent progression of bronchiectasis and deterioration of lung function by guidance for daily life, immunization, cessation of smoking and prompt therapy at the time of respiratory tract infection. Since PCD is inherited in an autosomal-recessive manner, genetic counseling is necessary after definite diagnosis. ",

These guidelines have not been studied in a clinical setting. We present a case series describing the PCD diagnostic process at our pediatric PCD center. METHODS: Diagnostic data from 131 patients undergoing PCD consultation were reviewed. RESULTS: In all participants >= 5 years old and who completed nNO using resistor methodology, the first diagnostic test performed was nNO in 77% (73/95), genetic testing in 14% (13/95), and TEM in <1% (9/95). nNO was the only diagnostic test performed in 75% (55/73) of participants who completed nNO first. Seventy-five percent (55/73) had a single above the cutoff nNO value and PCD was determined to be unlikely in 91% (50/55) without performing additional confirmatory testing. Eleven percent (8/73) had multiple below the cutoff nNO values, with 38% (3/8) being diagnosed with PCD by confirmatory testing and 50% (4/8) with negative confirmatory testing, but being managed as PCD. The genetic testing positivity rate was 50% in participants who completed nNO first and 8% when genetic testing was completed first. CONCLUSION: nNO is useful in three situations: an initial above the cutoff nNO value makes PCD unlikely and prevents additional confirmatory testing, repetitively below the cutoff nNO values without positive confirmatory testing suggests a probable PCD diagnosis and the yield of genetic testing is higher when nNO is performed first.",

                    "title": "Intermittent prophylactic antibiotics for bronchiectasis.",
                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bronchiectasis is a common but under-diagnosed chronic disorder characterised by permanent dilation of the airways arising from a cycle of recurrent infection and inflammation. Symptoms including chronic, persistent cough and productive phlegm are a significant burden for people with bronchiectasis, and the main aim of treatment is to reduce exacerbation frequency and improve quality of life. Prophylactic antibiotic therapy aims to break this infection cycle and is recommended by clinical guidelines for adults with three or more exacerbations a year, based on limited evidence. It is important to weigh the evidence for bacterial suppression against the prevention of antibiotic resistance and further evidence is required on the safety and efficacy of different regimens of intermittently administered antibiotic treatments for people with bronchiectasis. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of intermittent prophylactic antibiotics in the treatment of adults and children with bronchiectasis. SEARCH METHODS: We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, which contains studies identified through multiple electronic searches and handsearches of other sources. We also searched trial registries and reference lists of primary studies. We conducted searches on 6 September 2021, with no restriction on language of publication. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least three months' duration comparing an intermittent regime of prophylactic antibiotics with placebo, usual care or an alternate intermittent regimen. Intermittent prophylactic administration was defined as repeated courses of antibiotics with on-treatment and off-treatment intervals of at least 14 days' duration. We included adults and children with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiectasis confirmed by high resolution computed tomography (HRCT), plain film chest radiograph, or bronchography and a documented history of recurrent chest infections. We excluded studies where participants received high dose antibiotics immediately prior to enrolment or those with a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), primary ciliary dyskinesia, hypogammaglobulinaemia, sarcoidosis, or a primary diagnosis of COPD. Our primary outcomes were exacerbation frequency and serious adverse events. We did not exclude studies on the basis of review outcomes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs) or relative risk (RRs) and continuous data as mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs). We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We conducted GRADE assessments for the following primary outcomes: exacerbation frequency; serious adverse events and secondary outcomes: antibiotic resistance; hospital admissions; health-related quality of life. MAIN RESULTS: We included eight RCTs, with interventions ranging from 16 to 48 weeks, involving 2180 adults. All evaluated one of three types of antibiotics over two to six cycles of 28 days on/off treatment: aminoglycosides, ss-lactams or fluoroquinolones. Two studies also included 12 cycles of 14 days on/off treatment with fluoroquinolones. Participants had a mean age of 63.6 years, 65% were women and approximately 85% Caucasian. Baseline FEV1 ranged from 55.5% to 62.6% predicted. None of the studies included children. Generally, there was a low risk of bias in the included studies. Antibiotic versus placebo: cycle of 14 days on/off. Ciprofloxacin reduced the frequency of exacerbations compared to placebo (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.93; I2 = 65%; 2 studies, 469 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), with eight people (95% CI 6 to 28) needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome. The intervention increased the risk of antibiotic resistance more than twofold (OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.36 to 3.35; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 624 participants; high-certainty evidence). Serious adverse events, lung function (FEV1), health-related quality of life, and adverse effects did not differ between groups. Antibiotic versus placebo: cycle of 28 days on/off. Antibiotics did not reduce overall exacerbation frequency (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.02; I2 = 0%; 8 studies, 1695 participants; high-certainty evidence) but there were fewer severe exacerbations (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.93; I2 = 54%; 3 studies, 624 participants), though this should be interpreted with caution due to low event rates. The risk of antibiotic resistance was more than twofold higher based on a pooled analysis (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.42 to 3.42; I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 685 participants; high-certainty evidence) and consistent with unpooled data from four further studies. Serious adverse events, time to first exacerbation, duration of exacerbation, respiratory-related hospital admissions, lung function, health-related quality of life and adverse effects did not differ between study groups. Antibiotic versus usual care. We did not find any studies that compared intermittent antibiotic regimens with usual care. Cycle of 14 days on/off versus cycle of 28 days on/off. Exacerbation frequency did not differ between the two treatment regimens (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.24; I2 = 71%; 2 studies, 625 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) However, inconsistencies in the results from the two trials in this comparison indicate that the apparent aggregated similarities may not be reliable. There was no evidence of a difference in antibiotic resistance between groups (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.48; I2 = 60%; 2 studies, 624 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Serious adverse events, adverse effects, lung function and health-related quality of life did not differ between the two antibiotic regimens. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Overall, in adults who have frequent chest infections, long-term antibiotics given at 14-day on/off intervals slightly reduces the frequency of those infections and increases antibiotic resistance. Intermittent antibiotic regimens result in little to no difference in serious adverse events. The impact of intermittent antibiotic therapy on children with bronchiectasis is unknown due to an absence of evidence, and further research is needed to establish the potential risks and benefits.",

To better delineate clinical pediatric experience and outcomes with M. abscessus complex, we retrospectively gathered 5-year data on M. abscessus complex infection and outcomes in a large, hospital-based pediatric pulmonary center. Patients were selected from the database of the microbiology department at Miller Children's Hospital in Long Beach, CA. Patients had at least one positive pulmonary isolate for M. abscessus complex from February 2006 to May 2011. Treatment modality data were collected and successful therapy of disease was determined as clearance of M. abscessus complex infection after antibiotics proven by culture negative respiratory isolate within at least 12 months of therapy initiation. Two cystic fibrosis patients with M. abscessus complex were identified, one with failed therapy and the other with stable pulmonary status despite persistent isolation. One primary ciliary dyskinesia patient had successful clearance of M. abscessus complex, however is now growing M. avium intracellulare. A patient with no prior medical history was successfully treated with antimycobacterial therapy. Eleven patients with neuromuscular disorders had tracheal aspirates positive for M. abscessus complex. None were treated due to stable lung status and all but two had spontaneous clearance of the mycobacteria. The two remaining persist with sporadic isolation of M. abscessus complex without clinical significance. We concluded that patients with tracheostomy associated M. abscessus complex infections do not appear to require treatment and often have spontaneous resolution. Cystic fibrosis or primary ciliary dyskinesia patients may have clinical disease warranting treatment, but current antimycobacterial therapy has not proven to be completely successful. As M. abscessus complex gains prevalence, standardized guidelines for diagnosis and therapy are needed in the pediatric population. Multicenter cohort analysis is necessary to achieve such guidelines.",

Patients were selected from the database of the microbiology department at Miller Children's Hospital in Long Beach, CA. Patients had at least one positive pulmonary isolate for M. abscessus complex from February 2006 to May 2011. Treatment modality data were collected and successful therapy of disease was determined as clearance of M. abscessus complex infection after antibiotics proven by culture negative respiratory isolate within at least 12 months of therapy initiation. Two cystic fibrosis patients with M. abscessus complex were identified, one with failed therapy and the other with stable pulmonary status despite persistent isolation. One primary ciliary dyskinesia patient had successful clearance of M. abscessus complex, however is now growing M. avium intracellulare.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chest physiotherapy (CP) is a recommended treatment modality in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). OBJECTIVE: Primary aim was to compare the efficacy and safety of the conventional chest physiotherapy (CCP) and oscillatory positive expiratory pressure therapy (OPEPT). Secondary aims were to compare the exacerbation rate, time until the first exacerbation, patient compliance and comfort between the two CP methods. METHODS: This is a 6 month randomized, controlled crossover trial. Patients >6 years of age with PCD were randomized into two groups, first group was assigned to OPEPT (Acapella ) for 3 months while second group was assigned to CCP. Groups were crossed over to the other modality after a 15-day washout period. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and compliance were monitored by monthly clinic visits. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in FEV1 , FEF25-75 , and PEF values (p = .018, p = .020, and p = .016, respectively) in the OPEPT group and in FVC values (p = .007) in CCP group compared to baseline. However PFT increase at 3rd month was not superior to each other with both physiotherapy methods. Median acute pulmonary exacerbation rate and time period until the first exacerbation were similar in both groups (p = .821, p = .092, respectively). Comfort and effectiveness of OPEPT was higher than CCP according to patients (p = .029 and p = .042, respectively). There were no adverse effects with either therapy. CONCLUSIONS: OPEPT was as effective as CCP in PCD patients. OPEPT was more comfortable and effective than CCP according to patients. OPEPT might be an efficient alternative method for airway cleareance in PCD patients.",

It causes chronic cough, copious production of sputum (often purulent), and recurrent infections, and may cause airway obstruction bearing some similarities with that seen in COPD. It may complicate respiratory conditions such as asthma or COPD. It can be associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia, primary immunodeficiencies, certain systemic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis, and foreign body inhalation. Bronchiectasis can be due to cystic fibrosis but this is excluded from this review. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments in people with non-cystic fibrosis (non-CF) bronchiectasis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to January 2014 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. RESULTS: We found 23 studies that met our inclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: airway clearance techniques, corticosteroids (inhaled), exercise or physical training, hyperosmolar agents (inhaled), mucolytics, prolonged-use antibiotics, and surgery.",

Chronic oto-sino-pulmonary infection is the most common clinical presentation. Patients should be monitored in centres with expertise in PCD. Regular respiratory monitoring consists of lung function tests, adapted to the patient's age, and cough swab or sputum cultures. Chest X-rays are insensitive but the use of high-resolution computed tomography should be considered carefully to avoid excessive radiation. Treatment of the chronic suppuration of the lower airways relies on antibiotics to which the isolated bacteria are sensitive, together with respiratory physiotherapy and exercise to clear excessive bronchial secretions. Bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory agents have no proven benefit and should be prescribed, if at all, on an individual basis. Treatment of the lower airways should always be in conjunction with that of the upper airways. Importantly in PCD, respiratory disease may be controlled with the use of early, adequate and aggressive management.",

Prevalence is estimated with 1:15 000 to 1:30 000 births. We present a newborn infant with respiratory distress caused by PCD. PATIENT: On the first day of life, the male newborn developed dyspnoe and cyanosis, so that CPAP and short term ventilation was necessary. Varying atelectasis impressed on the chest radiographs and the diagnosis of PCD was made by nasal brush biopsies. Causative is a lack of the inner dynein arms of the cilia. The clinical features of newborns with the diagnoses of PCD are listed and compared with the own case. CONCLUSION: PCD is a rare cause of neonatal respiratory distress and should be considered in term infants with unknown and prolonged course even if Situs inversus is lacking.",

                    "abstract": "RATIONALE: The typical symptoms for primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) manifest after birth and in early infancy, however diagnosis is often not confirmed during infancy. There is currently a lack of evidence in PCD regarding the impact of the age of diagnosis on clinical outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether early diagnosis is related to improved long-term outcomes. METHOD: This was a retrospective study of patients diagnosed with PCD between 2000 to 2022. We divided our cohort to three groups according to the age of diagnosis. 1) early diagnosis (<1 year); typical diagnosis (1-7 years) and late diagnosis (8-14 years). We compared various clinical long-term outcomes between the groups. RESULTS: Over the study period, 110 patients were included in the analysis, with 41 patients in the early diagnosis group, 35 in the typical diagnosis group and 34 patients in the late diagnosis group. The presence of unexplained neonatal respiratory distress (NRDS) and organ laterality defect were higher in the early diagnosis group with rates between the early, typical, and late diagnosis groups for NRDS (80% vs 53% vs 61%, p=0.045) and laterality defect (64% vs 50% vs 18%, p<0.001). At the end of the first decade of life, patients in the early diagnosis and the typical age of diagnosis had better forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), compared to the late diagnosis group (93.5% and 93.1% vs 80.2%, P=0.002), respectively, but there was no significant change in the annual rate of decline between the groups once diagnosis was confirmed. Patient diagnosed late had significantly higher rates of pulmonary exacerbations (Pex) compared to typical age (1.95 vs 0.75 Pex/year, p<0.01) Conclusion: Late diagnosis (>8 years) was associated with lower FEV1 throughout childhood, although once diagnosed, the annual rate of decline was not different. These findings demonstrate the negative effect of delayed diagnosis in pediatric PCD.",

Lung disease is a hallmark of PCD, given the essential role of cilia in airway surface defense. Diagnosis of PCD is complicated due to its reliance on complex tests that are not utilized by every clinic and also its phenotypic overlap with several other respiratory diseases. Nonetheless, PCD is increasingly being recognized as more common than once thought. The disease is genetically complex, with several genes reported to be associated with PCD. There is no cure for PCD, but gene therapy remains a promising therapeutic strategy. In this review we provide an overview of the clinical symptoms, diagnosis, genetics, and current treatment regimens for PCD. We also describe PCD model systems and discuss the therapeutic potential of different gene therapeutics for targeting the intended cellular target, the ciliated cells of the airway.",

                    "abstract": "RATIONALE: The typical symptoms for primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) manifest after birth and in early infancy, however diagnosis is often not confirmed during infancy. There is currently a lack of evidence in PCD regarding the impact of the age of diagnosis on clinical outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether early diagnosis is related to improved long-term outcomes. METHOD: This was a retrospective study of patients diagnosed with PCD between 2000 to 2022. We divided our cohort to three groups according to the age of diagnosis. 1) early diagnosis (<1 year); typical diagnosis (1-7 years) and late diagnosis (8-14 years). We compared various clinical long-term outcomes between the groups. RESULTS: Over the study period, 110 patients were included in the analysis, with 41 patients in the early diagnosis group, 35 in the typical diagnosis group and 34 patients in the late diagnosis group. The presence of unexplained neonatal respiratory distress (NRDS) and organ laterality defect were higher in the early diagnosis group with rates between the early, typical, and late diagnosis groups for NRDS (80% vs 53% vs 61%, p=0.045) and laterality defect (64% vs 50% vs 18%, p<0.001). At the end of the first decade of life, patients in the early diagnosis and the typical age of diagnosis had better forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), compared to the late diagnosis group (93.5% and 93.1% vs 80.2%, P=0.002), respectively, but there was no significant change in the annual rate of decline between the groups once diagnosis was confirmed. Patient diagnosed late had significantly higher rates of pulmonary exacerbations (Pex) compared to typical age (1.95 vs 0.75 Pex/year, p<0.01) Conclusion: Late diagnosis (>8 years) was associated with lower FEV1 throughout childhood, although once diagnosed, the annual rate of decline was not different. These findings demonstrate the negative effect of delayed diagnosis in pediatric PCD.",

Compared with patients diagnosed with PCD in childhood or infancy, patients diagnosed with PCD in adulthood had a higher prevalence of chronic wet cough, sinusitis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) isolation and radiological bronchiectasis as well as worse lung function. 25 PCD-related genes were identified in 142 patients, and DNAH5, DNAH11, CCDC39 and CCDC40 were the most frequently detected mutations. More than half of genetic variants were loss-of-function mutations, and the majority of these variants were seen only once. Correlations between PCD phenotype, genotype and ciliary ultrastructure were also evidenced. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic delay and under-recognition of PCD remain a big issue in China, which contributes to progressive lung disease and PA infection indicating worse outcome. Specialist equipment and expertise are urgently required to facilitate the early diagnosis and treatment of PCD. TRIAL REGISTRY: PROSPERO; No.: CRD42021257804; URL: www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/.",

This report details the late diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia in two adults who have had long-standing interactions with medical services but in whom the diagnosis was never considered or even dismissed.

The primary objective was to assess whether lidocaine 2% and naphazoline 0.5% nasal spray alter ciliary beat frequency and pattern in subjects undergoing nasal brushing, aiming to enhance primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) diagnosis. HYPOTHESIS: It was hypothesized that local anesthesia administration would not significantly affect ciliary function in nasal epithelium. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, simple-blind randomized study was conducted between 2020 and 2023. The study employed digital high-speed videomicroscopy to analyze ciliary beat frequency and pattern. PATIENT/SUBJECT SELECTION: A cohort of 38 participants was recruited, consisting of 25 healthy volunteers and 13 referred individuals (including seven diagnosed with PCD). Selection criteria ensured the absence of chronic respiratory diseases, recent respiratory tract infections, or regular use of nasal medications. METHODOLOGY: Participants underwent nasal brushing with administration of lidocaine and naphazoline nasal spray in one nostril and saline in the contralateral nostril. Ciliary beat frequency and pattern were measured using digital high-speed video microscopy. RESULTS: Nasal spray administration did not significantly alter ciliary beat frequency or pattern compared to saline (p = 0.841 and p = 0.125, respectively). Subgroup analysis revealed consistent results across healthy volunteers, referred patients, and PCD patients. CONCLUSION: Local anesthesia with lidocaine and naphazoline spray did not affect ciliary function outcomes. These findings support the safe use of these agents in clinical practice for PCD diagnostic procedures. Further research with larger cohorts is warranted for validation.",

METHODS: A national descriptive study based on a survey questionnaire was conducted. The questionnaire consisted of three different sections: distribution and characteristics of the centres, services provided by respiratory therapists, physiotherapists' perception of the unit. The survey was distributed to all healthcare providers via an online platform, and a descriptive data analysis was performed. RESULTS: The survey had a response rate of 97.5% with twenty-nine responses collected. The centers are heterogeneously distributed: thirteen in the northern regions, eight in the central regions and eight in the southern regions. Of the 29 centers with a physiotherapy unit, 19 had a specialized respiratory therapy unit. Respiratory therapy was provided in different care settings: regular wards (28/29 centers, 97%), outpatient service (29/29 centers, 100%), and intensive or semi-intensive care units (17/29 centers, 59%). The interventions provided by respiratory therapists involved more than just airway clearance (29/29). More specific interventions, such as pulmonary function tests (23/29), functional tests (27/29), educational training (26/29), management of workout exercise programs (25/29) and interventions developed in collaboration with physicians such as non-invasive ventilation (NIV) (23/29) and oxygen titration (21/29) are performed. It is interesting to note that therapists are also involved in various activities, such as telemedicine, physiotherapists' research projects, and supporting alongside physicians, for the prescription at home of medical devices. Perception of the unit was also evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: The involved centers are heterogeneous in terms of distribution and treatments offered. The role of respiratory physiotherapists still seems to be fragmented. This first descriptive analysis of the physiotherapy units and the main differences between centers opens queries on the clinical approaches used for pediatric patients with PCD in terms of respiratory physiotherapy. However,in response to evolving treatment needs, a more specialized and standardized approach to patient care is required.",

Respiratory therapy was provided in different care settings: regular wards (28/29 centers, 97%), outpatient service (29/29 centers, 100%), and intensive or semi-intensive care units (17/29 centers, 59%). The interventions provided by respiratory therapists involved more than just airway clearance (29/29). More specific interventions, such as pulmonary function tests (23/29), functional tests (27/29), educational training (26/29), management of workout exercise programs (25/29) and interventions developed in collaboration with physicians such as non-invasive ventilation (NIV) (23/29) and oxygen titration (21/29) are performed. It is interesting to note that therapists are also involved in various activities, such as telemedicine, physiotherapists' research projects, and supporting alongside physicians, for the prescription at home of medical devices. Perception of the unit was also evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: The involved centers are heterogeneous in terms of distribution and treatments offered. The role of respiratory physiotherapists still seems to be fragmented. This first descriptive analysis of the physiotherapy units and the main differences between centers opens queries on the clinical approaches used for pediatric patients with PCD in terms of respiratory physiotherapy. However,in response to evolving treatment needs, a more specialized and standardized approach to patient care is required.",

Although the genetic tests and new diagnostic algorithms have recently been recommended, clinical signs and electron microscope (EM) findings have historically been the mainstays of diagnosis in Asia. To characterize PCD previously reported in Japan, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: A search using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Japana Centra Revuo Medicina (in Japanese) databases was carried out to identify articles reporting PCD, Kartagener syndrome, or immotile cilia syndrome in Japanese patients and published between 1985 and 2015. RESULTS: After excluding duplication from 334 reports, we extracted 316 patients according to the criteria. Diagnosis was most frequently made in adulthood (148 patients [46.8%] >= 18 years old, 24 patients [7.6%] < 1 year old, 68 patients [21.5%] 1-17 years old and 76 patients [24.1%] lacking information). Of the 230 patients (72.8%) who received EM examination, there were patients with inner dynein arm (IDA) defects (n = 55; 23.9%), outer dynein arm (ODA) defects (14; 6.1%), both ODA and IDA defects (57; 24.8%), other structural abnormalities (25; 10.9%), no abnormalities (4; 1.7%), and no detailed conclusion or description (75; 32.6%). CONCLUSION: Delayed diagnosis of this congenital disease with high frequency of IDA defects and low frequency of ODA defects appear to be historical features of PCD reported in Japan, when EM was a main diagnostic tool.

SETTING: University-affiliated assisted reproductive technologies practice. PATIENT(S): A 40 year-old man presenting with 12 months' primary infertility, complete sperm immotility, severe morphologic defects, and moderate sinopulmonary disease. INTERVENTION(S): Electron microscopy (EM) of sperm, nasal cilial function studies, open testis biopsy, and sperm extraction for intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Outcome of ICSI treatment using immotile testicular sperm. RESULT(S): EM revealed abnormal connecting pieces, shortened midpieces with attenuated mitochondrial sheaths, poorly developed annulus, abnormal outer dense fibers, and axonemes missing the two central mircotubules. Nasal ciliary beat frequency was subnormal and dyssynchronous. Immotile testicular sperm were selected for ICSI based on physical characteristics and fertilized 12 of 18 eggs. A single day-5 blastocyst achieved a normal pregnancy and delivery of a healthy 3,840-g girl at 38 weeks' gestation. CONCLUSION(S): Nonclassic PCD may present with structurally abnormal completely immotile sperm, with seemingly little prospect of fertility, and moderate respiratory dysfunction supporting the presence of an underlying ciliopathy. Despite testicular sperm also being immotile and showing profound structural defects that would seem to preclude fertilization, more morphologically normal sperm are capable of establishing a normal pregnancy.",

Regular respiratory monitoring consists of lung function tests, adapted to the patient's age, and cough swab or sputum cultures. Chest X-rays are insensitive but the use of high-resolution computed tomography should be considered carefully to avoid excessive radiation. Treatment of the chronic suppuration of the lower airways relies on antibiotics to which the isolated bacteria are sensitive, together with respiratory physiotherapy and exercise to clear excessive bronchial secretions. Bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory agents have no proven benefit and should be prescribed, if at all, on an individual basis. Treatment of the lower airways should always be in conjunction with that of the upper airways.

Physiotherapy, in the form of airway clearance techniques and exercise is recommended to patients with PCD to facilitate sputum clearance. As children diagnosed with PCD develop into adults, understanding their experiences of growing up with this long-term condition and undertaking physiotherapy may help to provide insight to clinicians. No previous research has been published which explores the lived experiences of children and young people with PCD. The prevalence of PCD in Bradford in the North of the UK is unusually high, signifying the importance of understanding the experiences of this patient population. This qualitative study used Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis to allow the researcher, as a physiotherapist, to investigate the lived experiences of five paediatric patients with PCD. While patients' experiences are all unique, three themes emerged across the analysis of the interviews: (1) the experiences of day to day life with the symptoms and treatment burden of PCD; (2) participants' awareness of their own symptoms and knowledge of PCD; and (3) the development of mastery skills and devolution of management from the family to the growing child. The results from this study suggested that facilitation of disease acceptance, strategies to increase patient empowerment, the use of patient-centred communication and understanding the contextualisation of patients' experiences may all help to guide clinical practice.",

It causes chronic cough, copious production of sputum (often purulent), and recurrent infections, and may cause airway obstruction bearing some similarities with that seen in COPD. It may complicate respiratory conditions such as asthma or COPD. It can be associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia, primary immunodeficiencies, certain systemic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis, and foreign body inhalation. Bronchiectasis can be due to cystic fibrosis but this is excluded from this review. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments in people with non-cystic fibrosis (non-CF) bronchiectasis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to January 2014 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. RESULTS: We found 23 studies that met our inclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: airway clearance techniques, corticosteroids (inhaled), exercise or physical training, hyperosmolar agents (inhaled), mucolytics, prolonged-use antibiotics, and surgery.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Patients with heterotaxy and complex congenital heart disease underwent cardiac surgery with high mortality and morbidity. Recent studies have revealed an association among heterotaxy, congenital heart disease, and primary ciliary dyskinesia. We undertook a retrospective review of patients undergoing cardiac surgery at Children's National Medical Center between 2004 and 2008 to explore the hypothesis that there is increased mortality and respiratory complications in heterotaxy patients. METHODS: Retrospective review was performed on postsurgical outcomes of 87 patients with heterotaxy and congenital heart disease exhibiting the full spectrum of situs abnormalities associated with heterotaxy. As controls patients, 634 cardiac surgical patients with congenital heart disease, but without laterality defects, were selected, and surgical complexities were similar with a median Risk Adjustment in Congenital Heart Surgery-1 score of 3.0 for both groups. RESULTS: We found the mean length of postoperative hospital stay (17 vs 11 days) and mechanical ventilation (11 vs 4 days) were significantly increased in the heterotaxy patients. Also elevated were rates of tracheostomies (6.9% vs 1.6%; odds ratio, 4.6), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support (12.6% vs 4.9%: odds ratio, 2.8), prolonged ventilatory courses (23% vs 12.3%; odds ratio, 2.1) and postsurgical deaths (16.1% vs 4.7%; odds ratio, 3.9). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show heterotaxy patients had more postsurgical events with increased postsurgical mortality and risk for respiratory complications as compared to control patients with similar Risk Adjustment in Congenital Heart Surgery-1 surgical complexity scores. We speculate that increased respiratory complications maybe due to ciliary dysfunction. Further studies are needed to explore the basis for the increased surgical risks for heterotaxy patients undergoing cardiac surgery.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Currently, there is a lack of data concerning the organization and characteristics of Italian pediatric physiotherapy units for the treatment of patients with chronic lung diseases, especially those with rare conditions such as Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) and non-Cystic Fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB). METHODS: A national descriptive study based on a survey questionnaire was conducted. The questionnaire consisted of three different sections: distribution and characteristics of the centres, services provided by respiratory therapists, physiotherapists' perception of the unit. The survey was distributed to all healthcare providers via an online platform, and a descriptive data analysis was performed. RESULTS: The survey had a response rate of 97.5% with twenty-nine responses collected. The centers are heterogeneously distributed: thirteen in the northern regions, eight in the central regions and eight in the southern regions. Of the 29 centers with a physiotherapy unit, 19 had a specialized respiratory therapy unit. Respiratory therapy was provided in different care settings: regular wards (28/29 centers, 97%), outpatient service (29/29 centers, 100%), and intensive or semi-intensive care units (17/29 centers, 59%). The interventions provided by respiratory therapists involved more than just airway clearance (29/29). More specific interventions, such as pulmonary function tests (23/29), functional tests (27/29), educational training (26/29), management of workout exercise programs (25/29) and interventions developed in collaboration with physicians such as non-invasive ventilation (NIV) (23/29) and oxygen titration (21/29) are performed. It is interesting to note that therapists are also involved in various activities, such as telemedicine, physiotherapists' research projects, and supporting alongside physicians, for the prescription at home of medical devices. Perception of the unit was also evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: The involved centers are heterogeneous in terms of distribution and treatments offered. The role of respiratory physiotherapists still seems to be fragmented. This first descriptive analysis of the physiotherapy units and the main differences between centers opens queries on the clinical approaches used for pediatric patients with PCD in terms of respiratory physiotherapy. However,in response to evolving treatment needs, a more specialized and standardized approach to patient care is required.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Currently, there is a lack of data concerning the organization and characteristics of Italian pediatric physiotherapy units for the treatment of patients with chronic lung diseases, especially those with rare conditions such as Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) and non-Cystic Fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB). METHODS: A national descriptive study based on a survey questionnaire was conducted. The questionnaire consisted of three different sections: distribution and characteristics of the centres, services provided by respiratory therapists, physiotherapists' perception of the unit. The survey was distributed to all healthcare providers via an online platform, and a descriptive data analysis was performed. RESULTS: The survey had a response rate of 97.5% with twenty-nine responses collected. The centers are heterogeneously distributed: thirteen in the northern regions, eight in the central regions and eight in the southern regions. Of the 29 centers with a physiotherapy unit, 19 had a specialized respiratory therapy unit. Respiratory therapy was provided in different care settings: regular wards (28/29 centers, 97%), outpatient service (29/29 centers, 100%), and intensive or semi-intensive care units (17/29 centers, 59%). The interventions provided by respiratory therapists involved more than just airway clearance (29/29). More specific interventions, such as pulmonary function tests (23/29), functional tests (27/29), educational training (26/29), management of workout exercise programs (25/29) and interventions developed in collaboration with physicians such as non-invasive ventilation (NIV) (23/29) and oxygen titration (21/29) are performed. It is interesting to note that therapists are also involved in various activities, such as telemedicine, physiotherapists' research projects, and supporting alongside physicians, for the prescription at home of medical devices. Perception of the unit was also evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: The involved centers are heterogeneous in terms of distribution and treatments offered. The role of respiratory physiotherapists still seems to be fragmented. This first descriptive analysis of the physiotherapy units and the main differences between centers opens queries on the clinical approaches used for pediatric patients with PCD in terms of respiratory physiotherapy. However,in response to evolving treatment needs, a more specialized and standardized approach to patient care is required.",

However, data about Chinese patients are limited. We aimed to summarize the clinical and genetic spectrum of Chinese PCD patients based on all available literatures. METHODS: We searched Embase, Pubmed, Web of Science and Chinese databases including CNKI, SinoMed and Wanfang from 1981 to 2021, to identify articles reporting patients with PCD in China, which had included information about transmission electron microscopy and/or genetic testing. RESULTS: A total of 244 Chinese PCD patients in 52 articles were included. Of these patients, the mean age was 13.1 years, and 55 patients (22.5%) were diagnosed with PCD after 18 years old. Compared with patients diagnosed with PCD in childhood or infancy, patients diagnosed with PCD in adulthood had a higher prevalence of chronic wet cough, sinusitis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) isolation and radiological bronchiectasis as well as worse lung function. 25 PCD-related genes were identified in 142 patients, and DNAH5, DNAH11, CCDC39 and CCDC40 were the most frequently detected mutations. More than half of genetic variants were loss-of-function mutations, and the majority of these variants were seen only once. Correlations between PCD phenotype, genotype and ciliary ultrastructure were also evidenced. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic delay and under-recognition of PCD remain a big issue in China, which contributes to progressive lung disease and PA infection indicating worse outcome. Specialist equipment and expertise are urgently required to facilitate the early diagnosis and treatment of PCD. TRIAL REGISTRY: PROSPERO; No.: CRD42021257804; URL: www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/.",

METHODS: A search using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Japana Centra Revuo Medicina (in Japanese) databases was carried out to identify articles reporting PCD, Kartagener syndrome, or immotile cilia syndrome in Japanese patients and published between 1985 and 2015. RESULTS: After excluding duplication from 334 reports, we extracted 316 patients according to the criteria. Diagnosis was most frequently made in adulthood (148 patients [46.8%] >= 18 years old, 24 patients [7.6%] < 1 year old, 68 patients [21.5%] 1-17 years old and 76 patients [24.1%] lacking information). Of the 230 patients (72.8%) who received EM examination, there were patients with inner dynein arm (IDA) defects (n = 55; 23.9%), outer dynein arm (ODA) defects (14; 6.1%), both ODA and IDA defects (57; 24.8%), other structural abnormalities (25; 10.9%), no abnormalities (4; 1.7%), and no detailed conclusion or description (75; 32.6%). CONCLUSION: Delayed diagnosis of this congenital disease with high frequency of IDA defects and low frequency of ODA defects appear to be historical features of PCD reported in Japan, when EM was a main diagnostic tool. This review highlights problems experienced in this field, and provides basic information to establish a modernized PCD diagnosis and management system in the future.",

Our primary aim was to compare the efficacy and safety of postural drainage, percussion and vibration [conventional PR (CPR)], and high frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) by studying change in pulmonary function. Our secondary aim was to evaluate patient preferences regarding the two methods. METHODS: This was a controlled randomized crossover study. PCD patients between the ages of 7 and 18 years were assigned to two groups, first group performed airway clearance with CPR at hospital for 5 days and after a 2-day washout period HFCWO was applied to the same group at home. HFCWO was applied first to the other group and then these patients were hospitalized for CPR. The primary outcome measure of the study was pulmonary function test (PFT). The secondary outcomes were pulse arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2 ) and the perceived efficiency and comfort level. RESULTS: PFT values of patients increased significantly after both PR methods (before/after): CPR: FVC: 77.0 +- 14.1/81.8 +- 13.0 (P = 0.002); FEV1 : 72.9 +- 14.8/78.7 +- 13.5 (P = 0.001); PEF: 73.8 +- 14.5/82.5 +- 14.5 (P = 0.001); FEF25-75 : 68.6 +- 27.6/74.9 +- 29.3 (P = 0.007). HFCWO FVC: 75.1 +- 15.3/80.3 +- 13.9 (P = 0.002); FEV1 : 71.4 +- 16/77.4 +- 14.6 (P = 0.001); PEF: 70.9 +- 18.0/78.3 +- 17.7 (P = 0.002); FEF25-75 : 70.5 +- 23.4/76.4 +- 25.6 (P = 0.006). There were no significant differences in % predicted FVC, FEV1 , PEF, and FEF25-75 increased values with CPR and HFCWO. HFCWO was found more comfortable (P = 0.04). Two PR methods were found efficient and no desaturation occurred during PR. CONCLUSIONS: PFTs were significantly increased after both PR methods. There were no differences in PFTs and SpO2 between the CPR and HFCWO groups. Both PR methods were found efficient. HFCWO was found more comfortable. HFCWO may be an option in patients with chronic pulmonary disease and low adherence to PR.",

It causes chronic cough, copious production of sputum (often purulent), and recurrent infections, and may cause airway obstruction bearing some similarities with that seen in COPD. It may complicate respiratory conditions such as asthma or COPD. It can be associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia, primary immunodeficiencies, certain systemic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis, and foreign body inhalation. Bronchiectasis can be due to cystic fibrosis but this is excluded from this review. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments in people with non-cystic fibrosis (non-CF) bronchiectasis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to January 2014 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. RESULTS: We found 23 studies that met our inclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: airway clearance techniques, corticosteroids (inhaled), exercise or physical training, hyperosmolar agents (inhaled), mucolytics, prolonged-use antibiotics, and surgery.",

                    "abstract": "TRIAL DESIGN: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetical disease that inherited in an autosomal-recessive way. Its clinical manifestations (such as male infertility) are mainly caused by defects of motion-related cilia that encoded by mutated genes. Although some mutation has been verified, a number of mutations of PCD remain elusive. The main purpose of this study is to identify mutant genes in a Chinese family with PCD, and to verify the safety and effectiveness of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) of infertility caused by PCD. METHODS: Imaging examination was used to exclude pulmonary inflammation and visceral translocation. Semen analysis was used to assess the quality of the proband's sperm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was conducted to assess the ultrastructure of flagella and cilia. Targeted next generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing and qPCR (real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction detecting system) were applied to identified mutation of Chinese Family suspected of having PCD. Viable sperm were selected by hypo-osmotic swelling test (HOST) for ICSI. RESULTS: We report 2 novel mutations in CCDC40 gene (c.1259delA and EX17_20 deletion) resulted in immobility of sperm and infertility of the proband. These mutations were confirmed in the proband's sister (heterozygous) and his parents (recessive carrier) by Sanger sequencing and qPCR. All the spermatozoa from the proband were immotile. Ultrastructural defects were found in flagella and cilia of proband and his sister. Viable sperms were selected by HOST for ICSI and fertilized 9 of 21 eggs. Two frozen embryos were transplanted and a healthy 3500 g boy was delivered at 40 + 4 weeks' gestation. And then, we summarized the genes related to PCD and the mutant sites of CCDC40 gene. CONCLUSION: We reported 2 novel mutants in CCDC40 gene (c.1259delA and EX17_20 deletion), which could be candidates for genetic diagnosis in PCD patients. The combination of targeted next generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing may be a useful tool to diagnose PCD. ICSI is a considerable method in treatment of infertility caused by PCD.",

The main purpose of this study is to identify mutant genes in a Chinese family with PCD, and to verify the safety and effectiveness of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) of infertility caused by PCD. METHODS: Imaging examination was used to exclude pulmonary inflammation and visceral translocation. Semen analysis was used to assess the quality of the proband's sperm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was conducted to assess the ultrastructure of flagella and cilia. Targeted next generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing and qPCR (real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction detecting system) were applied to identified mutation of Chinese Family suspected of having PCD. Viable sperm were selected by hypo-osmotic swelling test (HOST) for ICSI. RESULTS: We report 2 novel mutations in CCDC40 gene (c.1259delA and EX17_20 deletion) resulted in immobility of sperm and infertility of the proband. These mutations were confirmed in the proband's sister (heterozygous) and his parents (recessive carrier) by Sanger sequencing and qPCR. All the spermatozoa from the proband were immotile. Ultrastructural defects were found in flagella and cilia of proband and his sister. Viable sperms were selected by HOST for ICSI and fertilized 9 of 21 eggs. Two frozen embryos were transplanted and a healthy 3500 g boy was delivered at 40 + 4 weeks' gestation. And then, we summarized the genes related to PCD and the mutant sites of CCDC40 gene. CONCLUSION: We reported 2 novel mutants in CCDC40 gene (c.1259delA and EX17_20 deletion), which could be candidates for genetic diagnosis in PCD patients. The combination of targeted next generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing may be a useful tool to diagnose PCD. ICSI is a considerable method in treatment of infertility caused by PCD.",

                    "abstract": "RESEARCH QUESTION: Male infertility is a widespread symptom in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). PCD-related male infertility is often caused by asthenozoospermia, with barely normal sperm morphology. Multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF) are a major cause of asthenozoospermia, characterized by various malformed morphologies of sperm flagella. To date, a limited number of genes have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of both PCD and MMAF. What other genes associated with both PCD and MMAF are waiting to be discovered? DESIGN: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed to identify the pathogenic mutation associated with MMAF in a PCD patient. Peripheral venous blood and semen samples were collected from the PCD patient. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), immunofluorescence staining and western blotting were conducted to confirm the pathogenicity of the identified mutation. RESULTS: A novel homozygous mutation in CCDC39, c.983 T>C (p. Leu328Pro), was identified in two PCD-affected siblings of a consanguineous family showing a typical PCD phenotype, while the proband was infertile, which is associated with characterized MMAF. Furthermore, TEM revealed the abnormal ultrastructure of the patient's sperm flagella. Moreover, immunofluorescence staining revealed that CCDC39 was almost undetectable in the spermatozoa, which was further confirmed by western blotting. The outcome of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in the patient with the CCDC39 mutation was also favourable. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that a novel loss-of-function mutation of CCDC39 is involved in the pathogenesis of PCD and MMAF and initially reported that ICSI treatment has a good outcome. Therefore, the novel variant of CCDC39 contributes to the genetic diagnosis, counselling and treatment of male infertility in PCD patients with MMAF phenotype.",

Infertility is a common condition in women presenting with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) characterized by hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. The purpose of this study was to explore the clinical significance of genetic diagnostics in several Chinese primary infertile women with atypical POI. Methods: Four atypical POI patients and 100 healthy subjects were recruited, genetic pathogenicityc factors were investigated by whole exome sequencing (WES). Results: WES revealed a homozygous deletion mutation in the DNAH1 gene (NM_015512.5; c.11726_11727delCT, p.Pro3909Argfs*33) in one of the four POI patients. The 31-year-old affected woman presented with a normal menstrual cycle and elevated plasma levels of FSH, around the postmenopausal range, but had a normal antral follicle count and normal anti-Mullerian hormone levels. The patient, after two failed ovulation cycles, became pregnant in the third IVF cycle and delivered a healthy girl at term. Conclusions: The homozygous deletion mutation in the DNAH1 gene suggested that the patient might have a cilia movement disorder of the fallopian tubes, which is a known infertility factor. Moreover, the significantly elevated plasma level of FSH in this patient is likely one of the most important factors leading to her decreased fertility.",

METHODS: Data from 20 patients with PCD and 20 matched, healthy counterparts recorded between July 2015 and January 2017 were analyzed. The data evaluated and recorded included pulmonary function using a portable spirometer, respiratory muscle strength (using a mouth pressure device, exercise capacity using the incremental shuttle walk test,), physical fitness (using the Munich Fitness Test), and ADLs (using the Glittre ADL test). RESULTS: Pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength, incremental shuttle walk test scores (all parameters), and total Munich Fitness Test scores were lower in the PCD group relative to controls (P < 0.05). The duration to complete the Glittre ADL test was higher in PCD patients than in healthy subjects (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength, exercise capacity, physical fitness, and ADL were affected by PCD. Thus, pulmonary rehabilitation regimens should be tailored according to these impacts.",

Increased cough transportability may improve quality of life (QoL) in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD).In this randomised controlled trial (RCT), PCD patients received twice-daily inhalations of hypertonic (7%) saline or isotonic (0.9%) saline for 12 weeks, with 4 weeks washout during crossover. Primary outcome was change in QoL measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score. Secondary outcomes were SGRQ subscores, Quality of Life Questionnaire-Bronchiectasis (QoL-B) scores, lower respiratory tract infection symptoms, exacerbations, spirometry, systemic and sputum inflammatory markers, adherence, and adverse events.There was no significant change in median (interquartile range) SGRQ total score between hypertonic saline (-2.6 (-9.0-1.5)) and isotonic saline (-0.3 (-8.1-6.1)) in 22 patients (age range 22-73 years) (p=0.38). QoL-B Health Perception scale improved with hypertonic saline (p=0.03). Adverse events occurred more frequently with hypertonic saline, but were mild.12 weeks of inhaled hypertonic saline did not improve SGRQ total score in adult PCD patients in this RCT, but the sample size was small. On the secondary and more disease-specific end-point of the QoL-B, a significant improvement was observed in the Health Perception scale. This study found little evidence to support the hypothesis that hypertonic saline improves QoL in PCD patients. We advise the use of disease-specific outcome measures in future trials.",

                    "abstract": "RATIONALE: Treatment of pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacteria, especially Mycobacterium abscessus, requires prolonged, multidrug regimens with high toxicity and suboptimal efficacy. Options for refractory disease are limited. OBJECTIVES: We reviewed the efficacy and toxicity of inhaled amikacin in patients with treatment-refractory nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease. METHODS: Records were queried to identify patients who had inhaled amikacin added to failing regimens. Lower airway microbiology, symptoms, and computed tomography scan changes were assessed together with reported toxicity. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The majority (80%) of the 20 patients who met entry criteria were women; all had bronchiectasis, two had cystic fibrosis and one had primary ciliary dyskinesia. At initiation of inhaled amikacin, 15 were culture positive for M. abscessus and 5 for Mycobacterium avium complex and had received a median (range) of 60 (6, 190) months of mycobacterial treatment. Patients were followed for a median of 19 (1, 50) months. Eight (40%) patients had at least one negative culture and 5 (25%) had persistently negative cultures. A decrease in smear quantity was noted in 9 of 20 (45%) and in mycobacterial culture growth for 10 of 19 (53%). Symptom scores improved in nine (45%), were unchanged in seven (35%), and worsened in four (20%). Improvement on computed tomography scans was noted in 6 (30%), unchanged in 3 (15%), and worsened in 11 (55%). Seven (35%) stopped amikacin due to: ototoxicity in two (10%), hemoptysis in two (10%), and nephrotoxicity, persistent dysphonia, and vertigo in one each. CONCLUSIONS: In some patients with treatment-refractory pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial disease, the addition of inhaled amikacin was associated with microbiologic and/or symptomatic improvement; however, toxicity was common. Prospective evaluation of inhaled amikacin for mycobacterial disease is warranted.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Bronchiectasis is usually a complication of previous lower respiratory infection and/or inflammation. It causes chronic cough, copious production of sputum (often purulent), and recurrent infections, and may cause airway obstruction bearing some similarities with that seen in COPD. It may complicate respiratory conditions such as asthma or COPD. It can be associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia, primary immunodeficiencies, certain systemic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis, and foreign body inhalation. Bronchiectasis can be due to cystic fibrosis but this is excluded from this review. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments in people with non-cystic fibrosis (non-CF) bronchiectasis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to January 2014 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. RESULTS: We found 23 studies that met our inclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: airway clearance techniques, corticosteroids (inhaled), exercise or physical training, hyperosmolar agents (inhaled), mucolytics, prolonged-use antibiotics, and surgery.",

Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) is a part of pulmonary rehabilitation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There is some evidence of its efficacy in cystic fibrosis (CF) and, recently, in long COVID-19. We are not aware of studies on IMT in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Our aim was to assess the effect of IMT on respiratory muscle strength and pulmonary function in PCD and CF patients. METHODS: A single center pilot study. Spirometry, lung clearance index (LCI), maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) were measured at baseline (visit 1), after a month of IMT with  POWERbreathe (visit 2), and at follow-up (visit 3). RESULTS: The cohort included 27 patients (19 PCD, 8 CF); mean age 18.4 +- 9.8 years. After a month of IMT, there was a significant increase in MIP and MIP% (6.19-7.44, p = .015; and 81.85%-100.41%, p = .046, respectively), which was sustained at visit 3. Compliance >=90% led to higher improvement in MIP. In sub-group analysis, improvement in MIP and MIP% remained significant for PCD patients (p = .026 and p = .049, respectively). No significant changes were found in spirometry, MEP or LCI. CONCLUSIONS: IMT was well-tolerated and led to improved inspiratory muscle strength in PCD patients. The clinical implication of improved MIP should be further investigated. Larger, long-term studies are needed to evaluate long-term effects of IMT on pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength, pulmonary exacerbations, and quality of life.",

Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) is a part of pulmonary rehabilitation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There is some evidence of its efficacy in cystic fibrosis (CF) and, recently, in long COVID-19. We are not aware of studies on IMT in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Our aim was to assess the effect of IMT on respiratory muscle strength and pulmonary function in PCD and CF patients. METHODS: A single center pilot study. Spirometry, lung clearance index (LCI), maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) were measured at baseline (visit 1), after a month of IMT with  POWERbreathe (visit 2), and at follow-up (visit 3). RESULTS: The cohort included 27 patients (19 PCD, 8 CF); mean age 18.4 +- 9.8 years. After a month of IMT, there was a significant increase in MIP and MIP% (6.19-7.44, p = .015; and 81.85%-100.41%, p = .046, respectively), which was sustained at visit 3.

                    "title": "Intermittent prophylactic antibiotics for bronchiectasis.",
                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bronchiectasis is a common but under-diagnosed chronic disorder characterised by permanent dilation of the airways arising from a cycle of recurrent infection and inflammation. Symptoms including chronic, persistent cough and productive phlegm are a significant burden for people with bronchiectasis, and the main aim of treatment is to reduce exacerbation frequency and improve quality of life. Prophylactic antibiotic therapy aims to break this infection cycle and is recommended by clinical guidelines for adults with three or more exacerbations a year, based on limited evidence. It is important to weigh the evidence for bacterial suppression against the prevention of antibiotic resistance and further evidence is required on the safety and efficacy of different regimens of intermittently administered antibiotic treatments for people with bronchiectasis. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of intermittent prophylactic antibiotics in the treatment of adults and children with bronchiectasis. SEARCH METHODS: We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, which contains studies identified through multiple electronic searches and handsearches of other sources. We also searched trial registries and reference lists of primary studies. We conducted searches on 6 September 2021, with no restriction on language of publication. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least three months' duration comparing an intermittent regime of prophylactic antibiotics with placebo, usual care or an alternate intermittent regimen. Intermittent prophylactic administration was defined as repeated courses of antibiotics with on-treatment and off-treatment intervals of at least 14 days' duration. We included adults and children with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiectasis confirmed by high resolution computed tomography (HRCT), plain film chest radiograph, or bronchography and a documented history of recurrent chest infections. We excluded studies where participants received high dose antibiotics immediately prior to enrolment or those with a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), primary ciliary dyskinesia, hypogammaglobulinaemia, sarcoidosis, or a primary diagnosis of COPD. Our primary outcomes were exacerbation frequency and serious adverse events. We did not exclude studies on the basis of review outcomes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs) or relative risk (RRs) and continuous data as mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs). We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We conducted GRADE assessments for the following primary outcomes: exacerbation frequency; serious adverse events and secondary outcomes: antibiotic resistance; hospital admissions; health-related quality of life. MAIN RESULTS: We included eight RCTs, with interventions ranging from 16 to 48 weeks, involving 2180 adults. All evaluated one of three types of antibiotics over two to six cycles of 28 days on/off treatment: aminoglycosides, ss-lactams or fluoroquinolones. Two studies also included 12 cycles of 14 days on/off treatment with fluoroquinolones. Participants had a mean age of 63.6 years, 65% were women and approximately 85% Caucasian. Baseline FEV1 ranged from 55.5% to 62.6% predicted. None of the studies included children. Generally, there was a low risk of bias in the included studies. Antibiotic versus placebo: cycle of 14 days on/off. Ciprofloxacin reduced the frequency of exacerbations compared to placebo (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.93; I2 = 65%; 2 studies, 469 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), with eight people (95% CI 6 to 28) needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome. The intervention increased the risk of antibiotic resistance more than twofold (OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.36 to 3.35; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 624 participants; high-certainty evidence). Serious adverse events, lung function (FEV1), health-related quality of life, and adverse effects did not differ between groups. Antibiotic versus placebo: cycle of 28 days on/off. Antibiotics did not reduce overall exacerbation frequency (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.02; I2 = 0%; 8 studies, 1695 participants; high-certainty evidence) but there were fewer severe exacerbations (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.93; I2 = 54%; 3 studies, 624 participants), though this should be interpreted with caution due to low event rates. The risk of antibiotic resistance was more than twofold higher based on a pooled analysis (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.42 to 3.42; I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 685 participants; high-certainty evidence) and consistent with unpooled data from four further studies. Serious adverse events, time to first exacerbation, duration of exacerbation, respiratory-related hospital admissions, lung function, health-related quality of life and adverse effects did not differ between study groups. Antibiotic versus usual care. We did not find any studies that compared intermittent antibiotic regimens with usual care. Cycle of 14 days on/off versus cycle of 28 days on/off. Exacerbation frequency did not differ between the two treatment regimens (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.24; I2 = 71%; 2 studies, 625 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) However, inconsistencies in the results from the two trials in this comparison indicate that the apparent aggregated similarities may not be reliable. There was no evidence of a difference in antibiotic resistance between groups (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.48; I2 = 60%; 2 studies, 624 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Serious adverse events, adverse effects, lung function and health-related quality of life did not differ between the two antibiotic regimens. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Overall, in adults who have frequent chest infections, long-term antibiotics given at 14-day on/off intervals slightly reduces the frequency of those infections and increases antibiotic resistance. Intermittent antibiotic regimens result in little to no difference in serious adverse events. The impact of intermittent antibiotic therapy on children with bronchiectasis is unknown due to an absence of evidence, and further research is needed to establish the potential risks and benefits.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bronchiectasis is a common but under-diagnosed chronic disorder characterised by permanent dilation of the airways arising from a cycle of recurrent infection and inflammation. Symptoms including chronic, persistent cough and productive phlegm are a significant burden for people with bronchiectasis, and the main aim of treatment is to reduce exacerbation frequency and improve quality of life. Prophylactic antibiotic therapy aims to break this infection cycle and is recommended by clinical guidelines for adults with three or more exacerbations a year, based on limited evidence. It is important to weigh the evidence for bacterial suppression against the prevention of antibiotic resistance and further evidence is required on the safety and efficacy of different regimens of intermittently administered antibiotic treatments for people with bronchiectasis. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of intermittent prophylactic antibiotics in the treatment of adults and children with bronchiectasis. SEARCH METHODS: We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, which contains studies identified through multiple electronic searches and handsearches of other sources. We also searched trial registries and reference lists of primary studies. We conducted searches on 6 September 2021, with no restriction on language of publication. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least three months' duration comparing an intermittent regime of prophylactic antibiotics with placebo, usual care or an alternate intermittent regimen. Intermittent prophylactic administration was defined as repeated courses of antibiotics with on-treatment and off-treatment intervals of at least 14 days' duration. We included adults and children with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiectasis confirmed by high resolution computed tomography (HRCT), plain film chest radiograph, or bronchography and a documented history of recurrent chest infections. We excluded studies where participants received high dose antibiotics immediately prior to enrolment or those with a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), primary ciliary dyskinesia, hypogammaglobulinaemia, sarcoidosis, or a primary diagnosis of COPD. Our primary outcomes were exacerbation frequency and serious adverse events. We did not exclude studies on the basis of review outcomes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs) or relative risk (RRs) and continuous data as mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs). We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We conducted GRADE assessments for the following primary outcomes: exacerbation frequency; serious adverse events and secondary outcomes: antibiotic resistance; hospital admissions; health-related quality of life. MAIN RESULTS: We included eight RCTs, with interventions ranging from 16 to 48 weeks, involving 2180 adults. All evaluated one of three types of antibiotics over two to six cycles of 28 days on/off treatment: aminoglycosides, ss-lactams or fluoroquinolones. Two studies also included 12 cycles of 14 days on/off treatment with fluoroquinolones. Participants had a mean age of 63.6 years, 65% were women and approximately 85% Caucasian. Baseline FEV1 ranged from 55.5% to 62.6% predicted. None of the studies included children. Generally, there was a low risk of bias in the included studies. Antibiotic versus placebo: cycle of 14 days on/off. Ciprofloxacin reduced the frequency of exacerbations compared to placebo (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.93; I2 = 65%; 2 studies, 469 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), with eight people (95% CI 6 to 28) needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome. The intervention increased the risk of antibiotic resistance more than twofold (OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.36 to 3.35; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 624 participants; high-certainty evidence). Serious adverse events, lung function (FEV1), health-related quality of life, and adverse effects did not differ between groups. Antibiotic versus placebo: cycle of 28 days on/off. Antibiotics did not reduce overall exacerbation frequency (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.02; I2 = 0%; 8 studies, 1695 participants; high-certainty evidence) but there were fewer severe exacerbations (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.93; I2 = 54%; 3 studies, 624 participants), though this should be interpreted with caution due to low event rates. The risk of antibiotic resistance was more than twofold higher based on a pooled analysis (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.42 to 3.42; I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 685 participants; high-certainty evidence) and consistent with unpooled data from four further studies. Serious adverse events, time to first exacerbation, duration of exacerbation, respiratory-related hospital admissions, lung function, health-related quality of life and adverse effects did not differ between study groups. Antibiotic versus usual care. We did not find any studies that compared intermittent antibiotic regimens with usual care. Cycle of 14 days on/off versus cycle of 28 days on/off. Exacerbation frequency did not differ between the two treatment regimens (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.24; I2 = 71%; 2 studies, 625 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) However, inconsistencies in the results from the two trials in this comparison indicate that the apparent aggregated similarities may not be reliable. There was no evidence of a difference in antibiotic resistance between groups (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.48; I2 = 60%; 2 studies, 624 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Serious adverse events, adverse effects, lung function and health-related quality of life did not differ between the two antibiotic regimens. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Overall, in adults who have frequent chest infections, long-term antibiotics given at 14-day on/off intervals slightly reduces the frequency of those infections and increases antibiotic resistance. Intermittent antibiotic regimens result in little to no difference in serious adverse events. The impact of intermittent antibiotic therapy on children with bronchiectasis is unknown due to an absence of evidence, and further research is needed to establish the potential risks and benefits.",

METHODS: High-throughput sequencing and bioinformatic analysis were carried out to identify pathogenic variant in the patient. Suspected variant was verified by Sanger sequencing among the family members, and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) was used to achieve the pregnancy. RESULTS: The patient had obstructive azoospermia, measurement of nasal NO exhalation at 84 ppb, and typical symptoms of PCD in nasal sinuses and lungs. DNA sequencing showed that he had carried biallelic variants of the DNAH5 gene, namely c.1489C>T (p.Q497X) in exon 11 and c.6304C>T (p.R2102C) in exon 38. His wife achieved clinical pregnancy with the assistance of ICSI.

                    "abstract": "TRIAL DESIGN: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetical disease that inherited in an autosomal-recessive way. Its clinical manifestations (such as male infertility) are mainly caused by defects of motion-related cilia that encoded by mutated genes. Although some mutation has been verified, a number of mutations of PCD remain elusive. The main purpose of this study is to identify mutant genes in a Chinese family with PCD, and to verify the safety and effectiveness of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) of infertility caused by PCD. METHODS: Imaging examination was used to exclude pulmonary inflammation and visceral translocation. Semen analysis was used to assess the quality of the proband's sperm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was conducted to assess the ultrastructure of flagella and cilia. Targeted next generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing and qPCR (real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction detecting system) were applied to identified mutation of Chinese Family suspected of having PCD. Viable sperm were selected by hypo-osmotic swelling test (HOST) for ICSI. RESULTS: We report 2 novel mutations in CCDC40 gene (c.1259delA and EX17_20 deletion) resulted in immobility of sperm and infertility of the proband. These mutations were confirmed in the proband's sister (heterozygous) and his parents (recessive carrier) by Sanger sequencing and qPCR. All the spermatozoa from the proband were immotile. Ultrastructural defects were found in flagella and cilia of proband and his sister. Viable sperms were selected by HOST for ICSI and fertilized 9 of 21 eggs. Two frozen embryos were transplanted and a healthy 3500 g boy was delivered at 40 + 4 weeks' gestation. And then, we summarized the genes related to PCD and the mutant sites of CCDC40 gene. CONCLUSION: We reported 2 novel mutants in CCDC40 gene (c.1259delA and EX17_20 deletion), which could be candidates for genetic diagnosis in PCD patients. The combination of targeted next generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing may be a useful tool to diagnose PCD. ICSI is a considerable method in treatment of infertility caused by PCD.",

SETTING: University-affiliated assisted reproductive technologies practice. PATIENT(S): A 40 year-old man presenting with 12 months' primary infertility, complete sperm immotility, severe morphologic defects, and moderate sinopulmonary disease. INTERVENTION(S): Electron microscopy (EM) of sperm, nasal cilial function studies, open testis biopsy, and sperm extraction for intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Outcome of ICSI treatment using immotile testicular sperm. RESULT(S): EM revealed abnormal connecting pieces, shortened midpieces with attenuated mitochondrial sheaths, poorly developed annulus, abnormal outer dense fibers, and axonemes missing the two central mircotubules. Nasal ciliary beat frequency was subnormal and dyssynchronous. Immotile testicular sperm were selected for ICSI based on physical characteristics and fertilized 12 of 18 eggs. A single day-5 blastocyst achieved a normal pregnancy and delivery of a healthy 3,840-g girl at 38 weeks' gestation. CONCLUSION(S): Nonclassic PCD may present with structurally abnormal completely immotile sperm, with seemingly little prospect of fertility, and moderate respiratory dysfunction supporting the presence of an underlying ciliopathy. Despite testicular sperm also being immotile and showing profound structural defects that would seem to preclude fertilization, more morphologically normal sperm are capable of establishing a normal pregnancy.",

                    "abstract": "RESEARCH QUESTION: Male infertility is a widespread symptom in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). PCD-related male infertility is often caused by asthenozoospermia, with barely normal sperm morphology. Multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF) are a major cause of asthenozoospermia, characterized by various malformed morphologies of sperm flagella. To date, a limited number of genes have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of both PCD and MMAF. What other genes associated with both PCD and MMAF are waiting to be discovered? DESIGN: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed to identify the pathogenic mutation associated with MMAF in a PCD patient. Peripheral venous blood and semen samples were collected from the PCD patient. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), immunofluorescence staining and western blotting were conducted to confirm the pathogenicity of the identified mutation. RESULTS: A novel homozygous mutation in CCDC39, c.983 T>C (p. Leu328Pro), was identified in two PCD-affected siblings of a consanguineous family showing a typical PCD phenotype, while the proband was infertile, which is associated with characterized MMAF. Furthermore, TEM revealed the abnormal ultrastructure of the patient's sperm flagella. Moreover, immunofluorescence staining revealed that CCDC39 was almost undetectable in the spermatozoa, which was further confirmed by western blotting. The outcome of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in the patient with the CCDC39 mutation was also favourable. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that a novel loss-of-function mutation of CCDC39 is involved in the pathogenesis of PCD and MMAF and initially reported that ICSI treatment has a good outcome. Therefore, the novel variant of CCDC39 contributes to the genetic diagnosis, counselling and treatment of male infertility in PCD patients with MMAF phenotype.",

Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) may be primary or secondary in nature and it may be life threatening in the acute phase due to the risk of perforation. A case of recurrent gastrointestinal hemorrhage in a child with systemic neurofibromatosis and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is presented. The upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed the presence of multiple gastric ulcers. The ulcers scarred after the long-term administration of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), but recurred after the suspension. Laboratory and imaging studies excluded Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and other known causes of PUD, suggesting a potential role of neurofibromatosis itself and primary ciliary dyskinesia in developing of recurrent PUD. As early diagnosis of PUD is vital for patient survival, this case report highlights the possible association of neurofibromatosis and PCD with this condition, responsive to PPI therapy and the potential need of gastric protection before complications arise.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite the manifestations of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) in early life, the diagnosis is often much delayed. Since 1998 in Cyprus, we have established the only national diagnostic and clinical referral center for PCD. OBJECTIVE: To review the phenotypic features at presentation of PCD patients in Cyprus in relation to age at diagnosis, with emphasis on previously lobectomised patients. METHODS: The medical records of the diagnosed PCD patients were retrospectively reviewed to obtain clinical data on presentation. RESULTS: Thirty patients, aged 13.9 years (range 0.1, 58.4 years), were diagnosed with PCD. Twelve of them presented after the age of 18. The most common manifestations were chronic cough (100%), chronic rhinorrhea (96.7%), sputum production (92.9%), laterality defects (63.3%), a history of pneumonia (53.3%) and neonatal respiratory distress (50%). A history of lobectomy in the past was recorded in 16.7% (5 patients). Patients who presented in adulthood had significantly higher frequency of lobectomy (41.7% vs 0%, p-value = 0.006) and had more frequently low FEV1 (58.3% vs 0%, p-value = 0.015) than those who presented before. Serial measurements of FEV1 and FVC indicated significantly lower intercepts in lobectomised compared to the adult non-lobectomised patients both in terms of FEV1 (-4.90 vs -1.80, p-value = 0.022) and FVC (-5.43 vs -1.91, p-value = 0.029) z-score levels. Change in FEV1 and FVC across time was not statistically significant in either group. CONCLUSIONS: PCD often remains undiagnosed up to adulthood accompanied by appearance of advanced lung disease. Performance of lobectomies seems to be a poor prognostic factor for PCD in adulthood.",

The primary objective was to assess whether lidocaine 2% and naphazoline 0.5% nasal spray alter ciliary beat frequency and pattern in subjects undergoing nasal brushing, aiming to enhance primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) diagnosis. HYPOTHESIS: It was hypothesized that local anesthesia administration would not significantly affect ciliary function in nasal epithelium. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, simple-blind randomized study was conducted between 2020 and 2023. The study employed digital high-speed videomicroscopy to analyze ciliary beat frequency and pattern. PATIENT/SUBJECT SELECTION: A cohort of 38 participants was recruited, consisting of 25 healthy volunteers and 13 referred individuals (including seven diagnosed with PCD). Selection criteria ensured the absence of chronic respiratory diseases, recent respiratory tract infections, or regular use of nasal medications. METHODOLOGY: Participants underwent nasal brushing with administration of lidocaine and naphazoline nasal spray in one nostril and saline in the contralateral nostril. Ciliary beat frequency and pattern were measured using digital high-speed video microscopy. RESULTS: Nasal spray administration did not significantly alter ciliary beat frequency or pattern compared to saline (p = 0.841 and p = 0.125, respectively). Subgroup analysis revealed consistent results across healthy volunteers, referred patients, and PCD patients. CONCLUSION: Local anesthesia with lidocaine and naphazoline spray did not affect ciliary function outcomes.

From the sinuses, Pseudomonas aeruginosa can infect the lungs. METHODS: We studied the effect of endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) on symptoms of CRS and lower airway infections in PCD patients in a prospective single-arm intervention study of ESS with adjuvant therapy using nasal irrigation with saline, topical nasal steroids, and 2 weeks of systemic antibiotics. Additional treatment with local colistin for 6 months was instigated when P. aeruginosa was cultured at ESS. RESULTS: Twenty-four PCD patients underwent ESS to search for an infectious focus (n = 10), due to severe symptoms of CRS (n = 8), or both (n = 6). Bacteria were cultured from sinus samples in 21 patients (88%), and simultaneous sinus and lung colonization with identical pathogens were observed in 13 patients (62%). Four patients with preoperative P. aeruginosa lung colonization (25%) had no regrowth during follow-up; 2 of these had P. aeruginosa sinusitis. Sinonasal symptoms were improved 12 months after ESS and we observed a trend toward better lung function after ESS. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated an improvement in CRS-related symptoms after ESS and adjuvant therapy. In selected PCD patients, the suggested regimen may postpone chronic lung infection with P. aeruginosa and stabilize lung function.",

Abnormal ciliary structure or function leading to impaired ciliary motility is the main pathophysiologic problem in Kartagener's syndrome. CASE PRESENTATION: A 24-year-old man from Gondar town, North-West Ethiopia, presented to University of Gondar Hospital with recurrent episodes of nasal congestion with itching and paranasal discomfort, and productive cough for more than a decade. Clinical and imaging findings revealed chronic sinusitis, bronchiectasis, dextrocardia, and situs inversus. He was treated with orally administered antibiotics, mucolytic, and chest physiotherapy. He was symptomatically better with the above therapy, and started on a long-term low-dose prophylactic antibiotic. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Kartagener's syndrome exist in Ethiopia as cases of chronic recurrent sinopulmonary infections. As there is no easy, reliable non-invasive diagnostic test for Kartagener's syndrome and the correct diagnosis is often delayed by years, it may cause chronic respiratory problems with reduced quality of life. Genetic counseling and fertility issues should be addressed once Kartagener's syndrome is diagnosed.",

                    "abstract": "The first clinical indication of non-antibiotic benefits of macrolides was in the Far East, in adults with diffuse panbronchiolitis. This condition is characterised by chronic airway infection, often with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, airway inflammation, bronchiectasis and a high mortality. Low dose erythromycin, and subsequently other macrolides, led in many cases to complete remission of the condition, and abrogated the neutrophilic airway inflammation characteristic of the disease. This dramatic finding sparked a flurry of interest in the many hundreds of macrolides in nature, especially their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. The biggest subsequent trials of azithromycin were in cystic fibrosis, which has obvious similarities to diffuse panbronchiolitis. There were unquestionable improvements in lung function and pulmonary exacerbations, but compared to diffuse panbronchiolitis, the results were disappointing. Case reports, case series and some randomised controlled trials followed in other conditions. Three trials of azithromycin in preschool wheeze gave contradictory results; a trial in pauci-inflammatory adult asthma, and a trial in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis both showed a significant reduction in exacerbations, but none matched the dramatic results in diffuse panbronchiolitis. There is clearly a huge risk of antibacterial resistance if macrolides are used widely and uncritically in the community. In summary, Azithromycin is not the answer to anything in paediatric respiratory medicine; the paediatric respiratory community needs to refocus on the dramatic benefits of macrolides in diffuse panbronchiolitis, use modern - omics technologies to determine the endotypes of inflammatory diseases and discover in nature or synthesise designer macrolides to replicate the diffuse panbronchiolitis results. We must now find out how to do better!",

The aims of this study were to describe the health of children seen in this Service and compare lung function to children with cystic fibrosis (CF). DESIGN: Multi-centre service evaluation of the English National Management PCD Service. SETTING: Four nationally commissioned PCD centres in England. PATIENTS: 333 children with PCD reviewed in the Service in 2015; lung function data were also compared with 2970 children with CF. RESULTS: Median age at diagnosis for PCD was 2.6 years, significantly lower in children with situs inversus (1.0 vs 6.0 years, p<0.001). Compared with national data from the CF Registry, mean (SD) %predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was 76.8% in PCD (n=240) and 85.0% in CF, and FEV1 was lower in children with PCD up to the age of 15 years. Approximately half of children had some hearing impairment, with 26% requiring hearing aids. Children with a lower body mass index (BMI) had lower FEV1 (p<0.001). One-third of children had positive respiratory cultures at review, 54% of these grew Haemophilus influenzae. CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence that children with PCD in England have worse lung function than those with CF. Nutritional status should be considered in PCD management, as those with a lower BMI have significantly lower FEV1. Hearing impairment is common but seems to improve with age. Well-designed and powered randomised controlled trials on management of PCD are needed to inform best clinical practice.",

Chronic oto-sino-pulmonary infection is the most common clinical presentation. Patients should be monitored in centres with expertise in PCD. Regular respiratory monitoring consists of lung function tests, adapted to the patient's age, and cough swab or sputum cultures. Chest X-rays are insensitive but the use of high-resolution computed tomography should be considered carefully to avoid excessive radiation. Treatment of the chronic suppuration of the lower airways relies on antibiotics to which the isolated bacteria are sensitive, together with respiratory physiotherapy and exercise to clear excessive bronchial secretions. Bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory agents have no proven benefit and should be prescribed, if at all, on an individual basis. Treatment of the lower airways should always be in conjunction with that of the upper airways. Importantly in PCD, respiratory disease may be controlled with the use of early, adequate and aggressive management.",

However, evidence for its efficacy in PCD is lacking. We aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of azithromycin maintenance therapy for 6 months in patients with PCD. METHODS: The Better Experimental Screening and Treatment for Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (BESTCILIA) trial was a multicentre, double-blind, parallel group, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial done at 6 European PCD clinics (tertiary paediatric care centres and university hospitals in Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland, and UK). Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of PCD, aged 7-50 years old, and predicted FEV1 greater than 40% were recruited. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1), stratified by age and study site, via a web-based randomisation system to azithromycin 250 mg or 500 mg as tablets according to bodyweight (</>= 40 kg) or identical placebo, three times a week for 6 months. The random allocation sequence was a permuted block randomisation, with a block size of four, generated by an external consultancy. Participants, investigators, and care providers were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was the number of respiratory exacerbations over 6 months. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered in the EU Clinical Trials Register, EudraCT number 2013-004664-58. FINDINGS: Between June 24, 2014, and Aug 23, 2016, 102 patients were screened, of whom 90 were randomly assigned to either azithromycin (n=49) or placebo (n=41). The study was ended without having included the planned number of participants due to recruitment difficulties. The mean number of respiratory exacerbations over 6 months was 0 75 (SD 1 12) in the azithromycin group compared with 1 62 (1 64) in the placebo group, and participants receiving azithromycin had significantly lower rate of exacerbations during the individual treatment periods (rate ratio 0 45 [95% CI 0 26-0 78]; p=0 004). Four serious adverse events were reported, occurring in one (2%) of 47 participants in the azithromycin group and in three (7%) of 41 participants in the placebo group. Loose stools or diarrhoea were more common in the azithromycin group than in the placebo group (11 [23%] vs two [5%]). INTERPRETATION: This first multinational randomised controlled trial on pharmacotherapy in PCD showed that azithromycin maintenance therapy for 6 months was well tolerated and halved the rate of respiratory exacerbations. Azithromycin maintenance therapy is an option for patients with PCD with frequent exacerbations potentially leading to reduced need for additional antibiotic treatments and preventing irreversible lung damage.

Participants were randomly assigned (1:1), stratified by age and study site, via a web-based randomisation system to azithromycin 250 mg or 500 mg as tablets according to bodyweight (</>= 40 kg) or identical placebo, three times a week for 6 months. The random allocation sequence was a permuted block randomisation, with a block size of four, generated by an external consultancy. Participants, investigators, and care providers were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was the number of respiratory exacerbations over 6 months. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered in the EU Clinical Trials Register, EudraCT number 2013-004664-58. FINDINGS: Between June 24, 2014, and Aug 23, 2016, 102 patients were screened, of whom 90 were randomly assigned to either azithromycin (n=49) or placebo (n=41). The study was ended without having included the planned number of participants due to recruitment difficulties. The mean number of respiratory exacerbations over 6 months was 0 75 (SD 1 12) in the azithromycin group compared with 1 62 (1 64) in the placebo group, and participants receiving azithromycin had significantly lower rate of exacerbations during the individual treatment periods (rate ratio 0 45 [95% CI 0 26-0 78]; p=0 004). Four serious adverse events were reported, occurring in one (2%) of 47 participants in the azithromycin group and in three (7%) of 41 participants in the placebo group. Loose stools or diarrhoea were more common in the azithromycin group than in the placebo group (11 [23%] vs two [5%]). INTERPRETATION: This first multinational randomised controlled trial on pharmacotherapy in PCD showed that azithromycin maintenance therapy for 6 months was well tolerated and halved the rate of respiratory exacerbations. Azithromycin maintenance therapy is an option for patients with PCD with frequent exacerbations potentially leading to reduced need for additional antibiotic treatments and preventing irreversible lung damage.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Currently, there is a lack of data concerning the organization and characteristics of Italian pediatric physiotherapy units for the treatment of patients with chronic lung diseases, especially those with rare conditions such as Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) and non-Cystic Fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB). METHODS: A national descriptive study based on a survey questionnaire was conducted. The questionnaire consisted of three different sections: distribution and characteristics of the centres, services provided by respiratory therapists, physiotherapists' perception of the unit. The survey was distributed to all healthcare providers via an online platform, and a descriptive data analysis was performed. RESULTS: The survey had a response rate of 97.5% with twenty-nine responses collected. The centers are heterogeneously distributed: thirteen in the northern regions, eight in the central regions and eight in the southern regions. Of the 29 centers with a physiotherapy unit, 19 had a specialized respiratory therapy unit. Respiratory therapy was provided in different care settings: regular wards (28/29 centers, 97%), outpatient service (29/29 centers, 100%), and intensive or semi-intensive care units (17/29 centers, 59%). The interventions provided by respiratory therapists involved more than just airway clearance (29/29). More specific interventions, such as pulmonary function tests (23/29), functional tests (27/29), educational training (26/29), management of workout exercise programs (25/29) and interventions developed in collaboration with physicians such as non-invasive ventilation (NIV) (23/29) and oxygen titration (21/29) are performed. It is interesting to note that therapists are also involved in various activities, such as telemedicine, physiotherapists' research projects, and supporting alongside physicians, for the prescription at home of medical devices. Perception of the unit was also evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: The involved centers are heterogeneous in terms of distribution and treatments offered. The role of respiratory physiotherapists still seems to be fragmented. This first descriptive analysis of the physiotherapy units and the main differences between centers opens queries on the clinical approaches used for pediatric patients with PCD in terms of respiratory physiotherapy. However,in response to evolving treatment needs, a more specialized and standardized approach to patient care is required.",

The survey was distributed to all healthcare providers via an online platform, and a descriptive data analysis was performed. RESULTS: The survey had a response rate of 97.5% with twenty-nine responses collected. The centers are heterogeneously distributed: thirteen in the northern regions, eight in the central regions and eight in the southern regions. Of the 29 centers with a physiotherapy unit, 19 had a specialized respiratory therapy unit. Respiratory therapy was provided in different care settings: regular wards (28/29 centers, 97%), outpatient service (29/29 centers, 100%), and intensive or semi-intensive care units (17/29 centers, 59%). The interventions provided by respiratory therapists involved more than just airway clearance (29/29). More specific interventions, such as pulmonary function tests (23/29), functional tests (27/29), educational training (26/29), management of workout exercise programs (25/29) and interventions developed in collaboration with physicians such as non-invasive ventilation (NIV) (23/29) and oxygen titration (21/29) are performed. It is interesting to note that therapists are also involved in various activities, such as telemedicine, physiotherapists' research projects, and supporting alongside physicians, for the prescription at home of medical devices. Perception of the unit was also evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: The involved centers are heterogeneous in terms of distribution and treatments offered. The role of respiratory physiotherapists still seems to be fragmented. This first descriptive analysis of the physiotherapy units and the main differences between centers opens queries on the clinical approaches used for pediatric patients with PCD in terms of respiratory physiotherapy. However,in response to evolving treatment needs, a more specialized and standardized approach to patient care is required.",

RESULTS: In all participants >= 5 years old and who completed nNO using resistor methodology, the first diagnostic test performed was nNO in 77% (73/95), genetic testing in 14% (13/95), and TEM in <1% (9/95). nNO was the only diagnostic test performed in 75% (55/73) of participants who completed nNO first. Seventy-five percent (55/73) had a single above the cutoff nNO value and PCD was determined to be unlikely in 91% (50/55) without performing additional confirmatory testing. Eleven percent (8/73) had multiple below the cutoff nNO values, with 38% (3/8) being diagnosed with PCD by confirmatory testing and 50% (4/8) with negative confirmatory testing, but being managed as PCD. The genetic testing positivity rate was 50% in participants who completed nNO first and 8% when genetic testing was completed first. CONCLUSION: nNO is useful in three situations: an initial above the cutoff nNO value makes PCD unlikely and prevents additional confirmatory testing, repetitively below the cutoff nNO values without positive confirmatory testing suggests a probable PCD diagnosis and the yield of genetic testing is higher when nNO is performed first.",

Treatment of the chronic suppuration of the lower airways relies on antibiotics to which the isolated bacteria are sensitive, together with respiratory physiotherapy and exercise to clear excessive bronchial secretions. Bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory agents have no proven benefit and should be prescribed, if at all, on an individual basis. Treatment of the lower airways should always be in conjunction with that of the upper airways. Importantly in PCD, respiratory disease may be controlled with the use of early, adequate and aggressive management.",

Abnormal ciliary structure or function leading to impaired ciliary motility is the main pathophysiologic problem in Kartagener's syndrome. CASE PRESENTATION: A 24-year-old man from Gondar town, North-West Ethiopia, presented to University of Gondar Hospital with recurrent episodes of nasal congestion with itching and paranasal discomfort, and productive cough for more than a decade. Clinical and imaging findings revealed chronic sinusitis, bronchiectasis, dextrocardia, and situs inversus. He was treated with orally administered antibiotics, mucolytic, and chest physiotherapy. He was symptomatically better with the above therapy, and started on a long-term low-dose prophylactic antibiotic. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Kartagener's syndrome exist in Ethiopia as cases of chronic recurrent sinopulmonary infections. As there is no easy, reliable non-invasive diagnostic test for Kartagener's syndrome and the correct diagnosis is often delayed by years, it may cause chronic respiratory problems with reduced quality of life. Genetic counseling and fertility issues should be addressed once Kartagener's syndrome is diagnosed.",

PATIENT: On the first day of life, the male newborn developed dyspnoe and cyanosis, so that CPAP and short term ventilation was necessary. Varying atelectasis impressed on the chest radiographs and the diagnosis of PCD was made by nasal brush biopsies. Causative is a lack of the inner dynein arms of the cilia. The clinical features of newborns with the diagnoses of PCD are listed and compared with the own case.

The primary objective was to assess whether lidocaine 2% and naphazoline 0.5% nasal spray alter ciliary beat frequency and pattern in subjects undergoing nasal brushing, aiming to enhance primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) diagnosis. HYPOTHESIS: It was hypothesized that local anesthesia administration would not significantly affect ciliary function in nasal epithelium. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, simple-blind randomized study was conducted between 2020 and 2023. The study employed digital high-speed videomicroscopy to analyze ciliary beat frequency and pattern. PATIENT/SUBJECT SELECTION: A cohort of 38 participants was recruited, consisting of 25 healthy volunteers and 13 referred individuals (including seven diagnosed with PCD). Selection criteria ensured the absence of chronic respiratory diseases, recent respiratory tract infections, or regular use of nasal medications. METHODOLOGY: Participants underwent nasal brushing with administration of lidocaine and naphazoline nasal spray in one nostril and saline in the contralateral nostril. Ciliary beat frequency and pattern were measured using digital high-speed video microscopy. RESULTS: Nasal spray administration did not significantly alter ciliary beat frequency or pattern compared to saline (p = 0.841 and p = 0.125, respectively). Subgroup analysis revealed consistent results across healthy volunteers, referred patients, and PCD patients. CONCLUSION: Local anesthesia with lidocaine and naphazoline spray did not affect ciliary function outcomes. These findings support the safe use of these agents in clinical practice for PCD diagnostic procedures. Further research with larger cohorts is warranted for validation.",

As the diagnosis is often delayed for years, the purpose of this study was to review the presenting features of children with PCD attending Australia's initial diagnostic PCD service over a 30-year period. METHOD: A retrospective review of the symptoms of children diagnosed with PCD at Concord Hospital between 1982 and 2012 was undertaken. RESULTS: One thousand thirty-seven paediatric patients were referred for assessment and underwent nasal ciliary brushing. Eighty-four (8.1%) had PCD based on microscopic analysis of nasal cilia. This included 81 with ciliary ultrastructural abnormalities demonstrated on electron microscopy and 3 with a suggestive phenotype, reduced ciliary beat frequency and a family history of PCD. The median age at diagnosis was 6.4 years (range 0.1 to 18.2 years). Forty-six per cent had situs abnormalities and 31% had a family member with PCD. Recurrent cough (81%), rhinosinusitis (71%), recurrent otitis media (49%) and neonatal respiratory distress (57%) were reported. Bronchiectasis at presentation was documented in 32%. Situs abnormalities and neonatal respiratory distress were present together in 26%. CONCLUSION: PCD remains under-recognised by health-care workers. The combination of neonatal respiratory distress, chronic suppurative cough and rhinosinusitis was the most common documented symptom cluster at presentation in cases of PCD. A heightened awareness of the clinical features of the disease may help to lower the age at diagnosis, facilitate appropriate treatment and improve long-term outcomes.",

SETTING: University-affiliated assisted reproductive technologies practice. PATIENT(S): A 40 year-old man presenting with 12 months' primary infertility, complete sperm immotility, severe morphologic defects, and moderate sinopulmonary disease. INTERVENTION(S): Electron microscopy (EM) of sperm, nasal cilial function studies, open testis biopsy, and sperm extraction for intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Outcome of ICSI treatment using immotile testicular sperm. RESULT(S): EM revealed abnormal connecting pieces, shortened midpieces with attenuated mitochondrial sheaths, poorly developed annulus, abnormal outer dense fibers, and axonemes missing the two central mircotubules. Nasal ciliary beat frequency was subnormal and dyssynchronous. Immotile testicular sperm were selected for ICSI based on physical characteristics and fertilized 12 of 18 eggs. A single day-5 blastocyst achieved a normal pregnancy and delivery of a healthy 3,840-g girl at 38 weeks' gestation. CONCLUSION(S): Nonclassic PCD may present with structurally abnormal completely immotile sperm, with seemingly little prospect of fertility, and moderate respiratory dysfunction supporting the presence of an underlying ciliopathy. Despite testicular sperm also being immotile and showing profound structural defects that would seem to preclude fertilization, more morphologically normal sperm are capable of establishing a normal pregnancy.",

To eliminate these secretions, airway clearance techniques (ACT) directed to the URT and LRT are frequently prescribed. The rationale for the application of these techniques is the same as in adults, but they need to be adapted to be transposed to children. The physiotherapist will be able to choose among a wide range of techniques, of which the most adequate will depend not only on the age of the child and the indication, but also on the basis of his preferences or habits, as well as those of the child. Upper airway clearance, including nasal irrigation, is now recommended for acute and chronic rhinosinusitis in children. It is also one of the symptomatic treatments recommended for infants with acute bronchiolitis. For LRT clearance, several indications, such as cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia and neuromuscular disease, are now widely advocated. Conversely, other indications, such as for infants with acute viral bronchiolitis, are highly controversial. Thoughtful application of these techniques is lacking in robust and precise tools to objectively assess the presence of bronchial congestion, and to treat it accordingly. Similarly, no precise and reliable evaluation of the effectiveness of these ACTs is available to date. This review is designed to explore the ACTs used by physiotherapists, to provide an overview of their current indications, and to consider complementary approaches.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is no gold-standard test for primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), rather American Thoracic Society guidelines recommend starting with nasal nitric oxide (nNO) in children >=5 years old and confirming the diagnosis with genetic testing or ciliary biopsy with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). These guidelines have not been studied in a clinical setting. We present a case series describing the PCD diagnostic process at our pediatric PCD center. METHODS: Diagnostic data from 131 patients undergoing PCD consultation were reviewed. RESULTS: In all participants >= 5 years old and who completed nNO using resistor methodology, the first diagnostic test performed was nNO in 77% (73/95), genetic testing in 14% (13/95), and TEM in <1% (9/95). nNO was the only diagnostic test performed in 75% (55/73) of participants who completed nNO first. Seventy-five percent (55/73) had a single above the cutoff nNO value and PCD was determined to be unlikely in 91% (50/55) without performing additional confirmatory testing. Eleven percent (8/73) had multiple below the cutoff nNO values, with 38% (3/8) being diagnosed with PCD by confirmatory testing and 50% (4/8) with negative confirmatory testing, but being managed as PCD. The genetic testing positivity rate was 50% in participants who completed nNO first and 8% when genetic testing was completed first. CONCLUSION: nNO is useful in three situations: an initial above the cutoff nNO value makes PCD unlikely and prevents additional confirmatory testing, repetitively below the cutoff nNO values without positive confirmatory testing suggests a probable PCD diagnosis and the yield of genetic testing is higher when nNO is performed first.",

Airway infection management strategies are borrowed from cystic fibrosis. The aim of this study is to describe the management of airway infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( PA) in children and adults with PCD across European centers. An online survey questionnaire was sent electronically using SurveyMonkey  to 55 PCD centers in 36 European countries. Fifty-two responded from 43 centers in 26 countries, a response rate of 70%. Most (89%) countries did not have written guidelines for PCD management. Airway sampling for infection detection at each clinic visit was more likely when follow-up was frequent. Eighty-seven percent of centers chose to treat the first PA isolate, most prescribing combined oral ciprofloxacin and inhaled colistimethate sodium (43%, n = 18). The preferred treatment for chronic infection with PA was nebulized colistimethate in 51% ( n = 22). In summary, considerable variation exists across European centers in the frequency of patient follow-up and airway sampling for infection, treatment goals, and the management of PA infection. Few centers had written guidelines for PCD management. Clinical trials to determine optimal treatment of PA in PCD patients are urgently needed.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disorder. Although the genetic tests and new diagnostic algorithms have recently been recommended, clinical signs and electron microscope (EM) findings have historically been the mainstays of diagnosis in Asia. To characterize PCD previously reported in Japan, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: A search using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Japana Centra Revuo Medicina (in Japanese) databases was carried out to identify articles reporting PCD, Kartagener syndrome, or immotile cilia syndrome in Japanese patients and published between 1985 and 2015. RESULTS: After excluding duplication from 334 reports, we extracted 316 patients according to the criteria. Diagnosis was most frequently made in adulthood (148 patients [46.8%] >= 18 years old, 24 patients [7.6%] < 1 year old, 68 patients [21.5%] 1-17 years old and 76 patients [24.1%] lacking information). Of the 230 patients (72.8%) who received EM examination, there were patients with inner dynein arm (IDA) defects (n = 55; 23.9%), outer dynein arm (ODA) defects (14; 6.1%), both ODA and IDA defects (57; 24.8%), other structural abnormalities (25; 10.9%), no abnormalities (4; 1.7%), and no detailed conclusion or description (75; 32.6%). CONCLUSION: Delayed diagnosis of this congenital disease with high frequency of IDA defects and low frequency of ODA defects appear to be historical features of PCD reported in Japan, when EM was a main diagnostic tool. This review highlights problems experienced in this field, and provides basic information to establish a modernized PCD diagnosis and management system in the future.",

METHODS: A national descriptive study based on a survey questionnaire was conducted. The questionnaire consisted of three different sections: distribution and characteristics of the centres, services provided by respiratory therapists, physiotherapists' perception of the unit. The survey was distributed to all healthcare providers via an online platform, and a descriptive data analysis was performed. RESULTS: The survey had a response rate of 97.5% with twenty-nine responses collected. The centers are heterogeneously distributed: thirteen in the northern regions, eight in the central regions and eight in the southern regions. Of the 29 centers with a physiotherapy unit, 19 had a specialized respiratory therapy unit. Respiratory therapy was provided in different care settings: regular wards (28/29 centers, 97%), outpatient service (29/29 centers, 100%), and intensive or semi-intensive care units (17/29 centers, 59%). The interventions provided by respiratory therapists involved more than just airway clearance (29/29). More specific interventions, such as pulmonary function tests (23/29), functional tests (27/29), educational training (26/29), management of workout exercise programs (25/29) and interventions developed in collaboration with physicians such as non-invasive ventilation (NIV) (23/29) and oxygen titration (21/29) are performed. It is interesting to note that therapists are also involved in various activities, such as telemedicine, physiotherapists' research projects, and supporting alongside physicians, for the prescription at home of medical devices. Perception of the unit was also evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: The involved centers are heterogeneous in terms of distribution and treatments offered. The role of respiratory physiotherapists still seems to be fragmented. This first descriptive analysis of the physiotherapy units and the main differences between centers opens queries on the clinical approaches used for pediatric patients with PCD in terms of respiratory physiotherapy. However,in response to evolving treatment needs, a more specialized and standardized approach to patient care is required.",

We assessed physical activity, respiratory physiotherapy practices and nutritional status among people with primary ciliary dyskinesia in Switzerland, investigated how these vary by age and identified factors associated with regular physical activity. METHODS: We sent a postal questionnaire survey to people with primary ciliary dyskinesia enrolled in the Swiss PCD registry (CH-PCD), based on the standardised FOLLOW-PCD patient questionnaire. We collected information about physical activity, physiotherapy, respiratory symptoms and nutritional status. We calculated the metabolic equivalent (MET) to better reflect the intensity of the reported physical activities. To assess nutritional status, we extracted information from CH-PCD and calculated participants' body mass index (BMI). RESULTS: Of the 86 questionnaires we sent, 74 (86% response rate) were returned from 24 children and 50 adults. The median age at survey completion was 23 years (IQR [interquartile range] 15-51), and 51% were female. Among all 74 participants, 48 (65%) performed sports regularly. Children were vigorously active (median MET 9.1; IQR 7.9-9.6) and adults were moderately active (median MET 5.5; IQR 4.3-6.9). Fifty-nine participants (80%) reported performing some type of respiratory physiotherapy. However, only 30% of adults saw a professional physiotherapist, compared with 75% of children. Half of the participants had normal BMI; one child (4%) and two adults (4%) were underweight. People who were regularly physically active reported seeing a physiotherapist more often. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to provide patient-reported data about physical activity, respiratory physiotherapy and nutrition among people with primary ciliary dyskinesia. Our results highlight that professional respiratory physiotherapy, exercise recommendations and nutritional advice are often not implemented in the care of people with primary ciliary dyskinesia in Switzerland. Multidisciplinary care in specialised centres by teams including physiotherapists and nutrition consultants could improve the quality of life of people with primary ciliary dyskinesia.",

The aims of this study were to describe the health of children seen in this Service and compare lung function to children with cystic fibrosis (CF). DESIGN: Multi-centre service evaluation of the English National Management PCD Service. SETTING: Four nationally commissioned PCD centres in England. PATIENTS: 333 children with PCD reviewed in the Service in 2015; lung function data were also compared with 2970 children with CF. RESULTS: Median age at diagnosis for PCD was 2.6 years, significantly lower in children with situs inversus (1.0 vs 6.0 years, p<0.001). Compared with national data from the CF Registry, mean (SD) %predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was 76.8% in PCD (n=240) and 85.0% in CF, and FEV1 was lower in children with PCD up to the age of 15 years. Approximately half of children had some hearing impairment, with 26% requiring hearing aids. Children with a lower body mass index (BMI) had lower FEV1 (p<0.001). One-third of children had positive respiratory cultures at review, 54% of these grew Haemophilus influenzae. CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence that children with PCD in England have worse lung function than those with CF. Nutritional status should be considered in PCD management, as those with a lower BMI have significantly lower FEV1. Hearing impairment is common but seems to improve with age. Well-designed and powered randomised controlled trials on management of PCD are needed to inform best clinical practice.",

OBJECTIVE: Primary aim was to compare the efficacy and safety of the conventional chest physiotherapy (CCP) and oscillatory positive expiratory pressure therapy (OPEPT). Secondary aims were to compare the exacerbation rate, time until the first exacerbation, patient compliance and comfort between the two CP methods. METHODS: This is a 6 month randomized, controlled crossover trial. Patients >6 years of age with PCD were randomized into two groups, first group was assigned to OPEPT (Acapella ) for 3 months while second group was assigned to CCP. Groups were crossed over to the other modality after a 15-day washout period. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and compliance were monitored by monthly clinic visits. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in FEV1 , FEF25-75 , and PEF values (p = .018, p = .020, and p = .016, respectively) in the OPEPT group and in FVC values (p = .007) in CCP group compared to baseline. However PFT increase at 3rd month was not superior to each other with both physiotherapy methods. Median acute pulmonary exacerbation rate and time period until the first exacerbation were similar in both groups (p = .821, p = .092, respectively). Comfort and effectiveness of OPEPT was higher than CCP according to patients (p = .029 and p = .042, respectively). There were no adverse effects with either therapy. CONCLUSIONS: OPEPT was as effective as CCP in PCD patients. OPEPT was more comfortable and effective than CCP according to patients. OPEPT might be an efficient alternative method for airway cleareance in PCD patients.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare inherited disease affecting motile cilia lining the respiratory tract. Despite neonatal respiratory distress as an early feature, diagnosis is typically delayed until late childhood. Our objective was to identify characteristics that differentiate PCD from common causes of term neonatal respiratory distress. METHODS: This was a case-control study. Patients with PCD born after 1994 attending a regional PCD clinic who had a history of neonatal respiratory distress (n = 46) were included. Controls (n = 46), term neonates with respiratory distress requiring a chest radiograph, were randomly selected from hospital birth records and matched on gender, birth month/year, and mode of delivery. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the association between neonatal characteristics and PCD diagnosis. The diagnostic performance of the best predictive variables was estimated by calculating sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: PCD cases required more oxygen therapy (39 cases, 29 controls, P = .01), longer duration of oxygen therapy (PCD mean = 15.2 days, control mean = 0.80 days, P < .01), had later onset of neonatal respiratory distress (PCD median = 12 hours, control median = 1 hour, P < .001), and higher frequency of lobar collapse and situs inversus (PCD = 70% and 48% respectively, control = 0% for both, P < .001). Situs inversus, lobar collapse, or oxygen need for >2 days had 87% (95% confidence interval: 74-94) sensitivity and 96% (95% confidence interval: 85-99) specificity for PCD. CONCLUSIONS: When encountering term neonates with unexplained respiratory distress, clinicians should consider PCD in those with lobar collapse, situs inversus, and/or prolonged oxygen therapy (>2 days).",

Despite neonatal respiratory distress as an early feature, diagnosis is typically delayed until late childhood. Our objective was to identify characteristics that differentiate PCD from common causes of term neonatal respiratory distress. METHODS: This was a case-control study. Patients with PCD born after 1994 attending a regional PCD clinic who had a history of neonatal respiratory distress (n = 46) were included. Controls (n = 46), term neonates with respiratory distress requiring a chest radiograph, were randomly selected from hospital birth records and matched on gender, birth month/year, and mode of delivery. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the association between neonatal characteristics and PCD diagnosis. The diagnostic performance of the best predictive variables was estimated by calculating sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: PCD cases required more oxygen therapy (39 cases, 29 controls, P = .01), longer duration of oxygen therapy (PCD mean = 15.2 days, control mean = 0.80 days, P < .01), had later onset of neonatal respiratory distress (PCD median = 12 hours, control median = 1 hour, P < .001), and higher frequency of lobar collapse and situs inversus (PCD = 70% and 48% respectively, control = 0% for both, P < .001). Situs inversus, lobar collapse, or oxygen need for >2 days had 87% (95% confidence interval: 74-94) sensitivity and 96% (95% confidence interval: 85-99) specificity for PCD. CONCLUSIONS: When encountering term neonates with unexplained respiratory distress, clinicians should consider PCD in those with lobar collapse, situs inversus, and/or prolonged oxygen therapy (>2 days).",

The questionnaire consisted of three different sections: distribution and characteristics of the centres, services provided by respiratory therapists, physiotherapists' perception of the unit. The survey was distributed to all healthcare providers via an online platform, and a descriptive data analysis was performed. RESULTS: The survey had a response rate of 97.5% with twenty-nine responses collected.

Our primary aim was to compare the efficacy and safety of postural drainage, percussion and vibration [conventional PR (CPR)], and high frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) by studying change in pulmonary function. Our secondary aim was to evaluate patient preferences regarding the two methods. METHODS: This was a controlled randomized crossover study. PCD patients between the ages of 7 and 18 years were assigned to two groups, first group performed airway clearance with CPR at hospital for 5 days and after a 2-day washout period HFCWO was applied to the same group at home. HFCWO was applied first to the other group and then these patients were hospitalized for CPR. The primary outcome measure of the study was pulmonary function test (PFT). The secondary outcomes were pulse arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2 ) and the perceived efficiency and comfort level. RESULTS: PFT values of patients increased significantly after both PR methods (before/after): CPR: FVC: 77.0 +- 14.1/81.8 +- 13.0 (P = 0.002); FEV1 : 72.9 +- 14.8/78.7 +- 13.5 (P = 0.001); PEF: 73.8 +- 14.5/82.5 +- 14.5 (P = 0.001); FEF25-75 : 68.6 +- 27.6/74.9 +- 29.3 (P = 0.007). HFCWO FVC: 75.1 +- 15.3/80.3 +- 13.9 (P = 0.002); FEV1 : 71.4 +- 16/77.4 +- 14.6 (P = 0.001); PEF: 70.9 +- 18.0/78.3 +- 17.7 (P = 0.002); FEF25-75 : 70.5 +- 23.4/76.4 +- 25.6 (P = 0.006). There were no significant differences in % predicted FVC, FEV1 , PEF, and FEF25-75 increased values with CPR and HFCWO. HFCWO was found more comfortable (P = 0.04). Two PR methods were found efficient and no desaturation occurred during PR. CONCLUSIONS: PFTs were significantly increased after both PR methods. There were no differences in PFTs and SpO2 between the CPR and HFCWO groups. Both PR methods were found efficient. HFCWO was found more comfortable. HFCWO may be an option in patients with chronic pulmonary disease and low adherence to PR.",

                    "abstract": "RESEARCH QUESTION: Male infertility is a widespread symptom in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). PCD-related male infertility is often caused by asthenozoospermia, with barely normal sperm morphology. Multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF) are a major cause of asthenozoospermia, characterized by various malformed morphologies of sperm flagella. To date, a limited number of genes have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of both PCD and MMAF. What other genes associated with both PCD and MMAF are waiting to be discovered? DESIGN: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed to identify the pathogenic mutation associated with MMAF in a PCD patient. Peripheral venous blood and semen samples were collected from the PCD patient. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), immunofluorescence staining and western blotting were conducted to confirm the pathogenicity of the identified mutation. RESULTS: A novel homozygous mutation in CCDC39, c.983 T>C (p. Leu328Pro), was identified in two PCD-affected siblings of a consanguineous family showing a typical PCD phenotype, while the proband was infertile, which is associated with characterized MMAF. Furthermore, TEM revealed the abnormal ultrastructure of the patient's sperm flagella. Moreover, immunofluorescence staining revealed that CCDC39 was almost undetectable in the spermatozoa, which was further confirmed by western blotting. The outcome of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in the patient with the CCDC39 mutation was also favourable. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that a novel loss-of-function mutation of CCDC39 is involved in the pathogenesis of PCD and MMAF and initially reported that ICSI treatment has a good outcome. Therefore, the novel variant of CCDC39 contributes to the genetic diagnosis, counselling and treatment of male infertility in PCD patients with MMAF phenotype.",

                    "abstract": "AIMS OF THE STUDY: We know little about the level of physical activity, respiratory physiotherapy practices and nutritional status of people with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), although these are important aspects of patients with chronic respiratory disease. We assessed physical activity, respiratory physiotherapy practices and nutritional status among people with primary ciliary dyskinesia in Switzerland, investigated how these vary by age and identified factors associated with regular physical activity. METHODS: We sent a postal questionnaire survey to people with primary ciliary dyskinesia enrolled in the Swiss PCD registry (CH-PCD), based on the standardised FOLLOW-PCD patient questionnaire. We collected information about physical activity, physiotherapy, respiratory symptoms and nutritional status. We calculated the metabolic equivalent (MET) to better reflect the intensity of the reported physical activities. To assess nutritional status, we extracted information from CH-PCD and calculated participants' body mass index (BMI). RESULTS: Of the 86 questionnaires we sent, 74 (86% response rate) were returned from 24 children and 50 adults. The median age at survey completion was 23 years (IQR [interquartile range] 15-51), and 51% were female. Among all 74 participants, 48 (65%) performed sports regularly. Children were vigorously active (median MET 9.1; IQR 7.9-9.6) and adults were moderately active (median MET 5.5; IQR 4.3-6.9). Fifty-nine participants (80%) reported performing some type of respiratory physiotherapy. However, only 30% of adults saw a professional physiotherapist, compared with 75% of children. Half of the participants had normal BMI; one child (4%) and two adults (4%) were underweight. People who were regularly physically active reported seeing a physiotherapist more often. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to provide patient-reported data about physical activity, respiratory physiotherapy and nutrition among people with primary ciliary dyskinesia. Our results highlight that professional respiratory physiotherapy, exercise recommendations and nutritional advice are often not implemented in the care of people with primary ciliary dyskinesia in Switzerland. Multidisciplinary care in specialised centres by teams including physiotherapists and nutrition consultants could improve the quality of life of people with primary ciliary dyskinesia.",

The most common underlying conditions leading to bronchiectasis include infections, immunodeficiency, aspiration and primary ciliary dyskinesia. Treatment centres on airway clearance with aggressive antibiotic regimens and physiotherapy; more specific approaches are available for some of the underlying conditions. A high index of suspicion that a child may have underlying bronchiectasis must be maintained in the presence of prolonged or recurrent \"wet/productive\" cough. The classic definition of bronchiectasis is of irreversible bronchial dilatation; however, at the milder end of the spectrum it appears that radiographic changes may be reversible. Untreated, in its severest form bronchiectasis can progress to end stage pulmonary failure in adult life. In this article, we review its pathogenesis and diagnosis and the evidence base for available treatments.",

Herein we report a case of successful conservative management of an anastomotic airway dehiscence after cadaveric donor lung transplantation. A 41-year-old woman with primary ciliary dyskinesia underwent cadaveric bilateral lung transplantation without cardiopulmonary bypass. On the postoperative day 25, left pneumothorax developed and bronchoscopy demonstrated a localized anastomotic dehiscence at the left main bronchus. The dehiscence was managed with 2 weeks of pleural drainage and was completely covered with regenerated bronchial epithelium at 4 months after transplantation. There is no finding suggestive of significant stenosis at 4 years of follow-up. Our case suggested asymptomatic and localized anastomotic dehiscence does not always require endobronchial stent placement or re-operation.

Airway infection management strategies are borrowed from cystic fibrosis. The aim of this study is to describe the management of airway infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( PA) in children and adults with PCD across European centers. An online survey questionnaire was sent electronically using SurveyMonkey  to 55 PCD centers in 36 European countries. Fifty-two responded from 43 centers in 26 countries, a response rate of 70%. Most (89%) countries did not have written guidelines for PCD management. Airway sampling for infection detection at each clinic visit was more likely when follow-up was frequent. Eighty-seven percent of centers chose to treat the first PA isolate, most prescribing combined oral ciprofloxacin and inhaled colistimethate sodium (43%, n = 18). The preferred treatment for chronic infection with PA was nebulized colistimethate in 51% ( n = 22). In summary, considerable variation exists across European centers in the frequency of patient follow-up and airway sampling for infection, treatment goals, and the management of PA infection. Few centers had written guidelines for PCD management. Clinical trials to determine optimal treatment of PA in PCD patients are urgently needed.",

It causes chronic cough, copious production of sputum (often purulent), and recurrent infections, and may cause airway obstruction bearing some similarities with that seen in COPD. It may complicate respiratory conditions such as asthma or COPD. It can be associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia, primary immunodeficiencies, certain systemic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis, and foreign body inhalation. Bronchiectasis can be due to cystic fibrosis but this is excluded from this review. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments in people with non-cystic fibrosis (non-CF) bronchiectasis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to January 2014 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. RESULTS: We found 23 studies that met our inclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: airway clearance techniques, corticosteroids (inhaled), exercise or physical training, hyperosmolar agents (inhaled), mucolytics, prolonged-use antibiotics, and surgery.",

Congenital abnormality of the primary cilia results in situs inversus in 50% of patients. Decreased function of motile cilia causes chronic rhinosinusitis, otitis media with effusion, bronchiectasis and infertility. Cases with situs inversus are considered to show \"Kartagener's syndrome\", and diagnosis is not difficult. However, in cases without situs inversus, the diagnosis is much more troublesome. PCD without situs inversus is thus probably underdiagnosed. Prolonged chronic cough represents an important symptom that is seen in most patients. The diagnosis of PCD requires the presence of the characteristic clinical phenotypes and either: (1) specific ciliary ultrastructural defects identified by transmission electron microscopy in biopsy samples of respiratory epithelium; or (2) identification of mutation in one of the genes known to be associated with PCD. Nasal nitric oxide concentration is extremely low in PCD, and this could be useful for screening of the disease. At present, no fundamental therapies are available for PCD. Diagnosis in the early stages is important to prevent progression of bronchiectasis and deterioration of lung function by guidance for daily life, immunization, cessation of smoking and prompt therapy at the time of respiratory tract infection. Since PCD is inherited in an autosomal-recessive manner, genetic counseling is necessary after definite diagnosis. ",

Abnormal ciliary structure or function leading to impaired ciliary motility is the main pathophysiologic problem in Kartagener's syndrome. CASE PRESENTATION: A 24-year-old man from Gondar town, North-West Ethiopia, presented to University of Gondar Hospital with recurrent episodes of nasal congestion with itching and paranasal discomfort, and productive cough for more than a decade. Clinical and imaging findings revealed chronic sinusitis, bronchiectasis, dextrocardia, and situs inversus. He was treated with orally administered antibiotics, mucolytic, and chest physiotherapy. He was symptomatically better with the above therapy, and started on a long-term low-dose prophylactic antibiotic. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Kartagener's syndrome exist in Ethiopia as cases of chronic recurrent sinopulmonary infections. As there is no easy, reliable non-invasive diagnostic test for Kartagener's syndrome and the correct diagnosis is often delayed by years, it may cause chronic respiratory problems with reduced quality of life. Genetic counseling and fertility issues should be addressed once Kartagener's syndrome is diagnosed.",

Symptoms including chronic, persistent cough and productive phlegm are a significant burden for people with bronchiectasis, and the main aim of treatment is to reduce exacerbation frequency and improve quality of life. Prophylactic antibiotic therapy aims to break this infection cycle and is recommended by clinical guidelines for adults with three or more exacerbations a year, based on limited evidence. It is important to weigh the evidence for bacterial suppression against the prevention of antibiotic resistance and further evidence is required on the safety and efficacy of different regimens of intermittently administered antibiotic treatments for people with bronchiectasis. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of intermittent prophylactic antibiotics in the treatment of adults and children with bronchiectasis. SEARCH METHODS: We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, which contains studies identified through multiple electronic searches and handsearches of other sources. We also searched trial registries and reference lists of primary studies. We conducted searches on 6 September 2021, with no restriction on language of publication. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least three months' duration comparing an intermittent regime of prophylactic antibiotics with placebo, usual care or an alternate intermittent regimen. Intermittent prophylactic administration was defined as repeated courses of antibiotics with on-treatment and off-treatment intervals of at least 14 days' duration. We included adults and children with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiectasis confirmed by high resolution computed tomography (HRCT), plain film chest radiograph, or bronchography and a documented history of recurrent chest infections. We excluded studies where participants received high dose antibiotics immediately prior to enrolment or those with a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), primary ciliary dyskinesia, hypogammaglobulinaemia, sarcoidosis, or a primary diagnosis of COPD. Our primary outcomes were exacerbation frequency and serious adverse events. We did not exclude studies on the basis of review outcomes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs) or relative risk (RRs) and continuous data as mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs). We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We conducted GRADE assessments for the following primary outcomes: exacerbation frequency; serious adverse events and secondary outcomes: antibiotic resistance; hospital admissions; health-related quality of life. MAIN RESULTS: We included eight RCTs, with interventions ranging from 16 to 48 weeks, involving 2180 adults. All evaluated one of three types of antibiotics over two to six cycles of 28 days on/off treatment: aminoglycosides, ss-lactams or fluoroquinolones. Two studies also included 12 cycles of 14 days on/off treatment with fluoroquinolones. Participants had a mean age of 63.6 years, 65% were women and approximately 85% Caucasian. Baseline FEV1 ranged from 55.5% to 62.6% predicted. None of the studies included children. Generally, there was a low risk of bias in the included studies. Antibiotic versus placebo: cycle of 14 days on/off. Ciprofloxacin reduced the frequency of exacerbations compared to placebo (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.93; I2 = 65%; 2 studies, 469 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), with eight people (95% CI 6 to 28) needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome. The intervention increased the risk of antibiotic resistance more than twofold (OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.36 to 3.35; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 624 participants; high-certainty evidence). Serious adverse events, lung function (FEV1), health-related quality of life, and adverse effects did not differ between groups. Antibiotic versus placebo: cycle of 28 days on/off. Antibiotics did not reduce overall exacerbation frequency (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.02; I2 = 0%; 8 studies, 1695 participants; high-certainty evidence) but there were fewer severe exacerbations (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.93; I2 = 54%; 3 studies, 624 participants), though this should be interpreted with caution due to low event rates. The risk of antibiotic resistance was more than twofold higher based on a pooled analysis (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.42 to 3.42; I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 685 participants; high-certainty evidence) and consistent with unpooled data from four further studies. Serious adverse events, time to first exacerbation, duration of exacerbation, respiratory-related hospital admissions, lung function, health-related quality of life and adverse effects did not differ between study groups. Antibiotic versus usual care. We did not find any studies that compared intermittent antibiotic regimens with usual care. Cycle of 14 days on/off versus cycle of 28 days on/off. Exacerbation frequency did not differ between the two treatment regimens (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.24; I2 = 71%; 2 studies, 625 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) However, inconsistencies in the results from the two trials in this comparison indicate that the apparent aggregated similarities may not be reliable. There was no evidence of a difference in antibiotic resistance between groups (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.48; I2 = 60%; 2 studies, 624 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Serious adverse events, adverse effects, lung function and health-related quality of life did not differ between the two antibiotic regimens. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Overall, in adults who have frequent chest infections, long-term antibiotics given at 14-day on/off intervals slightly reduces the frequency of those infections and increases antibiotic resistance. Intermittent antibiotic regimens result in little to no difference in serious adverse events. The impact of intermittent antibiotic therapy on children with bronchiectasis is unknown due to an absence of evidence, and further research is needed to establish the potential risks and benefits.",

Options for refractory disease are limited. OBJECTIVES: We reviewed the efficacy and toxicity of inhaled amikacin in patients with treatment-refractory nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease. METHODS: Records were queried to identify patients who had inhaled amikacin added to failing regimens. Lower airway microbiology, symptoms, and computed tomography scan changes were assessed together with reported toxicity. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The majority (80%) of the 20 patients who met entry criteria were women; all had bronchiectasis, two had cystic fibrosis and one had primary ciliary dyskinesia. At initiation of inhaled amikacin, 15 were culture positive for M. abscessus and 5 for Mycobacterium avium complex and had received a median (range) of 60 (6, 190) months of mycobacterial treatment. Patients were followed for a median of 19 (1, 50) months. Eight (40%) patients had at least one negative culture and 5 (25%) had persistently negative cultures. A decrease in smear quantity was noted in 9 of 20 (45%) and in mycobacterial culture growth for 10 of 19 (53%). Symptom scores improved in nine (45%), were unchanged in seven (35%), and worsened in four (20%). Improvement on computed tomography scans was noted in 6 (30%), unchanged in 3 (15%), and worsened in 11 (55%). Seven (35%) stopped amikacin due to: ototoxicity in two (10%), hemoptysis in two (10%), and nephrotoxicity, persistent dysphonia, and vertigo in one each. CONCLUSIONS: In some patients with treatment-refractory pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial disease, the addition of inhaled amikacin was associated with microbiologic and/or symptomatic improvement; however, toxicity was common. Prospective evaluation of inhaled amikacin for mycobacterial disease is warranted.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Currently, there is a lack of data concerning the organization and characteristics of Italian pediatric physiotherapy units for the treatment of patients with chronic lung diseases, especially those with rare conditions such as Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) and non-Cystic Fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB). METHODS: A national descriptive study based on a survey questionnaire was conducted. The questionnaire consisted of three different sections: distribution and characteristics of the centres, services provided by respiratory therapists, physiotherapists' perception of the unit. The survey was distributed to all healthcare providers via an online platform, and a descriptive data analysis was performed. RESULTS: The survey had a response rate of 97.5% with twenty-nine responses collected. The centers are heterogeneously distributed: thirteen in the northern regions, eight in the central regions and eight in the southern regions. Of the 29 centers with a physiotherapy unit, 19 had a specialized respiratory therapy unit. Respiratory therapy was provided in different care settings: regular wards (28/29 centers, 97%), outpatient service (29/29 centers, 100%), and intensive or semi-intensive care units (17/29 centers, 59%). The interventions provided by respiratory therapists involved more than just airway clearance (29/29). More specific interventions, such as pulmonary function tests (23/29), functional tests (27/29), educational training (26/29), management of workout exercise programs (25/29) and interventions developed in collaboration with physicians such as non-invasive ventilation (NIV) (23/29) and oxygen titration (21/29) are performed. It is interesting to note that therapists are also involved in various activities, such as telemedicine, physiotherapists' research projects, and supporting alongside physicians, for the prescription at home of medical devices. Perception of the unit was also evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: The involved centers are heterogeneous in terms of distribution and treatments offered. The role of respiratory physiotherapists still seems to be fragmented. This first descriptive analysis of the physiotherapy units and the main differences between centers opens queries on the clinical approaches used for pediatric patients with PCD in terms of respiratory physiotherapy. However,in response to evolving treatment needs, a more specialized and standardized approach to patient care is required.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Currently, there is a lack of data concerning the organization and characteristics of Italian pediatric physiotherapy units for the treatment of patients with chronic lung diseases, especially those with rare conditions such as Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) and non-Cystic Fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB). METHODS: A national descriptive study based on a survey questionnaire was conducted. The questionnaire consisted of three different sections: distribution and characteristics of the centres, services provided by respiratory therapists, physiotherapists' perception of the unit. The survey was distributed to all healthcare providers via an online platform, and a descriptive data analysis was performed. RESULTS: The survey had a response rate of 97.5% with twenty-nine responses collected. The centers are heterogeneously distributed: thirteen in the northern regions, eight in the central regions and eight in the southern regions. Of the 29 centers with a physiotherapy unit, 19 had a specialized respiratory therapy unit. Respiratory therapy was provided in different care settings: regular wards (28/29 centers, 97%), outpatient service (29/29 centers, 100%), and intensive or semi-intensive care units (17/29 centers, 59%). The interventions provided by respiratory therapists involved more than just airway clearance (29/29). More specific interventions, such as pulmonary function tests (23/29), functional tests (27/29), educational training (26/29), management of workout exercise programs (25/29) and interventions developed in collaboration with physicians such as non-invasive ventilation (NIV) (23/29) and oxygen titration (21/29) are performed. It is interesting to note that therapists are also involved in various activities, such as telemedicine, physiotherapists' research projects, and supporting alongside physicians, for the prescription at home of medical devices. Perception of the unit was also evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: The involved centers are heterogeneous in terms of distribution and treatments offered. The role of respiratory physiotherapists still seems to be fragmented. This first descriptive analysis of the physiotherapy units and the main differences between centers opens queries on the clinical approaches used for pediatric patients with PCD in terms of respiratory physiotherapy. However,in response to evolving treatment needs, a more specialized and standardized approach to patient care is required.",

Our primary aim was to compare the efficacy and safety of postural drainage, percussion and vibration [conventional PR (CPR)], and high frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) by studying change in pulmonary function. Our secondary aim was to evaluate patient preferences regarding the two methods. METHODS: This was a controlled randomized crossover study. PCD patients between the ages of 7 and 18 years were assigned to two groups, first group performed airway clearance with CPR at hospital for 5 days and after a 2-day washout period HFCWO was applied to the same group at home. HFCWO was applied first to the other group and then these patients were hospitalized for CPR. The primary outcome measure of the study was pulmonary function test (PFT). The secondary outcomes were pulse arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2 ) and the perceived efficiency and comfort level. RESULTS: PFT values of patients increased significantly after both PR methods (before/after): CPR: FVC: 77.0 +- 14.1/81.8 +- 13.0 (P = 0.002); FEV1 : 72.9 +- 14.8/78.7 +- 13.5 (P = 0.001); PEF: 73.8 +- 14.5/82.5 +- 14.5 (P = 0.001); FEF25-75 : 68.6 +- 27.6/74.9 +- 29.3 (P = 0.007). HFCWO FVC: 75.1 +- 15.3/80.3 +- 13.9 (P = 0.002); FEV1 : 71.4 +- 16/77.4 +- 14.6 (P = 0.001); PEF: 70.9 +- 18.0/78.3 +- 17.7 (P = 0.002); FEF25-75 : 70.5 +- 23.4/76.4 +- 25.6 (P = 0.006). There were no significant differences in % predicted FVC, FEV1 , PEF, and FEF25-75 increased values with CPR and HFCWO. HFCWO was found more comfortable (P = 0.04). Two PR methods were found efficient and no desaturation occurred during PR. CONCLUSIONS: PFTs were significantly increased after both PR methods. There were no differences in PFTs and SpO2 between the CPR and HFCWO groups. Both PR methods were found efficient. HFCWO was found more comfortable. HFCWO may be an option in patients with chronic pulmonary disease and low adherence to PR.",

METHODS: Data from 20 patients with PCD and 20 matched, healthy counterparts recorded between July 2015 and January 2017 were analyzed. The data evaluated and recorded included pulmonary function using a portable spirometer, respiratory muscle strength (using a mouth pressure device, exercise capacity using the incremental shuttle walk test,), physical fitness (using the Munich Fitness Test), and ADLs (using the Glittre ADL test). RESULTS: Pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength, incremental shuttle walk test scores (all parameters), and total Munich Fitness Test scores were lower in the PCD group relative to controls (P < 0.05). The duration to complete the Glittre ADL test was higher in PCD patients than in healthy subjects (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength, exercise capacity, physical fitness, and ADL were affected by PCD.

Regular respiratory monitoring consists of lung function tests, adapted to the patient's age, and cough swab or sputum cultures. Chest X-rays are insensitive but the use of high-resolution computed tomography should be considered carefully to avoid excessive radiation. Treatment of the chronic suppuration of the lower airways relies on antibiotics to which the isolated bacteria are sensitive, together with respiratory physiotherapy and exercise to clear excessive bronchial secretions. Bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory agents have no proven benefit and should be prescribed, if at all, on an individual basis. Treatment of the lower airways should always be in conjunction with that of the upper airways. Importantly in PCD, respiratory disease may be controlled with the use of early, adequate and aggressive management.",

We assessed physical activity, respiratory physiotherapy practices and nutritional status among people with primary ciliary dyskinesia in Switzerland, investigated how these vary by age and identified factors associated with regular physical activity. METHODS: We sent a postal questionnaire survey to people with primary ciliary dyskinesia enrolled in the Swiss PCD registry (CH-PCD), based on the standardised FOLLOW-PCD patient questionnaire. We collected information about physical activity, physiotherapy, respiratory symptoms and nutritional status. We calculated the metabolic equivalent (MET) to better reflect the intensity of the reported physical activities. To assess nutritional status, we extracted information from CH-PCD and calculated participants' body mass index (BMI). RESULTS: Of the 86 questionnaires we sent, 74 (86% response rate) were returned from 24 children and 50 adults. The median age at survey completion was 23 years (IQR [interquartile range] 15-51), and 51% were female. Among all 74 participants, 48 (65%) performed sports regularly. Children were vigorously active (median MET 9.1; IQR 7.9-9.6) and adults were moderately active (median MET 5.5; IQR 4.3-6.9). Fifty-nine participants (80%) reported performing some type of respiratory physiotherapy. However, only 30% of adults saw a professional physiotherapist, compared with 75% of children. Half of the participants had normal BMI; one child (4%) and two adults (4%) were underweight. People who were regularly physically active reported seeing a physiotherapist more often. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to provide patient-reported data about physical activity, respiratory physiotherapy and nutrition among people with primary ciliary dyskinesia. Our results highlight that professional respiratory physiotherapy, exercise recommendations and nutritional advice are often not implemented in the care of people with primary ciliary dyskinesia in Switzerland. Multidisciplinary care in specialised centres by teams including physiotherapists and nutrition consultants could improve the quality of life of people with primary ciliary dyskinesia.",

Recent studies have revealed an association among heterotaxy, congenital heart disease, and primary ciliary dyskinesia. We undertook a retrospective review of patients undergoing cardiac surgery at Children's National Medical Center between 2004 and 2008 to explore the hypothesis that there is increased mortality and respiratory complications in heterotaxy patients. METHODS: Retrospective review was performed on postsurgical outcomes of 87 patients with heterotaxy and congenital heart disease exhibiting the full spectrum of situs abnormalities associated with heterotaxy. As controls patients, 634 cardiac surgical patients with congenital heart disease, but without laterality defects, were selected, and surgical complexities were similar with a median Risk Adjustment in Congenital Heart Surgery-1 score of 3.0 for both groups. RESULTS: We found the mean length of postoperative hospital stay (17 vs 11 days) and mechanical ventilation (11 vs 4 days) were significantly increased in the heterotaxy patients. Also elevated were rates of tracheostomies (6.9% vs 1.6%; odds ratio, 4.6), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support (12.6% vs 4.9%: odds ratio, 2.8), prolonged ventilatory courses (23% vs 12.3%; odds ratio, 2.1) and postsurgical deaths (16.1% vs 4.7%; odds ratio, 3.9). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show heterotaxy patients had more postsurgical events with increased postsurgical mortality and risk for respiratory complications as compared to control patients with similar Risk Adjustment in Congenital Heart Surgery-1 surgical complexity scores. We speculate that increased respiratory complications maybe due to ciliary dysfunction. Further studies are needed to explore the basis for the increased surgical risks for heterotaxy patients undergoing cardiac surgery.",

We present the first published series of robotic-assisted pulmonary lobectomy in children with bronchiectasis. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of all consecutive patients who underwent pulmonary lobectomy for severe localized bronchiectasis (2014-2019) via thoracoscopic versus robotic lobectomy. Four 5 mm ports were used for thoracoscopy; a four-arm approach was used for robotic surgery (Da Vinci Surgical Xi System, Intuitive Surgical, California). RESULTS: Eighteen children were operated (robotic resection, n = 7; thoracoscopy, n = 11) with infected congenital pulmonary malformation, primary ciliary dyskinesia, and post-viral infection. There were no conversions to open surgery with robotic surgery, but five with thoracoscopy. Total operative time was significantly longer with robotic versus thoracoscopic surgery (mean 247 +- 50 versus 152 +- 57 min, p = 0.008). There were no significant differences in perioperative complications, length of thoracic drainage, or total length of stay (mean 7 +- 2 versus 8 +- 3 days, respectively). No blood transfusions were required. Two thoracoscopic patients had a type-3 postoperative complication. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric robotic lung lobectomy is feasible and safe, with excellent visualization and bi-manual hand-wrist dissection - useful properties in difficult cases of infectious pathologies. However, instrumentation dimensions limit use in smaller thoraxes.",

Congenital abnormality of the primary cilia results in situs inversus in 50% of patients. Decreased function of motile cilia causes chronic rhinosinusitis, otitis media with effusion, bronchiectasis and infertility. Cases with situs inversus are considered to show \"Kartagener's syndrome\", and diagnosis is not difficult. However, in cases without situs inversus, the diagnosis is much more troublesome. PCD without situs inversus is thus probably underdiagnosed. Prolonged chronic cough represents an important symptom that is seen in most patients. The diagnosis of PCD requires the presence of the characteristic clinical phenotypes and either: (1) specific ciliary ultrastructural defects identified by transmission electron microscopy in biopsy samples of respiratory epithelium; or (2) identification of mutation in one of the genes known to be associated with PCD. Nasal nitric oxide concentration is extremely low in PCD, and this could be useful for screening of the disease. At present, no fundamental therapies are available for PCD. Diagnosis in the early stages is important to prevent progression of bronchiectasis and deterioration of lung function by guidance for daily life, immunization, cessation of smoking and prompt therapy at the time of respiratory tract infection. Since PCD is inherited in an autosomal-recessive manner, genetic counseling is necessary after definite diagnosis. ",

                    "abstract": "TRIAL DESIGN: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetical disease that inherited in an autosomal-recessive way. Its clinical manifestations (such as male infertility) are mainly caused by defects of motion-related cilia that encoded by mutated genes. Although some mutation has been verified, a number of mutations of PCD remain elusive. The main purpose of this study is to identify mutant genes in a Chinese family with PCD, and to verify the safety and effectiveness of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) of infertility caused by PCD. METHODS: Imaging examination was used to exclude pulmonary inflammation and visceral translocation. Semen analysis was used to assess the quality of the proband's sperm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was conducted to assess the ultrastructure of flagella and cilia. Targeted next generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing and qPCR (real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction detecting system) were applied to identified mutation of Chinese Family suspected of having PCD. Viable sperm were selected by hypo-osmotic swelling test (HOST) for ICSI. RESULTS: We report 2 novel mutations in CCDC40 gene (c.1259delA and EX17_20 deletion) resulted in immobility of sperm and infertility of the proband. These mutations were confirmed in the proband's sister (heterozygous) and his parents (recessive carrier) by Sanger sequencing and qPCR. All the spermatozoa from the proband were immotile. Ultrastructural defects were found in flagella and cilia of proband and his sister. Viable sperms were selected by HOST for ICSI and fertilized 9 of 21 eggs. Two frozen embryos were transplanted and a healthy 3500 g boy was delivered at 40 + 4 weeks' gestation. And then, we summarized the genes related to PCD and the mutant sites of CCDC40 gene. CONCLUSION: We reported 2 novel mutants in CCDC40 gene (c.1259delA and EX17_20 deletion), which could be candidates for genetic diagnosis in PCD patients. The combination of targeted next generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing may be a useful tool to diagnose PCD. ICSI is a considerable method in treatment of infertility caused by PCD.",

                    "abstract": "RESEARCH QUESTION: Male infertility is a widespread symptom in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). PCD-related male infertility is often caused by asthenozoospermia, with barely normal sperm morphology. Multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF) are a major cause of asthenozoospermia, characterized by various malformed morphologies of sperm flagella. To date, a limited number of genes have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of both PCD and MMAF. What other genes associated with both PCD and MMAF are waiting to be discovered? DESIGN: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed to identify the pathogenic mutation associated with MMAF in a PCD patient. Peripheral venous blood and semen samples were collected from the PCD patient. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), immunofluorescence staining and western blotting were conducted to confirm the pathogenicity of the identified mutation. RESULTS: A novel homozygous mutation in CCDC39, c.983 T>C (p. Leu328Pro), was identified in two PCD-affected siblings of a consanguineous family showing a typical PCD phenotype, while the proband was infertile, which is associated with characterized MMAF. Furthermore, TEM revealed the abnormal ultrastructure of the patient's sperm flagella. Moreover, immunofluorescence staining revealed that CCDC39 was almost undetectable in the spermatozoa, which was further confirmed by western blotting. The outcome of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in the patient with the CCDC39 mutation was also favourable. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that a novel loss-of-function mutation of CCDC39 is involved in the pathogenesis of PCD and MMAF and initially reported that ICSI treatment has a good outcome. Therefore, the novel variant of CCDC39 contributes to the genetic diagnosis, counselling and treatment of male infertility in PCD patients with MMAF phenotype.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite the manifestations of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) in early life, the diagnosis is often much delayed. Since 1998 in Cyprus, we have established the only national diagnostic and clinical referral center for PCD. OBJECTIVE: To review the phenotypic features at presentation of PCD patients in Cyprus in relation to age at diagnosis, with emphasis on previously lobectomised patients. METHODS: The medical records of the diagnosed PCD patients were retrospectively reviewed to obtain clinical data on presentation. RESULTS: Thirty patients, aged 13.9 years (range 0.1, 58.4 years), were diagnosed with PCD. Twelve of them presented after the age of 18. The most common manifestations were chronic cough (100%), chronic rhinorrhea (96.7%), sputum production (92.9%), laterality defects (63.3%), a history of pneumonia (53.3%) and neonatal respiratory distress (50%). A history of lobectomy in the past was recorded in 16.7% (5 patients). Patients who presented in adulthood had significantly higher frequency of lobectomy (41.7% vs 0%, p-value = 0.006) and had more frequently low FEV1 (58.3% vs 0%, p-value = 0.015) than those who presented before. Serial measurements of FEV1 and FVC indicated significantly lower intercepts in lobectomised compared to the adult non-lobectomised patients both in terms of FEV1 (-4.90 vs -1.80, p-value = 0.022) and FVC (-5.43 vs -1.91, p-value = 0.029) z-score levels. Change in FEV1 and FVC across time was not statistically significant in either group. CONCLUSIONS: PCD often remains undiagnosed up to adulthood accompanied by appearance of advanced lung disease. Performance of lobectomies seems to be a poor prognostic factor for PCD in adulthood.",

PATIENT: On the first day of life, the male newborn developed dyspnoe and cyanosis, so that CPAP and short term ventilation was necessary. Varying atelectasis impressed on the chest radiographs and the diagnosis of PCD was made by nasal brush biopsies. Causative is a lack of the inner dynein arms of the cilia.

We aimed to evaluate the feasibility and the effect of the active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT) versus oscillating positive expiratory pressure therapy (OPEP) in improving lung function and functional exercise capacity among children with PCD in Palestine. Methods: 32 PCD children (6-18 years) were included in a 12-week home-based feasibility study. They were assigned randomly into two groups: ACBT and OPEP. Data collection included spirometry measurements, and the six-minute walk test (6MWT). Results: After 12 weeks of regular airway clearance techniques (ACT), the FEV1, MEF25-75%, and the 6MWT demonstrated statistically significant differences (p = .02, p = .04, and p = .05 respectively) between the two groups, in favor of the OPEP group with the effect size of Cohen's d (0.86, 0.76, and 0.71) respectively. However, there was no significant difference (p > .05) between the two groups in FVC and FEV1/FVC. Additionally, only in the OPEP group, significant differences were recorded between pre and post-tests for FEV1 and 6MWT (p < .05). Conclusion: The randomized study design comparing ACBT and OPEP was feasible and acceptable to patients. OPEP demonstrates potential for managing respiratory health; however, treatments should be individualized to address each patient's specific needs. Further research with larger cohorts is needed to assess the effectiveness of both methods.",

There is wide variability in respiratory disease severity at birth and later in life. Objectives: To evaluate the association between neonatal hospital length of stay (neonatal-LOS) and supplemental oxygen duration (SuppO2) with lung function in pediatric PCD. We hypothesized that longer neonatal-LOS and SuppO2 are associated with worse lung function (i.e., forced expiratory volume in 1 second percent predicted [FEV1pp]). Methods: We performed a secondary analysis of the Genetic Disorders of Mucociliary Clearance Consortium prospective longitudinal multicenter cohort study. Participants enrolled, during 2006-2011, were <19 years old with a confirmed PCD diagnosis and followed annually for 5 years. The exposure variables were neonatal-LOS and SuppO2, counted in days since birth. The outcome, FEV1pp, was measured annually by spirometry. The associations of neonatal-LOS and SuppO2 with FEV1pp were evaluated with a linear mixed-effects model with repeated measures and random intercepts, adjusted for age and ciliary ultrastructural defects. Results: Included were 123 participants (male, 47%; mean enrollment age, 8.3 yr [range, 0 to 18 yr]) with 578 visits (median follow-up, 5 yr). The median neonatal-LOS was 9 d (range, 1 to 90 d), and median SuppO2 was 5 d (range, 0 to 180 d). Neonatal-LOS was associated with worse lung function (-0.27 FEV1pp/d [95% confidence interval, -0.53 to -0.01]; P = 0.04). SuppO2 was not associated with lung function. Conclusions: Neonatal-LOS is associated with worse lung function in pediatric PCD, independent of age and ultrastructural defects. Future research on the mechanisms of neonatal respiratory distress and its management may help us understand the variability of lung health outcomes in PCD.",

We aimed to evaluate the feasibility and the effect of the active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT) versus oscillating positive expiratory pressure therapy (OPEP) in improving lung function and functional exercise capacity among children with PCD in Palestine. Methods: 32 PCD children (6-18 years) were included in a 12-week home-based feasibility study. They were assigned randomly into two groups: ACBT and OPEP. Data collection included spirometry measurements, and the six-minute walk test (6MWT). Results: After 12 weeks of regular airway clearance techniques (ACT), the FEV1, MEF25-75%, and the 6MWT demonstrated statistically significant differences (p = .02, p = .04, and p = .05 respectively) between the two groups, in favor of the OPEP group with the effect size of Cohen's d (0.86, 0.76, and 0.71) respectively. However, there was no significant difference (p > .05) between the two groups in FVC and FEV1/FVC. Additionally, only in the OPEP group, significant differences were recorded between pre and post-tests for FEV1 and 6MWT (p < .05). Conclusion: The randomized study design comparing ACBT and OPEP was feasible and acceptable to patients. OPEP demonstrates potential for managing respiratory health; however, treatments should be individualized to address each patient's specific needs. Further research with larger cohorts is needed to assess the effectiveness of both methods.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: We present the case of a parturient diagnosed with primary ciliary dyskinesia with secondary bronchiectasis who developed significant hypoxemia following administration of intravenous oxytocin during Cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia. This case suggests that oxytocin can affect pulmonary vascular tone and interfere with the protective effects of hypoxic vasoconstriction. CLINICAL FEATURES: A 35-yr-old primigravida at 37 weeks gestation presented for a scheduled Cesarean delivery due to breech positioning and fetal abnormalities. The patient had a diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia and had undergone a right middle lobectomy seven years earlier for resultant bronchiectasis. Pulmonary function testing in the month prior to delivery showed a 4% decline in her baseline FEV1 to 1.06 L (32% of predicted value) but she was functionally well. The patient initially had an uneventful spinal anesthetic and maintained an oxygen saturation of 97% on room air in the supine position until delivery of her baby. An intravenous infusion of oxytocin for uterine contraction was started following removal of the placenta. The patient then became acutely hypoxemic with a drop in room air saturation to 84% but with no other accompanying hemodynamic instability. Maternal oxygen saturation did not improve with the addition of supplemental oxygen, and the patient had a significant arterial-alveolar oxygen gradient suggesting an intrapulmonary shunt. No supporting clinical, radiologic, or laboratory evidence of a thrombotic, air, or amniotic fluid embolism or mucous plug was detected. The patient remained hypoxemic during the postoperative period with gradual improvement back to baseline saturation in approximately 48 hr. CONCLUSION: The vasodilatory effects of intravenous oxytocin on the pulmonary vasculature may worsen shunting and interfere with hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, producing clinically significant hypoxemia in patients with comorbid lung disease. Oxytocin should be used with caution in patients with compromised lung function.",

                    "abstract": "Congestion of the upper (URT) and lower respiratory tracts (LRT) is a common symptom in several acute and chronic respiratory diseases that occur in childhood. To eliminate these secretions, airway clearance techniques (ACT) directed to the URT and LRT are frequently prescribed. The rationale for the application of these techniques is the same as in adults, but they need to be adapted to be transposed to children. The physiotherapist will be able to choose among a wide range of techniques, of which the most adequate will depend not only on the age of the child and the indication, but also on the basis of his preferences or habits, as well as those of the child. Upper airway clearance, including nasal irrigation, is now recommended for acute and chronic rhinosinusitis in children. It is also one of the symptomatic treatments recommended for infants with acute bronchiolitis. For LRT clearance, several indications, such as cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia and neuromuscular disease, are now widely advocated. Conversely, other indications, such as for infants with acute viral bronchiolitis, are highly controversial. Thoughtful application of these techniques is lacking in robust and precise tools to objectively assess the presence of bronchial congestion, and to treat it accordingly. Similarly, no precise and reliable evaluation of the effectiveness of these ACTs is available to date.

SETTING: University-affiliated assisted reproductive technologies practice. PATIENT(S): A 40 year-old man presenting with 12 months' primary infertility, complete sperm immotility, severe morphologic defects, and moderate sinopulmonary disease. INTERVENTION(S): Electron microscopy (EM) of sperm, nasal cilial function studies, open testis biopsy, and sperm extraction for intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Outcome of ICSI treatment using immotile testicular sperm. RESULT(S): EM revealed abnormal connecting pieces, shortened midpieces with attenuated mitochondrial sheaths, poorly developed annulus, abnormal outer dense fibers, and axonemes missing the two central mircotubules. Nasal ciliary beat frequency was subnormal and dyssynchronous. Immotile testicular sperm were selected for ICSI based on physical characteristics and fertilized 12 of 18 eggs. A single day-5 blastocyst achieved a normal pregnancy and delivery of a healthy 3,840-g girl at 38 weeks' gestation. CONCLUSION(S): Nonclassic PCD may present with structurally abnormal completely immotile sperm, with seemingly little prospect of fertility, and moderate respiratory dysfunction supporting the presence of an underlying ciliopathy. Despite testicular sperm also being immotile and showing profound structural defects that would seem to preclude fertilization, more morphologically normal sperm are capable of establishing a normal pregnancy.",

To better delineate clinical pediatric experience and outcomes with M. abscessus complex, we retrospectively gathered 5-year data on M. abscessus complex infection and outcomes in a large, hospital-based pediatric pulmonary center. Patients were selected from the database of the microbiology department at Miller Children's Hospital in Long Beach, CA. Patients had at least one positive pulmonary isolate for M. abscessus complex from February 2006 to May 2011. Treatment modality data were collected and successful therapy of disease was determined as clearance of M. abscessus complex infection after antibiotics proven by culture negative respiratory isolate within at least 12 months of therapy initiation. Two cystic fibrosis patients with M. abscessus complex were identified, one with failed therapy and the other with stable pulmonary status despite persistent isolation. One primary ciliary dyskinesia patient had successful clearance of M. abscessus complex, however is now growing M. avium intracellulare. A patient with no prior medical history was successfully treated with antimycobacterial therapy. Eleven patients with neuromuscular disorders had tracheal aspirates positive for M. abscessus complex. None were treated due to stable lung status and all but two had spontaneous clearance of the mycobacteria. The two remaining persist with sporadic isolation of M. abscessus complex without clinical significance. We concluded that patients with tracheostomy associated M. abscessus complex infections do not appear to require treatment and often have spontaneous resolution. Cystic fibrosis or primary ciliary dyskinesia patients may have clinical disease warranting treatment, but current antimycobacterial therapy has not proven to be completely successful. As M. abscessus complex gains prevalence, standardized guidelines for diagnosis and therapy are needed in the pediatric population. Multicenter cohort analysis is necessary to achieve such guidelines.",

We present the first published series of robotic-assisted pulmonary lobectomy in children with bronchiectasis. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of all consecutive patients who underwent pulmonary lobectomy for severe localized bronchiectasis (2014-2019) via thoracoscopic versus robotic lobectomy. Four 5 mm ports were used for thoracoscopy; a four-arm approach was used for robotic surgery (Da Vinci Surgical Xi System, Intuitive Surgical, California). RESULTS: Eighteen children were operated (robotic resection, n = 7; thoracoscopy, n = 11) with infected congenital pulmonary malformation, primary ciliary dyskinesia, and post-viral infection. There were no conversions to open surgery with robotic surgery, but five with thoracoscopy. Total operative time was significantly longer with robotic versus thoracoscopic surgery (mean 247 +- 50 versus 152 +- 57 min, p = 0.008). There were no significant differences in perioperative complications, length of thoracic drainage, or total length of stay (mean 7 +- 2 versus 8 +- 3 days, respectively). No blood transfusions were required. Two thoracoscopic patients had a type-3 postoperative complication. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric robotic lung lobectomy is feasible and safe, with excellent visualization and bi-manual hand-wrist dissection - useful properties in difficult cases of infectious pathologies. However, instrumentation dimensions limit use in smaller thoraxes.",

                    "abstract": "Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetic disease inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The prevalence of PCD is estimated to be 1 in 20,000 live births. Congenital abnormality of the primary cilia results in situs inversus in 50% of patients. Decreased function of motile cilia causes chronic rhinosinusitis, otitis media with effusion, bronchiectasis and infertility. Cases with situs inversus are considered to show \"Kartagener's syndrome\", and diagnosis is not difficult. However, in cases without situs inversus, the diagnosis is much more troublesome. PCD without situs inversus is thus probably underdiagnosed. Prolonged chronic cough represents an important symptom that is seen in most patients. The diagnosis of PCD requires the presence of the characteristic clinical phenotypes and either: (1) specific ciliary ultrastructural defects identified by transmission electron microscopy in biopsy samples of respiratory epithelium; or (2) identification of mutation in one of the genes known to be associated with PCD. Nasal nitric oxide concentration is extremely low in PCD, and this could be useful for screening of the disease. At present, no fundamental therapies are available for PCD. Diagnosis in the early stages is important to prevent progression of bronchiectasis and deterioration of lung function by guidance for daily life, immunization, cessation of smoking and prompt therapy at the time of respiratory tract infection. Since PCD is inherited in an autosomal-recessive manner, genetic counseling is necessary after definite diagnosis. ",

                    "abstract": "RESEARCH QUESTION: Male infertility is a widespread symptom in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). PCD-related male infertility is often caused by asthenozoospermia, with barely normal sperm morphology. Multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF) are a major cause of asthenozoospermia, characterized by various malformed morphologies of sperm flagella. To date, a limited number of genes have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of both PCD and MMAF. What other genes associated with both PCD and MMAF are waiting to be discovered? DESIGN: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed to identify the pathogenic mutation associated with MMAF in a PCD patient. Peripheral venous blood and semen samples were collected from the PCD patient. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), immunofluorescence staining and western blotting were conducted to confirm the pathogenicity of the identified mutation. RESULTS: A novel homozygous mutation in CCDC39, c.983 T>C (p. Leu328Pro), was identified in two PCD-affected siblings of a consanguineous family showing a typical PCD phenotype, while the proband was infertile, which is associated with characterized MMAF. Furthermore, TEM revealed the abnormal ultrastructure of the patient's sperm flagella. Moreover, immunofluorescence staining revealed that CCDC39 was almost undetectable in the spermatozoa, which was further confirmed by western blotting. The outcome of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in the patient with the CCDC39 mutation was also favourable. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that a novel loss-of-function mutation of CCDC39 is involved in the pathogenesis of PCD and MMAF and initially reported that ICSI treatment has a good outcome. Therefore, the novel variant of CCDC39 contributes to the genetic diagnosis, counselling and treatment of male infertility in PCD patients with MMAF phenotype.",

Here, with a comprehensive literature review, we report a couple with an infertility history of 9 years and three unsuccessful IVF treatments, where male partner has Kartagener's Syndrome, a subtype of PCD, displaying recurrent respiratory infections, dextrocardia and total asthenozoospermia. His diagnosis was verified with transmission electron microscopy and genetic mutation screening, revealing total absence of dynein arms in sperm tails and homozygous mutation in the ZMYND10, heterozygous mutations in the ARMC4 and DNAH5 genes. Laser assisted viability assay (LAVA) was performed by shooting the sperm tails during sperm retrieval for microinjection, following detection of pentoxifylline resistant immotile sperm. Live births of healthy triplets, one boy and two monozygotic girls, was achieved after double blastocyst transfer.",

                    "abstract": "TRIAL DESIGN: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetical disease that inherited in an autosomal-recessive way. Its clinical manifestations (such as male infertility) are mainly caused by defects of motion-related cilia that encoded by mutated genes. Although some mutation has been verified, a number of mutations of PCD remain elusive. The main purpose of this study is to identify mutant genes in a Chinese family with PCD, and to verify the safety and effectiveness of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) of infertility caused by PCD. METHODS: Imaging examination was used to exclude pulmonary inflammation and visceral translocation. Semen analysis was used to assess the quality of the proband's sperm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was conducted to assess the ultrastructure of flagella and cilia. Targeted next generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing and qPCR (real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction detecting system) were applied to identified mutation of Chinese Family suspected of having PCD. Viable sperm were selected by hypo-osmotic swelling test (HOST) for ICSI. RESULTS: We report 2 novel mutations in CCDC40 gene (c.1259delA and EX17_20 deletion) resulted in immobility of sperm and infertility of the proband. These mutations were confirmed in the proband's sister (heterozygous) and his parents (recessive carrier) by Sanger sequencing and qPCR. All the spermatozoa from the proband were immotile. Ultrastructural defects were found in flagella and cilia of proband and his sister. Viable sperms were selected by HOST for ICSI and fertilized 9 of 21 eggs. Two frozen embryos were transplanted and a healthy 3500 g boy was delivered at 40 + 4 weeks' gestation. And then, we summarized the genes related to PCD and the mutant sites of CCDC40 gene. CONCLUSION: We reported 2 novel mutants in CCDC40 gene (c.1259delA and EX17_20 deletion), which could be candidates for genetic diagnosis in PCD patients. The combination of targeted next generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing may be a useful tool to diagnose PCD. ICSI is a considerable method in treatment of infertility caused by PCD.",

                    "abstract": "Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetic disease associated with defective ciliary structure and function. Chronic oto-sino-pulmonary infection is the most common clinical presentation. Patients should be monitored in centres with expertise in PCD. Regular respiratory monitoring consists of lung function tests, adapted to the patient's age, and cough swab or sputum cultures. Chest X-rays are insensitive but the use of high-resolution computed tomography should be considered carefully to avoid excessive radiation. Treatment of the chronic suppuration of the lower airways relies on antibiotics to which the isolated bacteria are sensitive, together with respiratory physiotherapy and exercise to clear excessive bronchial secretions. Bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory agents have no proven benefit and should be prescribed, if at all, on an individual basis. Treatment of the lower airways should always be in conjunction with that of the upper airways. Importantly in PCD, respiratory disease may be controlled with the use of early, adequate and aggressive management.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This review focuses on evaluating literature for the use of inhaled mucolytics (hypertonic saline, mannitol, and dornase alfa), inhaled antibiotics (tobramycin, aztreonam, colistin, and amikacin), and inhaled corticosteroids in pediatric noncystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. DATA SOURCES: A literature search via PubMed was conducted using the search terms \"non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis,\" \"primary ciliary dyskinesia,\" and \"bronchiectasis\" in combination with each inhaled agent of interest. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Studies were included if they were specific to patients with a clinical diagnosis of noncystic fibrosis bronchiectasis published from 1998 to July 2024. DATA SYNTHESIS: Several inhaled medications can be considered as maintenance therapies for pediatric patients with noncystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. Hypertonic saline could be considered for its potential airway clearance benefits and low risk of causing harm. Inhaled antipseudomonal antibiotics should be considered in patients who are colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Inhaled corticosteroid therapy should be reserved for patients with concomitant asthma. Dornase alfa has shown worse outcomes in adults with noncystic fibrosis bronchiectasis and should be used with caution. Risks and benefits should be carefully considered when evaluating these therapies for use in noncystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, and patient-specific treatment regimens should be developed. RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE: Chronic management of pediatric noncystic fibrosis bronchiectasis remains challenging due to paucity of applicable literature. Risks and benefits of different agents are discussed in this article with recommendations for application to clinical practice based on studies performed in both adult and pediatric patients with noncystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. CONCLUSION: Several inhaled medications could be considered as maintenance therapies for pediatric patients with noncystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, with more robust evidence to support use of inhaled antipseudomonal antibiotics and hypertonic saline compared with other available agents.

DATA SOURCES: A literature search via PubMed was conducted using the search terms \"non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis,\" \"primary ciliary dyskinesia,\" and \"bronchiectasis\" in combination with each inhaled agent of interest. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Studies were included if they were specific to patients with a clinical diagnosis of noncystic fibrosis bronchiectasis published from 1998 to July 2024. DATA SYNTHESIS: Several inhaled medications can be considered as maintenance therapies for pediatric patients with noncystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. Hypertonic saline could be considered for its potential airway clearance benefits and low risk of causing harm. Inhaled antipseudomonal antibiotics should be considered in patients who are colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Inhaled corticosteroid therapy should be reserved for patients with concomitant asthma. Dornase alfa has shown worse outcomes in adults with noncystic fibrosis bronchiectasis and should be used with caution. Risks and benefits should be carefully considered when evaluating these therapies for use in noncystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, and patient-specific treatment regimens should be developed. RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE: Chronic management of pediatric noncystic fibrosis bronchiectasis remains challenging due to paucity of applicable literature. Risks and benefits of different agents are discussed in this article with recommendations for application to clinical practice based on studies performed in both adult and pediatric patients with noncystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. CONCLUSION: Several inhaled medications could be considered as maintenance therapies for pediatric patients with noncystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, with more robust evidence to support use of inhaled antipseudomonal antibiotics and hypertonic saline compared with other available agents.

This study aimed to compare pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength, exercise capacity, physical fitness, and activities of daily living (ADLs) retrospectively between patients with PCD and healthy controls. METHODS: Data from 20 patients with PCD and 20 matched, healthy counterparts recorded between July 2015 and January 2017 were analyzed. The data evaluated and recorded included pulmonary function using a portable spirometer, respiratory muscle strength (using a mouth pressure device, exercise capacity using the incremental shuttle walk test,), physical fitness (using the Munich Fitness Test), and ADLs (using the Glittre ADL test). RESULTS: Pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength, incremental shuttle walk test scores (all parameters), and total Munich Fitness Test scores were lower in the PCD group relative to controls (P < 0.05). The duration to complete the Glittre ADL test was higher in PCD patients than in healthy subjects (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength, exercise capacity, physical fitness, and ADL were affected by PCD. Thus, pulmonary rehabilitation regimens should be tailored according to these impacts.",

This study aimed to compare pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength, exercise capacity, physical fitness, and activities of daily living (ADLs) retrospectively between patients with PCD and healthy controls. METHODS: Data from 20 patients with PCD and 20 matched, healthy counterparts recorded between July 2015 and January 2017 were analyzed. The data evaluated and recorded included pulmonary function using a portable spirometer, respiratory muscle strength (using a mouth pressure device, exercise capacity using the incremental shuttle walk test,), physical fitness (using the Munich Fitness Test), and ADLs (using the Glittre ADL test). RESULTS: Pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength, incremental shuttle walk test scores (all parameters), and total Munich Fitness Test scores were lower in the PCD group relative to controls (P < 0.05). The duration to complete the Glittre ADL test was higher in PCD patients than in healthy subjects (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength, exercise capacity, physical fitness, and ADL were affected by PCD.

PCD-related male infertility is often caused by asthenozoospermia, with barely normal sperm morphology. Multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF) are a major cause of asthenozoospermia, characterized by various malformed morphologies of sperm flagella. To date, a limited number of genes have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of both PCD and MMAF. What other genes associated with both PCD and MMAF are waiting to be discovered? DESIGN: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed to identify the pathogenic mutation associated with MMAF in a PCD patient. Peripheral venous blood and semen samples were collected from the PCD patient. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), immunofluorescence staining and western blotting were conducted to confirm the pathogenicity of the identified mutation. RESULTS: A novel homozygous mutation in CCDC39, c.983 T>C (p. Leu328Pro), was identified in two PCD-affected siblings of a consanguineous family showing a typical PCD phenotype, while the proband was infertile, which is associated with characterized MMAF. Furthermore, TEM revealed the abnormal ultrastructure of the patient's sperm flagella. Moreover, immunofluorescence staining revealed that CCDC39 was almost undetectable in the spermatozoa, which was further confirmed by western blotting. The outcome of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in the patient with the CCDC39 mutation was also favourable. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that a novel loss-of-function mutation of CCDC39 is involved in the pathogenesis of PCD and MMAF and initially reported that ICSI treatment has a good outcome. Therefore, the novel variant of CCDC39 contributes to the genetic diagnosis, counselling and treatment of male infertility in PCD patients with MMAF phenotype.",

It causes chronic cough, copious production of sputum (often purulent), and recurrent infections, and may cause airway obstruction bearing some similarities with that seen in COPD. It may complicate respiratory conditions such as asthma or COPD. It can be associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia, primary immunodeficiencies, certain systemic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis, and foreign body inhalation. Bronchiectasis can be due to cystic fibrosis but this is excluded from this review. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments in people with non-cystic fibrosis (non-CF) bronchiectasis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to January 2014 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. RESULTS: We found 23 studies that met our inclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: airway clearance techniques, corticosteroids (inhaled), exercise or physical training, hyperosmolar agents (inhaled), mucolytics, prolonged-use antibiotics, and surgery.",

Physiotherapy, in the form of airway clearance techniques and exercise is recommended to patients with PCD to facilitate sputum clearance. As children diagnosed with PCD develop into adults, understanding their experiences of growing up with this long-term condition and undertaking physiotherapy may help to provide insight to clinicians. No previous research has been published which explores the lived experiences of children and young people with PCD. The prevalence of PCD in Bradford in the North of the UK is unusually high, signifying the importance of understanding the experiences of this patient population. This qualitative study used Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis to allow the researcher, as a physiotherapist, to investigate the lived experiences of five paediatric patients with PCD. While patients' experiences are all unique, three themes emerged across the analysis of the interviews: (1) the experiences of day to day life with the symptoms and treatment burden of PCD; (2) participants' awareness of their own symptoms and knowledge of PCD; and (3) the development of mastery skills and devolution of management from the family to the growing child. The results from this study suggested that facilitation of disease acceptance, strategies to increase patient empowerment, the use of patient-centred communication and understanding the contextualisation of patients' experiences may all help to guide clinical practice.",

The most common underlying conditions leading to bronchiectasis include infections, immunodeficiency, aspiration and primary ciliary dyskinesia. Treatment centres on airway clearance with aggressive antibiotic regimens and physiotherapy; more specific approaches are available for some of the underlying conditions. A high index of suspicion that a child may have underlying bronchiectasis must be maintained in the presence of prolonged or recurrent \"wet/productive\" cough. The classic definition of bronchiectasis is of irreversible bronchial dilatation; however, at the milder end of the spectrum it appears that radiographic changes may be reversible. Untreated, in its severest form bronchiectasis can progress to end stage pulmonary failure in adult life.

These guidelines have not been studied in a clinical setting. We present a case series describing the PCD diagnostic process at our pediatric PCD center. METHODS: Diagnostic data from 131 patients undergoing PCD consultation were reviewed. RESULTS: In all participants >= 5 years old and who completed nNO using resistor methodology, the first diagnostic test performed was nNO in 77% (73/95), genetic testing in 14% (13/95), and TEM in <1% (9/95). nNO was the only diagnostic test performed in 75% (55/73) of participants who completed nNO first. Seventy-five percent (55/73) had a single above the cutoff nNO value and PCD was determined to be unlikely in 91% (50/55) without performing additional confirmatory testing. Eleven percent (8/73) had multiple below the cutoff nNO values, with 38% (3/8) being diagnosed with PCD by confirmatory testing and 50% (4/8) with negative confirmatory testing, but being managed as PCD. The genetic testing positivity rate was 50% in participants who completed nNO first and 8% when genetic testing was completed first. CONCLUSION: nNO is useful in three situations: an initial above the cutoff nNO value makes PCD unlikely and prevents additional confirmatory testing, repetitively below the cutoff nNO values without positive confirmatory testing suggests a probable PCD diagnosis and the yield of genetic testing is higher when nNO is performed first.",

To eliminate these secretions, airway clearance techniques (ACT) directed to the URT and LRT are frequently prescribed. The rationale for the application of these techniques is the same as in adults, but they need to be adapted to be transposed to children. The physiotherapist will be able to choose among a wide range of techniques, of which the most adequate will depend not only on the age of the child and the indication, but also on the basis of his preferences or habits, as well as those of the child. Upper airway clearance, including nasal irrigation, is now recommended for acute and chronic rhinosinusitis in children. It is also one of the symptomatic treatments recommended for infants with acute bronchiolitis. For LRT clearance, several indications, such as cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia and neuromuscular disease, are now widely advocated. Conversely, other indications, such as for infants with acute viral bronchiolitis, are highly controversial. Thoughtful application of these techniques is lacking in robust and precise tools to objectively assess the presence of bronchial congestion, and to treat it accordingly. Similarly, no precise and reliable evaluation of the effectiveness of these ACTs is available to date. This review is designed to explore the ACTs used by physiotherapists, to provide an overview of their current indications, and to consider complementary approaches.",

From the sinuses, Pseudomonas aeruginosa can infect the lungs. METHODS: We studied the effect of endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) on symptoms of CRS and lower airway infections in PCD patients in a prospective single-arm intervention study of ESS with adjuvant therapy using nasal irrigation with saline, topical nasal steroids, and 2 weeks of systemic antibiotics. Additional treatment with local colistin for 6 months was instigated when P. aeruginosa was cultured at ESS. RESULTS: Twenty-four PCD patients underwent ESS to search for an infectious focus (n = 10), due to severe symptoms of CRS (n = 8), or both (n = 6). Bacteria were cultured from sinus samples in 21 patients (88%), and simultaneous sinus and lung colonization with identical pathogens were observed in 13 patients (62%). Four patients with preoperative P. aeruginosa lung colonization (25%) had no regrowth during follow-up; 2 of these had P. aeruginosa sinusitis. Sinonasal symptoms were improved 12 months after ESS and we observed a trend toward better lung function after ESS. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated an improvement in CRS-related symptoms after ESS and adjuvant therapy. In selected PCD patients, the suggested regimen may postpone chronic lung infection with P. aeruginosa and stabilize lung function.",

Recent studies have revealed an association among heterotaxy, congenital heart disease, and primary ciliary dyskinesia. We undertook a retrospective review of patients undergoing cardiac surgery at Children's National Medical Center between 2004 and 2008 to explore the hypothesis that there is increased mortality and respiratory complications in heterotaxy patients. METHODS: Retrospective review was performed on postsurgical outcomes of 87 patients with heterotaxy and congenital heart disease exhibiting the full spectrum of situs abnormalities associated with heterotaxy. As controls patients, 634 cardiac surgical patients with congenital heart disease, but without laterality defects, were selected, and surgical complexities were similar with a median Risk Adjustment in Congenital Heart Surgery-1 score of 3.0 for both groups. RESULTS: We found the mean length of postoperative hospital stay (17 vs 11 days) and mechanical ventilation (11 vs 4 days) were significantly increased in the heterotaxy patients. Also elevated were rates of tracheostomies (6.9% vs 1.6%; odds ratio, 4.6), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support (12.6% vs 4.9%: odds ratio, 2.8), prolonged ventilatory courses (23% vs 12.3%; odds ratio, 2.1) and postsurgical deaths (16.1% vs 4.7%; odds ratio, 3.9). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show heterotaxy patients had more postsurgical events with increased postsurgical mortality and risk for respiratory complications as compared to control patients with similar Risk Adjustment in Congenital Heart Surgery-1 surgical complexity scores. We speculate that increased respiratory complications maybe due to ciliary dysfunction. Further studies are needed to explore the basis for the increased surgical risks for heterotaxy patients undergoing cardiac surgery.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Currently, there is a lack of data concerning the organization and characteristics of Italian pediatric physiotherapy units for the treatment of patients with chronic lung diseases, especially those with rare conditions such as Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) and non-Cystic Fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB). METHODS: A national descriptive study based on a survey questionnaire was conducted. The questionnaire consisted of three different sections: distribution and characteristics of the centres, services provided by respiratory therapists, physiotherapists' perception of the unit. The survey was distributed to all healthcare providers via an online platform, and a descriptive data analysis was performed. RESULTS: The survey had a response rate of 97.5% with twenty-nine responses collected. The centers are heterogeneously distributed: thirteen in the northern regions, eight in the central regions and eight in the southern regions. Of the 29 centers with a physiotherapy unit, 19 had a specialized respiratory therapy unit. Respiratory therapy was provided in different care settings: regular wards (28/29 centers, 97%), outpatient service (29/29 centers, 100%), and intensive or semi-intensive care units (17/29 centers, 59%). The interventions provided by respiratory therapists involved more than just airway clearance (29/29). More specific interventions, such as pulmonary function tests (23/29), functional tests (27/29), educational training (26/29), management of workout exercise programs (25/29) and interventions developed in collaboration with physicians such as non-invasive ventilation (NIV) (23/29) and oxygen titration (21/29) are performed. It is interesting to note that therapists are also involved in various activities, such as telemedicine, physiotherapists' research projects, and supporting alongside physicians, for the prescription at home of medical devices. Perception of the unit was also evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: The involved centers are heterogeneous in terms of distribution and treatments offered. The role of respiratory physiotherapists still seems to be fragmented. This first descriptive analysis of the physiotherapy units and the main differences between centers opens queries on the clinical approaches used for pediatric patients with PCD in terms of respiratory physiotherapy. However,in response to evolving treatment needs, a more specialized and standardized approach to patient care is required.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Enhancement of mucociliary clearance by pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is advocated in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Our primary aim was to compare the efficacy and safety of postural drainage, percussion and vibration [conventional PR (CPR)], and high frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) by studying change in pulmonary function. Our secondary aim was to evaluate patient preferences regarding the two methods. METHODS: This was a controlled randomized crossover study. PCD patients between the ages of 7 and 18 years were assigned to two groups, first group performed airway clearance with CPR at hospital for 5 days and after a 2-day washout period HFCWO was applied to the same group at home. HFCWO was applied first to the other group and then these patients were hospitalized for CPR. The primary outcome measure of the study was pulmonary function test (PFT). The secondary outcomes were pulse arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2 ) and the perceived efficiency and comfort level. RESULTS: PFT values of patients increased significantly after both PR methods (before/after): CPR: FVC: 77.0 +- 14.1/81.8 +- 13.0 (P = 0.002); FEV1 : 72.9 +- 14.8/78.7 +- 13.5 (P = 0.001); PEF: 73.8 +- 14.5/82.5 +- 14.5 (P = 0.001); FEF25-75 : 68.6 +- 27.6/74.9 +- 29.3 (P = 0.007). HFCWO FVC: 75.1 +- 15.3/80.3 +- 13.9 (P = 0.002); FEV1 : 71.4 +- 16/77.4 +- 14.6 (P = 0.001); PEF: 70.9 +- 18.0/78.3 +- 17.7 (P = 0.002); FEF25-75 : 70.5 +- 23.4/76.4 +- 25.6 (P = 0.006). There were no significant differences in % predicted FVC, FEV1 , PEF, and FEF25-75 increased values with CPR and HFCWO. HFCWO was found more comfortable (P = 0.04). Two PR methods were found efficient and no desaturation occurred during PR. CONCLUSIONS: PFTs were significantly increased after both PR methods. There were no differences in PFTs and SpO2 between the CPR and HFCWO groups. Both PR methods were found efficient. HFCWO was found more comfortable. HFCWO may be an option in patients with chronic pulmonary disease and low adherence to PR.",

The aims of this study were to describe the health of children seen in this Service and compare lung function to children with cystic fibrosis (CF). DESIGN: Multi-centre service evaluation of the English National Management PCD Service. SETTING: Four nationally commissioned PCD centres in England. PATIENTS: 333 children with PCD reviewed in the Service in 2015; lung function data were also compared with 2970 children with CF. RESULTS: Median age at diagnosis for PCD was 2.6 years, significantly lower in children with situs inversus (1.0 vs 6.0 years, p<0.001). Compared with national data from the CF Registry, mean (SD) %predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was 76.8% in PCD (n=240) and 85.0% in CF, and FEV1 was lower in children with PCD up to the age of 15 years. Approximately half of children had some hearing impairment, with 26% requiring hearing aids. Children with a lower body mass index (BMI) had lower FEV1 (p<0.001). One-third of children had positive respiratory cultures at review, 54% of these grew Haemophilus influenzae. CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence that children with PCD in England have worse lung function than those with CF. Nutritional status should be considered in PCD management, as those with a lower BMI have significantly lower FEV1. Hearing impairment is common but seems to improve with age. Well-designed and powered randomised controlled trials on management of PCD are needed to inform best clinical practice.",

Lung disease is a hallmark of PCD, given the essential role of cilia in airway surface defense. Diagnosis of PCD is complicated due to its reliance on complex tests that are not utilized by every clinic and also its phenotypic overlap with several other respiratory diseases. Nonetheless, PCD is increasingly being recognized as more common than once thought. The disease is genetically complex, with several genes reported to be associated with PCD. There is no cure for PCD, but gene therapy remains a promising therapeutic strategy. In this review we provide an overview of the clinical symptoms, diagnosis, genetics, and current treatment regimens for PCD. We also describe PCD model systems and discuss the therapeutic potential of different gene therapeutics for targeting the intended cellular target, the ciliated cells of the airway.",

Gastrointestinal complications are rare, especially during childhood. In adults, only two cases of peptic ulcer have been reported in neurofibromatosis, both due to Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) may be primary or secondary in nature and it may be life threatening in the acute phase due to the risk of perforation. A case of recurrent gastrointestinal hemorrhage in a child with systemic neurofibromatosis and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is presented. The upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed the presence of multiple gastric ulcers. The ulcers scarred after the long-term administration of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), but recurred after the suspension. Laboratory and imaging studies excluded Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and other known causes of PUD, suggesting a potential role of neurofibromatosis itself and primary ciliary dyskinesia in developing of recurrent PUD. As early diagnosis of PUD is vital for patient survival, this case report highlights the possible association of neurofibromatosis and PCD with this condition, responsive to PPI therapy and the potential need of gastric protection before complications arise.",

We aimed to evaluate the feasibility and the effect of the active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT) versus oscillating positive expiratory pressure therapy (OPEP) in improving lung function and functional exercise capacity among children with PCD in Palestine. Methods: 32 PCD children (6-18 years) were included in a 12-week home-based feasibility study. They were assigned randomly into two groups: ACBT and OPEP. Data collection included spirometry measurements, and the six-minute walk test (6MWT). Results: After 12 weeks of regular airway clearance techniques (ACT), the FEV1, MEF25-75%, and the 6MWT demonstrated statistically significant differences (p = .02, p = .04, and p = .05 respectively) between the two groups, in favor of the OPEP group with the effect size of Cohen's d (0.86, 0.76, and 0.71) respectively. However, there was no significant difference (p > .05) between the two groups in FVC and FEV1/FVC. Additionally, only in the OPEP group, significant differences were recorded between pre and post-tests for FEV1 and 6MWT (p < .05). Conclusion: The randomized study design comparing ACBT and OPEP was feasible and acceptable to patients. OPEP demonstrates potential for managing respiratory health; however, treatments should be individualized to address each patient's specific needs. Further research with larger cohorts is needed to assess the effectiveness of both methods.",

Infertility is a common condition in women presenting with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) characterized by hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. The purpose of this study was to explore the clinical significance of genetic diagnostics in several Chinese primary infertile women with atypical POI. Methods: Four atypical POI patients and 100 healthy subjects were recruited, genetic pathogenicityc factors were investigated by whole exome sequencing (WES). Results: WES revealed a homozygous deletion mutation in the DNAH1 gene (NM_015512.5; c.11726_11727delCT, p.Pro3909Argfs*33) in one of the four POI patients. The 31-year-old affected woman presented with a normal menstrual cycle and elevated plasma levels of FSH, around the postmenopausal range, but had a normal antral follicle count and normal anti-Mullerian hormone levels. The patient, after two failed ovulation cycles, became pregnant in the third IVF cycle and delivered a healthy girl at term. Conclusions: The homozygous deletion mutation in the DNAH1 gene suggested that the patient might have a cilia movement disorder of the fallopian tubes, which is a known infertility factor. Moreover, the significantly elevated plasma level of FSH in this patient is likely one of the most important factors leading to her decreased fertility.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Patients with heterotaxy and complex congenital heart disease underwent cardiac surgery with high mortality and morbidity. Recent studies have revealed an association among heterotaxy, congenital heart disease, and primary ciliary dyskinesia. We undertook a retrospective review of patients undergoing cardiac surgery at Children's National Medical Center between 2004 and 2008 to explore the hypothesis that there is increased mortality and respiratory complications in heterotaxy patients. METHODS: Retrospective review was performed on postsurgical outcomes of 87 patients with heterotaxy and congenital heart disease exhibiting the full spectrum of situs abnormalities associated with heterotaxy. As controls patients, 634 cardiac surgical patients with congenital heart disease, but without laterality defects, were selected, and surgical complexities were similar with a median Risk Adjustment in Congenital Heart Surgery-1 score of 3.0 for both groups. RESULTS: We found the mean length of postoperative hospital stay (17 vs 11 days) and mechanical ventilation (11 vs 4 days) were significantly increased in the heterotaxy patients. Also elevated were rates of tracheostomies (6.9% vs 1.6%; odds ratio, 4.6), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support (12.6% vs 4.9%: odds ratio, 2.8), prolonged ventilatory courses (23% vs 12.3%; odds ratio, 2.1) and postsurgical deaths (16.1% vs 4.7%; odds ratio, 3.9). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show heterotaxy patients had more postsurgical events with increased postsurgical mortality and risk for respiratory complications as compared to control patients with similar Risk Adjustment in Congenital Heart Surgery-1 surgical complexity scores. We speculate that increased respiratory complications maybe due to ciliary dysfunction. Further studies are needed to explore the basis for the increased surgical risks for heterotaxy patients undergoing cardiac surgery.",
