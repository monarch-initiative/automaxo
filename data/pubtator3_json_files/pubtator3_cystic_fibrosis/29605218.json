Functional capacity is an important diagnostic tool, because it reflects the cardiorespiratory status, quality of life and prognosis. This systematic review aims to assess the reproducibility and validity of the six minute walk test (6MWT) to reflect the functional capacity of children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis, and also the correlation between 6MWT and lung function. Searches for articles were performed in eight databases using MeSH/DeCS keywords. A total of 695 articles were found and, after verifying all eligibility criteria, six articles were included for analysis and scoring regarding the methodological quality according to the QUADAS scale (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies). All articles had good methodology (QUADAS between 9 and 11 points). The 6MWT is not correlated with lung function. There is a strong indication that the 6MWT is a reproducible test to assess the functional capacity of children and adolescents with CF. The validity assessment could not be reached because the studies included in this systematic review did not use adequate statistical tools to carry out such an evaluation.",
