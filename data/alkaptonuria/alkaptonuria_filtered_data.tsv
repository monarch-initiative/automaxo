16371803	Ochronotic arthropathy: disappearance of alkaptonuria after liver transplantation for hepatitis B-related cirrhosis.	The deficiency of homogentisic acid oxidase, an enzyme that is mainly found in hepatocytes, is associated with alkaptonuria and ochronosis. We report a patient with clinical and radiologic findings of ochronotic arthropathy in whom alkaptonuria disappeared and the progressive course of the disease stopped after liver transplantation for hepatitis B-related cirrhosis.
12359141	Exacerbation of the ochronosis of alkaptonuria due to renal insufficiency and improvement after renal transplantation.	In alkaptonuria, homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase deficiency causes tissue accumulation of homogentisic acid (HGA), followed by signs and symptoms of ochronosis. These include massive urinary excretion of HGA, arthritis and joint destruction, pigmentation of cartilage and connective tissue, and cardiac valve deterioration. We describe a 46-year-old man with alkaptonuria and diabetic renal failure whose plasma HGA concentration was twice that of any other alkaptonuria patient, and whose ochronosis progressed much more rapidly than that of his two alkaptonuric siblings. After renal transplantation, the plasma HGA normalized, and the daily urinary excretion of HGA decreased by 2-3g. This case illustrates the critical role of renal tubular secretion in eliminating HGA from the body, and suggests that renal transplantation in a uremic patient not only restores HGA excretion, but may also provide homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase activity for the metabolism of HGA.

38820945	Disc-coloration of an ochronotic cervical intervertebral disc in a patient with alkaptonuria: Case report and review of the literature.	"OBJECTIVES: Alkaptonuria is a rare inborn disorder of phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolism. It is characterized by an accumulation of homogentisic acid and its oxidation products, possibly resulting into connective tissue damaging. ""Ochronosis"" is a main feature, which is characterized by tissue discoloration and even alkaptonuric arthropathy. Cervical spine involvement is exceptional and there is a paucity of reports on surgical interventions in these patients. We explored the literature concerning cervical spine involvement in patients with alkaptonuria. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a review of the literature, in which patients with alkaptonuric degenerative changes of the cervical spine were examined. Articles were obtained from MEDLINE. Search terms included: ""cervical"", ""alkaptonuria"", ""alkaptonuric changes"" and ""black disc"". Additional studies were identified by checking reference lists. Furthermore, we present the case of a 46 year old patient with critical cervical spinal canal stenosis who underwent C6-C7 anterior cervical microdiscectomy and interbody fusion, in order to prevent myelopathic changes. CARE statement guidelines were followed. RESULTS: Peroperatively, we did not encounter any macroscopic abnormalities of the skin, muscles or ligaments. A black discoloration of the nucleus pulposus was observed. Peroperative and postoperative course was uneventful. CONCLUSION: Alkaptonuric degenerative abnormalities most commonly involve the lumbar spine, although the cervical spine can be affected in rare cases. Most frequently, the diagnosis of alkaptonuria can be made based on the clinical phenotype many years before symptoms secondary to ochronotic arthropathy develop. A retrospective diagnosis based on peroperative black discoloration of spinal structures has been described. A black discoloration of the intervertebral disc should encourage the neurosurgeon to further explore the possibility of alkaptonuria, even in the absence of a clear phenotype. Surgical results are mostly satisfactory. Further studies are required in order to better understand this pathology and its postoperative course."
32822600	Efficacy and safety of once-daily nitisinone for patients with alkaptonuria (SONIA 2): an international, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Alkaptonuria is a rare, genetic, multisystem disease characterised by the accumulation of homogentisic acid (HGA). No HGA-lowering therapy has been approved to date. The aim of SONIA 2 was to investigate the efficacy and safety of once-daily nitisinone for reducing HGA excretion in patients with alkaptonuria and to evaluate whether nitisinone has a clinical benefit. METHODS: SONIA 2 was a 4-year, open-label, evaluator-blind, randomised, no treatment controlled, parallel-group study done at three sites in the UK, France, and Slovakia. Patients aged 25 years or older with confirmed alkaptonuria and any clinical disease manifestations were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either oral nitisinone 10 mg daily or no treatment. Patients could not be masked to treatment due to colour changes in the urine, but the study was evaluator-blinded as far as possible. The primary endpoint was daily urinary HGA excretion (u-HGA24) after 12 months. Clinical evaluation Alkaptonuria Severity Score Index (cAKUSSI) score was assessed at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months. Efficacy variables were analysed in all randomly assigned patients with a valid u-HGA24 measurement at baseline. Safety variables were analysed in all randomly assigned patients. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01916382). FINDINGS: Between May 7, 2014, and Feb 16, 2015, 139 patients were screened, of whom 138 were included in the study, with 69 patients randomly assigned to each group. 55 patients in the nitisinone group and 53 in the control group completed the study. u-HGA24 at 12 months was significantly decreased by 99 7% in the nitisinone group compared with the control group (adjusted geometric mean ratio of nitisinone/control 0 003 [95% CI 0 003 to 0 004], p<0 0001). At 48 months, the increase in cAKUSSI score from baseline was significantly lower in the nitisinone group compared with the control group (adjusted mean difference -8 6 points [-16 0 to -1 2], p=0 023). 400 adverse events occurred in 59 (86%) patients in the nitisinone group and 284 events occurred in 57 (83%) patients in the control group. No treatment-related deaths occurred. INTERPRETATION: Nitisinone 10 mg daily was well tolerated and effective in reducing urinary excretion of HGA. Nitisinone decreased ochronosis and improved clinical signs, indicating a slower disease progression. FUNDING: European Commission Seventh Framework Programme.
25475116	Suitability Of Nitisinone In Alkaptonuria 1 (SONIA 1): an international, multicentre, randomised, open-label, no-treatment controlled, parallel-group, dose-response study to investigate the effect of once daily nitisinone on 24-h urinary homogentisic acid excretion in patients with alkaptonuria after 4 weeks of treatment.	BACKGROUND: Alkaptonuria (AKU) is a serious genetic disease characterised by premature spondyloarthropathy. Homogentisate-lowering therapy is being investigated for AKU. Nitisinone decreases homogentisic acid (HGA) in AKU but the dose-response relationship has not been previously studied. METHODS: Suitability Of Nitisinone In Alkaptonuria 1 (SONIA 1) was an international, multicentre, randomised, open-label, no-treatment controlled, parallel-group, dose-response study. The primary objective was to investigate the effect of different doses of nitisinone once daily on 24-h urinary HGA excretion (u-HGA24) in patients with AKU after 4 weeks of treatment. Forty patients were randomised into five groups of eight patients each, with groups receiving no treatment or 1 mg, 2 mg, 4 mg and 8 mg of nitisinone. FINDINGS: A clear dose-response relationship was observed between nitisinone and the urinary excretion of HGA. At 4 weeks, the adjusted geometric mean u-HGA24 was 31.53 mmol, 3.26 mmol, 1.44 mmol, 0.57 mmol and 0.15 mmol for the no treatment or 1 mg, 2 mg, 4 mg and 8 mg doses, respectively. For the most efficacious dose, 8 mg daily, this corresponds to a mean reduction of u-HGA24 of 98.8% compared with baseline. An increase in tyrosine levels was seen at all doses but the dose-response relationship was less clear than the effect on HGA. Despite tyrosinaemia, there were no safety concerns and no serious adverse events were reported over the 4 weeks of nitisinone therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In this study in patients with AKU, nitisinone therapy decreased urinary HGA excretion to low levels in a dose-dependent manner and was well tolerated within the studied dose range.

33530326	Towards a Precision Medicine Approach Based on Machine Learning for Tailoring Medical Treatment in Alkaptonuria.	ApreciseKUre is a multi-purpose digital platform facilitating data collection, integration and analysis for patients affected by Alkaptonuria (AKU), an ultra-rare autosomal recessive genetic disease. It includes genetic, biochemical, histopathological, clinical, therapeutic resources and quality of life scores that can be shared among registered researchers and clinicians in order to create a Precision Medicine Ecosystem (PME). The combination of machine learning application to analyse and re-interpret data available in the ApreciseKUre shows the potential direct benefits to achieve patient stratification and the consequent tailoring of care and treatments to a specific subgroup of patients. In this study, we have developed a tool able to investigate the most suitable treatment for AKU patients in accordance with their Quality of Life scores, which indicates changes in health status before/after the assumption of a specific class of drugs. This fact highlights the necessity of development of patient databases for rare diseases, like ApreciseKUre. We believe this is not limited to the study of AKU, but it represents a proof of principle study that could be applied to other rare diseases, allowing data management, analysis, and interpretation.
3734183	Exogenous ochronosis resulting from quinine injections.	An 86-year-old woman presented with bluish black macules on each buttock. Skin biopsy revealed ochronotic pigment in the dermis. On the basis of negative results of a urine test for alkaptonuria and a history of having received quinine injections for malaria 70 years ago, the patient was diagnosed as having localized exogenous ochronosis resulting from quinine injections. Exogenous ochronosis has been reported following the topical use of phenol in leg ulcers, the topical use of hydroquinone bleaching creams in black persons, and the oral administration of antimalarials for malaria and connective tissue diseases, but we could find no reports in the literature of exogenous ochronosis following intramuscular injections of antimalarials.
12546396	Alkaptonuria and lumbar disc herniation. Report of three cases.	Alkaptonuria is a rare metabolic disease caused by deficiency of homogentisic acid oxidase and characterized by bluish-black discoloration of cartilages and skin (ochronosis). The authors report the cases of three patients with lumbar disc herniation who underwent discectomy and in whom the nucleus pulposus was discovered to be black. Alkaptonuria was diagnosed after discectomy. Discal herniation requiring surgery is unusual in alkaptonuria, with only a few reports. The symptoms in the three patients disappeared after surgery and no symptoms were demonstrated on follow-up examination.
19671401	[Intrahepatic gallstones in patient with alkaptonuria].	Alkaptonuria is a rare inherited disease with enzyme deficiency in the protein metabolism. The patients accumulate homogentisic acid which leads to symptoms from various body tissues. We describe a patient with recurrent intrahepatic gallstones probably due to such accumulation, and the successful treatment with removal of the stones and a low-protein diet.
8009267	A case of alkaptonuria with root canal stenosis.	Spinal involvement in alkaptonuria is common. Patients usually present in the third or fourth decade with spondylosis or acute intervertebral disc prolapse. Alkaptonuria with root canal stenosis has however hitherto not been reported. We wish to report one such patient.
25266991	The role of nitisinone in tyrosine pathway disorders.	Nitisinone 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione (NTBC), an effective herbicide, is the licensed treatment for the human condition, hereditary tyrosinaemia type 1 (HT-1). Its mode of action interrupts tyrosine metabolism through inhibition of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD). Nitisinone is a remarkable safe drug to use with few side effects reported. Therefore, we propose that it should be investigated as a potential treatment for other disorders of tyrosine metabolism. These include alkaptonuria (AKU), a rare disease resulting is severe, early-onset osteoarthritis. We present a case study from the disease, and attempts to use the drug both off-label and in clinical research through the DevelopAKUre consortium. 
10488288	Alkaptonuric aortic stenosis: a case report.	Alkaptonuria is a rare disease of phenylalanine, aromatic amino acids, and tyrosine metabolism. Because of a genetic deficiency of the enzyme homogentisic acid oxidase, an accumulation of homogentisic acid causes ochronotic pigment deposition. The most common clinical manifestations are arthropathy, urinary calculi and discoloration, cutaneous and cartilaginous pigmentation, and cardiac valvular disease. Arthropathy and aortic stenosis are the most debilitating manifestations of the disease. A case of alkaptonuric aortic stenosis is described. A 75-year-old woman with a history of alkaptonuria presented in the emergency department with complaints of progressive dyspnea. Upon examination, the patient was hypertensive, tachypneic, and tachycardic with premature ventricular contractions. She had pitting edema of the lower extremities and complaints of generalized weakness. Chest x-rays revealed congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema. Diuretics were administered, and a continuous nitroglycerin infusion was initiated in the emergency department. The patient was admitted for further evaluation. The patient's respiratory status continued to decline. She was intubated endotracheally 1 day after admission. Subsequent cardiac evaluation revealed an ejection fraction of 35%, severe aortic stenosis, mild coronary artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and anteroapical akinesis. A dobutamine infusion was instituted for persistent hypotension, and renal dose dopamine was initiated for oliguric renal failure. The patient underwent an emergency operation for an aortic valve replacement with a Dacron patch 10 days after admission. Cardiopulmonary bypass and mild hypothermia were used during the procedure. The patient's hemodynamic status remained tenuous throughout the procedure. Although the first attempt to wean off cardiopulmonary bypass failed, the second attempt was successful with the aid of an intra-aortic balloon pump, inotropic support, and atrioventricular pacing. These measures were maintained during transport to the surgical intensive care unit. In the intensive care unit, the patient did not have an audible blood pressure or a palpable pulse without the support of the intra-aortic balloon pump and atrioventricular pacing. Coarse atrial fibrillation was the underlying electrocardiogram rhythm in the absence of atrioventricular pacing. Sodium bicarbonate was given without improvement. After discussion with the family, all life support measures were discontinued. The patient died 10 minutes after her arrival in the intensive care unit. Alkaptonuria's pathogenesis is manifested as both local and systemic in nature. Collagen vascular diseases share a similar pattern of multisystem involvement. Despite the negative outcome for the patient described, valuable insight can be obtained by studying this case and noting the anesthetic considerations specific to collagen vascular diseases in general.
9870204	The success of dietary protein restriction in alkaptonuria patients is age-dependent.	Alkaptonuria is characterized by an increased urinary excretion of homogentisic acid, pigmentation of cartilage and connective tissues, and ultimately the development of inflammatory arthropathy. Various diets low in protein have been designed to decrease homogentisic acid excretion and to prevent the ochronotic pigmentation and arthritic lesions. However, limited information is available on the long-term beneficial effects of these diets. We reviewed the medical records of 16 patients aged 3-27 years (4 > 18 years) to ascertain the age of diagnosis, growth, development, social behaviour, signs of complications and longitudinal dietary compliance. The diagnosis of alkaptonuria was made at an average age of 1.4 years (2 months-4 years); following the diagnosis all patients were prescribed a diet with a protein content of 1.5 g/kg per day. All patients showed normal growth and development, and no major complications of the disease. Behavioural problems associated with poor dietary compliance emerged as the main problem. Dietary compliance decreased progressively with age. The effect of dietary protein restriction in homogentisic acid excretion was studied by fixing the amounts of protein in the diet at 1 g/kg per day and 3.5-5 g/kg per day during 8 days. Twelve patients, aged 4-27 years, participated in the investigation. Protein restriction resulted in a significantly lower excretion of homogentisic acid in the urine of children younger than 12 years (p < 0.01), whereas this effect was less obvious for adolescent and adult patients. The results suggest that restriction of protein intake may have a beneficial effect on alkaptonuric children; but continuation of this regimen to older age seems questionable and not practical.
28081634	The effect of nitisinone on homogentisic acid and tyrosine: a two-year survey of patients attending the National Alkaptonuria Centre, Liverpool.	Background Alkaptonuria is a rare, debilitating autosomal recessive disorder affecting tyrosine metabolism. Deficiency of homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase leads to increased homogentisic acid which is deposited as ochronotic pigment. Clinical sequelae include severe early onset osteoarthritis, increased renal and prostate stone formation and cardiac complications. Treatment has been largely based on analgaesia and arthroplasty. The National Alkaptonuria Centre in Liverpool has been using 2 mg nitisinone (NTBC) off-license for all patients in the United Kingdom with alkaptonuria and monitoring the tyrosine metabolite profiles. Methods Patients with confirmed alkaptonuria are commenced on 2 mg dose (alternative days) of NTBC for three months with daily dose thereafter. Metabolite measurement by LC-MS/MS is performed at baseline, day 4, three-months, six-months and one-year post-commencing NTBC. Thereafter, monitoring and clinical assessments are performed annually. Results Urine homogentisic acid concentration decreased from a mean baseline 20,557 micromol/24 h (95th percentile confidence interval 18,446-22,669 micromol/24 h) by on average 95.4% by six months, 94.8% at one year and 94.1% at two year monitoring. A concurrent reduction in serum homogentisic acid concentration of 83.2% compared to baseline was also measured. Serum tyrosine increased from normal adult reference interval to a mean +- SD of 594 +- 184 micromol /L at year-two monitoring with an increased urinary excretion from 103 +- 81 micromol /24 h at baseline to 1071 +- 726 micromol /24 h two years from therapy. Conclusions The data presented represent the first longitudinal survey of NTBC use in an NHS service setting and demonstrate the sustained effect of NTBC on the tyrosine metabolite profile.
22772574	T1 hyperintense disc in alkaptonuria.	STUDY DESIGN: Case report. OBJECTIVE: To report a rare case of alkaptonuria presenting as a T1-hyperintense disc herniation. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: A 46-year-old man without previous diagnosis of alkaptonuria underwent evaluation for progressive back pain revealing a T1-hyperintense disc herniation at the L3-L4 level. Discectomy recovered a blackened disc that was pathologically confirmed to be nucleus pulposus with alkaptonuric involvement. The differential diagnosis of a T1-hyperintense, T2-hypointense disc on magnetic resonance imaging is discussed, with emphasis on the pathophysiology of alkaptonuria. METHODS: A single patient is reported. RESULTS: Pathologically proven patient presentation with radiological and pathological images. CONCLUSION: We report a rare case of alkaptonuria presenting as a T1-hyperintense disc herniation.
16394410	Early detection of alkaptonuria.	Alkaptonuria is a rare disorder of metabolism characterized by deficiency of homogentisic acid oxidase. This leads to the characteristic features like darkening of urine, ochronosis and arthropathy. Darkening of urine is one of the first symptoms noticed by the parents of the child suffering from this disorder. Ochronosis is seen in various organs like eyes, skin, tendons and joints. A case of 10 year old boy is reported who was brought to this clinic with the presenting complaint of bluish discoloration of sclerae. This discoloration led to eliciting positive history of dark urine off and on. Further investigations confirmed alkaptonuria.

24924728	[Severe osteoarthritic manifestations of ochronosis].	The congenital form of ochronosis is a result of the rare autosomal recessive inherited metabolic disease alkaptonuria. The disruption of tyrosine metabolism based on a genetic defect in the enzyme homogentisate dioxygenase results in accumulation of homogentisic acid (HA) which is excreted in the urine and leads to a dark discoloration after a certain incubation time at room temperature. Furthermore, HA polymerizes forming a pigment that is deposited in connective tissues such as tendons, cartilage, bones, intervertebral discs, sclerae, ossicles, cardiac valves and coronary arteries and leads to dark brown discoloration and degeneration. The case of a 74-year-old female patient with ochronosis and classical manifestations is described and in addition a current overview of this rare disease is provided. 
19300282	Devastating ochronotic arthropathy with successful bilateral hip and knee arthroplasties.	Ochronotic arthropathy is a manifestation of long-standing alkaptonuria, a rare hereditary metabolic disorder characterized by the absence of the enzyme homogentisic acid oxidase. We describe a patient who developed rapidly progressive destructive ochronotic arthropathy in his knee and hip joints and underwent successful bilateral total knee and hip arthroplasties.

29113706	Calcaneal Avulsion of an Ochronotic Achilles Tendon: A Case Report.	Alkaptonuria is a hereditary disorder of phenylalanine and tyrosine, with an incidence of approximately 1/200,000 to 1/1,000,000. Ochronosis is the accumulation of homogentisic acid and its metabolites in connective tissues such as the tendons, cartilage, and skin. In the present case study, a 50-year-old male presented with a nontraumatic calcaneal avulsion without a previous diagnosis of ochronosis. To the best of our knowledge, little information has been reported of this pathology in the Achilles tendon and the surgical management.
32908119	Cervical Myelopathy Due to Ochronosis: An Intraoperative Suspicion.	BACKGROUND Alkaptonuria (AKU) is a rare metabolic disease caused by a deficiency in homogentisic acid oxidase, which leads to the accumulation of homogentisic acid dark pigments in tissues such as bones, ligaments, and tendons. Long-term duration of this condition, termed ochronosis, can result in degenerative arthropathy involving the spine and large joints. CASE REPORT This report describes a 55-year-old Jordanian woman presenting with chronic neck and lower back pain. History, physical examination, and radiological imaging indicated cervical myelopathy and lumbar spine degeneration. Two-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion was performed successfully. Intra-operatively, the cervical discs were observed to be black, suggesting a diagnosis of alkaptonuria, which was later confirmed by genetic testing. A detailed history and physical examination revealed the absence of classical features of AKU. CONCLUSIONS Intraoperative detection of black disc material suggests the need for further tests to diagnose AKU, especially in indolent patients who did not have classical clinical features. Surgical management may improve outcomes in patients with cervical myelopathy due to ochronosis.
25978274	Lessons from rare diseases of cartilage and bone.	Studying severe phenotypes of rare syndromes can elucidate disease mechanisms of more common disorders and identify potential therapeutic targets. Lessons from rare bone diseases contributed to the development of the most successful class of bone active agents, the bisphosphonates. More recent research on rare bone diseases has helped elucidate key pathways and identify new targets in bone resorption and bone formation including cathepsin K and sclerostin, for which drugs are now in clinical trials. By contrast, there has been much less focus on rare cartilage diseases and osteoarthritis (OA) remains a common disease with no effective therapy. Investigation of rare cartilage syndromes is identifying new potential targets in OA including GDF5 and lubricin. Research on the arthropathy of the ultra-rare disease alkaptonuria has identified several new features of the OA phenotype, including high density mineralized protrusions (HDMPs) which constitute a newly identified mechanism of joint destruction. 
25956497	Detection of alkaptonuria in a 1-week-old infant.	Alkaptonuria is a rare disorder that results from an inherited deficiency of aromatic amino acid metabolism. Only 21% of the children under the age of 1 year having the disease are identified in clinics. We report a case of a 1-week-old child of a first-degree consanguineous couple with a symptom of frequent nappy staining. Analysis of urine showed a homogentisic acid concentration exceeding 200 mg/dL. The physical examination revealed that the child was healthy. The parents' watchfulness and the close attention paid to the child were the keys to the early detection of this rare disease. After identifying the disease, adequate follow-up of the patient is important to reduce further complications. Anti-inflammatory therapy and increasing the muscle strength by exercises such as swimming would be useful to restrict joint pains and immobilisation. A low protein diet also could be recommended; that fact is yet to be proven by clinical trials. 
10494297	[A child with dark discoloration of urine].	In a 3-year-old boy alkaptonuria was diagnosed. From early age on gradual dark discoloration of his urine had been noticed in the diapers, but routine urinalysis had not revealed abnormalities. Alkaptonuria is a rare metabolic disease in which homogentisic acid cannot be metabolised, due to a lack of the enzyme homogentisic acid oxidase. The disease often manifests itself in childhood by darkening of urine on standing. The excretion of homogentisic acid in urine in these patients is increased. The disease leads to serious consequences, such as ochronosis of cartilage and connective tissues with arthritis. It is expected that treatment with ascorbic acid and a dietary restriction of protein (1 g/kg/day) can decrease the late and serious consequences by diminishing the serum concentration of the metabolite benzoquinone acetic acid.
16736091	Ochronosis and lumbar disc herniation.	Alkaptonuria is a rare, autosomal recessive metabolic disorder in which the homogentisic acid oxidase activity is absent. Its incidence is as low as 0.001%. Ochronosis is the pigmentation of connective tissues and this pigmentation leads to degenerative changes in alkaptonuric patients. Alkaptonuria most prominently involves the lumbar region, but lumbar disc herniation as the presenting feature of alkaptonuria is not common. Only a few patients required surgical intervention. Herewith we report an alkaptonuric patient, who was operated on for lumbar disc herniation. His discectomy material was black and the metabolic disorder was diagnosed retrospectively. This metabolic disease is often recognized on physical re-examination after the black disc material was seen during the operation. Therefore urinalysis for homogentisic acid should be performed in all patients with degenerative changes of the vertebral column. The results of disc surgery in this patient group is successful.
31462106	Interactive alkaptonuria database: investigating clinical data to improve patient care in a rare disease.	Alkaptonuria (AKU) is an ultrarare autosomal recessive disorder (MIM 203500) that is caused byby a complex set of mutations in homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenasegene and consequent accumulation of homogentisic acid (HGA), causing a significant protein oxidation. A secondary form of amyloidosis was identified in AKU and related to high circulating serum amyloid A (SAA) levels, which are linked with inflammation and oxidative stress and might contribute to disease progression and patients' poor quality of life. Recently, we reported that inflammatory markers (SAA and chitotriosidase) and oxidative stress markers (protein thiolation index) might be disease activity markers in AKU. Thanks to an international network, we collected genotypic, phenotypic, and clinical data from more than 200 patients with AKU. These data are currently stored in our AKU database, named ApreciseKUre. In this work, we developed an algorithm able to make predictions about the oxidative status trend of each patient with AKU based on 55 predictors, namely circulating HGA, body mass index, total cholesterol, SAA, and chitotriosidase. Our general aim is to integrate the data of apparently heterogeneous patients with AKUAKU by using specific bioinformatics tools, in order to identify pivotal mechanisms involved in AKU for a preventive, predictive, and personalized medicine approach to AKU.-Cicaloni, V., Spiga, O., Dimitri, G.

22482092	Ochronotic arthropathy: diagnosis and management: a critical review.	Alkaptonuria, a rare hereditary metabolic disorder, is characterized by accumulation of homogentisic acid in the connective tissues resulting from lack of the enzyme homogentisic acid oxidase. Ochronosis, dark pigmentation of connective tissues, is the musculoskeletal manifestation of alkaptonuria. In this article, we report the case of a 53-year-old man who had ochronotic arthropathy and advanced degenerative changes in the shoulders managed with bilateral total shoulder arthroplasty. Three-year follow-up results were satisfactory: good range of motion, no pain, and no signs of prosthesis loosening. Shoulder function was significantly improved after surgery, as documented by Constant scores. This case suggests that shoulder prosthesis results are not affected by alkaptonuria.

9670391	Alkaptonuria presenting as lumbar disc prolapse: case report and review of literature.	Alkaptonuria is a rare genetic disorder caused by deficiency of the enzyme homogentisic acid oxidase, resulting in accumulation of homogentisic acid in various body tissue; it produces a multisystemic disorder with a characteristic bluish-black discolouration of the skin and cartilage, termed ochranosis. Ochranosis primarily involves the large joints of the body including the spine. Spinal involvement produces loss of flexibility and ankylosis of the thoracic and lumbar segments. The clinical presentation with spondylosis and canal stenosis is common after the third and fourth decades, but intervertebral disc prolapse is unusual in ochranosis.
