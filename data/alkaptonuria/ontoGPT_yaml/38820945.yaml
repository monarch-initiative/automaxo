input_text: 'Disc-coloration of an ochronotic cervical intervertebral disc in a patient
  with alkaptonuria: Case report and review of the literature. OBJECTIVES: Alkaptonuria
  is a rare inborn disorder of phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolism. It is characterized
  by an accumulation of homogentisic acid and its oxidation products, possibly resulting
  into connective tissue damaging. "Ochronosis" is a main feature, which is characterized
  by tissue discoloration and even alkaptonuric arthropathy. Cervical spine involvement
  is exceptional and there is a paucity of reports on surgical interventions in these
  patients. We explored the literature concerning cervical spine involvement in patients
  with alkaptonuria. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a review of the literature,
  in which patients with alkaptonuric degenerative changes of the cervical spine were
  examined. Articles were obtained from MEDLINE. Search terms included: "cervical",
  "alkaptonuria", "alkaptonuric changes" and "black disc". Additional studies were
  identified by checking reference lists. Furthermore, we present the case of a 46
  year old patient with critical cervical spinal canal stenosis who underwent C6-C7
  anterior cervical microdiscectomy and interbody fusion, in order to prevent myelopathic
  changes. CARE statement guidelines were followed. RESULTS: Peroperatively, we did
  not encounter any macroscopic abnormalities of the skin, muscles or ligaments. A
  black discoloration of the nucleus pulposus was observed. Peroperative and postoperative
  course was uneventful. CONCLUSION: Alkaptonuric degenerative abnormalities most
  commonly involve the lumbar spine, although the cervical spine can be affected in
  rare cases. Most frequently, the diagnosis of alkaptonuria can be made based on
  the clinical phenotype many years before symptoms secondary to ochronotic arthropathy
  develop. A retrospective diagnosis based on peroperative black discoloration of
  spinal structures has been described. A black discoloration of the intervertebral
  disc should encourage the neurosurgeon to further explore the possibility of alkaptonuria,
  even in the absence of a clear phenotype. Surgical results are mostly satisfactory.
  Further studies are required in order to better understand this pathology and its
  postoperative course.'
