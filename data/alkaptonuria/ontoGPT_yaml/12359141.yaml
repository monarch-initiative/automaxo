input_text: Exacerbation of the ochronosis of alkaptonuria due to renal insufficiency
  and improvement after renal transplantation. In alkaptonuria, homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase
  deficiency causes tissue accumulation of homogentisic acid (HGA), followed by signs
  and symptoms of ochronosis. These include massive urinary excretion of HGA, arthritis
  and joint destruction, pigmentation of cartilage and connective tissue, and cardiac
  valve deterioration. We describe a 46-year-old man with alkaptonuria and diabetic
  renal failure whose plasma HGA concentration was twice that of any other alkaptonuria
  patient, and whose ochronosis progressed much more rapidly than that of his two
  alkaptonuric siblings. After renal transplantation, the plasma HGA normalized, and
  the daily urinary excretion of HGA decreased by 2-3g. This case illustrates the
  critical role of renal tubular secretion in eliminating HGA from the body, and suggests
  that renal transplantation in a uremic patient not only restores HGA excretion,
  but may also provide homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase activity for the metabolism of
  HGA.
