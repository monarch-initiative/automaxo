input_text: Dietary restriction of tyrosine and phenylalanine lowers tyrosinemia associated
  with nitisinone therapy of alkaptonuria. Alkaptonuria (AKU) is caused by homogentisate
  1,2-dioxygenase deficiency that leads to homogentisic acid (HGA) accumulation, ochronosis
  and severe osteoarthropathy. Recently, nitisinone treatment, which blocks HGA formation,
  has been effective in AKU patients. However, a consequence of nitisinone is elevated
  tyrosine that can cause keratopathy. The effect of tyrosine and phenylalanine dietary
  restriction was investigated in nitisinone-treated AKU mice, and in an observational
  study of dietary intervention in AKU patients. Nitisinone-treated AKU mice were
  fed tyrosine/phenylalanine-free and phenylalanine-free diets with phenylalanine
  supplementation in drinking water. Tyrosine metabolites were measured pre-nitisinone,
  post-nitisinone, and after dietary restriction. Subsequently an observational study
  was undertaken in 10 patients attending the National Alkaptonuria Centre (NAC),
  with tyrosine >700 mumol/L who had been advised to restrict dietary protein intake
  and where necessary, to use tyrosine/phenylalanine-free amino acid supplements.
  Elevated tyrosine (813 mumol/L) was significantly reduced in nitisinone-treated
  AKU mice fed a tyrosine/phenylalanine-free diet in a dose responsive manner. At
  3 days of restriction, tyrosine was 389.3, 274.8, and 144.3 mumol/L with decreasing
  phenylalanine doses. In contrast, tyrosine was not effectively reduced in mice by
  a phenylalanine-free diet; at 3 days tyrosine was 757.3, 530.2, and 656.2 mumol/L,
  with no dose response to phenylalanine supplementation. In NAC patients, tyrosine
  was significantly reduced (P = .002) when restricting dietary protein alone, and
  when combined with tyrosine/phenylalanine-free amino acid supplementation; 4 out
  of 10 patients achieved tyrosine <700 mumol/L. Tyrosine/phenylalanine dietary restriction
  significantly reduced nitisinone-induced tyrosinemia in mice, with phenylalanine
  restriction alone proving ineffective. Similarly, protein restriction significantly
  reduced circulating tyrosine in AKU patients.
