input_text: 'Cervical Myelopathy Due to Ochronosis: An Intraoperative Suspicion. BACKGROUND
  Alkaptonuria (AKU) is a rare metabolic disease caused by a deficiency in homogentisic
  acid oxidase, which leads to the accumulation of homogentisic acid dark pigments
  in tissues such as bones, ligaments, and tendons. Long-term duration of this condition,
  termed ochronosis, can result in degenerative arthropathy involving the spine and
  large joints. CASE REPORT This report describes a 55-year-old Jordanian woman presenting
  with chronic neck and lower back pain. History, physical examination, and radiological
  imaging indicated cervical myelopathy and lumbar spine degeneration. Two-level anterior
  cervical discectomy and fusion was performed successfully. Intra-operatively, the
  cervical discs were observed to be black, suggesting a diagnosis of alkaptonuria,
  which was later confirmed by genetic testing. A detailed history and physical examination
  revealed the absence of classical features of AKU. CONCLUSIONS Intraoperative detection
  of black disc material suggests the need for further tests to diagnose AKU, especially
  in indolent patients who did not have classical clinical features. Surgical management
  may improve outcomes in patients with cervical myelopathy due to ochronosis.'
