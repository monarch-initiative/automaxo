input_text: 'Machine learning application for patient stratification and phenotype/genotype
  investigation in a rare disease. Alkaptonuria (AKU, OMIM: 203500) is an autosomal
  recessive disorder caused by mutations in the Homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (HGD)
  gene. A lack of standardized data, information and methodologies to assess disease
  severity and progression represents a common complication in ultra-rare disorders
  like AKU. This is the reason why we developed a comprehensive tool, called ApreciseKUre,
  able to collect AKU patients deriving data, to analyse the complex network among
  genotypic and phenotypic information and to get new insight in such multi-systemic
  disease. By taking advantage of the dataset, containing the highest number of AKU
  patient ever considered, it is possible to apply more sophisticated computational
  methods (such as machine learning) to achieve a first AKU patient stratification
  based on phenotypic and genotypic data in a typical precision medicine perspective.
  Thanks to our sufficiently populated and organized dataset, it is possible, for
  the first time, to extensively explore the phenotype-genotype relationships unknown
  so far. This proof of principle study for rare diseases confirms the importance
  of a dedicated database, allowing data management and analysis and can be used to
  tailor treatments for every patient in a more effective way.'
