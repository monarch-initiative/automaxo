input_text: 'Ochronotic arthropathy: disappearance of alkaptonuria after liver transplantation
  for hepatitis B-related cirrhosis. The deficiency of homogentisic acid oxidase,
  an enzyme that is mainly found in hepatocytes, is associated with alkaptonuria and
  ochronosis. We report a patient with clinical and radiologic findings of ochronotic
  arthropathy in whom alkaptonuria disappeared and the progressive course of the disease
  stopped after liver transplantation for hepatitis B-related cirrhosis.'
