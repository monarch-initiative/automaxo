input_text: 'Efficacy and safety of once-daily nitisinone for patients with alkaptonuria
  (SONIA 2): an international, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial.
  BACKGROUND: Alkaptonuria is a rare, genetic, multisystem disease characterised by
  the accumulation of homogentisic acid (HGA). No HGA-lowering therapy has been approved
  to date. The aim of SONIA 2 was to investigate the efficacy and safety of once-daily
  nitisinone for reducing HGA excretion in patients with alkaptonuria and to evaluate
  whether nitisinone has a clinical benefit. METHODS: SONIA 2 was a 4-year, open-label,
  evaluator-blind, randomised, no treatment controlled, parallel-group study done
  at three sites in the UK, France, and Slovakia. Patients aged 25 years or older
  with confirmed alkaptonuria and any clinical disease manifestations were randomly
  assigned (1:1) to receive either oral nitisinone 10 mg daily or no treatment. Patients
  could not be masked to treatment due to colour changes in the urine, but the study
  was evaluator-blinded as far as possible. The primary endpoint was daily urinary
  HGA excretion (u-HGA24) after 12 months. Clinical evaluation Alkaptonuria Severity
  Score Index (cAKUSSI) score was assessed at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months. Efficacy
  variables were analysed in all randomly assigned patients with a valid u-HGA24 measurement
  at baseline. Safety variables were analysed in all randomly assigned patients. The
  study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01916382). FINDINGS: Between May
  7, 2014, and Feb 16, 2015, 139 patients were screened, of whom 138 were included
  in the study, with 69 patients randomly assigned to each group. 55 patients in the
  nitisinone group and 53 in the control group completed the study. u-HGA24 at 12
  months was significantly decreased by 99 7% in the nitisinone group compared with
  the control group (adjusted geometric mean ratio of nitisinone/control 0 003 [95%
  CI 0 003 to 0 004], p<0 0001). At 48 months, the increase in cAKUSSI score from
  baseline was significantly lower in the nitisinone group compared with the control
  group (adjusted mean difference -8 6 points [-16 0 to -1 2], p=0 023). 400 adverse
  events occurred in 59 (86%) patients in the nitisinone group and 284 events occurred
  in 57 (83%) patients in the control group. No treatment-related deaths occurred.
  INTERPRETATION: Nitisinone 10 mg daily was well tolerated and effective in reducing
  urinary excretion of HGA. Nitisinone decreased ochronosis and improved clinical
  signs, indicating a slower disease progression. FUNDING: European Commission Seventh
  Framework Programme.'
