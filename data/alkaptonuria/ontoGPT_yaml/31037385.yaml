input_text: 'Assessing the effect of nitisinone induced hypertyrosinaemia on monoamine
  neurotransmitters in brain tissue from a murine model of alkaptonuria using mass
  spectrometry imaging. OBJECTIVE: Nitisinone induced hypertyrosinaemia is a concern
  in patients with Alkaptonuria (AKU). It has been suggested that this may alter neurotransmitter
  metabolism, specifically dopamine and serotonin. Herein mass spectrometry imaging
  (MSI) is used for the direct measurement of 2,4-diphenyl-pyranylium tetrafluoroborate
  (DPP-TFB) derivatives of monoamine neurotransmitters in brain tissue from a murine
  model of AKU following treatment with nitisinone. METHODS: Metabolite changes were
  assessed using MSI on DPP-TFB derivatised fresh frozen tissue sections directing
  analysis towards primary amine neurotransmitters. Matched tail bleed plasma samples
  were analysed using LC-MS/MS. Eighteen BALB/c mice were included in this study:
  HGD-/- (n = 6, treated with nitisinone-4 mg/L, in drinking water); HGD-/- (n = 6,
  no treatment) and HGD+/- (n = 6, no treatment). RESULTS: Ion intensity and distribution
  of DPP-TFB derivatives in brain tissue for dopamine, 3-methoxytyramine, noradrenaline,
  tryptophan, serotonin, and glutamate were not significantly different following
  treatment with nitisinone in HGD -/- mice, and no significant differences were observed
  between HGD-/- and HGD+/- mice that received no treatment. Tyrosine (10-fold in
  both comparisons, p = 0.003; [BALB/c HGD-/- (n = 6) and BALB/c HGD+/- (n = 6) (no
  treatment) vs. BALB/c HGD-/- (n = 6, treated)] and tyramine (25-fold, p = 0.02;
  32-fold, p = 0.02) increased significantly following treatment with nitisinone.
  Plasma tyrosine and homogentisic acid increased (ninefold, p = < 0.0001) and decreased
  (ninefold, p = 0.004), respectively in HGD-/- mice treated with nitisinone. CONCLUSIONS:
  Monoamine neurotransmitters in brain tissue from a murine model of AKU did not change
  following treatment with nitisinone. These findings have significant implications
  for patients with AKU as they suggest monoamine neurotransmitters are not altered
  following treatment with nitisinone.'
