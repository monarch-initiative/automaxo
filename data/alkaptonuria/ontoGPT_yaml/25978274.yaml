input_text: 'Lessons from rare diseases of cartilage and bone. Studying severe phenotypes
  of rare syndromes can elucidate disease mechanisms of more common disorders and
  identify potential therapeutic targets. Lessons from rare bone diseases contributed
  to the development of the most successful class of bone active agents, the bisphosphonates.
  More recent research on rare bone diseases has helped elucidate key pathways and
  identify new targets in bone resorption and bone formation including cathepsin K
  and sclerostin, for which drugs are now in clinical trials. By contrast, there has
  been much less focus on rare cartilage diseases and osteoarthritis (OA) remains
  a common disease with no effective therapy. Investigation of rare cartilage syndromes
  is identifying new potential targets in OA including GDF5 and lubricin. Research
  on the arthropathy of the ultra-rare disease alkaptonuria has identified several
  new features of the OA phenotype, including high density mineralized protrusions
  (HDMPs) which constitute a newly identified mechanism of joint destruction. '
