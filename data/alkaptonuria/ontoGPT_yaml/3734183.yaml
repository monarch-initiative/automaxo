input_text: Exogenous ochronosis resulting from quinine injections. An 86-year-old
  woman presented with bluish black macules on each buttock. Skin biopsy revealed
  ochronotic pigment in the dermis. On the basis of negative results of a urine test
  for alkaptonuria and a history of having received quinine injections for malaria
  70 years ago, the patient was diagnosed as having localized exogenous ochronosis
  resulting from quinine injections. Exogenous ochronosis has been reported following
  the topical use of phenol in leg ulcers, the topical use of hydroquinone bleaching
  creams in black persons, and the oral administration of antimalarials for malaria
  and connective tissue diseases, but we could find no reports in the literature of
  exogenous ochronosis following intramuscular injections of antimalarials.
