input_text: 'The effect of nitisinone on homogentisic acid and tyrosine: a two-year
  survey of patients attending the National Alkaptonuria Centre, Liverpool. Background
  Alkaptonuria is a rare, debilitating autosomal recessive disorder affecting tyrosine
  metabolism. Deficiency of homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase leads to increased homogentisic
  acid which is deposited as ochronotic pigment. Clinical sequelae include severe
  early onset osteoarthritis, increased renal and prostate stone formation and cardiac
  complications. Treatment has been largely based on analgaesia and arthroplasty.
  The National Alkaptonuria Centre in Liverpool has been using 2 mg nitisinone (NTBC)
  off-license for all patients in the United Kingdom with alkaptonuria and monitoring
  the tyrosine metabolite profiles. Methods Patients with confirmed alkaptonuria are
  commenced on 2 mg dose (alternative days) of NTBC for three months with daily dose
  thereafter. Metabolite measurement by LC-MS/MS is performed at baseline, day 4,
  three-months, six-months and one-year post-commencing NTBC. Thereafter, monitoring
  and clinical assessments are performed annually. Results Urine homogentisic acid
  concentration decreased from a mean baseline 20,557 micromol/24 h (95th percentile
  confidence interval 18,446-22,669 micromol/24 h) by on average 95.4% by six months,
  94.8% at one year and 94.1% at two year monitoring. A concurrent reduction in serum
  homogentisic acid concentration of 83.2% compared to baseline was also measured.
  Serum tyrosine increased from normal adult reference interval to a mean +- SD of
  594 +- 184 micromol /L at year-two monitoring with an increased urinary excretion
  from 103 +- 81 micromol /24 h at baseline to 1071 +- 726 micromol /24 h two years
  from therapy. Conclusions The data presented represent the first longitudinal survey
  of NTBC use in an NHS service setting and demonstrate the sustained effect of NTBC
  on the tyrosine metabolite profile.'
