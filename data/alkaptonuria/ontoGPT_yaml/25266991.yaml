input_text: 'The role of nitisinone in tyrosine pathway disorders. Nitisinone 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione
  (NTBC), an effective herbicide, is the licensed treatment for the human condition,
  hereditary tyrosinaemia type 1 (HT-1). Its mode of action interrupts tyrosine metabolism
  through inhibition of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD). Nitisinone is
  a remarkable safe drug to use with few side effects reported. Therefore, we propose
  that it should be investigated as a potential treatment for other disorders of tyrosine
  metabolism. These include alkaptonuria (AKU), a rare disease resulting is severe,
  early-onset osteoarthritis. We present a case study from the disease, and attempts
  to use the drug both off-label and in clinical research through the DevelopAKUre
  consortium. '
