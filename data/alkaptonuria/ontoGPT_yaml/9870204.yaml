input_text: The success of dietary protein restriction in alkaptonuria patients is
  age-dependent. Alkaptonuria is characterized by an increased urinary excretion of
  homogentisic acid, pigmentation of cartilage and connective tissues, and ultimately
  the development of inflammatory arthropathy. Various diets low in protein have been
  designed to decrease homogentisic acid excretion and to prevent the ochronotic pigmentation
  and arthritic lesions. However, limited information is available on the long-term
  beneficial effects of these diets. We reviewed the medical records of 16 patients
  aged 3-27 years (4 > 18 years) to ascertain the age of diagnosis, growth, development,
  social behaviour, signs of complications and longitudinal dietary compliance. The
  diagnosis of alkaptonuria was made at an average age of 1.4 years (2 months-4 years);
  following the diagnosis all patients were prescribed a diet with a protein content
  of 1.5 g/kg per day. All patients showed normal growth and development, and no major
  complications of the disease. Behavioural problems associated with poor dietary
  compliance emerged as the main problem. Dietary compliance decreased progressively
  with age. The effect of dietary protein restriction in homogentisic acid excretion
  was studied by fixing the amounts of protein in the diet at 1 g/kg per day and 3.5-5
  g/kg per day during 8 days. Twelve patients, aged 4-27 years, participated in the
  investigation. Protein restriction resulted in a significantly lower excretion of
  homogentisic acid in the urine of children younger than 12 years (p < 0.01), whereas
  this effect was less obvious for adolescent and adult patients. The results suggest
  that restriction of protein intake may have a beneficial effect on alkaptonuric
  children; but continuation of this regimen to older age seems questionable and not
  practical.
