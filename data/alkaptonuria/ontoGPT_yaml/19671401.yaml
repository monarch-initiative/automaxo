input_text: '[Intrahepatic gallstones in patient with alkaptonuria]. Alkaptonuria
  is a rare inherited disease with enzyme deficiency in the protein metabolism. The
  patients accumulate homogentisic acid which leads to symptoms from various body
  tissues. We describe a patient with recurrent intrahepatic gallstones probably due
  to such accumulation, and the successful treatment with removal of the stones and
  a low-protein diet.'
