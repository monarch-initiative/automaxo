input_text: Early detection of alkaptonuria. Alkaptonuria is a rare disorder of metabolism
  characterized by deficiency of homogentisic acid oxidase. This leads to the characteristic
  features like darkening of urine, ochronosis and arthropathy. Darkening of urine
  is one of the first symptoms noticed by the parents of the child suffering from
  this disorder. Ochronosis is seen in various organs like eyes, skin, tendons and
  joints. A case of 10 year old boy is reported who was brought to this clinic with
  the presenting complaint of bluish discoloration of sclerae. This discoloration
  led to eliciting positive history of dark urine off and on. Further investigations
  confirmed alkaptonuria.
