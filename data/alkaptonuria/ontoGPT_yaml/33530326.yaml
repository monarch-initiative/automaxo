input_text: Towards a Precision Medicine Approach Based on Machine Learning for Tailoring
  Medical Treatment in Alkaptonuria. ApreciseKUre is a multi-purpose digital platform
  facilitating data collection, integration and analysis for patients affected by
  Alkaptonuria (AKU), an ultra-rare autosomal recessive genetic disease. It includes
  genetic, biochemical, histopathological, clinical, therapeutic resources and quality
  of life scores that can be shared among registered researchers and clinicians in
  order to create a Precision Medicine Ecosystem (PME). The combination of machine
  learning application to analyse and re-interpret data available in the ApreciseKUre
  shows the potential direct benefits to achieve patient stratification and the consequent
  tailoring of care and treatments to a specific subgroup of patients. In this study,
  we have developed a tool able to investigate the most suitable treatment for AKU
  patients in accordance with their Quality of Life scores, which indicates changes
  in health status before/after the assumption of a specific class of drugs. This
  fact highlights the necessity of development of patient databases for rare diseases,
  like ApreciseKUre. We believe this is not limited to the study of AKU, but it represents
  a proof of principle study that could be applied to other rare diseases, allowing
  data management, analysis, and interpretation.

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
  object: <A sign or symptom associated with the disease and targeted by the medical action. For example, Low serum calcitriol, hypoplasia of the thymus, chronic cough, aortic stiffness, low pulse pressure>
  qualifier: <The primary disease the relationship is about, or specifically the disease the symptom is related to. For example, Beck-Fahrner syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, progeria, diabetes mellitus, infectious otitis media>
