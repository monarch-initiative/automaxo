input_text: Towards a Precision Medicine Approach Based on Machine Learning for Tailoring
  Medical Treatment in Alkaptonuria. ApreciseKUre is a multi-purpose digital platform
  facilitating data collection, integration and analysis for patients affected by
  Alkaptonuria (AKU), an ultra-rare autosomal recessive genetic disease. It includes
  genetic, biochemical, histopathological, clinical, therapeutic resources and quality
  of life scores that can be shared among registered researchers and clinicians in
  order to create a Precision Medicine Ecosystem (PME). The combination of machine
  learning application to analyse and re-interpret data available in the ApreciseKUre
  shows the potential direct benefits to achieve patient stratification and the consequent
  tailoring of care and treatments to a specific subgroup of patients. In this study,
  we have developed a tool able to investigate the most suitable treatment for AKU
  patients in accordance with their Quality of Life scores, which indicates changes
  in health status before/after the assumption of a specific class of drugs. This
  fact highlights the necessity of development of patient databases for rare diseases,
  like ApreciseKUre. We believe this is not limited to the study of AKU, but it represents
  a proof of principle study that could be applied to other rare diseases, allowing
  data management, analysis, and interpretation.
