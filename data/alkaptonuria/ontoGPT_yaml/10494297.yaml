input_text: '[A child with dark discoloration of urine]. In a 3-year-old boy alkaptonuria
  was diagnosed. From early age on gradual dark discoloration of his urine had been
  noticed in the diapers, but routine urinalysis had not revealed abnormalities. Alkaptonuria
  is a rare metabolic disease in which homogentisic acid cannot be metabolised, due
  to a lack of the enzyme homogentisic acid oxidase. The disease often manifests itself
  in childhood by darkening of urine on standing. The excretion of homogentisic acid
  in urine in these patients is increased. The disease leads to serious consequences,
  such as ochronosis of cartilage and connective tissues with arthritis. It is expected
  that treatment with ascorbic acid and a dietary restriction of protein (1 g/kg/day)
  can decrease the late and serious consequences by diminishing the serum concentration
  of the metabolite benzoquinone acetic acid.'
