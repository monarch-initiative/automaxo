input_text: "A new integrated and interactive tool applicable to inborn errors of
  metabolism: Application to alkaptonuria. This paper describes our experience with
  the development and implementation of a database for the rare disease Alkaptonuria
  (AKU, OMIM: 203500). AKU is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a gene mutation
  leading to the accumulation of homogentisic acid (HGA). Analogously to other rare
  conditions, currently there are no approved biomarkers to monitor AKU progression
  or severity. Although some biomarkers are under evaluation, an extensive biomarker
  analysis has not been undertaken in AKU yet. In order to fill this gap, we gained
  access to AKU-related data that we carefully processed, documented and stored in
  a database, which we named ApreciseKUre. We undertook a suitable statistical analysis
  by associating every couple of potential biomarkers to highlight significant correlations.
  Our database is continuously updated allowing us to find novel unpredicted correlations
  between AKU biomarkers and to confirm system reliability. ApreciseKUre includes
  data on potential biomarkers, patients' quality of life and clinical outcomes facilitating
  their integration and possibly allowing a Precision Medicine approach in AKU. This
  framework may represent an online tool that can be turned into a best practice model
  for other rare diseases."
