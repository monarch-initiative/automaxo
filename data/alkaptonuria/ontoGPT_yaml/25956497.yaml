input_text: "Detection of alkaptonuria in a 1-week-old infant. Alkaptonuria is a rare
  disorder that results from an inherited deficiency of aromatic amino acid metabolism.
  Only 21% of the children under the age of 1 year having the disease are identified
  in clinics. We report a case of a 1-week-old child of a first-degree consanguineous
  couple with a symptom of frequent nappy staining. Analysis of urine showed a homogentisic
  acid concentration exceeding 200 mg/dL. The physical examination revealed that the
  child was healthy. The parents' watchfulness and the close attention paid to the
  child were the keys to the early detection of this rare disease. After identifying
  the disease, adequate follow-up of the patient is important to reduce further complications.
  Anti-inflammatory therapy and increasing the muscle strength by exercises such as
  swimming would be useful to restrict joint pains and immobilisation. A low protein
  diet also could be recommended; that fact is yet to be proven by clinical trials. "
