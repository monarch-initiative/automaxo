input_text: "Alkaptonuric aortic stenosis: a case report. Alkaptonuria is a rare disease
  of phenylalanine, aromatic amino acids, and tyrosine metabolism. Because of a genetic
  deficiency of the enzyme homogentisic acid oxidase, an accumulation of homogentisic
  acid causes ochronotic pigment deposition. The most common clinical manifestations
  are arthropathy, urinary calculi and discoloration, cutaneous and cartilaginous
  pigmentation, and cardiac valvular disease. Arthropathy and aortic stenosis are
  the most debilitating manifestations of the disease. A case of alkaptonuric aortic
  stenosis is described. A 75-year-old woman with a history of alkaptonuria presented
  in the emergency department with complaints of progressive dyspnea. Upon examination,
  the patient was hypertensive, tachypneic, and tachycardic with premature ventricular
  contractions. She had pitting edema of the lower extremities and complaints of generalized
  weakness. Chest x-rays revealed congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema. Diuretics
  were administered, and a continuous nitroglycerin infusion was initiated in the
  emergency department. The patient was admitted for further evaluation. The patient's
  respiratory status continued to decline. She was intubated endotracheally 1 day
  after admission. Subsequent cardiac evaluation revealed an ejection fraction of
  35%, severe aortic stenosis, mild coronary artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy,
  and anteroapical akinesis. A dobutamine infusion was instituted for persistent hypotension,
  and renal dose dopamine was initiated for oliguric renal failure. The patient underwent
  an emergency operation for an aortic valve replacement with a Dacron patch 10 days
  after admission. Cardiopulmonary bypass and mild hypothermia were used during the
  procedure. The patient's hemodynamic status remained tenuous throughout the procedure.
  Although the first attempt to wean off cardiopulmonary bypass failed, the second
  attempt was successful with the aid of an intra-aortic balloon pump, inotropic support,
  and atrioventricular pacing. These measures were maintained during transport to
  the surgical intensive care unit. In the intensive care unit, the patient did not
  have an audible blood pressure or a palpable pulse without the support of the intra-aortic
  balloon pump and atrioventricular pacing. Coarse atrial fibrillation was the underlying
  electrocardiogram rhythm in the absence of atrioventricular pacing. Sodium bicarbonate
  was given without improvement. After discussion with the family, all life support
  measures were discontinued. The patient died 10 minutes after her arrival in the
  intensive care unit. Alkaptonuria's pathogenesis is manifested as both local and
  systemic in nature. Collagen vascular diseases share a similar pattern of multisystem
  involvement. Despite the negative outcome for the patient described, valuable insight
  can be obtained by studying this case and noting the anesthetic considerations specific
  to collagen vascular diseases in general."
