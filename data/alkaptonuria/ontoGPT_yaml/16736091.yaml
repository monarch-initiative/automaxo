input_text: Ochronosis and lumbar disc herniation. Alkaptonuria is a rare, autosomal
  recessive metabolic disorder in which the homogentisic acid oxidase activity is
  absent. Its incidence is as low as 0.001%. Ochronosis is the pigmentation of connective
  tissues and this pigmentation leads to degenerative changes in alkaptonuric patients.
  Alkaptonuria most prominently involves the lumbar region, but lumbar disc herniation
  as the presenting feature of alkaptonuria is not common. Only a few patients required
  surgical intervention. Herewith we report an alkaptonuric patient, who was operated
  on for lumbar disc herniation. His discectomy material was black and the metabolic
  disorder was diagnosed retrospectively. This metabolic disease is often recognized
  on physical re-examination after the black disc material was seen during the operation.
  Therefore urinalysis for homogentisic acid should be performed in all patients with
  degenerative changes of the vertebral column. The results of disc surgery in this
  patient group is successful.
