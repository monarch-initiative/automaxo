input_text: Alkaptonuria and lumbar disc herniation. Report of three cases. Alkaptonuria
  is a rare metabolic disease caused by deficiency of homogentisic acid oxidase and
  characterized by bluish-black discoloration of cartilages and skin (ochronosis).
  The authors report the cases of three patients with lumbar disc herniation who underwent
  discectomy and in whom the nucleus pulposus was discovered to be black. Alkaptonuria
  was diagnosed after discectomy. Discal herniation requiring surgery is unusual in
  alkaptonuria, with only a few reports. The symptoms in the three patients disappeared
  after surgery and no symptoms were demonstrated on follow-up examination.
