input_text: "ApreciseKUre: an approach of Precision Medicine in a Rare Disease. BACKGROUND:
  Alkaptonuria (AKU; OMIM:203500) is a classic Mendelian genetic disorder described
  by Garrod already in 1902. It causes urine to turn black upon exposure to air and
  also leads to ochronosis as well as early osteoarthritis. Our objective is the implementation
  of a Precision Medicine (PM) approach to AKU. We present here a novel ApreciseKUre
  database facilitating the collection, integration and analysis of patient data in
  order to create an AKU-dedicated \"PM Ecosystem\" in which genetic, biochemical
  and clinical resources can be shared among registered researchers. In order to exploit
  the ApreciseKUre database, we developed an analytic method based on Pearson's correlation
  coefficient and P value that generates as refreshable correlation matrix. A complete
  statistical analysis is obtained by associating every pair of parameters to examine
  the dependence between multiple variables at the same time. SHORT CONCLUSIONS: Employing
  this analytic approach, we showed that some clinically used biomarkers are not suitable
  as prognostic biomarkers in AKU for a more reliable patients' clinical monitoring.
  We believe this database could be a good starting point for the creation of a new
  clinical management tool in AKU, which will lead to the development of a deeper
  knowledge network on the disease and will advance its treatment. Moreover, our approach
  can serve as a personalization model paradigm for other inborn errors of metabolism
  or rare diseases in general."
