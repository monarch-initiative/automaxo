input_text: 'Suitability Of Nitisinone In Alkaptonuria 1 (SONIA 1): an international,
  multicentre, randomised, open-label, no-treatment controlled, parallel-group, dose-response
  study to investigate the effect of once daily nitisinone on 24-h urinary homogentisic
  acid excretion in patients with alkaptonuria after 4 weeks of treatment. BACKGROUND:
  Alkaptonuria (AKU) is a serious genetic disease characterised by premature spondyloarthropathy.
  Homogentisate-lowering therapy is being investigated for AKU. Nitisinone decreases
  homogentisic acid (HGA) in AKU but the dose-response relationship has not been previously
  studied. METHODS: Suitability Of Nitisinone In Alkaptonuria 1 (SONIA 1) was an international,
  multicentre, randomised, open-label, no-treatment controlled, parallel-group, dose-response
  study. The primary objective was to investigate the effect of different doses of
  nitisinone once daily on 24-h urinary HGA excretion (u-HGA24) in patients with AKU
  after 4 weeks of treatment. Forty patients were randomised into five groups of eight
  patients each, with groups receiving no treatment or 1 mg, 2 mg, 4 mg and 8 mg of
  nitisinone. FINDINGS: A clear dose-response relationship was observed between nitisinone
  and the urinary excretion of HGA. At 4 weeks, the adjusted geometric mean u-HGA24
  was 31.53 mmol, 3.26 mmol, 1.44 mmol, 0.57 mmol and 0.15 mmol for the no treatment
  or 1 mg, 2 mg, 4 mg and 8 mg doses, respectively. For the most efficacious dose,
  8 mg daily, this corresponds to a mean reduction of u-HGA24 of 98.8% compared with
  baseline. An increase in tyrosine levels was seen at all doses but the dose-response
  relationship was less clear than the effect on HGA. Despite tyrosinaemia, there
  were no safety concerns and no serious adverse events were reported over the 4 weeks
  of nitisinone therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In this study in patients with AKU, nitisinone
  therapy decreased urinary HGA excretion to low levels in a dose-dependent manner
  and was well tolerated within the studied dose range. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER:
  EudraCT number: 2012-005340-24. Registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCTO1828463.'
