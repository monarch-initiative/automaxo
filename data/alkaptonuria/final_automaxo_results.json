Alkaptonuria most prominently involves the lumbar region, but lumbar disc herniation as the presenting feature of alkaptonuria is not common. Only a few patients required surgical intervention. Herewith we report an alkaptonuric patient, who was operated on for lumbar disc herniation. His discectomy material was black and the metabolic disorder was diagnosed retrospectively. This metabolic disease is often recognized on physical re-examination after the black disc material was seen during the operation. Therefore urinalysis for homogentisic acid should be performed in all patients with degenerative changes of the vertebral column. The results of disc surgery in this patient group is successful.",

The repository, in accordance to ethical policies, is publicly available after a registration request, to give to scientists the opportunity to study, investigate and compare such precious resources. AKUImg is also integrated with a preliminary but accurate predictive system able to discriminate the presence/absence of AKU by comparing histopatological affected/control images. The algorithm is based on a standard image processing approach, namely histogram comparison, resulting to be particularly effective in performing image classification, and constitutes a useful guide for non-AKU researchers and clinicians.",

No HGA-lowering therapy has been approved to date. The aim of SONIA 2 was to investigate the efficacy and safety of once-daily nitisinone for reducing HGA excretion in patients with alkaptonuria and to evaluate whether nitisinone has a clinical benefit. METHODS: SONIA 2 was a 4-year, open-label, evaluator-blind, randomised, no treatment controlled, parallel-group study done at three sites in the UK, France, and Slovakia. Patients aged 25 years or older with confirmed alkaptonuria and any clinical disease manifestations were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either oral nitisinone 10 mg daily or no treatment. Patients could not be masked to treatment due to colour changes in the urine, but the study was evaluator-blinded as far as possible. The primary endpoint was daily urinary HGA excretion (u-HGA24) after 12 months. Clinical evaluation Alkaptonuria Severity Score Index (cAKUSSI) score was assessed at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months. Efficacy variables were analysed in all randomly assigned patients with a valid u-HGA24 measurement at baseline. Safety variables were analysed in all randomly assigned patients. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01916382). FINDINGS: Between May 7, 2014, and Feb 16, 2015, 139 patients were screened, of whom 138 were included in the study, with 69 patients randomly assigned to each group. 55 patients in the nitisinone group and 53 in the control group completed the study. u-HGA24 at 12 months was significantly decreased by 99 7% in the nitisinone group compared with the control group (adjusted geometric mean ratio of nitisinone/control 0 003 [95% CI 0 003 to 0 004], p<0 0001). At 48 months, the increase in cAKUSSI score from baseline was significantly lower in the nitisinone group compared with the control group (adjusted mean difference -8 6 points [-16 0 to -1 2], p=0 023). 400 adverse events occurred in 59 (86%) patients in the nitisinone group and 284 events occurred in 57 (83%) patients in the control group. No treatment-related deaths occurred. INTERPRETATION: Nitisinone 10 mg daily was well tolerated and effective in reducing urinary excretion of HGA. Nitisinone decreased ochronosis and improved clinical signs, indicating a slower disease progression. FUNDING: European Commission Seventh Framework Programme.",

Because of a genetic deficiency of the enzyme homogentisic acid oxidase, an accumulation of homogentisic acid causes ochronotic pigment deposition. The most common clinical manifestations are arthropathy, urinary calculi and discoloration, cutaneous and cartilaginous pigmentation, and cardiac valvular disease. Arthropathy and aortic stenosis are the most debilitating manifestations of the disease. A case of alkaptonuric aortic stenosis is described. A 75-year-old woman with a history of alkaptonuria presented in the emergency department with complaints of progressive dyspnea. Upon examination, the patient was hypertensive, tachypneic, and tachycardic with premature ventricular contractions. She had pitting edema of the lower extremities and complaints of generalized weakness. Chest x-rays revealed congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema. Diuretics were administered, and a continuous nitroglycerin infusion was initiated in the emergency department. The patient was admitted for further evaluation. The patient's respiratory status continued to decline. She was intubated endotracheally 1 day after admission. Subsequent cardiac evaluation revealed an ejection fraction of 35%, severe aortic stenosis, mild coronary artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and anteroapical akinesis. A dobutamine infusion was instituted for persistent hypotension, and renal dose dopamine was initiated for oliguric renal failure. The patient underwent an emergency operation for an aortic valve replacement with a Dacron patch 10 days after admission. Cardiopulmonary bypass and mild hypothermia were used during the procedure. The patient's hemodynamic status remained tenuous throughout the procedure. Although the first attempt to wean off cardiopulmonary bypass failed, the second attempt was successful with the aid of an intra-aortic balloon pump, inotropic support, and atrioventricular pacing. These measures were maintained during transport to the surgical intensive care unit. In the intensive care unit, the patient did not have an audible blood pressure or a palpable pulse without the support of the intra-aortic balloon pump and atrioventricular pacing. Coarse atrial fibrillation was the underlying electrocardiogram rhythm in the absence of atrioventricular pacing. Sodium bicarbonate was given without improvement. After discussion with the family, all life support measures were discontinued. The patient died 10 minutes after her arrival in the intensive care unit. Alkaptonuria's pathogenesis is manifested as both local and systemic in nature. Collagen vascular diseases share a similar pattern of multisystem involvement. Despite the negative outcome for the patient described, valuable insight can be obtained by studying this case and noting the anesthetic considerations specific to collagen vascular diseases in general.",

Homogentisate-lowering therapy is being investigated for AKU. Nitisinone decreases homogentisic acid (HGA) in AKU but the dose-response relationship has not been previously studied. METHODS: Suitability Of Nitisinone In Alkaptonuria 1 (SONIA 1) was an international, multicentre, randomised, open-label, no-treatment controlled, parallel-group, dose-response study. The primary objective was to investigate the effect of different doses of nitisinone once daily on 24-h urinary HGA excretion (u-HGA24) in patients with AKU after 4 weeks of treatment. Forty patients were randomised into five groups of eight patients each, with groups receiving no treatment or 1 mg, 2 mg, 4 mg and 8 mg of nitisinone. FINDINGS: A clear dose-response relationship was observed between nitisinone and the urinary excretion of HGA. At 4 weeks, the adjusted geometric mean u-HGA24 was 31.53 mmol, 3.26 mmol, 1.44 mmol, 0.57 mmol and 0.15 mmol for the no treatment or 1 mg, 2 mg, 4 mg and 8 mg doses, respectively. For the most efficacious dose, 8 mg daily, this corresponds to a mean reduction of u-HGA24 of 98.8% compared with baseline. An increase in tyrosine levels was seen at all doses but the dose-response relationship was less clear than the effect on HGA. Despite tyrosinaemia, there were no safety concerns and no serious adverse events were reported over the 4 weeks of nitisinone therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In this study in patients with AKU, nitisinone therapy decreased urinary HGA excretion to low levels in a dose-dependent manner and was well tolerated within the studied dose range.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alkaptonuria (AKU) is a serious genetic disease characterised by premature spondyloarthropathy. Homogentisate-lowering therapy is being investigated for AKU. Nitisinone decreases homogentisic acid (HGA) in AKU but the dose-response relationship has not been previously studied. METHODS: Suitability Of Nitisinone In Alkaptonuria 1 (SONIA 1) was an international, multicentre, randomised, open-label, no-treatment controlled, parallel-group, dose-response study. The primary objective was to investigate the effect of different doses of nitisinone once daily on 24-h urinary HGA excretion (u-HGA24) in patients with AKU after 4 weeks of treatment. Forty patients were randomised into five groups of eight patients each, with groups receiving no treatment or 1 mg, 2 mg, 4 mg and 8 mg of nitisinone. FINDINGS: A clear dose-response relationship was observed between nitisinone and the urinary excretion of HGA. At 4 weeks, the adjusted geometric mean u-HGA24 was 31.53 mmol, 3.26 mmol, 1.44 mmol, 0.57 mmol and 0.15 mmol for the no treatment or 1 mg, 2 mg, 4 mg and 8 mg doses, respectively. For the most efficacious dose, 8 mg daily, this corresponds to a mean reduction of u-HGA24 of 98.8% compared with baseline. An increase in tyrosine levels was seen at all doses but the dose-response relationship was less clear than the effect on HGA. Despite tyrosinaemia, there were no safety concerns and no serious adverse events were reported over the 4 weeks of nitisinone therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In this study in patients with AKU, nitisinone therapy decreased urinary HGA excretion to low levels in a dose-dependent manner and was well tolerated within the studied dose range.

                    "abstract": "Alkaptonuria is a rare disease of phenylalanine, aromatic amino acids, and tyrosine metabolism. Because of a genetic deficiency of the enzyme homogentisic acid oxidase, an accumulation of homogentisic acid causes ochronotic pigment deposition. The most common clinical manifestations are arthropathy, urinary calculi and discoloration, cutaneous and cartilaginous pigmentation, and cardiac valvular disease. Arthropathy and aortic stenosis are the most debilitating manifestations of the disease. A case of alkaptonuric aortic stenosis is described. A 75-year-old woman with a history of alkaptonuria presented in the emergency department with complaints of progressive dyspnea. Upon examination, the patient was hypertensive, tachypneic, and tachycardic with premature ventricular contractions. She had pitting edema of the lower extremities and complaints of generalized weakness. Chest x-rays revealed congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema. Diuretics were administered, and a continuous nitroglycerin infusion was initiated in the emergency department. The patient was admitted for further evaluation. The patient's respiratory status continued to decline. She was intubated endotracheally 1 day after admission. Subsequent cardiac evaluation revealed an ejection fraction of 35%, severe aortic stenosis, mild coronary artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and anteroapical akinesis. A dobutamine infusion was instituted for persistent hypotension, and renal dose dopamine was initiated for oliguric renal failure. The patient underwent an emergency operation for an aortic valve replacement with a Dacron patch 10 days after admission. Cardiopulmonary bypass and mild hypothermia were used during the procedure. The patient's hemodynamic status remained tenuous throughout the procedure. Although the first attempt to wean off cardiopulmonary bypass failed, the second attempt was successful with the aid of an intra-aortic balloon pump, inotropic support, and atrioventricular pacing. These measures were maintained during transport to the surgical intensive care unit. In the intensive care unit, the patient did not have an audible blood pressure or a palpable pulse without the support of the intra-aortic balloon pump and atrioventricular pacing. Coarse atrial fibrillation was the underlying electrocardiogram rhythm in the absence of atrioventricular pacing. Sodium bicarbonate was given without improvement. After discussion with the family, all life support measures were discontinued. The patient died 10 minutes after her arrival in the intensive care unit. Alkaptonuria's pathogenesis is manifested as both local and systemic in nature. Collagen vascular diseases share a similar pattern of multisystem involvement. Despite the negative outcome for the patient described, valuable insight can be obtained by studying this case and noting the anesthetic considerations specific to collagen vascular diseases in general.",

                    "abstract": "Background Alkaptonuria is a rare, debilitating autosomal recessive disorder affecting tyrosine metabolism. Deficiency of homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase leads to increased homogentisic acid which is deposited as ochronotic pigment. Clinical sequelae include severe early onset osteoarthritis, increased renal and prostate stone formation and cardiac complications. Treatment has been largely based on analgaesia and arthroplasty. The National Alkaptonuria Centre in Liverpool has been using 2 mg nitisinone (NTBC) off-license for all patients in the United Kingdom with alkaptonuria and monitoring the tyrosine metabolite profiles. Methods Patients with confirmed alkaptonuria are commenced on 2 mg dose (alternative days) of NTBC for three months with daily dose thereafter. Metabolite measurement by LC-MS/MS is performed at baseline, day 4, three-months, six-months and one-year post-commencing NTBC. Thereafter, monitoring and clinical assessments are performed annually. Results Urine homogentisic acid concentration decreased from a mean baseline 20,557 micromol/24 h (95th percentile confidence interval 18,446-22,669 micromol/24 h) by on average 95.4% by six months, 94.8% at one year and 94.1% at two year monitoring. A concurrent reduction in serum homogentisic acid concentration of 83.2% compared to baseline was also measured. Serum tyrosine increased from normal adult reference interval to a mean +- SD of 594 +- 184 micromol /L at year-two monitoring with an increased urinary excretion from 103 +- 81 micromol /24 h at baseline to 1071 +- 726 micromol /24 h two years from therapy. Conclusions The data presented represent the first longitudinal survey of NTBC use in an NHS service setting and demonstrate the sustained effect of NTBC on the tyrosine metabolite profile.",

                    "abstract": "ApreciseKUre is a multi-purpose digital platform facilitating data collection, integration and analysis for patients affected by Alkaptonuria (AKU), an ultra-rare autosomal recessive genetic disease. It includes genetic, biochemical, histopathological, clinical, therapeutic resources and quality of life scores that can be shared among registered researchers and clinicians in order to create a Precision Medicine Ecosystem (PME). The combination of machine learning application to analyse and re-interpret data available in the ApreciseKUre shows the potential direct benefits to achieve patient stratification and the consequent tailoring of care and treatments to a specific subgroup of patients. In this study, we have developed a tool able to investigate the most suitable treatment for AKU patients in accordance with their Quality of Life scores, which indicates changes in health status before/after the assumption of a specific class of drugs. This fact highlights the necessity of development of patient databases for rare diseases, like ApreciseKUre. We believe this is not limited to the study of AKU, but it represents a proof of principle study that could be applied to other rare diseases, allowing data management, analysis, and interpretation.",

                    "abstract": "Alkaptonuria is a rare disease of phenylalanine, aromatic amino acids, and tyrosine metabolism. Because of a genetic deficiency of the enzyme homogentisic acid oxidase, an accumulation of homogentisic acid causes ochronotic pigment deposition. The most common clinical manifestations are arthropathy, urinary calculi and discoloration, cutaneous and cartilaginous pigmentation, and cardiac valvular disease. Arthropathy and aortic stenosis are the most debilitating manifestations of the disease. A case of alkaptonuric aortic stenosis is described. A 75-year-old woman with a history of alkaptonuria presented in the emergency department with complaints of progressive dyspnea. Upon examination, the patient was hypertensive, tachypneic, and tachycardic with premature ventricular contractions. She had pitting edema of the lower extremities and complaints of generalized weakness. Chest x-rays revealed congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema. Diuretics were administered, and a continuous nitroglycerin infusion was initiated in the emergency department. The patient was admitted for further evaluation. The patient's respiratory status continued to decline. She was intubated endotracheally 1 day after admission. Subsequent cardiac evaluation revealed an ejection fraction of 35%, severe aortic stenosis, mild coronary artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and anteroapical akinesis. A dobutamine infusion was instituted for persistent hypotension, and renal dose dopamine was initiated for oliguric renal failure. The patient underwent an emergency operation for an aortic valve replacement with a Dacron patch 10 days after admission. Cardiopulmonary bypass and mild hypothermia were used during the procedure. The patient's hemodynamic status remained tenuous throughout the procedure. Although the first attempt to wean off cardiopulmonary bypass failed, the second attempt was successful with the aid of an intra-aortic balloon pump, inotropic support, and atrioventricular pacing. These measures were maintained during transport to the surgical intensive care unit. In the intensive care unit, the patient did not have an audible blood pressure or a palpable pulse without the support of the intra-aortic balloon pump and atrioventricular pacing. Coarse atrial fibrillation was the underlying electrocardiogram rhythm in the absence of atrioventricular pacing. Sodium bicarbonate was given without improvement. After discussion with the family, all life support measures were discontinued. The patient died 10 minutes after her arrival in the intensive care unit. Alkaptonuria's pathogenesis is manifested as both local and systemic in nature. Collagen vascular diseases share a similar pattern of multisystem involvement. Despite the negative outcome for the patient described, valuable insight can be obtained by studying this case and noting the anesthetic considerations specific to collagen vascular diseases in general.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Alkaptonuria is a rare inborn disorder of phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolism. It is characterized by an accumulation of homogentisic acid and its oxidation products, possibly resulting into connective tissue damaging. \"Ochronosis\" is a main feature, which is characterized by tissue discoloration and even alkaptonuric arthropathy. Cervical spine involvement is exceptional and there is a paucity of reports on surgical interventions in these patients. We explored the literature concerning cervical spine involvement in patients with alkaptonuria. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a review of the literature, in which patients with alkaptonuric degenerative changes of the cervical spine were examined. Articles were obtained from MEDLINE. Search terms included: \"cervical\", \"alkaptonuria\", \"alkaptonuric changes\" and \"black disc\". Additional studies were identified by checking reference lists. Furthermore, we present the case of a 46 year old patient with critical cervical spinal canal stenosis who underwent C6-C7 anterior cervical microdiscectomy and interbody fusion, in order to prevent myelopathic changes. CARE statement guidelines were followed. RESULTS: Peroperatively, we did not encounter any macroscopic abnormalities of the skin, muscles or ligaments. A black discoloration of the nucleus pulposus was observed. Peroperative and postoperative course was uneventful. CONCLUSION: Alkaptonuric degenerative abnormalities most commonly involve the lumbar spine, although the cervical spine can be affected in rare cases. Most frequently, the diagnosis of alkaptonuria can be made based on the clinical phenotype many years before symptoms secondary to ochronotic arthropathy develop. A retrospective diagnosis based on peroperative black discoloration of spinal structures has been described. A black discoloration of the intervertebral disc should encourage the neurosurgeon to further explore the possibility of alkaptonuria, even in the absence of a clear phenotype. Surgical results are mostly satisfactory. Further studies are required in order to better understand this pathology and its postoperative course.",

Lessons from rare bone diseases contributed to the development of the most successful class of bone active agents, the bisphosphonates. More recent research on rare bone diseases has helped elucidate key pathways and identify new targets in bone resorption and bone formation including cathepsin K and sclerostin, for which drugs are now in clinical trials. By contrast, there has been much less focus on rare cartilage diseases and osteoarthritis (OA) remains a common disease with no effective therapy. Investigation of rare cartilage syndromes is identifying new potential targets in OA including GDF5 and lubricin. Research on the arthropathy of the ultra-rare disease alkaptonuria has identified several new features of the OA phenotype, including high density mineralized protrusions (HDMPs) which constitute a newly identified mechanism of joint destruction.

                    "abstract": "Alkaptonuria is a rare disease of phenylalanine, aromatic amino acids, and tyrosine metabolism. Because of a genetic deficiency of the enzyme homogentisic acid oxidase, an accumulation of homogentisic acid causes ochronotic pigment deposition. The most common clinical manifestations are arthropathy, urinary calculi and discoloration, cutaneous and cartilaginous pigmentation, and cardiac valvular disease. Arthropathy and aortic stenosis are the most debilitating manifestations of the disease. A case of alkaptonuric aortic stenosis is described. A 75-year-old woman with a history of alkaptonuria presented in the emergency department with complaints of progressive dyspnea. Upon examination, the patient was hypertensive, tachypneic, and tachycardic with premature ventricular contractions. She had pitting edema of the lower extremities and complaints of generalized weakness. Chest x-rays revealed congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema. Diuretics were administered, and a continuous nitroglycerin infusion was initiated in the emergency department. The patient was admitted for further evaluation. The patient's respiratory status continued to decline. She was intubated endotracheally 1 day after admission. Subsequent cardiac evaluation revealed an ejection fraction of 35%, severe aortic stenosis, mild coronary artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and anteroapical akinesis. A dobutamine infusion was instituted for persistent hypotension, and renal dose dopamine was initiated for oliguric renal failure. The patient underwent an emergency operation for an aortic valve replacement with a Dacron patch 10 days after admission. Cardiopulmonary bypass and mild hypothermia were used during the procedure. The patient's hemodynamic status remained tenuous throughout the procedure. Although the first attempt to wean off cardiopulmonary bypass failed, the second attempt was successful with the aid of an intra-aortic balloon pump, inotropic support, and atrioventricular pacing. These measures were maintained during transport to the surgical intensive care unit. In the intensive care unit, the patient did not have an audible blood pressure or a palpable pulse without the support of the intra-aortic balloon pump and atrioventricular pacing. Coarse atrial fibrillation was the underlying electrocardiogram rhythm in the absence of atrioventricular pacing. Sodium bicarbonate was given without improvement. After discussion with the family, all life support measures were discontinued. The patient died 10 minutes after her arrival in the intensive care unit. Alkaptonuria's pathogenesis is manifested as both local and systemic in nature. Collagen vascular diseases share a similar pattern of multisystem involvement. Despite the negative outcome for the patient described, valuable insight can be obtained by studying this case and noting the anesthetic considerations specific to collagen vascular diseases in general.",

This is the reason why we developed a comprehensive tool, called ApreciseKUre, able to collect AKU patients deriving data, to analyse the complex network among genotypic and phenotypic information and to get new insight in such multi-systemic disease. By taking advantage of the dataset, containing the highest number of AKU patient ever considered, it is possible to apply more sophisticated computational methods (such as machine learning) to achieve a first AKU patient stratification based on phenotypic and genotypic data in a typical precision medicine perspective. Thanks to our sufficiently populated and organized dataset, it is possible, for the first time, to extensively explore the phenotype-genotype relationships unknown so far.

In order to fill this gap, we gained access to AKU-related data that we carefully processed, documented and stored in a database, which we named ApreciseKUre. We undertook a suitable statistical analysis by associating every couple of potential biomarkers to highlight significant correlations. Our database is continuously updated allowing us to find novel unpredicted correlations between AKU biomarkers and to confirm system reliability. ApreciseKUre includes data on potential biomarkers, patients' quality of life and clinical outcomes facilitating their integration and possibly allowing a Precision Medicine approach in AKU. This framework may represent an online tool that can be turned into a best practice model for other rare diseases.",

A secondary form of amyloidosis was identified in AKU and related to high circulating serum amyloid A (SAA) levels, which are linked with inflammation and oxidative stress and might contribute to disease progression and patients' poor quality of life. Recently, we reported that inflammatory markers (SAA and chitotriosidase) and oxidative stress markers (protein thiolation index) might be disease activity markers in AKU. Thanks to an international network, we collected genotypic, phenotypic, and clinical data from more than 200 patients with AKU. These data are currently stored in our AKU database, named ApreciseKUre. In this work, we developed an algorithm able to make predictions about the oxidative status trend of each patient with AKU based on 55 predictors, namely circulating HGA, body mass index, total cholesterol, SAA, and chitotriosidase. Our general aim is to integrate the data of apparently heterogeneous patients with AKUAKU by using specific bioinformatics tools, in order to identify pivotal mechanisms involved in AKU for a preventive, predictive, and personalized medicine approach to AKU.-Cicaloni, V., Spiga, O., Dimitri, G.

From early age on gradual dark discoloration of his urine had been noticed in the diapers, but routine urinalysis had not revealed abnormalities. Alkaptonuria is a rare metabolic disease in which homogentisic acid cannot be metabolised, due to a lack of the enzyme homogentisic acid oxidase. The disease often manifests itself in childhood by darkening of urine on standing. The excretion of homogentisic acid in urine in these patients is increased. The disease leads to serious consequences, such as ochronosis of cartilage and connective tissues with arthritis. It is expected that treatment with ascorbic acid and a dietary restriction of protein (1 g/kg/day) can decrease the late and serious consequences by diminishing the serum concentration of the metabolite benzoquinone acetic acid.",

Recently, nitisinone treatment, which blocks HGA formation, has been effective in AKU patients. However, a consequence of nitisinone is elevated tyrosine that can cause keratopathy. The effect of tyrosine and phenylalanine dietary restriction was investigated in nitisinone-treated AKU mice, and in an observational study of dietary intervention in AKU patients. Nitisinone-treated AKU mice were fed tyrosine/phenylalanine-free and phenylalanine-free diets with phenylalanine supplementation in drinking water. Tyrosine metabolites were measured pre-nitisinone, post-nitisinone, and after dietary restriction. Subsequently an observational study was undertaken in 10 patients attending the National Alkaptonuria Centre (NAC), with tyrosine >700 mumol/L who had been advised to restrict dietary protein intake and where necessary, to use tyrosine/phenylalanine-free amino acid supplements. Elevated tyrosine (813 mumol/L) was significantly reduced in nitisinone-treated AKU mice fed a tyrosine/phenylalanine-free diet in a dose responsive manner. At 3 days of restriction, tyrosine was 389.3, 274.8, and 144.3 mumol/L with decreasing phenylalanine doses. In contrast, tyrosine was not effectively reduced in mice by a phenylalanine-free diet; at 3 days tyrosine was 757.3, 530.2, and 656.2 mumol/L, with no dose response to phenylalanine supplementation. In NAC patients, tyrosine was significantly reduced (P = .002) when restricting dietary protein alone, and when combined with tyrosine/phenylalanine-free amino acid supplementation; 4 out of 10 patients achieved tyrosine <700 mumol/L. Tyrosine/phenylalanine dietary restriction significantly reduced nitisinone-induced tyrosinemia in mice, with phenylalanine restriction alone proving ineffective. Similarly, protein restriction significantly reduced circulating tyrosine in AKU patients.",

Long-term duration of this condition, termed ochronosis, can result in degenerative arthropathy involving the spine and large joints. CASE REPORT This report describes a 55-year-old Jordanian woman presenting with chronic neck and lower back pain. History, physical examination, and radiological imaging indicated cervical myelopathy and lumbar spine degeneration. Two-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion was performed successfully. Intra-operatively, the cervical discs were observed to be black, suggesting a diagnosis of alkaptonuria, which was later confirmed by genetic testing. A detailed history and physical examination revealed the absence of classical features of AKU. CONCLUSIONS Intraoperative detection of black disc material suggests the need for further tests to diagnose AKU, especially in indolent patients who did not have classical clinical features. Surgical management may improve outcomes in patients with cervical myelopathy due to ochronosis.",

Only 21% of the children under the age of 1 year having the disease are identified in clinics. We report a case of a 1-week-old child of a first-degree consanguineous couple with a symptom of frequent nappy staining. Analysis of urine showed a homogentisic acid concentration exceeding 200 mg/dL. The physical examination revealed that the child was healthy. The parents' watchfulness and the close attention paid to the child were the keys to the early detection of this rare disease. After identifying the disease, adequate follow-up of the patient is important to reduce further complications. Anti-inflammatory therapy and increasing the muscle strength by exercises such as swimming would be useful to restrict joint pains and immobilisation. A low protein diet also could be recommended; that fact is yet to be proven by clinical trials. ",

                    "abstract": "Alkaptonuria is a rare disease of phenylalanine, aromatic amino acids, and tyrosine metabolism. Because of a genetic deficiency of the enzyme homogentisic acid oxidase, an accumulation of homogentisic acid causes ochronotic pigment deposition. The most common clinical manifestations are arthropathy, urinary calculi and discoloration, cutaneous and cartilaginous pigmentation, and cardiac valvular disease. Arthropathy and aortic stenosis are the most debilitating manifestations of the disease. A case of alkaptonuric aortic stenosis is described. A 75-year-old woman with a history of alkaptonuria presented in the emergency department with complaints of progressive dyspnea. Upon examination, the patient was hypertensive, tachypneic, and tachycardic with premature ventricular contractions. She had pitting edema of the lower extremities and complaints of generalized weakness. Chest x-rays revealed congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema. Diuretics were administered, and a continuous nitroglycerin infusion was initiated in the emergency department. The patient was admitted for further evaluation. The patient's respiratory status continued to decline. She was intubated endotracheally 1 day after admission. Subsequent cardiac evaluation revealed an ejection fraction of 35%, severe aortic stenosis, mild coronary artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and anteroapical akinesis. A dobutamine infusion was instituted for persistent hypotension, and renal dose dopamine was initiated for oliguric renal failure. The patient underwent an emergency operation for an aortic valve replacement with a Dacron patch 10 days after admission. Cardiopulmonary bypass and mild hypothermia were used during the procedure. The patient's hemodynamic status remained tenuous throughout the procedure. Although the first attempt to wean off cardiopulmonary bypass failed, the second attempt was successful with the aid of an intra-aortic balloon pump, inotropic support, and atrioventricular pacing. These measures were maintained during transport to the surgical intensive care unit. In the intensive care unit, the patient did not have an audible blood pressure or a palpable pulse without the support of the intra-aortic balloon pump and atrioventricular pacing. Coarse atrial fibrillation was the underlying electrocardiogram rhythm in the absence of atrioventricular pacing. Sodium bicarbonate was given without improvement. After discussion with the family, all life support measures were discontinued. The patient died 10 minutes after her arrival in the intensive care unit. Alkaptonuria's pathogenesis is manifested as both local and systemic in nature. Collagen vascular diseases share a similar pattern of multisystem involvement. Despite the negative outcome for the patient described, valuable insight can be obtained by studying this case and noting the anesthetic considerations specific to collagen vascular diseases in general.",

Analogously to other rare conditions, currently there are no approved biomarkers to monitor AKU progression or severity. Although some biomarkers are under evaluation, an extensive biomarker analysis has not been undertaken in AKU yet. In order to fill this gap, we gained access to AKU-related data that we carefully processed, documented and stored in a database, which we named ApreciseKUre. We undertook a suitable statistical analysis by associating every couple of potential biomarkers to highlight significant correlations. Our database is continuously updated allowing us to find novel unpredicted correlations between AKU biomarkers and to confirm system reliability. ApreciseKUre includes data on potential biomarkers, patients' quality of life and clinical outcomes facilitating their integration and possibly allowing a Precision Medicine approach in AKU. This framework may represent an online tool that can be turned into a best practice model for other rare diseases.",

Because of a genetic deficiency of the enzyme homogentisic acid oxidase, an accumulation of homogentisic acid causes ochronotic pigment deposition. The most common clinical manifestations are arthropathy, urinary calculi and discoloration, cutaneous and cartilaginous pigmentation, and cardiac valvular disease. Arthropathy and aortic stenosis are the most debilitating manifestations of the disease. A case of alkaptonuric aortic stenosis is described. A 75-year-old woman with a history of alkaptonuria presented in the emergency department with complaints of progressive dyspnea. Upon examination, the patient was hypertensive, tachypneic, and tachycardic with premature ventricular contractions. She had pitting edema of the lower extremities and complaints of generalized weakness. Chest x-rays revealed congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema. Diuretics were administered, and a continuous nitroglycerin infusion was initiated in the emergency department. The patient was admitted for further evaluation. The patient's respiratory status continued to decline. She was intubated endotracheally 1 day after admission. Subsequent cardiac evaluation revealed an ejection fraction of 35%, severe aortic stenosis, mild coronary artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and anteroapical akinesis. A dobutamine infusion was instituted for persistent hypotension, and renal dose dopamine was initiated for oliguric renal failure. The patient underwent an emergency operation for an aortic valve replacement with a Dacron patch 10 days after admission. Cardiopulmonary bypass and mild hypothermia were used during the procedure. The patient's hemodynamic status remained tenuous throughout the procedure. Although the first attempt to wean off cardiopulmonary bypass failed, the second attempt was successful with the aid of an intra-aortic balloon pump, inotropic support, and atrioventricular pacing. These measures were maintained during transport to the surgical intensive care unit. In the intensive care unit, the patient did not have an audible blood pressure or a palpable pulse without the support of the intra-aortic balloon pump and atrioventricular pacing.

More recent research on rare bone diseases has helped elucidate key pathways and identify new targets in bone resorption and bone formation including cathepsin K and sclerostin, for which drugs are now in clinical trials. By contrast, there has been much less focus on rare cartilage diseases and osteoarthritis (OA) remains a common disease with no effective therapy. Investigation of rare cartilage syndromes is identifying new potential targets in OA including GDF5 and lubricin. Research on the arthropathy of the ultra-rare disease alkaptonuria has identified several new features of the OA phenotype, including high density mineralized protrusions (HDMPs) which constitute a newly identified mechanism of joint destruction.

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Nitisinone induced hypertyrosinaemia is a concern in patients with Alkaptonuria (AKU). It has been suggested that this may alter neurotransmitter metabolism, specifically dopamine and serotonin. Herein mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is used for the direct measurement of 2,4-diphenyl-pyranylium tetrafluoroborate (DPP-TFB) derivatives of monoamine neurotransmitters in brain tissue from a murine model of AKU following treatment with nitisinone. METHODS: Metabolite changes were assessed using MSI on DPP-TFB derivatised fresh frozen tissue sections directing analysis towards primary amine neurotransmitters. Matched tail bleed plasma samples were analysed using LC-MS/MS. Eighteen BALB/c mice were included in this study: HGD-/- (n = 6, treated with nitisinone-4 mg/L, in drinking water); HGD-/- (n = 6, no treatment) and HGD+/- (n = 6, no treatment). RESULTS: Ion intensity and distribution of DPP-TFB derivatives in brain tissue for dopamine, 3-methoxytyramine, noradrenaline, tryptophan, serotonin, and glutamate were not significantly different following treatment with nitisinone in HGD -/- mice, and no significant differences were observed between HGD-/- and HGD+/- mice that received no treatment. Tyrosine (10-fold in both comparisons, p = 0.003; [BALB/c HGD-/- (n = 6) and BALB/c HGD+/- (n = 6) (no treatment) vs. BALB/c HGD-/- (n = 6, treated)] and tyramine (25-fold, p = 0.02; 32-fold, p = 0.02) increased significantly following treatment with nitisinone. Plasma tyrosine and homogentisic acid increased (ninefold, p = < 0.0001) and decreased (ninefold, p = 0.004), respectively in HGD-/- mice treated with nitisinone. CONCLUSIONS: Monoamine neurotransmitters in brain tissue from a murine model of AKU did not change following treatment with nitisinone. These findings have significant implications for patients with AKU as they suggest monoamine neurotransmitters are not altered following treatment with nitisinone.",

Its mode of action interrupts tyrosine metabolism through inhibition of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD). Nitisinone is a remarkable safe drug to use with few side effects reported. Therefore, we propose that it should be investigated as a potential treatment for other disorders of tyrosine metabolism. These include alkaptonuria (AKU), a rare disease resulting is severe, early-onset osteoarthritis. We present a case study from the disease, and attempts to use the drug both off-label and in clinical research through the DevelopAKUre consortium. ",

It has been suggested that this may alter neurotransmitter metabolism, specifically dopamine and serotonin. Herein mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is used for the direct measurement of 2,4-diphenyl-pyranylium tetrafluoroborate (DPP-TFB) derivatives of monoamine neurotransmitters in brain tissue from a murine model of AKU following treatment with nitisinone. METHODS: Metabolite changes were assessed using MSI on DPP-TFB derivatised fresh frozen tissue sections directing analysis towards primary amine neurotransmitters. Matched tail bleed plasma samples were analysed using LC-MS/MS. Eighteen BALB/c mice were included in this study: HGD-/- (n = 6, treated with nitisinone-4 mg/L, in drinking water); HGD-/- (n = 6, no treatment) and HGD+/- (n = 6, no treatment). RESULTS: Ion intensity and distribution of DPP-TFB derivatives in brain tissue for dopamine, 3-methoxytyramine, noradrenaline, tryptophan, serotonin, and glutamate were not significantly different following treatment with nitisinone in HGD -/- mice, and no significant differences were observed between HGD-/- and HGD+/- mice that received no treatment.

Plasma tyrosine and homogentisic acid increased (ninefold, p = < 0.0001) and decreased (ninefold, p = 0.004), respectively in HGD-/- mice treated with nitisinone. CONCLUSIONS: Monoamine neurotransmitters in brain tissue from a murine model of AKU did not change following treatment with nitisinone.

Homogentisate-lowering therapy is being investigated for AKU. Nitisinone decreases homogentisic acid (HGA) in AKU but the dose-response relationship has not been previously studied. METHODS: Suitability Of Nitisinone In Alkaptonuria 1 (SONIA 1) was an international, multicentre, randomised, open-label, no-treatment controlled, parallel-group, dose-response study. The primary objective was to investigate the effect of different doses of nitisinone once daily on 24-h urinary HGA excretion (u-HGA24) in patients with AKU after 4 weeks of treatment. Forty patients were randomised into five groups of eight patients each, with groups receiving no treatment or 1 mg, 2 mg, 4 mg and 8 mg of nitisinone. FINDINGS: A clear dose-response relationship was observed between nitisinone and the urinary excretion of HGA. At 4 weeks, the adjusted geometric mean u-HGA24 was 31.53 mmol, 3.26 mmol, 1.44 mmol, 0.57 mmol and 0.15 mmol for the no treatment or 1 mg, 2 mg, 4 mg and 8 mg doses, respectively. For the most efficacious dose, 8 mg daily, this corresponds to a mean reduction of u-HGA24 of 98.8% compared with baseline. An increase in tyrosine levels was seen at all doses but the dose-response relationship was less clear than the effect on HGA. Despite tyrosinaemia, there were no safety concerns and no serious adverse events were reported over the 4 weeks of nitisinone therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In this study in patients with AKU, nitisinone therapy decreased urinary HGA excretion to low levels in a dose-dependent manner and was well tolerated within the studied dose range.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alkaptonuria is a rare, genetic, multisystem disease characterised by the accumulation of homogentisic acid (HGA). No HGA-lowering therapy has been approved to date. The aim of SONIA 2 was to investigate the efficacy and safety of once-daily nitisinone for reducing HGA excretion in patients with alkaptonuria and to evaluate whether nitisinone has a clinical benefit. METHODS: SONIA 2 was a 4-year, open-label, evaluator-blind, randomised, no treatment controlled, parallel-group study done at three sites in the UK, France, and Slovakia. Patients aged 25 years or older with confirmed alkaptonuria and any clinical disease manifestations were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either oral nitisinone 10 mg daily or no treatment. Patients could not be masked to treatment due to colour changes in the urine, but the study was evaluator-blinded as far as possible. The primary endpoint was daily urinary HGA excretion (u-HGA24) after 12 months. Clinical evaluation Alkaptonuria Severity Score Index (cAKUSSI) score was assessed at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months. Efficacy variables were analysed in all randomly assigned patients with a valid u-HGA24 measurement at baseline. Safety variables were analysed in all randomly assigned patients. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01916382). FINDINGS: Between May 7, 2014, and Feb 16, 2015, 139 patients were screened, of whom 138 were included in the study, with 69 patients randomly assigned to each group. 55 patients in the nitisinone group and 53 in the control group completed the study. u-HGA24 at 12 months was significantly decreased by 99 7% in the nitisinone group compared with the control group (adjusted geometric mean ratio of nitisinone/control 0 003 [95% CI 0 003 to 0 004], p<0 0001). At 48 months, the increase in cAKUSSI score from baseline was significantly lower in the nitisinone group compared with the control group (adjusted mean difference -8 6 points [-16 0 to -1 2], p=0 023). 400 adverse events occurred in 59 (86%) patients in the nitisinone group and 284 events occurred in 57 (83%) patients in the control group. No treatment-related deaths occurred. INTERPRETATION: Nitisinone 10 mg daily was well tolerated and effective in reducing urinary excretion of HGA. Nitisinone decreased ochronosis and improved clinical signs, indicating a slower disease progression. FUNDING: European Commission Seventh Framework Programme.",

The combination of machine learning application to analyse and re-interpret data available in the ApreciseKUre shows the potential direct benefits to achieve patient stratification and the consequent tailoring of care and treatments to a specific subgroup of patients. In this study, we have developed a tool able to investigate the most suitable treatment for AKU patients in accordance with their Quality of Life scores, which indicates changes in health status before/after the assumption of a specific class of drugs.

                    "abstract": "Alkaptonuria (AKU) is an ultrarare autosomal recessive disorder (MIM 203500) that is caused byby a complex set of mutations in homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenasegene and consequent accumulation of homogentisic acid (HGA), causing a significant protein oxidation. A secondary form of amyloidosis was identified in AKU and related to high circulating serum amyloid A (SAA) levels, which are linked with inflammation and oxidative stress and might contribute to disease progression and patients' poor quality of life. Recently, we reported that inflammatory markers (SAA and chitotriosidase) and oxidative stress markers (protein thiolation index) might be disease activity markers in AKU. Thanks to an international network, we collected genotypic, phenotypic, and clinical data from more than 200 patients with AKU. These data are currently stored in our AKU database, named ApreciseKUre. In this work, we developed an algorithm able to make predictions about the oxidative status trend of each patient with AKU based on 55 predictors, namely circulating HGA, body mass index, total cholesterol, SAA, and chitotriosidase. Our general aim is to integrate the data of apparently heterogeneous patients with AKUAKU by using specific bioinformatics tools, in order to identify pivotal mechanisms involved in AKU for a preventive, predictive, and personalized medicine approach to AKU.-Cicaloni, V., Spiga, O., Dimitri, G.

Only 21% of the children under the age of 1 year having the disease are identified in clinics. We report a case of a 1-week-old child of a first-degree consanguineous couple with a symptom of frequent nappy staining. Analysis of urine showed a homogentisic acid concentration exceeding 200 mg/dL. The physical examination revealed that the child was healthy. The parents' watchfulness and the close attention paid to the child were the keys to the early detection of this rare disease. After identifying the disease, adequate follow-up of the patient is important to reduce further complications. Anti-inflammatory therapy and increasing the muscle strength by exercises such as swimming would be useful to restrict joint pains and immobilisation. A low protein diet also could be recommended; that fact is yet to be proven by clinical trials. ",

Because of a genetic deficiency of the enzyme homogentisic acid oxidase, an accumulation of homogentisic acid causes ochronotic pigment deposition. The most common clinical manifestations are arthropathy, urinary calculi and discoloration, cutaneous and cartilaginous pigmentation, and cardiac valvular disease. Arthropathy and aortic stenosis are the most debilitating manifestations of the disease. A case of alkaptonuric aortic stenosis is described. A 75-year-old woman with a history of alkaptonuria presented in the emergency department with complaints of progressive dyspnea. Upon examination, the patient was hypertensive, tachypneic, and tachycardic with premature ventricular contractions. She had pitting edema of the lower extremities and complaints of generalized weakness. Chest x-rays revealed congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema. Diuretics were administered, and a continuous nitroglycerin infusion was initiated in the emergency department. The patient was admitted for further evaluation. The patient's respiratory status continued to decline. She was intubated endotracheally 1 day after admission. Subsequent cardiac evaluation revealed an ejection fraction of 35%, severe aortic stenosis, mild coronary artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and anteroapical akinesis. A dobutamine infusion was instituted for persistent hypotension, and renal dose dopamine was initiated for oliguric renal failure. The patient underwent an emergency operation for an aortic valve replacement with a Dacron patch 10 days after admission. Cardiopulmonary bypass and mild hypothermia were used during the procedure. The patient's hemodynamic status remained tenuous throughout the procedure. Although the first attempt to wean off cardiopulmonary bypass failed, the second attempt was successful with the aid of an intra-aortic balloon pump, inotropic support, and atrioventricular pacing. These measures were maintained during transport to the surgical intensive care unit. In the intensive care unit, the patient did not have an audible blood pressure or a palpable pulse without the support of the intra-aortic balloon pump and atrioventricular pacing. Coarse atrial fibrillation was the underlying electrocardiogram rhythm in the absence of atrioventricular pacing. Sodium bicarbonate was given without improvement. After discussion with the family, all life support measures were discontinued. The patient died 10 minutes after her arrival in the intensive care unit. Alkaptonuria's pathogenesis is manifested as both local and systemic in nature. Collagen vascular diseases share a similar pattern of multisystem involvement. Despite the negative outcome for the patient described, valuable insight can be obtained by studying this case and noting the anesthetic considerations specific to collagen vascular diseases in general.",

We describe a 46-year-old man with alkaptonuria and diabetic renal failure whose plasma HGA concentration was twice that of any other alkaptonuria patient, and whose ochronosis progressed much more rapidly than that of his two alkaptonuric siblings. After renal transplantation, the plasma HGA normalized, and the daily urinary excretion of HGA decreased by 2-3g. This case illustrates the critical role of renal tubular secretion in eliminating HGA from the body, and suggests that renal transplantation in a uremic patient not only restores HGA excretion, but may also provide homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase activity for the metabolism of HGA.",

Cervical spine involvement is exceptional and there is a paucity of reports on surgical interventions in these patients. We explored the literature concerning cervical spine involvement in patients with alkaptonuria. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a review of the literature, in which patients with alkaptonuric degenerative changes of the cervical spine were examined. Articles were obtained from MEDLINE. Search terms included: \"cervical\", \"alkaptonuria\", \"alkaptonuric changes\" and \"black disc\". Additional studies were identified by checking reference lists. Furthermore, we present the case of a 46 year old patient with critical cervical spinal canal stenosis who underwent C6-C7 anterior cervical microdiscectomy and interbody fusion, in order to prevent myelopathic changes. CARE statement guidelines were followed. RESULTS: Peroperatively, we did not encounter any macroscopic abnormalities of the skin, muscles or ligaments. A black discoloration of the nucleus pulposus was observed. Peroperative and postoperative course was uneventful. CONCLUSION: Alkaptonuric degenerative abnormalities most commonly involve the lumbar spine, although the cervical spine can be affected in rare cases. Most frequently, the diagnosis of alkaptonuria can be made based on the clinical phenotype many years before symptoms secondary to ochronotic arthropathy develop. A retrospective diagnosis based on peroperative black discoloration of spinal structures has been described. A black discoloration of the intervertebral disc should encourage the neurosurgeon to further explore the possibility of alkaptonuria, even in the absence of a clear phenotype. Surgical results are mostly satisfactory. Further studies are required in order to better understand this pathology and its postoperative course.",

AKU is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a gene mutation leading to the accumulation of homogentisic acid (HGA). Analogously to other rare conditions, currently there are no approved biomarkers to monitor AKU progression or severity. Although some biomarkers are under evaluation, an extensive biomarker analysis has not been undertaken in AKU yet. In order to fill this gap, we gained access to AKU-related data that we carefully processed, documented and stored in a database, which we named ApreciseKUre. We undertook a suitable statistical analysis by associating every couple of potential biomarkers to highlight significant correlations. Our database is continuously updated allowing us to find novel unpredicted correlations between AKU biomarkers and to confirm system reliability. ApreciseKUre includes data on potential biomarkers, patients' quality of life and clinical outcomes facilitating their integration and possibly allowing a Precision Medicine approach in AKU. This framework may represent an online tool that can be turned into a best practice model for other rare diseases.",

AKUImg includes a new set of AKU images taken from cartilage tissues acquired by means of a microscopic technique. The repository, in accordance to ethical policies, is publicly available after a registration request, to give to scientists the opportunity to study, investigate and compare such precious resources. AKUImg is also integrated with a preliminary but accurate predictive system able to discriminate the presence/absence of AKU by comparing histopatological affected/control images. The algorithm is based on a standard image processing approach, namely histogram comparison, resulting to be particularly effective in performing image classification, and constitutes a useful guide for non-AKU researchers and clinicians.",

Recently, nitisinone treatment, which blocks HGA formation, has been effective in AKU patients. However, a consequence of nitisinone is elevated tyrosine that can cause keratopathy. The effect of tyrosine and phenylalanine dietary restriction was investigated in nitisinone-treated AKU mice, and in an observational study of dietary intervention in AKU patients. Nitisinone-treated AKU mice were fed tyrosine/phenylalanine-free and phenylalanine-free diets with phenylalanine supplementation in drinking water. Tyrosine metabolites were measured pre-nitisinone, post-nitisinone, and after dietary restriction. Subsequently an observational study was undertaken in 10 patients attending the National Alkaptonuria Centre (NAC), with tyrosine >700 mumol/L who had been advised to restrict dietary protein intake and where necessary, to use tyrosine/phenylalanine-free amino acid supplements. Elevated tyrosine (813 mumol/L) was significantly reduced in nitisinone-treated AKU mice fed a tyrosine/phenylalanine-free diet in a dose responsive manner. At 3 days of restriction, tyrosine was 389.3, 274.8, and 144.3 mumol/L with decreasing phenylalanine doses. In contrast, tyrosine was not effectively reduced in mice by a phenylalanine-free diet; at 3 days tyrosine was 757.3, 530.2, and 656.2 mumol/L, with no dose response to phenylalanine supplementation. In NAC patients, tyrosine was significantly reduced (P = .002) when restricting dietary protein alone, and when combined with tyrosine/phenylalanine-free amino acid supplementation; 4 out of 10 patients achieved tyrosine <700 mumol/L. Tyrosine/phenylalanine dietary restriction significantly reduced nitisinone-induced tyrosinemia in mice, with phenylalanine restriction alone proving ineffective. Similarly, protein restriction significantly reduced circulating tyrosine in AKU patients.",

Alkaptonuria most prominently involves the lumbar region, but lumbar disc herniation as the presenting feature of alkaptonuria is not common. Only a few patients required surgical intervention. Herewith we report an alkaptonuric patient, who was operated on for lumbar disc herniation. His discectomy material was black and the metabolic disorder was diagnosed retrospectively. This metabolic disease is often recognized on physical re-examination after the black disc material was seen during the operation. Therefore urinalysis for homogentisic acid should be performed in all patients with degenerative changes of the vertebral column. The results of disc surgery in this patient group is successful.",

Eighteen BALB/c mice were included in this study: HGD-/- (n = 6, treated with nitisinone-4 mg/L, in drinking water); HGD-/- (n = 6, no treatment) and HGD+/- (n = 6, no treatment). RESULTS: Ion intensity and distribution of DPP-TFB derivatives in brain tissue for dopamine, 3-methoxytyramine, noradrenaline, tryptophan, serotonin, and glutamate were not significantly different following treatment with nitisinone in HGD -/- mice, and no significant differences were observed between HGD-/- and HGD+/- mice that received no treatment.

From early age on gradual dark discoloration of his urine had been noticed in the diapers, but routine urinalysis had not revealed abnormalities. Alkaptonuria is a rare metabolic disease in which homogentisic acid cannot be metabolised, due to a lack of the enzyme homogentisic acid oxidase. The disease often manifests itself in childhood by darkening of urine on standing. The excretion of homogentisic acid in urine in these patients is increased. The disease leads to serious consequences, such as ochronosis of cartilage and connective tissues with arthritis. It is expected that treatment with ascorbic acid and a dietary restriction of protein (1 g/kg/day) can decrease the late and serious consequences by diminishing the serum concentration of the metabolite benzoquinone acetic acid.",

Long-term duration of this condition, termed ochronosis, can result in degenerative arthropathy involving the spine and large joints. CASE REPORT This report describes a 55-year-old Jordanian woman presenting with chronic neck and lower back pain. History, physical examination, and radiological imaging indicated cervical myelopathy and lumbar spine degeneration. Two-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion was performed successfully. Intra-operatively, the cervical discs were observed to be black, suggesting a diagnosis of alkaptonuria, which was later confirmed by genetic testing. A detailed history and physical examination revealed the absence of classical features of AKU. CONCLUSIONS Intraoperative detection of black disc material suggests the need for further tests to diagnose AKU, especially in indolent patients who did not have classical clinical features. Surgical management may improve outcomes in patients with cervical myelopathy due to ochronosis.",

Long-term duration of this condition, termed ochronosis, can result in degenerative arthropathy involving the spine and large joints. CASE REPORT This report describes a 55-year-old Jordanian woman presenting with chronic neck and lower back pain. History, physical examination, and radiological imaging indicated cervical myelopathy and lumbar spine degeneration. Two-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion was performed successfully. Intra-operatively, the cervical discs were observed to be black, suggesting a diagnosis of alkaptonuria, which was later confirmed by genetic testing. A detailed history and physical examination revealed the absence of classical features of AKU. CONCLUSIONS Intraoperative detection of black disc material suggests the need for further tests to diagnose AKU, especially in indolent patients who did not have classical clinical features. Surgical management may improve outcomes in patients with cervical myelopathy due to ochronosis.",

Alkaptonuria most prominently involves the lumbar region, but lumbar disc herniation as the presenting feature of alkaptonuria is not common. Only a few patients required surgical intervention. Herewith we report an alkaptonuric patient, who was operated on for lumbar disc herniation. His discectomy material was black and the metabolic disorder was diagnosed retrospectively.

Because of a genetic deficiency of the enzyme homogentisic acid oxidase, an accumulation of homogentisic acid causes ochronotic pigment deposition. The most common clinical manifestations are arthropathy, urinary calculi and discoloration, cutaneous and cartilaginous pigmentation, and cardiac valvular disease. Arthropathy and aortic stenosis are the most debilitating manifestations of the disease. A case of alkaptonuric aortic stenosis is described. A 75-year-old woman with a history of alkaptonuria presented in the emergency department with complaints of progressive dyspnea. Upon examination, the patient was hypertensive, tachypneic, and tachycardic with premature ventricular contractions. She had pitting edema of the lower extremities and complaints of generalized weakness. Chest x-rays revealed congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema. Diuretics were administered, and a continuous nitroglycerin infusion was initiated in the emergency department. The patient was admitted for further evaluation. The patient's respiratory status continued to decline. She was intubated endotracheally 1 day after admission. Subsequent cardiac evaluation revealed an ejection fraction of 35%, severe aortic stenosis, mild coronary artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and anteroapical akinesis. A dobutamine infusion was instituted for persistent hypotension, and renal dose dopamine was initiated for oliguric renal failure. The patient underwent an emergency operation for an aortic valve replacement with a Dacron patch 10 days after admission. Cardiopulmonary bypass and mild hypothermia were used during the procedure. The patient's hemodynamic status remained tenuous throughout the procedure. Although the first attempt to wean off cardiopulmonary bypass failed, the second attempt was successful with the aid of an intra-aortic balloon pump, inotropic support, and atrioventricular pacing. These measures were maintained during transport to the surgical intensive care unit. In the intensive care unit, the patient did not have an audible blood pressure or a palpable pulse without the support of the intra-aortic balloon pump and atrioventricular pacing. Coarse atrial fibrillation was the underlying electrocardiogram rhythm in the absence of atrioventricular pacing. Sodium bicarbonate was given without improvement. After discussion with the family, all life support measures were discontinued. The patient died 10 minutes after her arrival in the intensive care unit. Alkaptonuria's pathogenesis is manifested as both local and systemic in nature. Collagen vascular diseases share a similar pattern of multisystem involvement. Despite the negative outcome for the patient described, valuable insight can be obtained by studying this case and noting the anesthetic considerations specific to collagen vascular diseases in general.",

Recently, nitisinone treatment, which blocks HGA formation, has been effective in AKU patients. However, a consequence of nitisinone is elevated tyrosine that can cause keratopathy. The effect of tyrosine and phenylalanine dietary restriction was investigated in nitisinone-treated AKU mice, and in an observational study of dietary intervention in AKU patients. Nitisinone-treated AKU mice were fed tyrosine/phenylalanine-free and phenylalanine-free diets with phenylalanine supplementation in drinking water. Tyrosine metabolites were measured pre-nitisinone, post-nitisinone, and after dietary restriction. Subsequently an observational study was undertaken in 10 patients attending the National Alkaptonuria Centre (NAC), with tyrosine >700 mumol/L who had been advised to restrict dietary protein intake and where necessary, to use tyrosine/phenylalanine-free amino acid supplements. Elevated tyrosine (813 mumol/L) was significantly reduced in nitisinone-treated AKU mice fed a tyrosine/phenylalanine-free diet in a dose responsive manner. At 3 days of restriction, tyrosine was 389.3, 274.8, and 144.3 mumol/L with decreasing phenylalanine doses. In contrast, tyrosine was not effectively reduced in mice by a phenylalanine-free diet; at 3 days tyrosine was 757.3, 530.2, and 656.2 mumol/L, with no dose response to phenylalanine supplementation. In NAC patients, tyrosine was significantly reduced (P = .002) when restricting dietary protein alone, and when combined with tyrosine/phenylalanine-free amino acid supplementation; 4 out of 10 patients achieved tyrosine <700 mumol/L. Tyrosine/phenylalanine dietary restriction significantly reduced nitisinone-induced tyrosinemia in mice, with phenylalanine restriction alone proving ineffective. Similarly, protein restriction significantly reduced circulating tyrosine in AKU patients.",

                    "abstract": "Alkaptonuria is a rare disease of phenylalanine, aromatic amino acids, and tyrosine metabolism. Because of a genetic deficiency of the enzyme homogentisic acid oxidase, an accumulation of homogentisic acid causes ochronotic pigment deposition. The most common clinical manifestations are arthropathy, urinary calculi and discoloration, cutaneous and cartilaginous pigmentation, and cardiac valvular disease. Arthropathy and aortic stenosis are the most debilitating manifestations of the disease. A case of alkaptonuric aortic stenosis is described. A 75-year-old woman with a history of alkaptonuria presented in the emergency department with complaints of progressive dyspnea. Upon examination, the patient was hypertensive, tachypneic, and tachycardic with premature ventricular contractions. She had pitting edema of the lower extremities and complaints of generalized weakness. Chest x-rays revealed congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema. Diuretics were administered, and a continuous nitroglycerin infusion was initiated in the emergency department. The patient was admitted for further evaluation. The patient's respiratory status continued to decline. She was intubated endotracheally 1 day after admission. Subsequent cardiac evaluation revealed an ejection fraction of 35%, severe aortic stenosis, mild coronary artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and anteroapical akinesis. A dobutamine infusion was instituted for persistent hypotension, and renal dose dopamine was initiated for oliguric renal failure. The patient underwent an emergency operation for an aortic valve replacement with a Dacron patch 10 days after admission. Cardiopulmonary bypass and mild hypothermia were used during the procedure. The patient's hemodynamic status remained tenuous throughout the procedure. Although the first attempt to wean off cardiopulmonary bypass failed, the second attempt was successful with the aid of an intra-aortic balloon pump, inotropic support, and atrioventricular pacing. These measures were maintained during transport to the surgical intensive care unit. In the intensive care unit, the patient did not have an audible blood pressure or a palpable pulse without the support of the intra-aortic balloon pump and atrioventricular pacing. Coarse atrial fibrillation was the underlying electrocardiogram rhythm in the absence of atrioventricular pacing. Sodium bicarbonate was given without improvement. After discussion with the family, all life support measures were discontinued. The patient died 10 minutes after her arrival in the intensive care unit. Alkaptonuria's pathogenesis is manifested as both local and systemic in nature. Collagen vascular diseases share a similar pattern of multisystem involvement. Despite the negative outcome for the patient described, valuable insight can be obtained by studying this case and noting the anesthetic considerations specific to collagen vascular diseases in general.",

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: A 46-year-old man without previous diagnosis of alkaptonuria underwent evaluation for progressive back pain revealing a T1-hyperintense disc herniation at the L3-L4 level. Discectomy recovered a blackened disc that was pathologically confirmed to be nucleus pulposus with alkaptonuric involvement. The differential diagnosis of a T1-hyperintense, T2-hypointense disc on magnetic resonance imaging is discussed, with emphasis on the pathophysiology of alkaptonuria. METHODS: A single patient is reported. RESULTS: Pathologically proven patient presentation with radiological and pathological images. CONCLUSION: We report a rare case of alkaptonuria presenting as a T1-hyperintense disc herniation.",

Analysis of urine showed a homogentisic acid concentration exceeding 200 mg/dL. The physical examination revealed that the child was healthy. The parents' watchfulness and the close attention paid to the child were the keys to the early detection of this rare disease. After identifying the disease, adequate follow-up of the patient is important to reduce further complications. Anti-inflammatory therapy and increasing the muscle strength by exercises such as swimming would be useful to restrict joint pains and immobilisation.

Deficiency of homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase leads to increased homogentisic acid which is deposited as ochronotic pigment. Clinical sequelae include severe early onset osteoarthritis, increased renal and prostate stone formation and cardiac complications. Treatment has been largely based on analgaesia and arthroplasty. The National Alkaptonuria Centre in Liverpool has been using 2 mg nitisinone (NTBC) off-license for all patients in the United Kingdom with alkaptonuria and monitoring the tyrosine metabolite profiles. Methods Patients with confirmed alkaptonuria are commenced on 2 mg dose (alternative days) of NTBC for three months with daily dose thereafter. Metabolite measurement by LC-MS/MS is performed at baseline, day 4, three-months, six-months and one-year post-commencing NTBC. Thereafter, monitoring and clinical assessments are performed annually. Results Urine homogentisic acid concentration decreased from a mean baseline 20,557 micromol/24 h (95th percentile confidence interval 18,446-22,669 micromol/24 h) by on average 95.4% by six months, 94.8% at one year and 94.1% at two year monitoring. A concurrent reduction in serum homogentisic acid concentration of 83.2% compared to baseline was also measured. Serum tyrosine increased from normal adult reference interval to a mean +- SD of 594 +- 184 micromol /L at year-two monitoring with an increased urinary excretion from 103 +- 81 micromol /24 h at baseline to 1071 +- 726 micromol /24 h two years from therapy. Conclusions The data presented represent the first longitudinal survey of NTBC use in an NHS service setting and demonstrate the sustained effect of NTBC on the tyrosine metabolite profile.",
