input_text: 'The cornea in classic type Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: macro- and microstructural
  changes. PURPOSE: To analyze in vivo corneal morphology and ultrastructural features
  in patients with classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). METHODS: Fifty patients with
  classic EDS and 50 age- and sex-matched control subjects were studied. A clinical
  evaluation was made with the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire and
  a complete ophthalmic examination, including assessment of the best-corrected visual
  acuity and refraction, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, tear break-up time, intraocular
  pressure, Schirmer test without topical anesthesia, and corneal diameter. Scheimpflug
  camera topography and in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) were used to investigate
  corneal morphology and corneal ultrastructural features respectively. RESULTS: Classic
  EDS patients, compared to controls, had thinner and steeper corneas (P < 0.001 and
  P < 0.05, respectively; independent samples t-test). IVCM showed thinner stromas,
  lower keratocyte densities (P < 0.001), increased applanation-related stromal folds
  (P < 0.001; Mann-Whitney U test), and increased endothelial hyperreflective dots
  (P < 0.05) in these patients. The study group also had increased symptoms (OSDI
  score: P < 0.01, independent samples t-test) and signs (tear break-up time and Schirmer
  test: P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively) of tear film dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS:
  Patients with classic EDS had macro- and microstructural changes of the cornea,
  which is a target tissue of the disease. These findings should be considered to
  optimize clinical management of these patients and to evaluate the opportunity of
  adding ocular findings to the classic EDS diagnostic criteria.'
