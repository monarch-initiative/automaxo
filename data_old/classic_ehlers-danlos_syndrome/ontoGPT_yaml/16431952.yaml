input_text: 'Structural abnormalities of the cornea and lid resulting from collagen
  V mutations. PURPOSE: Type V collagen forms heterotypic fibrils with type I collagen
  and accounts for 10% to 20% of corneal collagen. The purpose of this study was to
  define the ocular phenotype resulting from mutations in the type V collagen genes
  COL5A1 and COL5A2 and to study the pathogenesis of anomalies in a Col5a1-deficient
  mouse. METHODS: Seven patients with classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) due to
  COL5A1 haploinsufficiency and one with an exon-skipping mutation in COL5A2 underwent
  an ocular examination, corneal topography, pachymetry, and specular microscopy.
  A Col5a1-haploinsufficient mouse model of classic EDS was used for biochemical and
  immunochemical analyses of corneas. Light and electron microscopy were used to quantify
  stromal thickness, fibril density, fibril structure, and diameter. RESULTS: Five
  males and three females (mean age, 26 +/- 13.57 years; range, 11-52) were studied.
  All patients had "floppy eyelids." The corneas of all eyes were thinner (mean corneal
  thickness: 435.75 +/- 12.51 microm) when compared with control corneas (568.89 +/-
  28.46 microm; P < 0.0001). In the Col5a1+/- mouse cornea, type V collagen content
  was reduced by approximately 49%, and stromal thickness was reduced by approximately
  26%. Total collagen deposition in Col5a1(+/-) corneas also was reduced. Collagen
  fibril diameters were increased, but fibril density was decreased throughout the
  stroma at all developmental stages. CONCLUSIONS: In the eye, COL5A1 and COL5A2 mutations
  manifest as abnormally thin and steep corneas with floppy eyelids. Mechanisms involved
  in producing the latter anomalies probably involve altered regulation of collagen
  fibrillogenesis due to abnormalities in heterotypic type I/V collagen interactions
  similar to those observed in the Col5a1+/- mouse cornea.'
