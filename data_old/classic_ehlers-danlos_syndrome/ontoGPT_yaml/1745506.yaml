input_text: 'Temporomandibular joint dysfunction syndrome: a close association with
  systemic joint laxity (the hypermobile joint syndrome) Sixty-two patients admitted
  for elective reconstructive surgery of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and eight
  seen as outpatients with a chief complaint of TMJ dysfunction during the same time
  interval were evaluated for possible etiologic factors contributing to the disease.
  All hospitalized patients had severe, end-stage degenerative changes within the
  TMJ, whereas outpatients had less severe disease and did not require surgery. TMJ
  dysfunction in some patients was said to be a result of established causes including
  bruxism, malocclusion, and trauma. No patient in this series had evidence of a systemic
  inflammatory polyarthritis. Of the 70 patients, 38 (54%) met criteria, based on
  those of Carter and Wilkinson, as modified by Beighton et al., sufficient to warrant
  a diagnosis of the hypermobile joint syndrome. Five patients had classic Ehlers-Danlos
  syndrome and therefore were not patients with "benign hypermobility," and an additional
  two cases were described as "marfanoid" and as possible Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,
  respectively. Radiographs showed TMJ hyperextensibility in four hypermobile patients.
  Long-term surgical outcome was identical in the hypermobile and nonhypermobile groups.
  The incidence of hypermobility in this series is strikingly higher than the expected
  incidence in an otherwise population. Magnetic resonance images of the TMJs on separate
  groups of asymptomatic normal and hypermobile women identified excessive anterior
  movement in the hypermobile group, together with abnormal anterior disk position
  in some. We hypothesize that hypermobility within the TMJ may cause accelerated
  disk destruction and degenerative disease.'
