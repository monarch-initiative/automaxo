input_text: "Acute focal dystonia induced by a tricyclic antidepressant in a patient
  with Wilson disease: a case report. The authors present the case of a 19-year-old
  patient with Wilson disease (WD) who developed symptoms of acute focal dystonia
  of the left hand (a 'starfish' hand presentation) shortly after treatment with the
  tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine. The diagnosis of WD was made 8 months earlier
  based on abnormal copper metabolism parameters and was confirmed by genetic testing.
  Initially, the patient presented with akathisia, sialorrhea, oromandibular dystonia
  (occasionally grimacing) and slight dysarthria. The patient's symptoms diminished
  after treatment with d-penicillamine was initiated. No further deterioration was
  observed after copper-chelating therapy was started. The authors diagnosed acute
  focal dystonia induced by clomipramine. Botulinum toxin and intensive rehabilitation
  was initiated; complete regression of hand dystonia was observed. Based on the case,
  the authors suggest that care should be exercised with regard to starting medications
  that could potentially impact the extrapyramidal system in WD patients. "
