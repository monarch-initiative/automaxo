input_text: "Exchangeable copper: a reflection of the neurological severity in Wilson's
  disease. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The severity of Wilson's disease (WD) is linked
  to free copper accumulating in the liver and brain. Exchangeable copper (CuEXC)
  is a new technique to determine plasmatic copper and is useful in the diagnosis
  of WD. It is hypothesized that it may also enable a good evaluation of extra-hepatic
  involvement and its severity. METHODS: Forty-eight newly diagnosed WD patients were
  prospectively evaluated using hepatic, neurological, ophthalmological and brain
  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scores. Three phenotypic presentations were distinguished:
  pre-symptomatic, hepatic and extra-hepatic. CuEXC was determined in addition to
  standard copper assays before decoppering therapy. Correlations between biological
  parameters and the different scores were determined and compared in the hepatic
  and extra-hepatic groups. RESULTS: Extra-hepatic patients had significantly higher
  CuEXC values than those with the hepatic form (P < 0.0001). The overall ability
  of CuEXC to separate the two forms was satisfactory, with an area under the curve
  of 0.883 (95% confidence interval 0.771-0.996) and an optimal threshold for extra-hepatic
  diagnosis of 2.08 mumol/l (sensitivity 85.7%; specificity 94.1%). In extra-hepatic
  patients, CuEXC was the only biological marker to be positively correlated with
  the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Score (r = 0.45, P = 0.016), the Kayser-Fleischer
  ring score (r = 0.46, P = 0.014) and the brain MRI score (r = 0.38, P = 0.048),
  but it was not correlated with the hepatic score. CONCLUSIONS: Exchangeable copper
  determination is useful when diagnosing WD as a value >2.08 mumol/l is indicative
  of the severity of the extra-hepatic involvement. In the case of purely hepatic
  presentation, atypical or mild neurological signs, it should encourage physicians
  to search for lesions in the brain and eyes."
