input_text: '[Ecchymosis as the presenting manifestation of Wilson disease: A case
  report]. INTRODUCTION: The presence of a psychiatric disorder during the course
  of an organic disease is a common cause of delayed diagnosis. CASE REPORT: We report
  a 16-year-old girl who was admitted with thrombocytopenia and had a two-year history
  of neuropsychiatric disorder which was attributed to a difficult family situation.
  Neurological examination showed a frontal lobe disorder and extrapyramidal manifestations.
  The thrombocytopenia was attributed to liver cirrhosis. These neurological and hepatic
  injuries were consistent with a metabolic disease, most likely Wilson disease. This
  was supported by the presence of a corneal Kayser-Fleischer ring and a decreased
  ceruloplasmin concentration. An urgent liver transplantation was required due to
  worsening neurological symptoms. CONCLUSION: Wilson disease is a rare genetic disease
  caused by copper toxicity. It is characterized by combined hepatic and neurologic
  damage to varying degrees and can develop at any age. Urgent treatment is required,
  but the diagnosis may be delayed by prevailing psychiatric symptoms.'
