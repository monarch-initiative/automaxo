input_text: 'Small fiber peripheral neuropathy in Wilson disease: an in vivo documentation
  by corneal confocal microscopy. PURPOSE: Wilson disease (WD) is a disorder of hepatic
  copper metabolism leading to copper accumulation in hepatocytes and in extrahepatic
  organs, as the brain and cornea. The aim of this study was to investigate central
  corneal changes and in particular to assess the parameters of corneal subbasal nerve
  plexus (SBNP) in patients affected by WD, using corneal confocal microscopy (CCM).
  METHODS: A total of 24 patients affected by WD and 24 healthy control subjects were
  included in this cross-sectional comparative study. One eye of each subject was
  examined to quantify different corneal parameters. Mean cell diameter and mean cell
  density of the epithelium; number of fibers (NF), nerve fiber length density (NFLD),
  number of branchings (NBr), number of beadings (NBe), and fiber tortuosity (FT)
  of the SBNP; mean cell density of keratocytes of the anterior, medium, and posterior
  stroma; and mean cell density, polimegatism, and pleomorphism of the endothelium,
  and central corneal sensitivity were analyzed. RESULTS: Wilson disease induced significant
  alterations in SBNP, and corneal epithelium. The NFLD (P < 0.0001), NF (P = 0.001),
  NBe (P = 0.025), and NBr (P < 0.0001) were significantly lower, whereas FT (P <
  0.0001) was significantly higher in WD subjects compared to controls. Moreover mean
  epithelial cell diameter (P < 0.0001) and mean epithelial cell density (P < 0.0001)
  were significantly higher and lower compared to controls, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:
  The CCM showed significant corneal changes in SBNP, with concomitant corneal epithelium
  changes in WD, demonstrating the presence of small fiber peripheral neuropathy in
  these patients. The CCM may contribute to diagnosis and monitoring of the peripheral
  nervous system involvement in WD.'
