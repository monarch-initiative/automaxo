input_text: 'Inborn errors of copper metabolism. Two copper-transporting ATPases are
  essential for mammalian copper homeostasis: ATP7A, which mediates copper uptake
  in the gastrointestinal tract and copper delivery to the brain, and ATP7B, which
  mediates copper excretion by the liver into bile. Mutations in ATP7A may cause three
  distinct X-linked conditions in infants, children, or adolescents: Menkes disease,
  occipital horn syndrome (OHS), and a newly identified allelic variant restricted
  to motor neurons called X-linked distal hereditary motor neuropathy. These three
  disorders show variable neurological findings and ages of onset. Menkes disease
  presents in the first several months of life with failure to thrive, developmental
  delay, and seizures. OHS features more subtle developmental delays, dysautonomia,
  and connective tissue abnormalities beginning in early childhood. ATP7A-related
  distal motor neuropathy presents even later, often not until adolescence or early
  adulthood, and involves a neurological phenotype that resembles Charcot-Marie-Tooth
  disease, type 2. These disorders may be treatable through copper replacement or
  ATP7A gene therapy. In contrast, mutations in ATP7B cause a single known phenotype,
  Wilson disease, an autosomal recessive trait that results from copper overload rather
  than deficiency. Dysarthria, dystonia, tremor, gait abnormalities, and psychiatric
  problems may be presenting symptoms, at ages from 10 to 40 years. Excellent treatment
  options exist for Wilson disease, based on copper chelation. In the past 2 years
  (2012-2013), three new autosomal recessive copper metabolism conditions have been
  recognized: 1) Huppke-Brendel syndrome caused by mutations in an acetyl CoA transporter
  needed for acetylation of one or more copper proteins, 2) CCS deficiency caused
  by mutations in the copper chaperone to SODI, and 3) MEDNIK syndrome, which revealed
  that mutations in the sigma1A subunit of adaptor protein complex 1 (AP-1) have detrimental
  effects on trafficking of ATP7A and ATP7B.'
