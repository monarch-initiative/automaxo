  disorders. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder. In 2015,
  The Movement Disorder Society Clinical Diagnostic Criteria for PD was published.
  In the criteria, the absolute exclusion criteria and red flags were designed to
  minimize diagnostic error, in particular to differentiate from neurodegenerative
  or secondary parkinsonism. Here, we reviewed neurodegenerative disorders that we
  should differentiate from PD. The common differential diagnoses, such as multiple
  system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, dementia
  with Lewy bodies, and essential tremor are important but sometimes difficult to
  differentiate. We also described the features of rare but important differential
  diagnoses: neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease, Perry syndrome, Fragile X tremor/ataxia
  syndrome, Huntington's disease, dopa-responsive dystonia, Wilson disease, and neurodegeneration
  wit,1 brain iron accumulation."

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
