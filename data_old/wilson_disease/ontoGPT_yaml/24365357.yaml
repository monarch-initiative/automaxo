input_text: 'Disorders of heavy metals. Heavy metals and trace elements play an important
  role in relation to the physiology and pathology of the nervous system. Neurologic
  diseases related to disorders of metabolism of copper and iron are reviewed. Copper
  disorders are divided into two classes: ATP7A- or ATP7B-related inherited copper
  transport disorders (Menkes disease, occipital horn syndrome, ATP7A-related distal
  motor neuropathy, and Wilson disease) and acquired diseases associated with copper
  deficiency or copper excess. Iron brain disorders are divided into genetic neurodegeneration
  with brain iron accumulation (NBIA, neuroferritinopathy, and aceruloplasminemia),
  genetic systemic iron accumulation with neurologic features (hemochromatosis), and
  acquired diseases associated with iron excess (superficial siderosis) or iron deficiency
  (restless leg syndrome). The main features of cadmium, lead, aluminum, mercury,
  and manganese toxicity are summarized. '
