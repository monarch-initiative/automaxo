input_text: 'Characterizing brain mineral deposition in patients with Wilson disease
  using susceptibility-weighted imaging. AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate
  the feasibility of characterizing the brain-mineral deposition in patients with
  Wilson disease (WD) using susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI). MATERIALS AND METHODS:
  The study enrolled 30 WD patients and 20 age-matched healthy controls. Neurological
  symptoms were scored using the modified Young Scale. The hepatic function indices,
  serum and urinary copper content, and serum iron content were determined. All study
  objects received the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and SWI test of the brain.
  The values of corrected phase (CP) were calculated on SWI. The relationship between
  CP values and the clinical status were evaluated. RESULTS: The serum iron content
  of WD patients was higher than the normal. The CP values of substantia nigra, caudate
  nucleus, and globus pallidus of WD were lower than the normal values, while the
  CP value of substantia nigra was the lowest. No correlations were determined between
  the CP values and the iron and copper parameters. There was negative correlation
  between the scores of dysarthria and the CP values of the globus pallidus. There
  was negative correlation between the scores of tremor and the CP values of caudate
  nucleus. Some regions, which had high signals on T2-weighted image, had low signals
  on SWI. CONCLUSIONS: There might be abnormal iron metabolism in patients with WD.
  The decreased CP values might reflect a deposition of both copper and iron. SWI
  may be more sensitive than the ordinary MRI. The mineral deposition may contribute
  to the neural symptoms.'
