input_text: 'Transient elastography compared to liver biopsy and morphometry for predicting
  fibrosis in pediatric chronic liver disease: Does etiology matter? AIM: To evaluate
  transient elastography (TE) as a noninvasive tool in staging liver fibrosis compared
  with liver biopsy and morphometry in children with different chronic liver diseases.
  METHODS: A total of 90 children [50 with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV), 20 with
  autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and 20 with Wilson disease] were included in the study
  and underwent liver stiffness measurement (LSM) using TE. Liver biopsies were evaluated
  for fibrosis, qualitatively, by Ishak score and quantitatively by fibrosis area
  fraction (FAF) using digital image analysis (morphometry). LSM was correlated with
  fibrosis and other studied variables using spearman correlation. A stepwise multiple
  regression analysis was also performed to examine independent factors associated
  with LSM. Different cut-off values of LSM were calculated for predicting individual
  fibrosis stages using receiver-operating characteristic curve. Cut-off values with
  optimal clinical performance (optimal sensitivity and specificity simultaneously)
  were selected. RESULTS: The majority of HCV group had minimal activity (80%) and
  no/mild fibrosis (72%). On the other hand, the majority of AIH group had mild to
  moderate activity (70%) and moderate to severe fibrosis (95%) and all Wilson disease
  group had mild to moderate activity (100%) and moderate to severe fibrosis (100%).
  LSM correlated significantly with both FAF and Ishak scores and the correlation
  appeared better with the latter (r = 0.839 vs 0.879, P < 0.0001 for both). LSM discriminated
  individual stages of fibrosis with high performance. Sensitivity ranged from 81.4%
  to 100% and specificity ranged from 75.0% to 97.2%. When we compared LSM values
  for the same stage of fibrosis, they varied according to the different etiologies.
  Higher values were in AIH (16.15 +- 7.23 kPa) compared to Wilson disease (8.30 +-
  0.84 kPa) and HCV groups (7.43 +- 1.73 kPa). Multiple regression analysis revealed
  that Ishak fibrosis stage was the only independent variable associated with higher
  LSM (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: TE appears reliable in distinguishing different stages
  of liver fibrosis in children. However, its values vary according to the disease
  type. For that, a disease-specific estimation of cut-off values for fibrosis staging
  is worthy.'
