input_text: 'Influence of Liver Transplantation on Neuropsychiatric Manifestations
  of Wilson Disease. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate the effect of liver
  transplantation on the neuropsychological manifestations of Wilson disease. MATERIALS
  AND METHODS: Nine of 42 Wilson disease patients had neuropsychological symptoms
  before liver transplantation. They were 7 male and 2 female subjects with a median
  age of 19 years (range 10 to 25). They were analyzed for their preoperative and
  postoperative hepatic, neurological, and psychological scores described by the Unified
  Wilson Disease Rating Scale after a mean 36.6 months of follow-up. RESULTS: Preoperative
  mean Model for End-Stage Liver Disease and Child-Pugh scores were 18.3 (range 15
  to 26) and 8.9 (range 6 to 12), respectively. One patient had acute postoperative
  ischemic stroke unrelated to Wilson disease and was excluded from the statistical
  analysis. Preoperative and postoperative hepatic, neurological, and psychological
  scores of the remaining 8 patients were 7.4 +- 2.3 vs 2.4 +- 1.3 (P = .0005), 17.7
  +- 11.7 vs 12.7 +- 12.5 (P = .055), and 9.0 +- 1.7 vs 7.0 +- 2.1 (P = .033). CONCLUSIONS:
  Liver transplantation for Wilson disease can provide some improvement of the neuropsychological
  symptoms in addition to the hepatic recovery.'
