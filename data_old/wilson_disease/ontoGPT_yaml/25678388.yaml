input_text: 'Hepatic steatosis in Wilson disease--Role of copper and PNPLA3 mutations.
  BACKGROUND & AIMS: The earliest characteristic alterations of the liver pathology
  in Wilson disease (WD) include steatosis, which is sometimes indistinguishable from
  non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Steatosis in WD may reflect copper-induced
  mitochondrial dysfunction. A genetic polymorphism in rs738409, in the patatin-like
  phospholipase domain-containing 3 gene (PNPLA3), is strongly associated with appearance
  of in NAFLD. This study evaluated the role of PNPLA3 and hepatic copper content
  for development of steatosis in patients with WD. METHODS: Liver biopsies obtained
  at diagnosis and the PNPLA3 genotype were analyzed in 98 Caucasian patients with
  WD (male: 52 [53.1%]; mean age: 27.6 years [CI 95%: 24.8-30.4, range: 5.8-61.5]).
  Steatosis was graded as percentage of lipid containing hepatocytes by an expert
  hepatopathologist unaware of the results of genetic testing. RESULTS: Moderate/severe
  steatosis (>33% of hepatocytes) was observed in 28 patients (pediatric: n=13/26
  [50.0%], adult: n=15/72 [20.8%]; p=0.01). Forty-six patients (46.9%; pediatric:
  n=7, adult: n=39; p=0.022) had cirrhosis. Multivariate logistic regression identified
  PNPLA3 G allele (OR: 2.469, CI 95%: 1.203-5.068; p=0.014) and pediatric age (OR:
  4.348; 1.577-11.905; p=0.004) as independent variables associated with moderate/severe
  steatosis. In contrast, hepatic copper content did not impact on moderate/severe
  steatosis (OR: 1.000, CI 95%: 1.000-1.001; p=0.297). CONCLUSIONS: Steatosis is common
  in WD and the PNPLA3 G allele contributes to its pathogenesis. The role of hepatic
  copper concentration and ATP7B mutations in steatosis development deserve further
  investigations.'
