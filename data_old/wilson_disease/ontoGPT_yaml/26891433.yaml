input_text: "[Wilson's disease - a case report]. Wilson's disease (WD) or hepatolenticular
  degeneration, is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by mutations
  in the Wilson disease protein (ATP7B) gene. It is characterized by impaired copper
  metabolism leading to its accumulation in various tissues and organs, including
  the liver and central nervous system, this results in the development of characteristic
  liver disease and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Liver symptoms usually appear during
  first three decades of life, while psychiatric symptoms are observed in people who
  are in their twenties or older. WD is one of few genetic diseases that can be effectively
  treated with pharmacotherapy. However, some cases, especially diagnosed late in
  the course of the disease, may not respond well to treatment. Here we present a
  case of a 22-year-old male with neurological, psychiatric and liver disease symptoms
  as an example of diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in patients. Wilson's disease
  (WD) should be considered in all patients presenting with neurological, psychiatric
  and liver disease symptoms especially those of young age. "
