input_text: Auxiliary Partial Orthotopic Living Liver Transplant for Wilson Disease.Wilson
  disease is a genetic disease involving copper metabolism disturbances that result
  in copper accumulations, especially in the liver and brain. Wilson disease can be
  treated with pharmacologic agents, such as chelators that induce urinary excretion
  of copper or zinc salts that inhibit copper absorption in the digestive tract. Liver
  transplant is the only treatment option for Wilson disease when liver failure has
  occurred. In some patients, that is, in those with Child-Pugh A score, neurologic
  disease can be seen without hepatic failure. Our recommendation is for these patients
  to have auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplant. Here, we present a 36-year-old
  male patient with neurologic disease associated with Wilson disease who had successful
  related living-donor auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplant using a left
  lobe. The patient, as a result of neurologic symptoms that included tremor walking
  and speaking problems and low serum ceruloplasmin level of 7 mg/dL, was diagnosed
  with Wilson disease, and a liver biopsy was performed. Chronic necroinflammatory
  disease activity was 4/18, and the patient received chelation treatment. His hepatic
  functions were normal. The donor was the patient's 57-year-old father whose liver
  function tests were also normal. The graft-to-recipient weight ratio was 1% using
  a left lobe graft. After transplant, serum ceruloplasmin levels on day 15 and month
  1 were 14 and 19 mg/dL. At month 1, liver function tests were normal. Doppler ultrasonography
  showed normal vascular flow of the native liver and the graft. The patient's neurologic
  symptoms were progressively reduced. Progressive neurologic deterioration with no
  hepatic insufficiency is considered a suitable indication for auxiliary partial
  orthotopic liver transplant; this procedure is suggested before the neurologic and
  liver failure symptoms of Wilson disease occur.
