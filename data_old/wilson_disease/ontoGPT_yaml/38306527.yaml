input_text: 'A rare presentation of Wilson disease with neurological symptoms: Case
  report and genetic analysis. RATIONALE: Wilson disease is a rare genetic disorder
  primarily associated with hepatic symptoms; however, its unique neurological presentation
  remains a subject of interest in the medical literature. This case report contributes
  to existing knowledge by highlighting the unusual manifestation of Wilson disease
  with significant neurological symptoms. PATIENT CONCERNS: The patient, pseudonym
  John Smith, presented with prominent neurological symptoms, including tremors, dystonia,
  and psychiatric manifestations. Clinical findings corroborated copper accumulation
  in the brain, prompting a thorough diagnostic investigation. DIAGNOSES: Genetic
  analysis revealed two ATP7B mutations, confirming the primary diagnosis of Wilson
  disease. This case underscores the importance of recognizing atypical neurological
  presentations in the context of this rare genetic disorder. INTERVENTIONS: Chelation
  therapy, initiated promptly upon diagnosis, targeted copper overload. The intervention
  led to notable improvements in neurological symptoms and psychiatric manifestations.
  The dosage and duration of treatment were adjusted based on regular monitoring.
  OUTCOMES: Regular follow-up revealed a positive trajectory, with reduced tremors
  and improved overall well-being. Genetic testing, coupled with clinical assessments,
  contributed to monitoring treatment efficacy and optimizing therapeutic interventions.
  LESSONS: The main takeaway lessons from this case include the significance of a
  comprehensive diagnostic approach, personalized therapeutic interventions, and the
  imperative to acknowledge the diverse clinical spectrum of Wilson disease. Early
  recognition and tailored treatment contribute to favorable outcomes in cases with
  atypical neurological presentations.'
