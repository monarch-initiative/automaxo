input_text: 'Clinical presentations of Wilson disease among Polish children. INTRODUCTION:
  Wilson disease (WD) may present from early childhood up to the eighth decade, presenting
  with variable hepatic and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Establishing the diagnosis
  is straightforward if the major clinical and laboratory features are present. However,
  clinical phenotypes are highly varied and early, proper diagnosis can be challenging.
  AIM: The aim of our study was to analyze clinical presentations and diagnostic tests
  of Polish pediatric patients with WD. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed medical
  history of 156 patients with confirmed diagnosis of WD treated at our Institute
  from 1996 till March 2016. RESULTS: The mean age at onset of symptoms was 10.15+-4.23
  years of age. Hepatic presentation was the most common one (94.23%) with either
  liver failure (16.03%) or more frequently increased transaminases (78.2%). In 90.26%
  cases ceruloplasmin serum concentration was <=0,2 g/l, in 51.93% patients basal
  urinary copper excretion was >100 mug/24 h. Mutation analysis was performed in 155
  (99.36%) cases. The most common mutation was p.H1069Q. CONCLUSIONS: Wilson disease
  can present with only significantly increased transaminases activity and hepatomegaly
  or liver failure, but neurological symptoms are very rare in children. Diagnostic
  approach is challenging due to wide spectrum of clinical presentations in a high
  variable degree of severity. Genetic screening is supportive, ceruloplasmin and
  urinary copper excretion are valuable tests in the majority of patients but do not
  allow to exclude WD.'
