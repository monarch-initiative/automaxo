input_text: 'Trientine induced colitis during therapy for Wilson disease: a case report
  and review of the literature. BACKGROUND: Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive
  disorder of human copper metabolism characterized by copper accumulation in the
  liver due to impaired excretion of copper into the bile. Brain accumulation of copper
  may cause neuropsychiatric symptoms. Trientine (triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride)
  is a copper-chelating agent used to treat patients with WD. Trientine has been considered
  an option for initial treatment and maintentance therapy of WD due to its safety
  profile. CASE PRESENTATION: A 40 year old female with a recent diagnosis of WD was
  started on treatment with trientine for her WD. Within one month she developed profound
  bloody diarrhea unresponsive to medical treatment. Trientine was discontinued and
  a colonoscopy with biopsy showed moderately active ileitis and moderate to severe
  pancolitis, consistent with a drug induced mucosal injury. The colitis improved
  immediately upon withdrawal of trientine, and recurred when medication was rechallenged
  because of worsened WD symptoms. After second compulsory discontinuation of trientine,
  she remained on zinc therapy for her WD and her colitis resolved by time. CONCLUSION:
  Drug induced colitis is a very rare side effect of trientine. Although trientine
  therapy is well tolerated and less side effects are reported with this medication
  than penicillamine, colitis can occur during trientine treatment. Zinc therapy may
  be an effective alternative for treatment of WD in patients experiencing side effects
  from chelation therapy.'
