input_text: '[The Relationship of the Degree of Impairment of the Structure and Function
  of the Liver with its Chronic Illnesses in Children]. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to
  on the basis of determining the degree of violation of the structure and function
  of the liver establish their relationships and to assess the dynamics of liver disease
  in its chronic illnesses in children. METHODS: With the help of the developed scoring
  systems were used to assess the degree of liver dysfunction and the degree of disruption
  of the structure of the liver and the severity of portal hypertension. RESULTS:
  The results of the diagnostic methods 252 children aged 1 to 17 years (mean age
  of 11.8+-3,5) with Wilson disease (WD), autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), chronic hepatitis
  C (CHC) were analyzed; 48 patients underwent liver transplantation. In children
  with WD, AIHand CHC liverfunction reduced by 41.3+-12.9% to 28.8+-12.5% and 19.1+-7.8%
  respectively. Structure of the liver in children with WD, AIH and CHC was disturbed
  by 25.0+-8.1% to 20.4+-9.2% and 6.8+-4.4% respectively. Thefunction and structure
  violations of the liver more pronounced in liver cirrhosis. The use of the developed
  scoring systems to monitor the severity of liver damage in the dynamics and evaluation
  of the effectiveness of the therapy is demonstrated. The degree of liver dysfunction
  is directly dependent on the degree of its structure. Abnormal liverfunction >=40%
  and >=40% of its structure with treatment failure can be used as a criterion of
  indicationsfor elective liver transplantation with its chronic diseases in children.
  CONCLUSION: Developed a point system to determine liver function and a point system
  to determine disruption of the structure of the liver and the severity of portal
  hypertension in children can serve as an objective criterion for assessing the severity
  of liver disease, monitoring their changes in the dynamics with the assessment of
  the effectiveness of the therapy and making decisions about the need for routine
  liver transplantation in its chronic illnesses in children.'
