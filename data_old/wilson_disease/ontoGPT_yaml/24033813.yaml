input_text: "Factors that predict mortality in children with Wilson disease associated
  acute liver failure and comparison of Wilson disease specific prognostic indices.
  BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Wilson disease (WD) associated acute liver failure (ALF) affects
  children more than adults. The predictors of mortality and outcome in patients without
  encephalopathy are not clear. We investigated the ability of prognostic factors
  and various models including model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) to predict
  mortality among children with WD and ALF. METHODS: We analyzed the admission characteristics
  in 61 children <18 years with WD and ALF. Factors associated with mortality on univariate
  Cox regression analysis were analyzed by forward stepwise Cox hazards regression.
  The prognostic models such as Nazer's model, revised Kings College Model, and pediatric
  end-stage liver disease/model for end-stage liver disease (PELD/MELD) score were
  compared. RESULTS: Of the 145 children < 18 years with WD, 61 experienced ALF of
  whom 33 (54%) died, including 22/27 (81.5%) with encephalopathy and 11/34 (32.4%)
  without encephalopathy. The mean age of children with ALF was 9.7 years, 38(62.3%)
  were boys. Prognostic factors significant for mortality included encephalopathy,
  international normalized ratio, total proteins, total and direct bilirubin, alkaline
  phosphatase, serum creatinine, and white blood cell count. Forward stepwise Cox
  proportional hazards regression identified encephalopathy (hazard ratio 2.88; CI
  1.1-7.4) and total bilirubin (hazard ratio 1.05; CI: 1.02-1.09) as predictors of
  outcome. The area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of the Nazer index, revised
  King's College Criteria, and PELD/MELD were 0.74, 0.76, and 0.75, respectively.
  CONCLUSIONS: Mortality in children with WD and ALF is 54% including 81.5% with encephalopathy
  and 32.4% without encephalopathy. The prognostic models, MELD/PELD score, Nazer
  index and Kings College Criteria are comparable with a AUC between 0.74-0.76."
