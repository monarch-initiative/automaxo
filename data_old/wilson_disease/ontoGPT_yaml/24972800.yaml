input_text: 'Search for rare liver diseases: the case of glycosylation defects mimicking
  Wilson Disease. Pediatric hepatology appears to be a very specific field of paediatrics
  which deals mainly with rare diseases although clinical features can be commonly
  found - like increased activity of transaminases. Some of these rare diseases like
  Wilson disease are commonly looked for and recently Wilsonian like phenotypes have
  been described which additionally presented with abnormal glycosylation of the plasma
  protein transferrin. In a subgroup of those patients with specific additional clinical
  symptoms (cleft uvula, low blood sugar, rhabdomyolysis and dilated cardiomyopathy)
  phosphoglucomutase 1 deficiency was identified. We recommend screening for abnormal
  glycosylation of the plasma protein transferrin in children with unexplained liver
  injury.'
