input_text: Copper induces hepatocyte injury due to the endoplasmic reticulum stress
  in cultured cells and patients with Wilson disease. Copper is an essential trace
  element, however, excess copper is harmful to human health. Excess copper-derived
  oxidants contribute to the progression of Wilson disease, and oxidative stress induces
  accumulation of abnormal proteins. It is known that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
  plays an important role in proper protein folding, and that accumulation of misfolded
  proteins disturbs ER homeostasis resulting in ER stress. However, copper-induced
  ER homeostasis disturbance has not been fully clarified. We treated human hepatoma
  cell line (Huh7) and immortalized-human hepatocyte cell line (OUMS29) with copper
  and chemical chaperones, including 4-phenylbutyrate and ursodeoxycholic acid. We
  examined copper-induced oxidative stress, ER stress and apoptosis by immunofluorescence
  microscopy and immunoblot analyses. Furthermore, we examined the effects of copper
  on carcinogenesis. Excess copper induced not only oxidative stress but also ER stress.
  Furthermore, excess copper induced DNA damage and reduced cell proliferation. Chemical
  chaperones reduced this copper-induced hepatotoxicity. Excess copper induced hepatotoxicity
  via ER stress. We also confirmed the abnormality of ultra-structure of the ER of
  hepatocytes in patients with Wilson disease. These findings show that ER stress
  plays a pivotal role in Wilson disease, and suggests that chemical chaperones may
  have beneficial effects in the treatment of Wilson disease.
