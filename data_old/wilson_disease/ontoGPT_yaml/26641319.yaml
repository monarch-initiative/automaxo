input_text: 'Pediatric liver diseases: current challenges and future perspectives.
  Chronic liver diseases in children represent a rising problem with significant effects
  on public health. In fact, several pediatric liver diseases are precursors of adult
  chronic hepatopathies, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The prevalence of
  liver diseases in children is unknown. In the USA, every year, 15,000 children are
  hospitalized for liver diseases, but these disorders continue to be under-recognized
  or diagnosed late. The main reason is due to the frequent absence of symptoms in
  the vast majority of liver diseases, especially in the early stages. In the last
  few decades several advances have been made in understanding the pathogenesis of
  liver diseases, permitting the discovery of new therapeutic targets to treat liver
  diseases, thus improving the natural history of these disorders. In this article
  we discuss the most recent advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis, diagnosis
  and treatment of the most frequent pediatric liver diseases. '
