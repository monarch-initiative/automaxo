input_text: 'Zinc mono-therapy in pre-symptomatic Chinese children with Wilson disease:
  a single center, retrospective study. BACKGROUND: There is no official consensus
  regarding zinc therapy in pre-symptomatic children with Wilson Disease (WD); more
  data is needed. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the safety and efficacy of zinc gluconate
  therapy for Chinese children with pre-symptomatic WD. METHODS: We retrospectively
  analyzed pre-symptomatic children receiving zinc gluconate in a single Chinese center
  specialized in pediatric hepatology. Short-term follow-up data on safety and efficacy
  were presented, and effects of different zinc dosages were compared. RESULTS: 30
  children (21 males) aged 2.7 to 16.8 years were followed for up to 4.4 years; 26
  (87%) children had abnormal ALT at baseline. Most patients (73%) received higher
  than the currently recommended dose of elemental zinc. Zinc gluconate significantly
  reduced mean ALT (p<0.0001), AST (p<0.0001), GGT (p<0.0001) levels after 1 month,
  and urinary copper excretion after 6 months (p<0.0054). Mean direct bilirubin levels
  dropped significantly at 1 month (p = 0.0175), 3 months (p = 0.0010), and 6 months
  (p = 0.0036). Serum zinc levels gradually increased and reached a significantly
  higher level after 6 months (p<0.0026), reflecting good compliance with the therapy.
  Complete blood count parameters did not change throughout the analysis period. 8
  children experienced mild and transient gastrointestinal side effects. The higher
  zinc dose did not affect treatment response and was not associated with different
  or increased side effects when compared to conventional zinc dose. CONCLUSION: In
  our cohort, zinc gluconate therapy for Chinese children with pre-symptomatic WD
  was effective, and higher initial dose of elemental zinc had the same level of efficacy
  as the conventional dose.'
