input_text: "Spasmodic muscle cramps and weakness as presenting symptoms in Wilson
  disease. Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal-recessive disorder of hepatic copper
  metabolism that has tremendous variability in its presentation. Phenotypic diversity
  of the disease can lead to delayed diagnosis. We describe a case of WD in a 10-year-old
  boy presenting with 3 months of increasingly intense, spasmodic lower extremity
  muscle cramps. Physical examination revealed tenderness on calf palpation and dark
  flat lesions over his ankles, knees, and elbows. Initial testing revealed creatine
  kinase of 302 IU/L (normal 24-248 IU/L), hemoglobin of 8.9 g/dL (11.5-15.5 g/dL),
  aspartate aminotransferase of 114 IU/L (16-52 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase of
  54 IU/L (2-30 IU/L), and myoglobinuria. Extensive evaluation of his myopathy, including
  MRI and muscle biopsy, was negative. Additional laboratory tests revealed a prothrombin
  time of 21.3 seconds (11.8-15.5 seconds), total bilirubin of 1.4 mg/dL (<1 mg/dL),
  direct bilirubin of 0.5 mg/dL (<0.3 mg/dL), albumin of 2.1 g/dL (3.1-4.6 g/dL),
  a reticulocyte percentage of 4.5% (0.5%-2.5%), a negative Coombs direct antibody
  test, ceruloplasmin of 3 mg/dL (21-51 mg/dL), and 24-h urine copper of 393 mug/24
  h (15-60 mug/24 h). Liver biopsy showed patchy advanced fibrosis, mild inflammation,
  positive staining for copper, and a tissue copper concentration of 768 microg/g
  (10-35 mug/g). Brain MRI revealed symmetric intrinsic T1 shortening within bilateral
  basal ganglia. Trientene therapy was initiated for WD. Symptoms and laboratory abnormalities
  resolved and remain normal at 21 months' follow-up. Musculoskeletal involvement
  in WD is uncommon and typically defined as bone demineralization, arthropathy, or
  hypokalemic muscle weakness. In patients with unexplained musculoskeletal symptoms
  and hepatic abnormalities, a diagnosis of WD should be considered and appropriate
  evaluation initiated. "
