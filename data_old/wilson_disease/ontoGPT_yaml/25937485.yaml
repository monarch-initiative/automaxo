input_text: Cholestatic liver disease masquerading as Wilson disease. Wilson disease
  and cholestatic liver diseases may present as a diagnostic dilemma if standard guidelines
  incorporating markers of copper overload are followed. We hereby present a series
  of four cases of sclerosing cholangitis masquerading as Wilson disease. True Wilson
  disease cases had significantly lower ceruloplasmin (6 vs. 16 mg/dL) and higher
  24-hour urinary copper (322.3 vs. 74.5 mug/day) as compared to mimickers. Initial
  low serum ceruloplasmin levels normalized in mimickers on follow up, and this may
  used as a diagnostic indicator. Standard Wilson disease diagnostic criteria thus
  need further modification especially in developing countries to help avoid mismanagement.
