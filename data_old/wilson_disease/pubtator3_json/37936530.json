                    "text": "INTRODUCTION: Liver transplantation (LT) has emerged as a lifesaving modality for many liver diseases in children. Pediatric LT is an established treatment in the Western world but is relatively a new procedure in resource-limited countries like Pakistan. The study aims to highlight the outcomes and survival of pediatric recipients from the first pediatric liver transplant center in Pakistan. METHOD: A retrospective analysis of pediatric LT was done from 2012 to 2019. The study was conducted in the Hepatobiliary and liver transplant department of Shifa International Hospital (SIH), Islamabad. A detailed analysis for indications for pediatric LT, survival, and complications was done. RESULTS: Forty-five patients under 18 years of age underwent Living donor liver transplant (LDLT) in SIH. Median age was 9 years and M:F of 2:1. Cryptogenic liver disease followed by Wilson disease were the two most common indications of LT. The majority of patients had chronic liver disease 34 (75%) while 11 (24%) had acute liver failure. The right lobe graft was the most common type of graft 19 (42.2%). Thirty days, 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival was 77.8%, 75.6%, 73.3%, and 60.6% respectively. Mortality was highest in patients with biliary atresia 4 (33%). Causes of death included pulmonary embolism, sepsis, surgical complications, and acute kidney injury. Mean survival was 88.850 months (+-7.899) (CI 73.369-104.331). CONCLUSION: Pediatric LDLT has offered disease-free survival for patients. Survival can improve further with nutritional rehabilitation and anticipation and management of post-operative complications.",
