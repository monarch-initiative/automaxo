input_text: Diagnostic value of proton MR spectroscopy and diffusion-weighted MR imaging
  in childhood inherited neurometabolic brain diseases and review of the literature.
  The purpose of this study is to evaluate parenchymal diffusion properties and metabolite
  ratios in affected brain tissues of inherited neurometabolic brain diseases with
  an overview of the current literature about the diagnostic data of both techniques
  in childhood inherited metabolic brain diseases. The study group was consisting,
  19 patients (15 males, 4 females; mean age, 54 months (4.5 years); age range, 1-171
  months (14.25 years)) diagnosed with inherited neurometabolic brain disease. Single-
  and multivoxel proton MRS was carried out and NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr, mI/Cr, Glx/Cr ratios
  were calculated. Presence of lactate peak and abnormal different peaks were noted.
  ADC values were calculated from brain lesions. Results are compared with age and
  sex matched normal subjects. Elevated NAA/Cr ratio (Canavan disease), galactitol
  peak (galactosemia) at 3.7 ppm, branched chain amino acids (Maple syrup urine disease-MSUD)
  at 0.9 ppm were seen on different diseases. In Leigh disease and MSUD restricted
  diffusion was detected. Different diffusion properties were seen only in one Glutaric
  aciduria lesions. NAA/Cr ratios and calculated ADC values were significantly different
  from normal subjects (p<0.05). DWI combined with MRS are complementary methods to
  routine cranial MRI for evaluating neurometabolic diseases which can give detailed
  information about neurochemistry of affected brain areas.
