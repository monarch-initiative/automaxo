input_text: Biochemistry and molecular biology of Canavan disease. Canavan in 1931
  described spongy degeneration of the brain in a child who was thought to have had
  Schilder's disease. Since that classic histological description, Canavan disease
  has become a distinct clinical entity, with the recognition by Van Bogaert and Bertrand
  that this is an autosomal recessive disease prevalant among children of Jewish extraction.
  Recent advances in the understanding of the biochemical defect led to an increase
  in awareness and ease in diagnosis, and indeed the disease is not as rare as initially
  thought. Exploring the molecular aspects of Canavan disease has led to exciting
  new developments in carrier detection and prevention of Canavan disease. Work is
  underway in our laboratory to develop a knock-out mouse for Canavan disease for
  understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease and formulating gene therapy.
