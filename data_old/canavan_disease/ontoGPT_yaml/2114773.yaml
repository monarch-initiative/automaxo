input_text: 'Canavan disease: CT and MR imaging of the brain. Canavan disease (spongy
  degeneration of the brain) is a rare lethal neurodegenerative disorder of infancy;
  fewer than 100 cases have been reported. We describe a series of nine patients with
  enzymatic defects and clinical features consistent with Canavan disease; in two
  patients the disease was proved by biopsy. All patients were examined with CT and
  seven with MR. In every instance, both CT and MR showed white-matter disease, sometimes
  sparing the external and internal capsules, the corpus callosum, and the deep cerebellar
  white matter. Atrophic changes were found in six patients; the changes were marked
  in one and slight in five. There was no obvious correlation between the severity
  of the white-matter disease and the clinical presentation--one patient with severe
  white-matter disease was clinically normal. The CT and MR findings in Canavan disease
  are nonspecific and somewhat nonuniform: its preautopsy diagnosis relies primarily
  on biochemical findings.'
