input_text: Transport of N-acetylaspartate via murine sodium/dicarboxylate cotransporter
  NaDC3 and expression of this transporter and aspartoacylase II in ocular tissues
  in mouse. Canavan disease is a genetic disorder associated with optic neuropathy
  and the metabolism of N-acetylaspartate is defective in this disorder due to mutations
  in the gene coding for the enzyme aspartoacylase II. Here we show that the plasma
  membrane transporter NaDC3, a Na+-coupled transporter for dicarboxylates, is able
  to transport N-acetylaspartate, suggesting that the transporter may function in
  concert with aspartoacylase II in the metabolism of N-acetylaspartate. Since Canavan
  disease is associated with ocular complications, we investigated the expression
  pattern of NaDC3 and aspartoacylase II in ocular tissues in mouse by in situ hybridization.
  These studies show that NaDC3 mRNA is expressed in the optic nerve, most layers
  of the retina, retinal pigment epithelium, ciliary body, iris, and lens. Aspartoacylase
  II mRNA is coexpressed in most of these cell types. We conclude that transport of
  N-acetylaspartate into ocular tissues via NaDC3 and its subsequent hydrolysis by
  aspartoacylase II play an essential role in the maintenance of visual function.
