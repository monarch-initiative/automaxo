input_text: 'Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging patterns in metabolic and toxic
  brain disorders. PURPOSE: To evaluate metabolic and toxic brain disorders that manifest
  with restricted, elevated, or both restricted and elevated diffusion patterns on
  diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Echo-planar diffusion
  MRI examinations were obtained in 34 pediatric patients with metabolic and toxic
  brain disorders proved by appropriate laboratory studies. The MRI unit operated
  at 1.5 T with a gradient strength of 30 mT/ meter, and a rise time of 600 micros.
  b=1000s/mm2 images and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps with ADC values
  were studied. RESULTS: Three patterns were observed: 1. A restricted diffusion pattern
  (high signal on b = 1000 s/mm2 images and low ADC values); 2. an elevated diffusion
  pattern (normal signal on b = 1000s/mm2 images and high ADC values); and 3. a mixed
  pattern (coexistent restricted and increased diffusion patterns in the same patient).
  Disorders manifesting with a restricted diffusion pattern included metachromatic
  leukodystrophy (n = 2), phenylketonuria (n = 3), maple syrup urine disease (intermediate
  form) (n = 1), infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (n = 1), Leigh (n = 2), Wilson (n
  = 3), and Canavan disease (n = 1). Disorders with an elevated diffusion pattern
  included phenylketonuria (n = 1), adrenoleukodystrophy (n = 1), merosin-deficient
  congenital muscular dystrophy (n = 2), mucopolysaccharidosis (n = 2), Lowe syndrome
  (n = 1), Leigh (n = 2), Alexander (n = 1), Pelizaeus-Merzbacher (n = 1), and Wilson
  (n = 3) disease. Disorders with a mixed pattern included L-2 hydroxyglutaric aciduria
  (n = 2), non-ketotic hyperglycinemia (n = 1), infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (n
  =2), maple syrup urine disease (n = 1), and Leigh (n = 1) disease. CONCLUSION: The
  findings suggested that the three different diffusion patterns reflect the histopathological
  changes associated with the disorders and different stages of a particular disorder.
  It is likely that the restricted diffusion pattern corresponds to abnormalities
  related to myelin, and the elevated diffusion pattern to disintegration of the tissue.
  The mixed pattern has contributions from both myelin abnormalities related to myelin
  disintegration of the tissue.'
