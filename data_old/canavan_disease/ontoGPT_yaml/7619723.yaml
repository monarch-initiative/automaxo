input_text: Primary intracranial atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor in a child with
  Canavan disease. A primary intracranial atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor was encountered
  in a child (age 4 years and 9 months) with Canavan disease. The tumor contained
  a large spindled cell component as well as classical rhabdoid morphology and focal
  areas resembling a primitive neuroectodermal tumor. The rhabdoid areas of the neoplasm
  were immunoreactive with antibodies against epithelial membrane antigen and vimentin,
  in the classically described pattern. Ultrastructurally these portions of the tumor
  displayed the characteristic perinuclear whorls of intermediate filaments reported
  in rhabdoid tumors of all body sites. Thought to be purely coincidental, this is
  also the first description of any intracranial neoplasm associated with Canavan
  disease.
