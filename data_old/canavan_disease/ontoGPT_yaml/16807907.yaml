input_text: 'Canavan disease: a white matter disorder. Breakdown of oligodendrocyte-neuron
  interactions in white matter (WM), such as the loss of myelin, results in axonal
  dysfunction and hence a disruption of information processing between brain regions.
  The major feature of leukodystrophies is the lack of proper myelin formation during
  early development or the onset of myelin loss late in life. These early childhood
  WM diseases are described as hypomyelination or dysmyelination arising from a primary
  block in normal myelin synthesis because of a genetic mutation expressed in oligodendrocytes,
  or failure in myelination secondary to neuronal or astroglial dysfunctions (van
  der Knaap 2001 Dev. Med. Child Neurol. 43:705-712). Here, we describe the pathophysiological
  parameters of Canavan disease (CD), caused by genetic mutations of the aspartoacylase
  (ASPA) gene, a metabolic enzyme restricted in the central nervous system (CNS) to
  oligodendrocytes. CD presents pathophysiological dysfunctions similar to diseases
  caused by myelin gene mutations, such as Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) and
  several animal models, such as myelin deficient rat (md), jimpy (jp), shiverer (sh),
  and quaking (qk viable) mutant mice. These single gene mutations have pleiotropic
  effects, whereby the alteration of one myelin gene expression disrupts functional
  expression of other oligodendrocyte genes with an outcome of hypomyelination/dysmyelination.
  Among all of the known leukodystrophies, CD is the first disorder, which was approved
  and tested for the adeno-associated virus vector (AAV)-ASPA gene therapy (Leone
  et al. 2000 Ann. Neurol. 48:27-38; Janson et al. 2001 Trends Neurosci. 24:706-712)
  without much success following the first two attempts. ASPA gene delivery attempts
  in animal models have shown a lowering of N-acetyl L-aspartate and a change in motor
  functions, while sponginess of the WM, a characteristic of CD remained unchanged
  (Matalon et al. 2003 Mol. Ther. 7 (5, Part 1):580-587; McPhee et al. 2005 Brain
  Res. Mol. Brain Res. 135:112-121) even with better viral serotype and delivery of
  the gene during early phase of development (Klugmann et al. 2005 Mol. Ther. 11:745-753).
  While different approaches are being sought for the success of gene therapy, there
  are pivotal developmental questions to address regarding the specific regions of
  the CNS and cell lineages that become the target for the onset and progression of
  CD symptoms from early to late stages of development.'
