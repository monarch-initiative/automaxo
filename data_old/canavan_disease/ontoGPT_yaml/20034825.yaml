input_text: Lithium citrate reduces excessive intra-cerebral N-acetyl aspartate in
  Canavan disease. Our group has previously reported the first clinical application
  of lithium in a child affected by Canavan disease. In this study, we aimed to assess
  the effects of lithium on N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) as well as other end points in
  a larger cohort. Six patients with clinical, laboratory and genetic confirmation
  of Canavan disease were recruited and underwent treatment with lithium. The battery
  of safety and efficacy testing performed before and after sixty days of treatment
  included Gross Motor Function Testing (GMFM), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Proton
  Magnetic Spectroscopy (H-MRS) as well as blood work. The medication was safe without
  any clinical or laboratory evidence for toxicity. Parental reports indicated improvement
  in alertness and social interactions. GMFM did not show statistically significant
  improvement in motor development. H-MRS documented an overall drop in NAA which
  was statistically significant in the basal ganglia. T1 measurements recorded on
  MRI studies suggested a mild improvement in myelination in the frontal white matter
  after treatment. Diffusion Tensor Imaging was available in two patients and suggested
  micro-structural improvement in the corpus callosum. The results suggest that lithium
  administration may be beneficial in patients with Canavan disease.
