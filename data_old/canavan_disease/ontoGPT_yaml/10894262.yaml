input_text: 'Knock-out mouse for Canavan disease: a model for gene transfer to the
  central nervous system. BACKGROUND: Canavan disease (CD) is an autosomal recessive
  leukodystrophy characterized by deficiency of aspartoacylase (ASPA) and increased
  levels of N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) in brain and body fluids, severe mental retardation
  and early death. Gene therapy has been attempted in a number of children with CD.
  The lack of an animal model has been a limiting factor in developing vectors for
  the treatment of CD. This paper reports the successful creation of a knock-out mouse
  for Canavan disease that can be used for gene transfer. METHODS: Genomic library
  lambda knock-out shuttle (lambdaKOS) was screened and a specific pKOS/Aspa clone
  was isolated and used to create a plasmid with 10 base pair (bp) deletion of exon
  four of the murine aspa. Following linearization, the plasmid was electroporated
  to ES cells. Correctly targeted ES clones were identified following positive and
  negative selection and confirmed by Southern analysis. Chimeras were generated by
  injection of ES cells to blastocysts. Germ line transmission was achieved by the
  birth of heterozygous mice as confirmed by Southern analysis. RESULTS: Heterozygous
  mice born following these experiments have no overt phenotype. The homozygous mice
  display neurological impairment, macrocephaly, generalized white matter disease,
  deficient ASPA activity and high levels of NAA in urine. Magnetic resonance imaging
  (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) of the brain of the homozygous mice show white matter
  changes characteristic of Canavan disease and elevated NAA levels. CONCLUSION: The
  newly created ASPA deficient mouse establishes an important animal model of Canavan
  disease. This model should be useful for developing gene transfer vectors to treat
  Canavan disease. Vectors for the central nervous system (CNS) and modulation of
  NAA levels in the brain should further add to the understanding of the pathophysiology
  of Canavan disease. Data generated from this animal model will be useful for developing
  strategies for gene therapy in other neurodegenerative diseases.'
