input_text: 'Canavan disease - unusual imaging features in a child with mild clinical
  presentation. Canavan disease is a rare hereditary leukodystrophy that manifests
  in early childhood. Associated with rapidly progressive clinical deterioration,
  it usually results in death by the third year of life. The predominant MRI appearance
  is diffuse and symmetrical white matter disease. We discuss an atypical, late presentation
  of Canavan disease with a benign clinical course and uncharacteristic imaging features.
  This case introduces a previously unreported pattern of diffuse cortical abnormality
  without significant white matter involvement. '
