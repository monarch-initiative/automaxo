input_text: 'Canavan disease: genomic organization and localization of human ASPA
  to 17p13-ter and conservation of the ASPA gene during evolution. Canavan disease,
  or spongy degeneration of the brain, is a severe leukodystrophy caused by the deficiency
  of aspartoacylase (ASPA). Recently, a missense mutation was identified in human
  ASPA coding sequence from patients with Canavan disease. The human ASPA gene has
  been cloned and found to span 29 kb of the genome. Human aspartoacylase is coded
  by six exons intervened by five introns. The exons vary from 94 (exon III) to 514
  (exon VI) bases. The exon/intron splice junction sites follow the gt/ag consensus
  sequence rule. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA from human/mouse somatic cell
  hybrid cell lines localized ASPA to human chromosome 17. The human ASPA locus was
  further mapped in the 17p13-ter region by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The
  bovine aspa gene has also been cloned, and its exon/intron organization is identical
  to that of the human gene. The 500-base sequence upstream of the initiator ATG codon
  in the human gene and that in the bovine gene are 77% identical. Human ASPA coding
  sequences cross-hybridize with genomic DNA from yeast, chicken, rabbit, cow, dog,
  mouse, rat, and monkey. The specificity of cross-species hybridization of coding
  sequences suggests that aspartoacylase has been conserved during evolution. It should
  now be possible to identify mutations in the noncoding genomic sequences that lead
  to Canavan disease and to study the regulation of ASPA.'
