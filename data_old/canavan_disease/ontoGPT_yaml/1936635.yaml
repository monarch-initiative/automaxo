input_text: Variable course of Canavan disease in two boys with early infantile aspartoacylase
  deficiency. This is a report of two patients with Canavan disease from the Federal
  Republic of Germany. One is a severely retarded, macrocephalic boy, who had the
  characteristic laboratory findings of Canavan disease and progressive leucodystrophy
  on neuro-imaging. The other is retarded, with signs of a cerebral movement disorder
  showing no deterioration during the first 15 months. The significance of aspartoacylase
  deficiency in Canavan disease for differential diagnosis, genetic counselling and
  prenatal diagnosis of leucodystrophy is discussed.
