input_text: Antisense Oligonucleotide Reverses Leukodystrophy in Canavan Disease Mice.
  Marked elevation in the brain concentration of N-acetyl-L-aspartate (NAA) is a characteristic
  feature of Canavan disease, a vacuolar leukodystrophy resulting from deficiency
  of the oligodendroglial NAA-cleaving enzyme aspartoacylase. We now demonstrate that
  inhibiting NAA synthesis by intracisternal administration of a locked nucleic acid
  antisense oligonucleotide to young-adult aspartoacylase-deficient mice reverses
  their pre-existing ataxia and diminishes cerebellar and thalamic vacuolation and
  Purkinje cell dendritic atrophy. Ann Neurol 2020;87:480-485.
