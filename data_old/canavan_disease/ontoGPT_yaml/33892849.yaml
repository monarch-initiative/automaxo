input_text: Recent Advancements in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Leukodystrophies.
  Leukodystrophies and genetic leukoencephalopathies comprise a growing group of inherited
  white matter disorders. Diagnostic rates have improved with increased utilization
  of next generation sequencing. As treatment options continue to advance for leukodystrophies,
  so will candidacy for inclusion in the United States' newborn Recommended Universal
  Screening Panel as was achieved for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. Stem cell therapies
  have become standard of care for selected leukodystrophies. However, transplantation-related
  risks remain high and outcomes are not fully satisfactory. Transduction of autologous
  hematopoietic stem cells with lentiviral vectors, referred to as ex vivo gene therapy,
  circumvents some, but not all, of the risks of traditional transplantation and has
  recently been demonstrated to be safe and efficective in clinical studies of X-linked
  adrenoleukodystrophy and metachromatic leukodystrophy. Gene therapy, through direct
  infusion of adeno-associated virus vectors, has emerged as a safer alternative for
  many monogenetic pediatric neurological disorders. Numerous preclinical studies
  have shown safety and efficacy of adeno-associated virus gene therapy in leukodystrophies
  allowing expanded access treatment for Canavan disease prior to initiation of a
  clinical trial. For inherited white matter disorders resulting from overexpression
  of a protein, such as Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, emerging RNA therapies have
  shown success in preclinical studies and promise for rapid translation to the clinic.
  Lastly, small molecule and protein therapies remain a long-term treatment option
  for a number of leukodystrophies, including intrathecal enzyme replacement therapy
  for metachromatic leukodystrophy. Herein we review recent advances in diagnosis
  and treatment of inherited white matter disorders.
