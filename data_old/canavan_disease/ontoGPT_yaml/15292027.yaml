input_text: ACOG committee opinion. Number 298, August 2004. Prenatal and preconceptional
  carrier screening for genetic diseases in individuals of Eastern European Jewish
  descent. Certain autosomal recessive disease conditions are more prevalent in individuals
  of Eastern European Jewish (Ashkenazi) descent. Previously, the American College
  of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommended that individuals of Eastern European
  Jewish ancestry be offered carrier screening for Tay-Sachs disease, Canavan disease,
  and cystic fibrosis as part of routine obstetric care. Based on the criteria used
  to justify offering carrier screening for Tay-Sachs disease, Canavan disease, and
  cystic fibrosis, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' Committee
  on Genetics recommends that couples of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry also should be
  offered carrier screening for familial dysautonomia. Individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish
  descent may inquire about the availability of carrier screening for other disorders.
  Carrier screening is available for mucolipidosis IV Niemann-Pick disease type A,
  Fanconi anemia group C, Bloom syndrome, and Gaucher's disease.
