input_text: High throughput parallel analysis of hundreds of patient samples for more
  than 100 mutations in multiple disease genes. As more mutations are identified in
  genes of known sequence, there is a crucial need in the areas of medical genetics
  and genome analysis for rapid, accurate and cost-effective methods of mutation detection.
  We have developed a multiplex allele-specific diagnostic assay (MASDA) for analysis
  of large numbers of samples (> 500) simultaneously for a large number of known mutations
  (> 100) in a single assay. MASDA utilizes oligonucleotide hybridization to interrogate
  DNA sequences. Multiplex DNA samples are immobilized on a solid support and a single
  hybridization is performed with a pool of allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO)
  probes. Any probes complementary to specific mutations present in a given sample
  are in effect affinity purified from the pool by the target DNA. Sequence-specific
  band patterns (fingerprints), generated by chemical or enzymatic sequencing of the
  bound ASO(s), easily identify the specific mutation(s). Using this design, in a
  single diagnostic assay, we tested samples for 66 cystic fibrosis (CF) mutations,
  14 beta-thalassemia mutations, two sickle cell anemia (SCA) mutations, three Tay-Sachs
  mutations, eight Gaucher mutations, four mutations in Canavan disease, four mutations
  in Fanconi anemia, and five mutations in BRCA1. Each mutation was correctly identified.
  Finally, in a blinded study of 106 of these mutations in > 500 patients, all mutations
  were properly identified. There were no false positives or false negatives. The
  MASDA assay is capable of detecting point mutations as well as small insertion or
  deletion mutations. This technology is amenable to automation and is suitable for
  immediate utilization for high-throughput genetic diagnostics in clinical and research
  laboratories.
