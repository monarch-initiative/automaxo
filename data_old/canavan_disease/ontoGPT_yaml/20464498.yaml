input_text: Metabolic acetate therapy improves phenotype in the tremor rat model of
  Canavan disease. Genetic mutations that severely diminish the activity of aspartoacylase
  (ASPA) result in the fatal brain dysmyelinating disorder, Canavan disease. There
  is no effective treatment. ASPA produces free acetate from the concentrated brain
  metabolite, N-acetylaspartate (NAA). Because acetyl coenzyme A is a key building
  block for lipid synthesis, we postulated that the inability to catabolize NAA leads
  to a brain acetate deficiency during a critical period of CNS development, impairing
  myelination and possibly other aspects of brain development. We tested the hypothesis
  that acetate supplementation during postnatal myelination would ameliorate the severe
  phenotype associated with ASPA deficiency using the tremor rat model of Canavan
  disease. Glyceryltriacetate (GTA) was administered orally to tremor rats starting
  7 days after birth, and was continued in food and water after weaning. Motor function,
  myelin lipids, and brain vacuolation were analyzed in GTA-treated and untreated
  tremor rats. Significant improvements were observed in motor performance and myelin
  galactocerebroside content in tremor rats treated with GTA. Further, brain vacuolation
  was modestly reduced, and these reductions were positively correlated with improved
  motor performance. We also examined the expression of the acetyl coenzyme A synthesizing
  enzyme acetyl coenzyme A synthase 1 and found upregulation of expression in tremor
  rats, with a return to near normal expression levels in GTA-treated tremor rats.
  These results confirm the critical role played by NAA-derived acetate in brain myelination
  and development, and demonstrate the potential usefulness of acetate therapy for
  the treatment of Canavan disease.
