input_text: 'Atypical clinical and radiological course of a patient with Canavan disease.
  Canavan disease (CD) is a rare metabolic disorder caused by aspartoacylase (ASPA)
  deficiency. It leads to severe neurological degeneration with spongiform brain degeneration.
  Accumulation of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) in brain and urine is specific to the disease
  and guides diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) usually shows diffuse white
  matter abnormalities with involvement of the basal ganglia. Mild forms of the disease
  with a more favorable clinical course and radiological involvement of the basal
  ganglia without white matter abnormalities have also been reported. Here we report
  an atypical case of a girl aged nine years with CD. The disease started at the classical
  age of five months. Classical elevation of NAA in brain and urine was present and
  genetic analysis identified mutations in the ASPA gene. However, clinical evolution
  was milder than typical CD, with partial motor impairment and relatively well-preserved
  cognitive skills. MRI was also atypical with low white matter involvement and unusual
  topography and evolution of abnormalities in the basal ganglia. '
