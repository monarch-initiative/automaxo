input_text: The frequency of the C854 mutation in the aspartoacylase gene in Ashkenazi
  Jews in Israel. Canavan disease (CD) is an infantile neurodegenerative disease that
  is transmitted in an autosomal recessive manner and has mainly been reported in
  Ashkenazi Jewish families. The primary enzymatic defect is aspartoacylase deficiency,
  and an A-to-C transition at nucleotide 854 of the cDNA has recently been reported.
  We screened 18 patients with CD and 879 healthy individuals, all Israeli Ashkenazi
  Jews, for the mutation. All 18 patients were homozygotes for the mutation, and 15
  heterozygotes were found among the healthy individuals. The results disclose a carrier
  rate of 1:59 and suggest that a screening for the mutation is warranted among Ashkenazi
  Jewish couples.
