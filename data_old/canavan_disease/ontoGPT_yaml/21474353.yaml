input_text: A safety trial of high dose glyceryl triacetate for Canavan disease. Canavan
  disease (CD MIM#271900) is a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder
  presenting in early infancy. The course of the disease is variable, but it is always
  fatal. CD is caused by mutations in the ASPA gene, which codes for the enzyme aspartoacylase
  (ASPA), which breaks down N-acetylaspartate (NAA) to acetate and aspartic acid.
  The lack of NAA-degrading enzyme activity leads to excess accumulation of NAA in
  the brain and deficiency of acetate, which is necessary for myelin lipid synthesis.
  Glyceryltriacetate (GTA) is a short-chain triglyceride with three acetate moieties
  on a glycerol backbone and has proven an effective acetate precursor. Intragastric
  administration of GTA to tremor mice results in greatly increased brain acetate
  levels, and improved motor functions. GTA given to infants with CD at a low dose
  (up to 0.25 g/kg/d) resulted in no improvement in their clinical status, but also
  no detectable toxicity. We present for the first time the safety profile of high
  dose GTA (4.5 g/kg/d) in 2 patients with CD. We treated 2 infants with CD at ages
  8 months and 1 year with high dose GTA, for 4.5 and 6 months respectively. No significant
  side effects and no toxicity were observed. Although the treatment resulted in no
  motor improvement, it was well tolerated. The lack of clinical improvement might
  be explained mainly by the late onset of treatment, when significant brain damage
  was already present. Further larger studies of CD patients below age 3 months are
  required in order to test the long-term efficacy of this drug.
