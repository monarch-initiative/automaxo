input_text: Immunohistochemical localization of aspartoacylase in the rat central
  nervous system. Aspartoacylase (ASPA; EC 3.5.1.15) catalyzes deacetylation of N-acetylaspartate
  (NAA) to generate free acetate in the central nervous system (CNS). Mutations in
  the gene coding ASPA cause Canavan disease (CD), an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative
  disease that results in death before 10 years of age. The pathogenesis of CD remains
  unclear. Our working hypothesis is that deficiency in the supply of the NAA-derived
  acetate leads to inadequate lipid/myelin synthesis during development, resulting
  in CD. To explore the localization of ASPA in the CNS, we used double-label immunohistochemistry
  for ASPA and several cell-specific markers. A polyclonal antibody was generated
  in rabbit against mouse recombinant ASPA, which reacted with a single band (approximately
  37 kD) on Western blots of rat brain homogenate. ASPA colocalized throughout the
  brain with CC1, a marker for oligodendrocytes, with 92-98% of CC1-positive cells
  also reactive with the ASPA antibody. Many cells were labeled with ASPA antibodies
  in white matter, including cells in the corpus callosum and cerebellar white matter.
  Relatively fewer cells were labeled in gray matter, including cerebral cortex. No
  astrocytes were labeled for ASPA. Neurons were unstained in the forebrain, although
  small numbers of large reticular and motor neurons were faintly to moderately stained
  in the brainstem and spinal cord. Many ascending and descending neuronal fibers
  were moderately stained for ASPA in the medulla and spinal cord. Microglial-like
  cells showed faint to moderate staining with the ASPA antibodies throughout the
  brain by the avidin/biotin-peroxidase detection method, and colocalization studies
  with labeled lectins confirmed their identity as microglia. The predominant immunoreactivity
  in oligodendrocytes is consistent with the proposed role of ASPA in myelination,
  supporting the case for acetate supplementation as an immediate and inexpensive
  therapy for infants diagnosed with CD.
