input_text: "A next step in adeno-associated virus-mediated gene therapy for neurological
  diseases: regulation and targeting. Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors
  mediating long term transgene expression are excellent gene therapy tools for chronic
  neurological diseases. While rAAV2 was the first serotype tested in the clinics,
  more efficient vectors derived from the rh10 serotype are currently being evaluated
  and other serotypes are likely to be tested in the near future. In addition, aside
  from the currently used stereotaxy-guided intraparenchymal delivery, new techniques
  for global brain transduction (by intravenous or intra-cerebrospinal injections)
  are very promising. Various strategies for therapeutic gene delivery to the central
  nervous system have been explored in human clinical trials in the past decade. Canavan
  disease, a genetic disease caused by an enzymatic deficiency, was the first to be
  approved. Three gene transfer paradigms for Parkinson's disease have been explored:
  converting L-dopa into dopamine through AADC gene delivery in the putamen; synthesizing
  GABA through GAD gene delivery in the overactive subthalamic nucleus and providing
  neurotrophic support through neurturin gene delivery in the nigro-striatal pathway.
  These pioneer clinical trials demonstrated the safety and tolerability of rAAV delivery
  in the human brain at moderate doses. Therapeutic effects however, were modest,
  emphasizing the need for higher doses of the therapeutic transgene product which
  could be achieved using more efficient vectors or expression cassettes. This will
  require re-addressing pharmacological aspects, with attention to which cases require
  either localized and cell-type specific expression or efficient brain-wide transgene
  expression, and when it is necessary to modulate or terminate the administration
  of transgene product. The ongoing development of targeted and regulated rAAV vectors
  is described. "
