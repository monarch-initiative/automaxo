input_text: 'Metabolic and destructive brain disorders in children: findings with
  localized proton MR spectroscopy. The diagnostic potential of volume-selective proton
  magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy in vivo was evaluated in 20 children and young
  adults with various neurodegenerative brain disorders. All patients were examined
  with MR spectroscopy in conjunction with MR imaging of the brain on a whole-body
  imager at 1.5 T. Comparison of spectra in our patients with those of children with
  normal myelination (prominent signals from N-acetylaspartate [NAA], creatine/phosphocreatine,
  and choline) revealed a marked decrease of NAA in 12 of 17 patients with focal or
  generalized demyelination. In patients with Canavan disease, NAA signal intensity
  was markedly increased, but no choline signal was found. Increased signal intensity
  from lactate occurred in patients with Leigh disease, neuroaxonal dystrophy, Schilder
  disease, and Cockayne disease, which indicated a disturbed energy metabolism in
  the examined region. These results demonstrate that proton MR spectroscopy can be
  applied in a clinical environment to facilitate diagnosis of hereditary and acquired
  brain disorders in children.'
