input_text: Development of genomic DNA reference materials for genetic testing of
  disorders common in people of ashkenazi jewish descent. Many recessive genetic disorders
  are found at a higher incidence in people of Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) descent than
  in the general population. The American College of Medical Genetics and the American
  College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have recommended that individuals of
  AJ descent undergo carrier screening for Tay Sachs disease, Canavan disease, familial
  dysautonomia, mucolipidosis IV, Niemann-Pick disease type A, Fanconi anemia type
  C, Bloom syndrome, and Gaucher disease. Although these recommendations have led
  to increased test volumes and number of laboratories offering AJ screening, well-characterized
  genomic reference materials are not publicly available. The Centers for Disease
  Control and Prevention-based Genetic Testing Reference Materials Coordination Program,
  in collaboration with members of the genetic testing community and Coriell Cell
  Repositories, have developed a panel of characterized genomic reference materials
  for AJ genetic testing. DNA from 31 cell lines, representing many of the common
  alleles for Tay Sachs disease, Canavan disease, familial dysautonomia, mucolipidosis
  IV, Niemann-Pick disease type A, Fanconi anemia type C, Bloom syndrome, Gaucher
  disease, and glycogen storage disease, was prepared by the Repository and tested
  in six clinical laboratories using three different PCR-based assay platforms. A
  total of 33 disease alleles was assayed and 25 different alleles were identified.
  These characterized materials are publicly available from Coriell and may be used
  for quality control, proficiency testing, test development, and research.
