input_text: 'New T530C mutation in the aspartoacylase gene caused Canavan disease
  with no correlation between severity and N-acetylaspartate excretion. OBJECTIVE:
  Canavan disease (OMIM 271900) is a severe autosomal recessive neurodegenerative
  disorder characterized by spongy degeneration of the brain and caused by mutations
  in the gene encoding for aspartoacylase (ASPA). The enzyme is responsible for the
  catalyses of the brain-specific compound N-acetylaspartate (NAA). DESIGN AND METHODS:
  We report the case of two Egyptian sibling patients suspected of Canavan disease
  (CD) showing clinical deterioration, white matter degeneration, megalencephaly and
  severe intellectual impairment. The patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging
  (MRI) and biochemical analysis of NAA in biological fluid samples (serum and urine).
  Subsequently, in order to determine the mutation responsible for CD in these two
  sibs, a molecular biological examination was performed. RESULTS: MRI findings and
  quantification of high NAA excretion (1378.5 and 680.1mumolNAA/mmolcreatinine in
  urine of 4months and 4years old patients, respectively) confirmed the diagnosis
  of CD and prompted a search for the responsible mutation. The molecular biological
  analysis revealed homozygosity for the substitution T530C (Ile177Thr) in the exon
  4 of the ASPA gene in both sibs. A total loss of enzymatic activity was also recorded.
  CONCLUSIONS: The substitution T530C (Ile177Thr) results in a novel missense mutation
  causing a CD phenotype with severe clinical characteristics. This mutation was not
  previously described in the literature. In these two sibs, urinary concentration
  of NAA appears to correlate inversely to symptom severity and CD progression.'
