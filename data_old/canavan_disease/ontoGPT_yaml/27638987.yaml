input_text: 'Joint SOGC-CCMG Opinion for Reproductive Genetic Carrier Screening: An
  Update for All Canadian Providers of Maternity and Reproductive Healthcare in the
  Era of Direct-to-Consumer Testing. OBJECTIVE: This guideline was written to update
  Canadian maternity care and reproductive healthcare providers on pre- and postconceptional
  reproductive carrier screening for women or couples who may be at risk of being
  carriers for autosomal recessive (AR), autosomal dominant (AD), or X-linked (XL)
  conditions, with risk of transmission to the fetus. Four previous SOGC- Canadian
  College of Medical Geneticists (CCMG) guidelines are updated and merged into the
  current document. INTENDED USERS: All maternity care (most responsible health provider
  [MRHP]) and paediatric providers; maternity nursing; nurse practitioner; provincial
  maternity care administrator; medical student; and postgraduate resident year 1-7.
  TARGET POPULATION: Fertile, sexually active females and their fertile, sexually
  active male partners who are either planning a pregnancy or are pregnant (preferably
  in the first trimester of pregnancy, but any gestational age is acceptable). OPTIONS:
  Women and their partners will be able to obtain appropriate genetic carrier screening
  information and possible diagnosis of AR, AD, or XL disorders (preferably pre-conception),
  thereby allowing an informed choice regarding genetic carrier screening and reproductive
  options (e.g., prenatal diagnosis, preimplantation genetic diagnosis, egg or sperm
  donation, or adoption). OUTCOMES: Informed reproductive decisions related to genetic
  carrier screening and reproductive outcomes based on family history, ethnic background,
  past obstetrical history, known carrier status, or genetic diagnosis. SOGC REPRODUCTIVE
  CARRIER SCREENING SUMMARY STATEMENT (2016): Pre-conception or prenatal education
  and counselling for reproductive carrier screening requires a discussion about testing
  within the three perinatal genetic carrier screening/diagnosis time periods, which
  include pre-conception, prenatal, and neonatal for conditions currently being screened
  for and diagnosed. This new information should be added to the standard reproductive
  carrier screening protocols that are already being utilized by the most responsible
  maternity provider through the informed consent process with the patient. (III-A;
  GRADE low/moderate) SOGC OVERVIEW OF RECOMMENDATIONS QUALITY AND GRADE: There was
  a strong observational/expert opinion (quality and grade) for the genetic carrier
  literature with randomized controlled trial evidence being available only for the
  invasive testing. Both the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care quality
  and classification and the GRADE evidence quality and grade are provided. EVIDENCE:
  MEDLINE; PubMed; government neonatal screening websites; key words/common reproductive
  genetic carrier screened diseases/previous SOGC Guidelines/medical academic societies
  (Society of Maternal-Fetal Medicine [SMFM]; American College of Medical Genetics
  and Genomics; American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [ACOG]; CCMG;
  Royal College Obstetrics and Gynaecology [RCOG] [UK]; American Society of Human
  Genetics [ASHG]; International Society of Prenatal Diagnosis [ISPD])/provincial
  neonatal screening policies and programs; search terms (carrier screening, prenatal
  screening, neonatal genetic/metabolic screening, cystic fibrosis (CF), thalassemia,
  hemoglobinopathy, hemophilia, Fragile X syndrome (FXS), spinal muscular atrophy,
  Ashkenazi Jewish carrier screening, genetic carrier screening protocols, AR, AD,
  XL). SEARCH PERIOD: 10 years (June 2005-September 2015); initial search dates June
  30, 2015 and September 15, 2015; completed final search January 4, 2016. Validation
  of articles was completed by primary authors RD Wilson and I De Bie. BENEFITS, HARMS,
  AND COST: Benefits are to provide an evidenced based reproductive genetic carrier
  screening update consensus based on international opinions and publications for
  the use of Canadian women, who are planning a pregnancy or who are pregnant and
  have been identified to be at risk (personal or male partner family or reproductive
  history) for the transmission of a clinically significant genetic condition to their
  offspring with associated morbidity and/or mortality. Harm may arise from having
  counselling and informed testing of the carrier status of the mother, their partner,
  or their fetus, as well as from declining to have this counselling and informed
  testing or from not having the opportunity for counselling and informed testing.
  Costs will ensue both from the provision of opportunities for counselling and testing,
  as well as when no such opportunities are offered or are declined and the birth
  of a child with a significant inherited condition and resulting morbidity/mortality
  occurs; these comprise not only the health care costs to the system but also the
  social/financial/psychological/emotional costs to the family. These recommendations
  are based on expert opinion and have not been subjected to a health economics assessment
  and local or provincial implementation will be required. GUIDELINE UPDATE: This
  guideline is an update of four previous joint SOGC-CCMG Genetic Screening Guidelines
  dated 2002, 2006, 2008, and 2008 developed by the SOGC Genetic Committee in collaboration
  with the CCMG Prenatal Diagnosis Committee (now Clinical Practice Committee). 2016
