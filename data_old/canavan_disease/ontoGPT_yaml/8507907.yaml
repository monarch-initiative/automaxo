input_text: Dysmyelinating and demyelinating conditions in infancy. The myelin membrane
  is essential for rapid conduction of nerve impulses through the central nervous
  system. Failure of myelination--dysmyelination--may arise through several mechanisms.
  The synthesis of a particular myelin protein can be defective, as occurs for proteolipid
  protein in Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease and for myelin basic protein in the 18q-
  syndrome. Delay in myelination with a more generalized diminution in white matter
  is characteristic of many inherited metabolic diseases, including galactosemia,
  pyridoxine-dependent seizure disorder, glutaric aciduria type 1, and infantile Refsum
  disease. Demyelination or breakdown in myelin is characteristic of metachromatic
  leukodystrophy, Krabbe disease, mitochondrial disorders, adrenoleukodystrophy, Canavan
  disease, Alexander disease, and orthochromatic leukodystrophy. A fourth category
  is reserved for malformation syndromes. These include Cockayne, Fukuyama, Walker-Warburg,
  and Angelman syndromes. Demyelination also occurs in HIV-infected individuals with
  central nervous system findings and in multiple sclerosis. Much of the evidence
  for leukodystrophy in these disorders comes from neuroimaging. Some of these disorders
  are treatable.
