input_text: 'Combining Double Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization with Immunolabelling
  for Detection of the Expression of Three Genes in Mouse Brain Sections. Detection
  of gene expression in different types of brain cells e.g., neurons, astrocytes,
  oligodendrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursors and microglia, can be hampered by the
  lack of specific primary or secondary antibodies for immunostaining. Here we describe
  a protocol to detect the expression of three different genes in the same brain section
  using double fluorescence in situ hybridization with two gene-specific probes followed
  by immunostaining with an antibody of high specificity directed against the protein
  encoded by a third gene. The Aspartoacyclase (ASPA) gene, mutations of which can
  lead to a rare human white matter disease - Canavan disease - is thought to be expressed
  in oligodendrocytes and microglia but not in astrocytes and neurons. However, the
  precise expression pattern of ASPA in the brain has yet to be established. This
  protocol has allowed us to determine that ASPA is expressed in a subset of mature
  oligodendrocytes and it can be generally applied to a wide range of gene expression
  pattern studies. '
