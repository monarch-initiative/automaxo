input_text: In vivo quantitation of cerebral metabolite concentrations using natural
  abundance 13C MRS at 1.5 T. A method for the quantitation of cerebral metabolites
  on a clinical MR scanner by natural abundance 13C MRS in vivo is described. Proton-decoupled
  spectra were acquired with a power deposition within FDA guidelines using a novel
  coil design. myo-Inositol, quantified by a separate proton MRS, and readily detectable
  in 13C MRS, was used as an internal reference. Normal concentrations, measured in
  four control subjects, age 7 months to 12 years, were glutamate 9.9 +/- 0.7, glutamine
  5.6 +/- 1.0, and NAA 8.8 +/- 2.8 mmol/kg. In a patient diagnosed with Canavan disease,
  examined four times, glutamate was reduced to 46% of normal, 4.6 +/- 0.5 mmol/kg.
  NAA was increased by 50% to 13.2 +/- 1.6 mmol/kg in 13C MRS, consistent with the
  41% increase to 12.3 +/- 1.1 from control 8.7 +/- 1.1 mmol/kg assayed by 1H MRS.
  Limited concentration of glutamate may impact on glutamatergic neurons and excitatory
  neurotransmission in Canavan disease. Quantitation of cerebral glutamate in human
  brain may have clinical value in human neuropathologies in which glutamate is believed
  to play a central role.
