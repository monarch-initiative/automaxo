input_text: 'A case of Canavan disease: the first biochemically proven case in a Japanese
  girl. Canavan disease (CD) has only been diagnosed on autopsy or brain biopsy, however,
  specific biochemical markers, such as N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) and aspartoacylase
  activity, have recently been described in CD. We report a case of CD having the
  above biochemical markers. High levels of NAA were found in her urine, serum and
  CSF. Fibroblasts did not exhibit aspartoacylase activity. Clinically, she presented
  progressive psychomotor retardation, cerebellar signs, pyramidal signs and relative
  megalencephaly. CT and MRI showed findings of leukodystrophy. The evoked potentials
  showed widespread involvement in the brainstem. Magnetic resonance spectra showed
  a high level of NAA in the white matter. In Japan, this case is the first of CD
  determined on the basis of biochemical markers.'

  Split the following piece of text into fields in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
  object: <A sign or symptom associated with the disease and targeted by the medical action. For example, Low serum calcitriol, hypoplasia of the thymus, chronic cough, aortic stiffness, low pulse pressure>
