input_text: 'Use of isosulfan blue for identification of lymphatic vessels: experimental
  and clinical evaluation. Use of vital dyes for identification of lymphatic vessels
  before cannulation has heretofore not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration
  (FDA). The suitability of isosulfan blue, the 2,5 disulfonic acid isomer of Patent
  Blue, for this purpose was evaluated experimentally in the rat and clinically in
  11 volunteers and 543 patients under an investigational new drug application. FDA
  approval for this drug has been obtained. Volunteers and patients received up to
  15 mg of a 1% sterile, pyrogen-free solution per extremity (total dose of 0.4 mg/kg
  in the average patient). Excellent identification of lymphatic vessels was achieved
  in 100% of volunteers and in 97.4% of patients. In the other 2.6%, lymphatic vessels
  were not identified mainly due to congenital lymphatic vascular (Milroy) disease.
  Baseline blood chemistry in volunteers was not altered after administration of the
  dye. No adverse reactions were found in volunteers and minimal allergic reactions
  occurred in less than 1% of patients. Acute toxicity studies demonstrated an LD50
  greater than 150 mg/kg in the rat. Isosulfan blue was excreted unchanged in the
  urine (7%) and feces. Comparable excretion was found in volunteers. Isosulfan blue
  is a safe and efficacious vital dye for lymphangiography.'
