input_text: 'Lymphatic dysfunction, not aplasia, underlies Milroy disease. OBJECTIVE:
  Milroy disease is an inherited autosomal dominant lymphoedema caused by mutations
  in the gene for vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (VEGFR-3, also known
  as FLT4). The phenotype has to date been ascribed to lymphatic aplasia. We further
  investigated the structural and functional defects underlying the phenotype in humans.
  METHODS: The skin of the swollen foot and the non-swollen forearm was examined by
  (i) fluorescence microlymphangiography, to quantify functional initial lymphatic
  density in vivo; and (ii) podoplanin and LYVE-1 immunohistochemistry of biopsies,
  to quantify structural lymphatic density. Leg vein function was assessed by colour
  Doppler duplex ultrasound. RESULTS: Milroy patients exhibited profound (86-91%)
  functional failure of the initial lymphatics in the foot; the forearm was unimpaired.
  Dermal lymphatics were present in biopsies but density was reduced by 51-61% (foot)
  and 26-33% (forearm). Saphenous venous reflux was present in 9/10 individuals with
  VEGFR3 mutations, including two carriers. CONCLUSION: We propose that VEGFR3 mutations
  in humans cause lymphoedema through a failure of tissue protein and fluid absorption.
  This is due to a profound functional failure of initial lymphatics and is not explained
  by microlymphatic hypoplasia alone. The superficial venous valve reflux indicates
  the dual role of VEGFR-3 in lymphatic and venous development.'
