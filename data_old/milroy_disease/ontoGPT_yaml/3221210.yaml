input_text: "[Hereditary congenital lymphedema with pseudosexual ambiguity]. A case
  of uncommon genital lymphedema in a newborn girl like a pseudo sexual ambiguity
  is reported. The karyotype was 46, XX. Lymphedema of the lower limbs in the patient
  and in the mother's family confirmed a None-Milroy disease. Different considerations
  about genetic counseling in hereditary lymphedema, isolated or associated with others
  anomalies, are developed."
