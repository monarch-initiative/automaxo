input_text: Scintilymphangiography with 99 mTc-antimony sulfide colloid in hereditary
  lymphedema (Nonne-Milroy diseases). A family of four patients suffering from Nonne-Milroy
  disease has been examined by pedal scintilymphangiography. Lower limb edema was
  present in three patients and was bilateral in two instances. Scintilymphangiographic
  abnormality was invariably present, ranging from almost total obstruction of lymphatic
  flow to lymphatic pooling. The inguinal, iliac and para-aortic nodes on the affected
  sides were also noted to be small and few in number. The examination is safe and
  simple and may be used to distinguish Nonne-Milroy edema from edema due to other
  causes.
