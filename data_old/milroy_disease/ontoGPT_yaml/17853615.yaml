input_text: "Fluorescence microlymphography: diagnostic potential in lymphedema and
  basis for the measurement of lymphatic pressure and flow velocity. Fluorescence
  microlymphography (FML) is an almost atraumatic technique used to visualize the
  superficial skin network of initial lymphatics through the intact skin of man. Visualization
  was performed with an incident light fluorescence microscope following subepidermal
  injection of minute amounts of FITC-dextran 150,000 using microneedles. Emanating
  from the bright dye depot, the surrounding network of microvessels is filled, documentation
  performed by photography or video film. In congenital Milroy lymphedema, a lack
  of microlymphatics (aplasia) is typical while in other primary lymphedemas and in
  secondary lymphedema after mastectomy or irradiation of proximal lymph nodes, the
  network remains intact but the depicted area is enlarged. Lymphatic microangiopathy
  characterized by obliterations of capillary meshes or mesh segments develops in
  phleboedema with trophic skin changes, progressive systemic sclerosis and Fabry's
  disease. In lipedema, lymphatic microaneurysms are stained. Microlymphatic pressure
  may also be measured using FML. For this purpose, glass micropipettes are inserted
  into the capillaries by means of a micromanipulator and pressure is determined by
  the servo-nulling technique. Normal subjects produced significantly lower pressure
  (7.9 +/- 3.4 mmHg) compared to patients with primary lymphedema (15.0 +/- 5.1 mmHg,
  p<0.001). This characteristic lymphatic hypertension may be improved by complex
  physiotherapy or local application of prostaglandins. Additionally, a modification
  of the FML procedure can be used to measure lymphatic capillary flow velocity in
  controls and patients. FML is suited to confirm the clinical diagnosis of lymphedema,
  contributes to distinguish among various forms of edema, and is useful in clinical
  research. In addition, FML has also become a tool for experimental animal studies
  including the depiction of gastric microlymphatics, the measurement of flow velocity
  in the naked mouse tail, and in evaluation of lymphangiogenesis in a model of Milroy
  disease."
