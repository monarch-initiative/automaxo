input_text: 'Exome sequencing for prenatal diagnosis of fetuses with sonographic abnormalities.OBJECTIVE:
  In the absence of aneuploidy or other pathogenic cytogenetic abnormality, fetuses
  with increased nuchal translucency (NT >= 3.5 mm) and/or other sonographic abnormalities
  have a greater incidence of genetic syndromes, but defining the underlying pathology
  can be challenging. Here, we investigate the value of whole exome sequencing in
  fetuses with sonographic abnormalities but normal microarray analysis. METHOD: Whole
  exome sequencing was performed on DNA extracted from chorionic villi or amniocytes
  in 24 fetuses with unexplained ultrasound findings. In the first 14 cases sequencing
  was initially performed on fetal DNA only. For the remaining 10, the trio of fetus,
  mother and father was sequenced simultaneously. RESULTS: In 21% (5/24) cases, exome
  sequencing provided definitive diagnoses (Milroy disease, hypophosphatasia, achondrogenesis
  type 2, Freeman-Sheldon syndrome and Baraitser-Winter Syndrome). In a further case,
  a plausible diagnosis of orofaciodigital syndrome type 6 was made. In two others,
  a single mutation in an autosomal recessive gene was identified, but incomplete
  sequencing coverage precluded exclusion of the presence of a second mutation. CONCLUSION:
  Whole exome sequencing improves prenatal diagnosis in euploid fetuses with abnormal
  ultrasound scans. In order to expedite interpretation of results, trio sequencing
  should be employed, but interpretation can still be compromised by incomplete coverage
  of relevant genes.'
