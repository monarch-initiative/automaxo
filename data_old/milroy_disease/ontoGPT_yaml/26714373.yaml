input_text: A NOVEL FLT4 GENE MUTATION AND MR LYMPHANGIOGRAPHY IN A CHINESE FAMILY
  WITH MILROY DISEASE.Milroy disease is a congenital onset lymphedema linked to FLT4
  gene mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain. So far, a total of 59 different FLT4
  variants have been identified. Here, we report a novel FLT4 gene mutation in a Chinese
  family with Milroy disease and present their clinical symptoms and MR lymphangiographic
  findings.
