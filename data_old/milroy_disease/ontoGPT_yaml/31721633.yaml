input_text: 'Lymphoscintigraphic Abnormalities Associated with Milroy Disease and
  Lymphedema-Distichiasis Syndrome.Background: Primary lymphedema is genetically heterogeneous.
  Two of the most common forms of primary lymphedema are Milroy disease (MD) and lymphedema-distichiasis
  syndrome (LDS). This study aims to look further into the pathogenesis of the two
  conditions by analyzing the lymphoscintigram images from affected individuals to
  ascertain if it is a useful diagnostic tool. Methods and Results: The lymphoscintigrams
  of patients with MD and LDS were analyzed, comparing the images and transport parameters
  of the two genotypes against a control population. Lymphoscintigrams were available
  for 12 MD and 16 LDS patients (all genetically proven diagnoses). Eight of the 12
  (67%) lymph scans performed on patients with MD demonstrated little or no uptake
  from the initial lymphatics and poor visualization of the inguinal lymph nodes.
  These changes were consistent with a "functional aplasia," that is, the lymphatic
  vessels were present but appeared to be ineffective in absorbing the interstitial
  fluid into the lymphatic system. In patients with LDS the lymphoscintigraphic appearances
  were different. In 12 of the 16 scans (75%), the lymph scans were highly suggestive
  of lymphatic collector reflux. Quantification revealed a significantly reduced uptake
  of tracer within the inguinal lymph nodes and a higher residual activity in the
  feet at 2 hours in MD compared with LDS and compared with controls. Conclusion:
  Lymphoscintigraphic imaging and quantification can be characteristic in specific
  genetic forms of primary lymphedema and may be useful as an additional tool for
  in-depth phenotyping, leading to a more accurate diagnosis and providing insight
  into the underlying mechanism of disease.'
