input_text: FLT4 Mutations Are Associated with Segmental Lymphatic Dysfunction and
  Initial Lymphatic Aplasia in Patients with Milroy Disease.This study explored mutations
  in the Fms-related tyrosine kinase 4/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor
  3 gene (FLT4) and lymphatic defects in patients with Milroy disease (MD). Twenty-nine
  patients with lower limb lymphedema were enrolled. Sixteen patients had a familial
  history of MD, while 13 patients exhibited sporadic MD. Clinical signs, FLT4 mutations,
  indocyanine green (ICG) lymphography findings, and skin tissue immunohistochemical
  staining results were evaluated. Twenty-eight variants in FLT4 were identified.
  Twelve of these have previously been reported, while 16 are novel. Of the 28 variants,
  26 are missense mutations, and the remaining two comprise a splicing mutation and
  a non-frame shift mutation. Twenty-five variants are located in the intracellular
  protein tyrosine kinase domain; three are located in the extracellular immunoglobulin
  domain. Substantially delayed contrast-enhanced tortuous lymphatic vessels were
  visualized to the ankle or knee level in 15 of 23 patients who underwent ICG lymphography.
  No initial lymphatic vessels were visualized in skin specimens from four patients
  who did not exhibit lymphatic vessels during imaging analyses. No specific variant
  was identified in relation to the unique clinical phenotype. Segmental dysfunction
  of lymphatic vessels and initial lymphatic aplasia are present in MD patients with
  FLT4 mutations.
