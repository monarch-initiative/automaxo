input_text: Purpura-associated congenital lymphedema. An 8-year-old girl referred
  to our Department for a two-month worsening of congenital primary lymphedema of
  the lower limb and for the appearance of several purpuric lesions on the right thigh
  and knee. We diagnosed a lichenoid pigmented purpura of Gougerot and Blum in a patient
  with Milroy disease, complicated by an insufficiency of anterior saphena. We treated
  the patient with topical steroids and compression stockings, until surgical intervention
  of phlebectomy. We report this case for the rarity of the disease, for the even
  more rare association with lichenoid pigmented purpura and for cutaneous immunopathological
  findings.
