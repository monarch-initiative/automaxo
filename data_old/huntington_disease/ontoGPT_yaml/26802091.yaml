input_text: "Change in PDE10 across early Huntington disease assessed by [18F]MNI-659
  and PET imaging. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether striatal [(18)F]MNI-659 PET imaging
  of phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10) serves as a sensitive and reliable biomarker of
  striatal neurodegeneration in a longitudinal cohort of participants with early Huntington
  disease (HD). METHODS: A cohort of participants with HD, including both participants
  premanifest or manifest with motor signs, underwent clinical assessments, genetic
  determination, and 2 [(18)F]MNI-659 PET imaging sessions approximately 1 year apart.
  Eleven healthy control (HC) participants underwent clinical assessments and [(18)F]MNI-659
  PET imaging once. Striatal binding potentials (BPnd) were estimated for brain regions
  of interest, specifically within the basal ganglia, and compared between baseline
  and follow-up imaging. Clinical measures of HD severity were assessed at each visit.
  RESULTS: Eight participants with HD (6 manifest; 2 premanifest) participated. Of
  those with manifest HD, all had relatively early stage disease (stage 1, n = 2;
  stage 2, n = 4) and a Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale total motor score
  <45. As expected, the HD cohort as a whole had a reduction in the basal ganglia
  BPnd to approximately 50% of that seen in HC. On follow-up scans, [(18)F]MNI-659
  uptake declined in the putamen and caudate nucleus in all 8 participants. The mean
  annualized rates of decline in signal in the caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus
  and the putamen were 16.6%, 6.9%, and 5.8%, respectively. In HC, the annualized
  reduction in signal in striatal regions was less than 1%. CONCLUSION: Longitudinal
  data in this small cohort of participants with early HD support [(18)F]MNI-659 PET
  imaging of PDE10 as a useful biomarker to track HD disease progression."
