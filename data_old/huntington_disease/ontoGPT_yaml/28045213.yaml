input_text: "Longitudinal diffusion changes in prodromal and early HD: Evidence of
  white-matter tract deterioration. INTRODUCTION: Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetic
  neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects striatal neurons. Striatal volume
  loss is present years before clinical diagnosis; however, white matter degradation
  may also occur prior to diagnosis. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can measure
  microstructural changes associated with degeneration that precede macrostructural
  changes. DWI derived measures enhance understanding of degeneration in prodromal
  HD (pre-HD). METHODS: As part of the PREDICT-HD study, N = 191 pre-HD individuals
  and 70 healthy controls underwent two or more (baseline and 1-5 year follow-up)
  DWI, with n = 649 total sessions. Images were processed using cutting-edge DWI analysis
  methods for large multicenter studies. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics were
  computed in selected tracts connecting the primary motor, primary somato-sensory,
  and premotor areas of the cortex with the subcortical caudate and putamen. Pre-HD
  participants were divided into three CAG-Age Product (CAP) score groups reflecting
  clinical diagnosis probability (low, medium, or high probabilities). Baseline and
  longitudinal group differences were examined using linear mixed models. RESULTS:
  Cross-sectional and longitudinal differences in DTI measures were present in all
  three CAP groups compared with controls. The high CAP group was most affected. CONCLUSIONS:
  This is the largest longitudinal DWI study of pre-HD to date. Findings showed DTI
  differences, consistent with white matter degeneration, were present up to a decade
  before predicted HD diagnosis. Our findings indicate a unique role for disrupted
  connectivity between the premotor area and the putamen, which may be closely tied
  to the onset of motor symptoms in HD. Hum Brain Mapp 38:1460-1477, 2017.   2017
