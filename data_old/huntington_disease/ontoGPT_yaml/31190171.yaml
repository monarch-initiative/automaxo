input_text: "End-of-life measures in Huntington disease: HDQLIFE Meaning and Purpose,
  Concern with Death and Dying, and End of Life Planning. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:
  Huntington disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. There are no
  HD-specific measures to assess for end-of-life (EOL) preferences that have been
  validated for clinical use. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate reliability
  and validity of three HD-specific EOL measures for use in and clinical research
  settings. METHODS: We examined internal reliability, test-retest reliability, floor
  and ceiling effects, convergent and discriminant validity, known groups' validity,
  measurement error, and change over time to systematically examine reliability and
  validity of the HDQLIFE EOL measures. RESULTS: Internal consistency and test-retest
  reliability were > 0.70. The measures were generally free of floor and ceiling effects
  and measurement error was minimal. Convergent and discriminant validity were consistent
  with well-known constructs in the field. Hypotheses for known groups validity were
  partially supported (there were generally group differences for the EOL planning
  measures, but not for meaning and purpose or concern with death and dying). Measurement
  error was acceptable and there were minimal changes over time across the EOL measures.
  CONCLUSIONS: Results support the clinical utility of the HDQLIFE EOL measures in
  persons with HD."

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
