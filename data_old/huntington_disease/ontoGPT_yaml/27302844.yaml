input_text: 'Prenatal testing in Huntington disease: after the test, choices recommence.
  The objective of this study was (1) to determine the impact of prenatal diagnosis
  (PND) for Huntington disease (HD) on subsequent reproductive choices and family
  structure; and (2) to assess whether children born after PND were informed of their
  genetic status. Out of 354 presymptomatic carriers of HD gene mutation, aged 18-45
  years, 61 couples requested 101 PNDs. Fifty-four women, 29 female carriers and 25
  spouses of male carriers, accepted to be interviewed (0.6-16.3 years after the last
  PND, median 6.5 years) on their obstetrical history and information given to children
  born after PND. Women were willing to undergo two or more PNDs with a final success
  rate of 75%. Reproductive decisions differed depending on the outcome of the first
  PND. If favourable, 62% couples decided against another pregnancy and 10% chose
  to have an untested child. If unfavourable, 83% decided for another pregnancy (P<0.01),
  and the majority (87%) re-entered the PND procedure. In contrast, after a second
  PND, only 37% asked for a PND and 30% chose to have an untested child. Thirty-three
  percent had both, tested and untested children. Among children born after PND, 10
  years and older, 75% were informed of their genetic status. The decision to prevent
  transmission of the HD mutation is made anew with each pregnancy. Couples may need
  more psychological support after PND and pre-counselling sessions should take into
  account the effect of the outcome of a first PND on subsequent reproductive choices.'
