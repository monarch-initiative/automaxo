input_text: "Attending to Total Pain in Juvenile Huntington Disease: A Case Report
  Informed by Narrative Review of the Literature. OBJECTIVES: To consider the impact
  of juvenile Huntington disease (JHD) from a biomedical, symptom burden, and total
  pain palliative care perspective. METHODS: This case report was informed by a narrative
  review of the literature with inclusion of expert opinion from pediatric palliative
  care, an adult and pediatric neurologist, and a child psychiatrist. Audio-recorded
  qualitative interview and coauthorship with the pediatric patient's primary caregiver
  (his mother). RESULTS: The JHD impacts all domains of child and family function.
  SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: Application of the concept of total pain to JHD informs
  and guides care for this complex, challenging condition."
