input_text: 'Making (anti-) sense out of huntingtin levels in Huntington disease.
  BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder,
  characterized by motor, psychiatric and cognitive symptoms. HD is caused by a CAG
  repeat expansion in the first exon of the HTT gene, resulting in an expanded polyglutamine
  tract at the N-terminus of the huntingtin protein. Typical disease onset is around
  mid-life (adult-onset HD) whereas onset below 21 years is classified as juvenile
  HD. While much research has been done on the underlying HD disease mechanisms, little
  is known about regulation and expression levels of huntingtin RNA and protein. RESULTS:
  In this study we used 15 human post-mortem HD brain samples to investigate the expression
  of wild-type and mutant huntingtin mRNA and protein. In adult-onset HD brain samples,
  there was a small but significantly lower expression of mutant huntingtin mRNA compared
  to wild-type huntingtin mRNA, while wild-type and mutant huntingtin protein expression
  levels did not differ significantly. Juvenile HD subjects did show a lower expression
  of mutant huntingtin protein compared to wild-type huntingtin protein. Our results
  in HD brain and fibroblasts suggest that protein aggregation does not affect levels
  of huntingtin RNA and protein. Additionally, we did not find any evidence for a
  reduced expression of huntingtin antisense in fibroblasts derived from a homozygous
  HD patient. CONCLUSIONS: We found small differences in allelic huntingtin mRNA levels
  in adult-onset HD brain, with significantly lower mutant huntingtin mRNA levels.
  Wild-type and mutant huntingtin protein were not significantly different in adult-onset
  HD brain samples. Conversely, in juvenile HD brain samples mutant huntingtin protein
  levels were lower compared with wild-type huntingtin, showing subtle differences
  between juvenile HD and adult-onset HD. Since most HD model systems harbor juvenile
  repeat expansions, our results suggest caution with the interpretation of huntingtin
  mRNA and protein studies using HD cell and animal models with such long repeats.
  Furthermore, our huntingtin antisense results in homozygous HD cells do not support
  reduced huntingtin antisense expression due to an expanded CAG repeat.'
