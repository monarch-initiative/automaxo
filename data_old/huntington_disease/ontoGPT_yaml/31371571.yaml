input_text: 'Abnormal brain development in child and adolescent carriers of mutant
  huntingtin. OBJECTIVE: The huntingtin gene is critical for the formation and differentiation
  of the CNS, which raises questions about the neurodevelopmental effect of CAG expansion
  mutations within this gene (mHTT) that cause Huntington disease (HD). We sought
  to test the hypothesis that child and adolescent carriers of mHTT exhibit different
  brain growth compared to peers without the mutation by conducting structural MRI
  in youth who are at risk for HD. We also explored whether the length of CAG expansion
  affects brain development. METHODS: Children and adolescents (age 6-18) with a parent
  or grandparent diagnosed with HD underwent MRI and blinded genetic testing to confirm
  the presence or absence of mHTT. Seventy-five individuals were gene-expanded (GE)
  and 97 individuals were gene-nonexpanded (GNE). The GE group was estimated to be
  on average 35 years from clinical onset. Following an accelerated longitudinal design,
  age-related changes in brain regions were estimated. RESULTS: Age-related striatal
  volume changes differed significantly between the GE and GNE groups, with initial
  hypertrophy and more rapid volume decline in GE. This pattern was exaggerated with
  CAG expansion length for CAG > 50. A similar age-dependent group difference was
  observed for the globus pallidus, but not in other major regions. CONCLUSION: Our
  results suggest that pathogenesis of HD begins with abnormal brain development.
  An understanding of potential neurodevelopmental features associated with mHTT may
  be needed for optimized implementation of preventative gene silencing therapies,
  such that normal aspects of neurodevelopment are preserved as neurodegeneration
  is forestalled.'
