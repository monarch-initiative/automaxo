input_text: "The phosphodiesterase 10 positron emission tomography tracer, [18F]MNI-659,
  as a novel biomarker for early Huntington disease. IMPORTANCE: In Huntington disease
  (HD) striatal neuron loss precedes and predicts motor signs or symptoms. Current
  imaging biomarkers lack adequate sensitivity for assessing the early stages of HD.
  Developing an imaging biomarker for HD spanning the time of onset of motor signs
  remains a major unmet research need. Intracellular proteins whose expression is
  altered by the mutant huntingtin protein may be superior markers for early HD stages.
  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether [18F]MNI-659 (2-(2-(3-(4-(2-[18F]fluoroethoxy)phenyl)-7-methyl-4-oxo-3,4-dihydroquinazolin-2-yl)ethyl)-4-isopropoxyisoindoline-1,3-dione),
  a novel phosphodiesterase 10 positron emission tomography (PET) ligand, is a sensitive
  marker for striatal changes in early HD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cohort
  of individuals with HD, including premanifest (pre-HD) or manifest with motor signs
  (mHD), underwent clinical assessments, genetic determination, [18F]MNI-659 PET imaging,
  and brain magnetic resonance imaging. Age-matched healthy volunteers (HVs) also
  received clinical assessments and PET and magnetic resonance imaging. MAIN OUTCOMES
  AND MEASURES: Binding potentials (BPnds) were estimated for brain regions of interest,
  specifically within the basal ganglia, and compared between participants with HD
  and the HVs and correlated with markers of HD severity and atrophy of basal ganglia
  nuclei. RESULTS: Eleven participants with HD (8 mHD and 3 pre-HD) and 9 HVs participated.
  Ten of 11 HD participants had known huntingtin CAG repeat length, allowing determination
  of a burden of pathology (BOP) score. One individual with HD declined CAG determination.
  All participants with mHD had relatively early-stage disease (4 with stage 1 and
  4 with stage 2) and a Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) total Motor
  subscale score of less than 50. The HD cohort had significantly lower striatal [18F]MNI-659
  uptake than did the HV cohort (mean, -48.4%; P < .001). The HD cohort as a whole
  had a reduction in the basal ganglia BPnd to approximately 50% of the level in the
  HVs (mean, -47.6%; P < .001). The 3 pre-HD participants had intermediate basal ganglia
  BPnds. Striatal [18F]MNI-659 uptake correlated strongly with the severity of disease
  measured by the clinical scale (UHDRS Motor subscale; R = 0.903; P < .001), the
  molecular marker (BOP; R = 0.908; P < .001), and regional atrophy (R = 0.667; P
  < .05). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: As a promising striatal imaging biomarker, [18F]MNI-659
  is potentially capable of assessing the extent of disease in early mHD. Furthermore,
  [18F]MNI-659 may identify early changes in medium spiny neurons and serve as a marker
  to predict conversion to mHD. Additional studies with larger, stratified cohorts
  of patients with HD and prospective studies of individuals with pre-HD are warranted."
