input_text: Laquinimod rescues striatal, cortical and white matter pathology and results
  in modest behavioural improvements in the YAC128 model of Huntington disease. Increasing
  evidence supports a role for abnormal immune activation and inflammatory responses
  in Huntington disease (HD). In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic potential
  of laquinimod (1 and 10 mg/kg), a novel immunomodulatory agent shown to be protective
  in a number of neuroinflammatory conditions, in the YAC128 mouse model of HD. Treatment
  with laquinimod for 6 months rescued atrophy in the striatum, in certain cortical
  regions, and in the corpus callosum of YAC128 HD mice. Diffusion tensor imaging
  showed that white matter microstructural abnormalities in the posterior corpus callosum
  were improved following treatment with low dose (1 mg/kg) laquinimod, and were paralleled
  by reduced levels of interleukin-6 in the periphery of YAC128 HD mice. Functionally,
  treatment with laquinimod (1 and 10 mg/kg) led to modest improvements in motor function
  and in depressive-like behaviour. Taken together, these results suggest that laquinimod
  may improve some features of pathology in HD, and provides support for the role
  of immune activation in the pathogenesis of HD.
