input_text: 'Variable Effects of Autophagy Induction by Trehalose on Herpesviruses
  Depending on Conditions of Infection. Trehalose is a non-reducing sugar formed from
  two glucose units. Trehalose induces abundant autophagy in cultured cells and also
  reduces the rate of aggregation of the huntingtin protein in the animal model of
  Huntington disease, a chronic neurological disease in humans. The mechanism of this
  effect on autophagy is now known to be caused by starvation secondary to inhibition
  of a family of glucose transporters known as the solute carrier 2 or the glucose
  transporter family. Variable effects of trehalose treatment have been observed during
  infections with two herpesviruses-human cytomegalovirus and varicella-zoster virus.
  The reasons for differing results have now been delineated. These differences are
  caused by two variables in conditions of infection: timing of addition of trehalose
  and type of inoculum (cell-free virus vs. infected cells). When monolayers pretreated
  with trehalose were inoculated with cell-free virus, there was a decline in virus
  spread by as much as 93 percent when compared with untreated monolayers. However,
  when monolayers were inoculated with infected cells rather than cell-free virus,
  there was no decline in virus spread. These results demonstrated that the effect
  of trehalose was limited to monolayers that were starved when inoculated with cell-free
  virus. In contrast, sufficient virus was already present in infected cell inocula
  so as to minimize any inhibitory effect of a starved monolayer. These results also
  showed that trehalose did not specifically inhibit a herpesvirus; rather, addition
  of trehalose to cell culture media altered the intracellular environment.'
