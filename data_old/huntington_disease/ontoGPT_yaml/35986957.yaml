input_text: "Emotion expression through spoken language in Huntington disease. Patients
  with Huntington's disease suffer from disturbances in the perception of emotions;
  they do not correctly read the body, vocal and facial expressions of others. With
  regard to the expression of emotions, it has been shown that they are impaired in
  expressing emotions through face but up until now, little research has been conducted
  about their ability to express emotions through spoken language. To better understand
  emotion production in both voice and language in Huntington's Disease (HD), we tested
  115 individuals: 68 patients (HD), 22 participants carrying the mutant HD gene without
  any motor symptoms (pre-manifest HD), and 25 controls in a single-centre prospective
  observational follow-up study. Participants were recorded in interviews in which
  they were asked to recall sad, angry, happy, and neutral stories. Emotion expression
  through voice and language was investigated by comparing the identifiability of
  emotions expressed by controls, preHD and HD patients in these interviews. To assess
  separately vocal and linguistic expression of emotions in a blind design, we used
  machine learning models instead of a human jury performing a forced-choice recognition
  test. Results from this study showed that patients with HD had difficulty expressing
  emotions through both voice and language compared to preHD participants and controls,
  who behaved similarly and above chance. In addition, we did not find any differences
  in expression of emotions between preHD and healthy controls. We further validated
  our newly proposed methodology with a human jury on the speech produced by the controls.
  These results are consistent with the hypothesis that emotional deficits in HD are
  caused by impaired sensori-motor representations of emotions, in line with embodied
  cognition theories. This study also shows how machine learning models can be leveraged
  to assess emotion expression in a blind and reproducible way."
