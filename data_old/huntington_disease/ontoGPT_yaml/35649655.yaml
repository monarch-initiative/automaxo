input_text: Imaging of Synaptic Density in Neurodegenerative Disorders. PET technology
  has produced many radiopharmaceuticals that target specific brain proteins and other
  measures of brain function. Recently, a new approach has emerged to image synaptic
  density by targeting the synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A), an integral glycoprotein
  in the membrane of synaptic vesicles and widely distributed throughout the brain.
  Multiple SV2A ligands have been developed and translated to human use. The most
  successful of these to date is 11C-UCB-J, because of its high uptake, moderate metabolism,
  and effective quantification with a 1-tissue-compartment model. Further, since SV2A
  is the target of the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam, human blocking studies have
  characterized specific binding and potential reference regions. Regional brain SV2A
  levels were shown to correlate with those of synaptophysin, another commonly used
  marker of synaptic density, providing the basis for SV2A PET imaging to have broad
  utility across neuropathologic diseases. In this review, we highlight the development
  of SV2A tracers and the evaluation of quantification methods, including compartment
  modeling and simple tissue ratios. Mouse and rat models of neurodegenerative diseases
  have been studied with small-animal PET, providing validation by comparison to direct
  tissue measures. Next, we review human PET imaging results in multiple neurodegenerative
  disorders. Studies on Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease have progressed most
  rapidly at multiple centers, with generally consistent results of patterns of SV2A
  or synaptic loss. In Alzheimer disease, the synaptic loss patterns differ from those
  of amyloid, tau, and 18F-FDG, although intertracer and interregional correlations
  have been found. Smaller studies have been reported in other disorders, including
  Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington disease, progressive supranuclear
  palsy, and corticobasal degeneration. In conclusion, PET imaging of SV2A has rapidly
  developed, and qualified radioligands are available. PET studies on humans indicate
  that SV2A loss might be specific to disease-associated brain regions and consistent
  with synaptic density loss. The recent availability of new 18F tracers, 18F-SynVesT-1
  and 18F-SynVesT-2, will substantially broaden the application of SV2A PET. Future
  studies are needed in larger patient cohorts to establish the clinical value of
  SV2A PET and its potential for diagnosis and progression monitoring of neurodegenerative
  diseases, as well as efficacy assessment of disease-modifying therapies.
