input_text: 'Disruption of response inhibition circuits in prodromal Huntington disease.
  Cognitive changes in the prodromal phase of Huntington disease (prHD) are found
  in multiple domains, yet their neural bases are not well understood. One component
  process that supports cognition is inhibitory control. In the present fMRI study,
  we examined brain circuits involved in response inhibition in 65 prHD participants
  and 36 gene-negative (NEG) controls using the stop signal task (SST). PrHD participants
  were subdivided into three groups (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH) based on their CAG-Age Product
  (CAP) score, an index of genetic exposure and a proxy for expected time to diagnosis.
  Poorer response inhibition (stop signal duration) correlated with CAP scores. When
  response inhibition was successful, activation of the classic frontal inhibitory-network
  was normal in prHD, yet stepwise reductions in activation with proximity to diagnosis
  were found in the posterior ventral attention network (inferior parietal and temporal
  cortices). Failures in response inhibition in prHD were related to changes in inhibition
  centers (supplementary motor area (SMA)/anterior cingulate and inferior frontal
  cortex/insula) and ventral attention networks, where activation decreased with proximity
  to diagnosis. The LOW group showed evidence of early compensatory activation (hyperactivation)
  of right-hemisphere inhibition and attention reorienting centers, despite an absence
  of cortical atrophy or deficits on tests of executive functioning. Moreover, greater
  activation for failed than successful inhibitions in an ipsilateral motor-control
  network was found in the control group, whereas such differences were markedly attenuated
  in all prHD groups. The results were not related to changes in cortical volume and
  thickness, which did not differ among the groups. However, greater hypoactivation
  of classic right-hemisphere inhibition centers [inferior frontal gyrus (IFG)/insula,
  SMA/anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)] during inhibition failures correlated with
  greater globus pallidus atrophy. These results are the first to demonstrate that
  response inhibition in prHD is associated with altered functioning in brain networks
  that govern inhibition, attention, and motor control. '
