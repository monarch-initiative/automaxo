input_text: "Myelin Breakdown in Human Huntington's Disease: Multi-Modal Evidence
  from Diffusion MRI and Quantitative Magnetization Transfer. Huntington's disease
  (HD) leads to white matter (WM) degeneration that may be due to an early breakdown
  in axon myelination but in vivo imaging correlates of demyelination remain relatively
  unexplored in HD compared to other neurodegenerative diseases. This study investigated
  HD-related effects on a putative marker of myelin, the macromolecular proton fraction
  (MMPF) from quantitative magnetization transfer and on fractional anisotropy, axial
  and radial diffusivity from diffusion tensor MR-imaging. Microstructural differences
  were studied in WM pathways of the basal ganglia and motor systems known to be impaired
  in HD: the corpus callosum, the cortico-spinal tract, the anterior thalamic radiation,
  fibers between prefrontal cortex and caudate and between supplementary motor area
  and putamen. Principal component analysis was employed for dimensionality reduction.
  Patients showed reductions in a component with high loadings on MMPF in all WM pathways
  and a trend for increases in a component loading on axial and radial diffusivities
  but no differences in a component loading on fractional anisotropy. While patients'
  performance in executive functioning was impaired, their working memory span was
  preserved. Inter-individual differences in the diffusivity component correlated
  with patients' performance in clinical measures of the United Huntington Disease
  Rating Scale. In summary, HD-related reductions in MMPF suggest that myelin breakdown
  contributes to WM impairment in human HD and emphasize the potential of quantitative
  MRI metrics to inform about disease pathogenesis. Disease severity in manifest HD,
  however, was best captured by non-specific diffusivity metrics sensitive to multiple
  disease and age-related changes."
