input_text: ACR Appropriateness Criteria  Movement Disorders and Neurodegenerative
  Diseases. Movement disorders and neurodegenerative diseases are a variety of conditions
  that involve progressive neuronal degeneration, injury, or death. Establishing the
  correct diagnosis of a movement disorder or neurodegenerative process can be difficult
  due to the variable features of these conditions, unusual clinical presentations,
  and overlapping symptoms and characteristics. MRI has an important role in the initial
  assessment of these patients, although a combination of imaging and laboratory and
  genetic tests is often needed for complete evaluation and management. This document
  summarizes the imaging appropriateness data for rapidly progressive dementia, chorea,
  Parkinsonian syndromes, suspected neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation,
  and suspected motor neuron disease. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness
  Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are
  reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development
  and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer
  reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA
  Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and
  Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures
  for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or
  equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging
  or treatment.
