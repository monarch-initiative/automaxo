input_text: "Huntington disease: a single-gene degenerative disorder of the striatum.
  Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant, neurodegenerative disorder with
  a primary etiology of striatal pathology. The Huntingtin gene (HTT) has a unique
  feature of a DNA trinucleotide (triplet) repeat, with repeat length ranging from
  10 to 35 in the normal population. Repeat lengths between 36 and 39 cause HD at
  reduced penetrance (some will get the disease, others won't) and when expanded to
  40 or more repeats (mHTT), causes HD at full penetrance (every person with this
  length or beyond will definitely develop the disease). The symptoms of HD may be
  motor, cognitive, and psychiatric, and are consistent with the pathophysiology of
  frontostriatal circuitry malfunction. Expressed ubiquitously and throughout the
  entire life cycle (development through adulthood), mHTT causes initial dysfunction
  and eventual death of a specific cell population within the striatum. Although all
  areas of the brain are eventually affected, the primary pathology of the disease
  is regionally specific. As a single-gene disorder, HD has the distinction of having
  the potential of treatment that is aimed directly at the known pathogenic mechanism
  by gene silencing, providing hope for neuroprotection and ultimately, prevention. "
