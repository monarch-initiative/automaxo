input_text: 'Widespread Increased Diffusivity Reveals Early Cortical Degeneration
  in Huntington Disease. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Huntington disease is a devastating
  genetic neurodegenerative disorder for which no effective treatment is yet available.
  Although progressive striatal atrophy is its pathologic hallmark, concomitant cortical
  deterioration is assumed to occur, but it is poorly characterized. Our objective
  was to study the loss of cortical integrity and its association with clinical indicators
  throughout the course of the disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a cohort of 39
  patients with Huntington disease and 25 controls with available MR imaging (T1WI
  and DTI), we compared cortical atrophy and intracortical diffusivity across disease
  stages. Intracortical diffusivity is a DTI-derived metric that has recently been
  suggested to detect incipient neuronal death because water can diffuse more freely
  in cortical regions with reduced neural density. RESULTS: We observed progressive
  thinning and increasing diffusivity within the cerebral cortex of patients with
  Huntington disease (P < .05, corrected for multiple comparisons). Most important,
  in the absence of pronounced atrophy, widespread increased diffusivity was already
  present in individuals with premanifest Huntington disease, correlating, in turn,
  with clinical and disease-specific progression markers. CONCLUSIONS: Intracortical
  diffusivity may be more sensitive than cortical thinning for tracking early neurodegeneration
  in Huntington disease. Moreover, our findings provide further evidence of an early
  cortical compromise in Huntington disease, which contributes to our understanding
  of its clinical phenotype and could have important therapeutic implications.'
