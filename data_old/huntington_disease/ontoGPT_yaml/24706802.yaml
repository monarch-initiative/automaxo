input_text: 'Differential ubiquitination and degradation of huntingtin fragments modulated
  by ubiquitin-protein ligase E3A. Ubiquitination of misfolded proteins, a common
  feature of many neurodegenerative diseases, is mediated by different lysine (K)
  residues in ubiquitin and alters the levels of toxic proteins. In Huntington disease,
  polyglutamine expansion causes N-terminal huntingtin (Htt) to misfold, inducing
  neurodegeneration. Here we report that shorter N-terminal Htt fragments are more
  stable than longer fragments and find differential ubiquitination via K63 of ubiquitin.
  Aging decreases proteasome-mediated Htt degradation, at the same time increasing
  K63-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent Htt aggregation in HD knock-in mice.
  The association of Htt with the K48-specific E3 ligase, Ube3a, is decreased in aged
  mouse brain. Overexpression of Ube3a in HD mouse brain reduces K63-mediated ubiquitination
  and Htt aggregation, enhancing its degradation via the K48 ubiquitin-proteasome
  system. Our findings suggest that aging-dependent Ube3a levels result in differential
  ubiquitination and degradation of Htt fragments, thereby contributing to the age-related
  neurotoxicity of mutant Htt. '
