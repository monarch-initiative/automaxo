input_text: 'Mutant huntingtin is present in neuronal grafts in Huntington disease
  patients. OBJECTIVE: Huntington disease (HD) is caused by a genetically encoded
  pathological protein (mutant huntingtin [mHtt]), which is thought to exert its effects
  in a cell-autonomous manner. Here, we tested the hypothesis that mHtt is capable
  of spreading within cerebral tissue by examining genetically unrelated fetal neural
  allografts within the brains of patients with advancing HD. METHODS: The presence
  of mHtt aggregates within the grafted tissue was confirmed using 3 different types
  of microscopy (bright-field, fluorescence, and electron), 2 additional techniques
  consisting of Western immunoblotting and infrared spectroscopy, and 4 distinct antibodies
  targeting different epitopes of mHtt aggregates. RESULTS: We describe the presence
  of mHtt aggregates within intracerebral allografts of striatal tissue in 3 HD patients
  who received their transplants approximately 1 decade earlier and then died secondary
  to the progression of their disease. The mHtt(+) aggregates were observed in the
  extracellular matrix of the transplanted tissue, whereas in the host brain they
  were seen in neurons, neuropil, extracellular matrix, and blood vessels. INTERPRETATION:
  This is the first demonstration of the presence of mHtt in genetically normal and
  unrelated allografted neural tissue transplanted into the brain of affected HD patients.
  These observations raise questions on protein spread in monogenic neurodegenerative
  disorders of the central nervous system characterized by the formation of mutant
  protein oligomers/aggregates.'
