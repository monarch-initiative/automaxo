input_text: String Grammar Unsupervised Possibilistic Fuzzy C-Medians for Gait Pattern
  Classification in Patients with Neurodegenerative Diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases
  that affect serious gait abnormalities include Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic
  lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington disease (HD). These diseases lead to gait
  rhythm distortion that can be determined by stride time interval of footfall contact
  times. In this paper, we present a new method for gait classification of neurodegenerative
  diseases. In particular, we utilize a symbolic aggregate approximation algorithm
  to convert left-foot stride-stride interval into a sequence of symbols using a symbolic
  aggregate approximation. We then find string prototypes of each class using the
  newly proposed string grammar unsupervised possibilistic fuzzy C-medians. Then in
  the testing process the fuzzy k-nearest neighbor is used. We implement the system
  on three 2-class problems, i.e., the classification of ALS against healthy patients,
  that of HD against healthy patients , and that of PD against healthy patients. The
  system is also implemented on one 4-class problem (the classification of ALS, HD,
  PD, and healthy patients altogether) called NDDs versus healthy. We found that our
  system yields a very good detection result. The average correct classification for
  ALS versus healthy is 96.88%, and that for HD versus healthy is 97.22%, whereas
  that for PD versus healthy is 96.43%. When the system is implemented on 4-class
  problem, the average accuracy is approximately 98.44%. It can provide prototypes
  of gait signals that are more understandable to human.
