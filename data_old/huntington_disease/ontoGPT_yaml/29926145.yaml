input_text: 'Morphological features in juvenile Huntington disease associated with
  cerebellar atrophy - magnetic resonance imaging morphometric analysis. BACKGROUND:
  The imaging features of Huntington disease are well known in adults, unlike in juvenile-onset
  Huntington disease. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a morphometric magnetic resonance imaging
  (MRI) analysis in three juvenile Huntington disease patients (ages 2, 4 and 6 years
  old) to determine whether quantitative cerebral and cerebellar morphological metrics
  may provide diagnostically interesting patterns of cerebellar and cerebellar atrophy.
  MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report the cases of three siblings with extremely early
  presentations of juvenile Huntington disease associated with dramatic expansions
  of the morbid paternal allele from 43 to more than 100 CAG trinucleotide repeats.
  Automatic segmentation of MRI images of the cerebrum and cerebellum was performed
  and volumes of cerebral substructures and cerebellar lobules of juvenile Huntington
  disease patients were compared to those of 30 normal gender- and age-matched controls.
  Juvenile Huntington disease segmented volumes were compared to those of age-matched
  controls by using a z-score. RESULTS: Three cerebral substructures (caudate nucleus,
  putamen and globus pallidus) demonstrated a reduction in size of more than three
  standard deviations from the normal mean although it was not salient in one of them
  at clinical reading and was not diagnosed. The size of cerebellum lobules, cerebellum
  grey matter and cerebellum cortex was reduced by more than two standard deviations
  in the three patients. The cerebellar atrophy was predominant in the posterior lobe.
  CONCLUSION: Our study sheds light on atrophic cerebral and cerebellar structures
  in juvenile Huntington disease. Automatic segmentations of the cerebellum provide
  patterns that may be of diagnostic interest in this disease.'
