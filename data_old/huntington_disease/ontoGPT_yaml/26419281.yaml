input_text: Hypothalamic overexpression of mutant huntingtin causes dysregulation
  of brown adipose tissue. Expression of mutant huntingtin (htt) protein has been
  shown to cause metabolic imbalance in animal models of Huntington disease (HD).
  The pathways involved are not fully understood but dysfunction of both the hypothalamus
  and brown adipose tissue (BAT) has been implicated. Here we show that targeted expression
  of mutant HTT in the hypothalamus leads to loss of the A13 dopaminergic cell group
  located in the zona incerta and reduced mRNA expression of neuropeptide Y1 receptor
  in the hypothalamus. Furthermore, this is accompanied by downregulation of uncoupling
  protein 1 expression and PPARgamma coactivator-1 alpha in BAT and a rapid body weight
  gain. Taken together, our data might provide a mechanistic link between expression
  of mutant HTT, reduced activity of a hypothalamic dopaminergic pathway and dysfunction
  of BAT and in part explain the development of an obese phenotype in HD mouse models.
