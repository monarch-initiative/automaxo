input_text: 'Functional impairment of precerebral arteries in Huntington disease.
  BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular pathology of Huntington disease (HD) appears to be complex;
  while microvascular dysfunction seems to appear early, deaths from cardiomyopathy
  and stroke might occur in the late phase of HD. METHODS: Our study evaluated global
  risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD), structure and function of precerebral
  arteries in 41 HD subjects and 41 matched controls. HD subjects were divided into
  groups by the United Huntington disease rating scale (presymptomatic-PHD, early-EHD,
  midstage-MHD and late-LHD). CHD risk factors assessment and Doppler examination
  of precerebral arteries were performed, including measurements of the carotid artery
  intima-media thickness (IMT), and parameters indicating local carotid artery distensibility
  (stiffness index beta, pulse wave velocity, pressure strain elasticity module and
  carotid artery compliance). RESULTS: In the HD and controls we identified a comparable
  number of non-obstructive plaques (<50% lumen narrowing). No obstructive plaques
  (>50% lumen narrowing) were found. There was significantly increased IMT in MHD.
  In PHD and EHD the parameters of arterial stiffness were significantly higher and
  the carotid artery compliance was significantly lower. CONCLUSIONS: Our results
  reveal functional vascular pathology in PHD, EHD, and MHD. Precerebral arteries
  dysfunction in HD therefore appears to be mostly functional and in agreement with
  recently described autonomic nervous system changes in HD.'
