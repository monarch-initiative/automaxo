  recommendations for the use of brain 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography
  in neurodegenerative cognitive impairment and dementia: Delphi consensus. BACKGROUND
  AND PURPOSE: Recommendations for using fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography
  (FDG-PET) to support the diagnosis of dementing neurodegenerative disorders are
  sparse and poorly structured. METHODS: Twenty-one questions on diagnostic issues
  and on semi-automated analysis to assist visual reading were defined. Literature
  was reviewed to assess study design, risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness
  and effect size. Critical outcomes were sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive/negative
  predictive value, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and positive/negative
  likelihood ratio of FDG-PET in detecting the target conditions. Using the Delphi
  method, an expert panel voted for/against the use of FDG-PET based on published
  evidence and expert opinion. RESULTS: Of the 1435 papers, 58 papers provided proper
  quantitative assessment of test performance. The panel agreed on recommending FDG-PET
  for 14 questions: diagnosing mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease
  (AD), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB);
  diagnosing atypical AD and pseudo-dementia; differentiating between AD and DLB,
  FTLD or vascular dementia, between DLB and FTLD, and between Parkinson's disease
  and progressive supranuclear palsy; suggesting underlying pathophysiology in corticobasal
  degeneration and progressive primary aphasia, and cortical dysfunction in Parkinson's
  disease; using semi-automated assessment to assist visual reading. Panellists did
  not support FDG-PET use for pre-clinical stages of neurodegenerative disorders,
  for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Huntington disease diagnoses, and for amyotrophic
  lateral sclerosis or Huntington-disease-related cognitive decline. CONCLUSIONS:
  Despite limited formal evidence, panellists deemed FDG-PET useful in the early and
  differential diagnosis of the main neurodegenerative disorders, and semi-automated
  assessment helpful to assist visual reading. These decisions are proposed as interim
  recommendations."
