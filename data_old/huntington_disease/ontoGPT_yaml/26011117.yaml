input_text: 'Multivariate clustering of progression profiles reveals different depression
  patterns in prodromal Huntington disease. OBJECTIVE: Although Huntington disease
  (HD) is caused by an autosomal dominant mutation, its phenotypic presentation differs
  widely. Variability in clinical phenotypes of HD may reflect the existence of disease
  subtypes. This hypothesis was tested in prodromal participants from the longitudinal
  Neurobiological Predictors of Huntington Disease (PREDICT-HD) study. METHOD: We
  performed clustering using longitudinal data assessing motor, cognitive, and depression
  symptoms. Using data from 521 participants with 2,716 data points, we fit growth
  mixture models (GMM) that identify groups based on multivariate trajectories. RESULTS:
  In various GMM, different phases of disease progression were partitioned by progression
  trajectories of motor and cognitive signs, and by overall level of depression symptoms.
  More progressed motor signs were accompanied by more progressed cognitive signs,
  but not always by higher levels of depressive symptoms. In several models, there
  were at least 2 groups with similar trajectories for motor and cognitive signs that
  showed different levels for depression symptoms-one with a very low level of depression
  and the other with a higher level of depression. CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate
  that at least intermediate HD progression might be associated with different levels
  of depression. Depression is one of the few symptoms that is treatable in HD and
  has implications for clinical care. Identification of potential depression subtypes
  may also help to select appropriate patients for clinical trials.'
