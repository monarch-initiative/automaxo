input_text: "The Safety of Deutetrabenazine for Chorea in Huntington Disease: An Open-Label
  Extension Study. BACKGROUND: Deutetrabenazine is approved in the USA, China, Australia,
  Israel, Brazil, and South Korea for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington
  disease. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of
  deutetrabenazine for the treatment of Huntington disease. METHODS: This open-label,
  single-arm, multi-center study included patients who completed a double-blind study
  (Rollover) and patients who converted overnight from a stable tetrabenazine dose
  (Switch). Exposure-adjusted incidence rates (adverse events per person-year) were
  calculated. Efficacy was analyzed using a stable post-titration timepoint (8 weeks).
  Changes in the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale total motor score and total
  maximal chorea score from baseline to week 8, as well as those from week 8 to week
  145 (or the last visit on the study drug if that occurred earlier), were evaluated
  as both efficacy and safety endpoints during the study. RESULTS: Of 119 patients
  (Rollover, n = 82; Switch, n = 37), 100 (84%) completed >= 1 year of treatment.
  End-of-study exposure-adjusted incidence rates for adverse events in Rollover and
  Switch, respectively, were: any, 2.57 and 4.02; serious, 0.11 and 0.14; leading
  to dose suspension, 0.05 and 0.04. Common adverse events (>= 4% either cohort) included
  somnolence (Rollover, 20%; Switch, 30%), depression (32%; 22%), anxiety (27%; 35%),
  insomnia (23%; 16%), and akathisia (6%; 11%). Adverse events of interest included
  suicidality (9%; 5%) and parkinsonism (4%; 8%). Mean dose at week 8 was 38.1 mg
  (Rollover) and 36.5 mg (Switch). Mean dose across cohorts after titration was 37.6
  mg; at the final visit, mean dose across cohorts was 45.7 mg. Patients showed minimal
  change in the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale total maximal chorea scores
  with stable dosing from weeks 8-145 or at the end of treatment, but total motor
  score increased versus week 8 (mean change [standard deviation]: 8.2 [11.9]). There
  were no unexpected adverse events upon drug withdrawal, and mean (standard deviation)
  total maximal chorea scores increased 4.7 (4.6) units from week 8 to 1-week follow-up.
  CONCLUSIONS: Adverse events observed with long-term deutetrabenazine exposure were
  consistent with previous studies. Reductions in chorea persisted over time. Upon
  treatment cessation, there was no unexpected worsening of chorea. CLINICAL TRIAL
