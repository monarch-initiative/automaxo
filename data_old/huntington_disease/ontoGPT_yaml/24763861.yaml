input_text: "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in a patient with a family history of huntington
  disease: genetic counseling challenges. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and
  Huntington disease (HD) are generally considered to be distinct and easily differentiated
  neurologic conditions. However, there are case reports of the co-occurrence of ALS
  with HD. We present a 57-year-old male with a clinical diagnosis of sporadic ALS
  in the context of a family history of HD. This case adds to the limited literature
  regarding individuals with a family history of HD who present with features of ALS.
  There were several genetic counseling challenges in counseling this patient including
  the diagnostic consideration of two fatal conditions, complex risk information,
  the personal and familial implications, and the patient's inability to communicate
  verbally or through writing due to disease progression. DNA banking effectively
  preserved the right of our patient and his wife not to learn his HD genetic status
  during a stressful time of disease progression while providing the option for family
  members to learn this information in the future if desired. We present lessons learned
  and considerations for other clinical genetics professionals who are presented with
  similar challenging issues."
