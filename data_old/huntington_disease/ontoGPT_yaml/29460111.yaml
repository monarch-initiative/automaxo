input_text: The Changing Age of Individuals Seeking Presymptomatic Genetic Testing
  for Huntington Disease. Huntington disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative
  disorder. Presymptomatic genetic testing allows at-risk individuals to clarify their
  risk status. Understanding the characteristics and motivations of individuals seeking
  HD presymptomatic genetic testing better equips genetic counselors and other healthcare
  professionals to provide comprehensive and personalized care. The aims of this study
  were to (1) determine whether the average age when individuals seek presymptomatic
  HD genetic testing has decreased over time, (2) assess motivations for seeking testing,
  (3) explore whether there is a relationship between age and motivations, and (4)
  explore genetic counselors' perceptions of the shift in age. Data from the US HD
  testing centers (N = 4) were analyzed. A small but statistically significant decrease
  in age of individuals seeking presymptomatic testing was observed (p = 0.045). HD
  community members (N = 77) were surveyed regarding presymptomatic testing motivations.
  Younger individuals were more likely than older individuals to cite "To learn whether
  or not you would develop HD" and "To make choices about further education or a career"
  compared to older individuals (p < 0.05). Conversely, older individuals more frequently
  cited "To give children a better idea of their risk" (p < 0.002). Sixteen percent
  of genetic counselors surveyed (6/37) perceived a change in age of testing. All
  of these respondents had provided HD testing for ten or more years and anecdotally
  believed the age at testing has decreased over time. Study results help providers
  personalize counseling based on patient's age and serve as a starting point for
  more research into the relationship between age at testing and motivations for testing.
