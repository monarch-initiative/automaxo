input_text: "A new measure for end of life planning, preparation, and preferences
  in Huntington disease: HDQLIFE end of life planning. BACKGROUND: Huntington disease
  is a fatal inherited neurodegenerative disease. Because the end result of Huntington
  disease is death due to Huntington disease-related causes, there is a need for better
  understanding and caring for individuals at their end of life. AIM: The purpose
  of this study was to develop a new measure to evaluate end of life planning. DESIGN:
  We conducted qualitative focus groups, solicited expert input, and completed a literature
  review to develop a 16-item measure to evaluate important aspects of end of life
  planning for Huntington disease. Item response theory and differential item functioning
  analyses were utilized to examine the psychometric properties of items; exploratory
  factor analysis was used to establish meaningful subscales. PARTICIPANTS: Participants
  included 508 individuals with pre-manifest or manifest Huntington disease. RESULTS:
  Item response theory supported the retention of all 16 items on the huntington disease
  quality of life (\"HDQLIFE\") end of life planning measure. Exploratory factor analysis
  supported a four-factor structure: legal planning, financial planning, preferences
  for hospice care, and preferences for conditions (locations, surroundings, etc.)
  at the time of death. Although a handful of items exhibited some evidence of differential
  item functioning, these items were retained due to their relevant clinical content.
  The final 16-item scale includes an overall total score and four subscale scores
  that reflect the different end of life planning constructs. CONCLUSIONS: The 16-item
  HDQLIFE end of life planning measure demonstrates adequate psychometric properties;
  it may be a useful tool for clinicians to clarify patients' preferences about end
  of life care."
