input_text: Motor onset and diagnosis in Huntington disease using the diagnostic confidence
  level. Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by
  motor dysfunction, cognitive deterioration, and psychiatric symptoms, with progressive
  motor impairments being a prominent feature. The primary objectives of this study
  are to delineate the disease course of motor function in HD, to provide estimates
  of the onset of motor impairments and motor diagnosis, and to examine the effects
  of genetic and demographic variables on the progression of motor impairments. Data
  from an international multisite, longitudinal observational study of 905 prodromal
  HD participants with cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeats of at least 36 and with
  at least two visits during the followup period from 2001 to 2012 was examined for
  changes in the diagnostic confidence level from the Unified Huntington's Disease
  Rating Scale. HD progression from unimpaired to impaired motor function, as well
  as the progression from motor impairment to diagnosis, was associated with the linear
  effect of age and CAG repeat length. Specifically, for every 1-year increase in
  age, the risk of transition in diagnostic confidence level increased by 11% (95%
  CI 7-15%) and for one repeat length increase in CAG, the risk of transition in diagnostic
  confidence level increased by 47% (95% CI 27-69%). Findings show that CAG repeat
  length and age increased the likelihood of the first onset of motor impairment as
  well as the age at diagnosis. Results suggest that more accurate estimates of HD
  onset age can be obtained by incorporating the current status of diagnostic confidence
  level into predictive models.
