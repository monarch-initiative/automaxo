input_text: 'Prefrontal cortex white matter tracts in prodromal Huntington disease.
  Huntington disease (HD) is most widely known for its selective degeneration of striatal
  neurons but there is also growing evidence for white matter (WM) deterioration.
  The primary objective of this research was to conduct a large-scale analysis using
  multisite diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) tractography data to quantify diffusivity
  properties along major prefrontal cortex WM tracts in prodromal HD. Fifteen international
  sites participating in the PREDICT-HD study collected imaging and neuropsychological
  data on gene-positive HD participants without a clinical diagnosis (i.e., prodromal)
  and gene-negative control participants. The anatomical prefrontal WM tracts of the
  corpus callosum (PFCC), anterior thalamic radiations (ATRs), inferior fronto-occipital
  fasciculi (IFO), and uncinate fasciculi (UNC) were identified using streamline tractography
  of DWI. Within each of these tracts, tensor scalars for fractional anisotropy, mean
  diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity coefficients were calculated.
  We divided prodromal HD subjects into three CAG-age product (CAP) groups having
  Low, Medium, or High probabilities of onset indexed by genetic exposure. We observed
  significant differences in WM properties for each of the four anatomical tracts
  for the High CAP group in comparison to controls. Additionally, the Medium CAP group
  presented differences in the ATR and IFO in comparison to controls. Furthermore,
  WM alterations in the PFCC, ATR, and IFO showed robust associations with neuropsychological
  measures of executive functioning. These results suggest long-range tracts essential
  for cross-region information transfer show early vulnerability in HD and may explain
  cognitive problems often present in the prodromal stage. Hum Brain Mapp 36:3717-3732,
