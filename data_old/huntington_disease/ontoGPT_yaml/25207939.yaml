input_text: 'Allele-specific suppression of mutant huntingtin using antisense oligonucleotides:
  providing a therapeutic option for all Huntington disease patients. Huntington disease
  (HD) is an inherited, fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion
  in the huntingtin gene. The mutant protein causes neuronal dysfunction and degeneration
  resulting in motor dysfunction, cognitive decline, and psychiatric disturbances.
  Currently, there is no disease altering treatment, and symptomatic therapy has limited
  benefit. The pathogenesis of HD is complicated and multiple pathways are compromised.
  Addressing the problem at its genetic root by suppressing mutant huntingtin expression
  is a promising therapeutic strategy for HD. We have developed and evaluated antisense
  oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting single nucleotide polymorphisms that are significantly
  enriched on HD alleles (HD-SNPs). We describe our structure-activity relationship
  studies for ASO design and find that adjusting the SNP position within the gap,
  chemical modifications of the wings, and shortening the unmodified gap are critical
  for potent, specific, and well tolerated silencing of mutant huntingtin. Finally,
  we show that using two distinct ASO drugs targeting the two allelic variants of
  an HD-SNP could provide a therapeutic option for all persons with HD; allele-specifically
  for roughly half, and non-specifically for the remainder. '
