input_text: Advances in the neuroimaging of motor disorders. Neuroimaging is a valuable
  adjunct to the history and examination in the evaluation of motor system disorders.
  Conventional imaging with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging depicts
  important anatomic information and helps to identify imaging patterns which may
  support diagnosis of a specific motor disorder. Advanced imaging techniques can
  provide further detail regarding volume, functional, or metabolic changes occurring
  in nervous system pathology. This chapter is an overview of the advances in neuroimaging
  with particular emphasis on both standard and less well-known advanced imaging techniques
  and findings, such as diffusion tensor imaging or volumetric studies, and their
  application to specific motor disorders. In addition, it provides reference to emerging
  imaging biomarkers in motor system disorders such as Parkinson disease, amyotrophic
  lateral sclerosis, and Huntington disease, and briefly reviews the neuroimaging
  findings in different causes of myelopathy and peripheral nerve disorders.

  Split the following piece of text into fields in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
  object: <A sign or symptom associated with the disease and targeted by the medical action. For example, Low serum calcitriol, hypoplasia of the thymus, chronic cough, aortic stiffness, low pulse pressure>
  qualifier: <The primary disease the relationship is about, or specifically the disease the symptom is related to. For example, Beck-Fahrner syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, progeria, diabetes mellitus, infectious otitis media>
  subject_qualifier: <An optional qualifier or modifier for the subject of the statement, e.g. "high dose" or "intravenously administered">
