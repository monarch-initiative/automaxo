input_text: 'Nocturnal agitation in Huntington disease is caused by arousal-related
  abnormal movements rather than by rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder. BACKGROUND:
  Patients with Huntington disease (HD) and their spouses often complain of agitation
  during sleep, but the causes are mostly unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate sleep and
  nocturnal movements in patients with various HD stages and CAG repeats length. METHODS:
  The clinical features and sleep studies of 29 patients with HD were retrospectively
  collected (11 referred for genotype-phenotype correlations and 18 for agitation
  during sleep) and compared with those of 29 age- and sex-matched healthy controls.
  All patients had videopolysomnography, but the movements during arousals were re-analyzed
  in six patients with HD with stored video. RESULTS: The patients had a longer total
  sleep period and REM sleep onset latency, but no other differences in sleep than
  controls. There was no correlation between CAG repeat length and sleep measures,
  but total sleep time and sleep efficiency were lower in the subgroup with moderate
  than milder form of HD. Periodic limb movements and REM sleep behavior disorders
  were excluded, although 2/29 patients had abnormal REM sleep without atonia. In
  contrast, they had clumsy and opisthotonos-like movements during arousals from non-REM
  or REM sleep. Some movements were violent and harmful. They might consist of voluntary
  movements inappropriately involving the proximal part of the limbs on a background
  of exaggerated hypotonia. Giant (>65 mcV) sleep spindles were observed in seven
  (24%) patients with HD and one control. CONCLUSION: The nocturnal agitation in patients
  with HD seems related to anosognostic voluntary movements on arousals, rather than
  to REM sleep behavior disorder and other sleep problems.'
