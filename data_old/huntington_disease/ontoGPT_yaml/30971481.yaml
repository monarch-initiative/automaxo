input_text: 'Brain structure in juvenile-onset Huntington disease. OBJECTIVE: To assess
  brain morphometry in a sample of patients with juvenile-onset Huntington disease
  (JOHD) and several mouse models of Huntington disease (HD) that likely represent
  the human JOHD phenotype. METHODS: Despite sharing the mutation in the Huntingtin
  gene, adult-onset HD characteristically presents as a hyperkinetic motor disorder,
  while JOHD typically presents as a hypokinetic motor disease. The University of
  Iowa Kids-JHD program enrolls individuals 5 to 25 years of age who have already
  received the clinical diagnosis. A total of 19 children with juvenile HD (JHD) (mean
  CAG = 72) were studied. Patients with JHD were compared to healthy controls (n =
  234) using a cross-sectional study design. Volumetric data from structural MRI was
  compared between groups. In addition, we used the same procedure to evaluate brain
  morphology of R6/2, zQ175, HdhQ250 HD mice models. RESULTS: Participants with JHD
  had substantially reduced intracranial volumes. After controlling for the small
  intracranial volume size, the volumes of subcortical regions (caudate, putamen,
  globus pallidus, and thalamus) and of cortical white matter were significantly decreased
  in patients with JHD. However, the cerebellum was proportionately enlarged in the
  JHD sample. The cerebral cortex was largely unaffected. Likewise, HD mice had a
  lower volume of striatum and a higher volume of cerebellum, mirroring the human
  MRI results. CONCLUSIONS: The primary pathology of JOHD extends beyond changes in
  the striatal volume. Brain morphology in both mice and human patients with JHD shows
  proportional cerebellar enlargement. This pattern of brain changes may explain the
  unique picture of hypokinetic motor symptoms in JHD, which is not seen in the hyperkinetic
  chorea-like phenotype of adult-onset HD.'
