input_text: "The highly anxious individual presenting for Huntington disease-predictive
  genetic testing: the psychiatrist's role in assessment and counseling. Guidelines
  in the Huntington disease genetic counseling community have set a standard for the
  process of at-risk counseling, recommending the involvement of a multidisciplinary
  team, which includes a psychiatrist or psychologist. Though most studies have been
  largely reassuring regarding the psychologic consequences of predictive testing,
  there are individuals presenting to testing who really want something else other
  than the test results, who are being pressured by others to obtain results, or who
  remain deeply ambivalent about testing. Particularly concerning are those testing
  candidates who are highly anxious or depressed at the time of presentation. Balancing
  the ethical principles of autonomy with beneficence and nonmaleficence requires
  careful exploration of the motivations behind testing to ensure that all are fully
  informed of alternatives, and opportunities for further support are offered when
  needed. This chapter illustrates 13 areas of focus and inquiry in the psychiatric
  interview and gives some case examples to illustrate an approach to the psychiatric
  assessment and counseling of highly anxious individuals seeking genetic testing."
