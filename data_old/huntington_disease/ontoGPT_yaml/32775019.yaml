input_text: "Screening for the C9ORF72 expansion in Greek Huntington Disease phenocopies
  and controls and meta-analysis of current data. Background: Several European studies
  examined the role of C9orf72 repeat expansion in patients with Huntington-disease
  like phenotypes (HD-L). The scope of our study is to investigate the expansion frequency
  in a Greek HD-L cohort and the meta-analysis of all published cases. This will be
  of use in genetic counseling of these cases. Methods: A cohort of 74 patients with
  HD-L and 67 healthy controls were screened for the C9orf72 expansion status. Case-controls
  comparison was assessed with the Pearson's chi-square statistic for a 2 x 2 table.A
  systematic database search was conducted and seven studies, including the current
  study, were considered eligible for inclusion in a meta-analysis considering a total
  of 812 patients with HD phenocopies. Pooled mutation frequency was calculated using
  a Random Effects model or the Mantel-Haezsel fixed effects model, depending on the
  observed heterogeneity. Results: In our cohort, one patient was found to have a
  pathologic expansion of C9orf72, and none from the control group (chi-square: 0.91,
  p-value: 0.34). Pooled mutation frequency was found at 2% (CI: 1-3%) with low heterogeneity
  (I2:15%). Discussion: Based on this meta-analysis the recommendation for genetic
  testing for C9orf72 expansions is further solidified."
