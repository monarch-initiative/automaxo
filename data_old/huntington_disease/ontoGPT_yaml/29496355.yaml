input_text: 'Cortical thickness, stance control, and arithmetic skill: An exploratory
  study in premanifest Huntington disease. BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD) is
  an inherited neurodegenerative disorder most commonly manifesting in adulthood.
  Identification of biomarkers tracking neurodegeneration before the onset of motor
  symptoms is important for future interventional studies. Our study aimed to contribute
  in the phenotypic characterization of the premanifest HD phase. METHODS: 28 premanifest
  subjects (preHD), 25 age-matched controls, and 12 manifest HD patients were enrolled
  for the study. The participants underwent a multimodal protocol including cognitive
  evaluations, arithmetic ability test, posturography, composite cerebellar functional
  test (CCFS), and brain 3T-MRI. PreHD were divided at the group median for predicted
  years to expected onset into "far-from-onset" (>15 years, PreHD-far), and "close-to-onset"
  (<=15 years, preHD-close). Basal ganglia volumes and cortical thickness were computed
  using FreeSurfer. RESULTS: PreHD-close showed significantly lower scores than controls
  in Symbol Digit Modalities Test (p = 0.017), Arithmetic subtraction task (p = 0.04),
  and MMSE (p < 0.006). At posturography, preHD-close showed increased sway velocity
  (<0.04) and distance (p < 0.02) compared to controls. PreHD-close had reduced striatum
  and globus pallidus volumes and left occipital cortical thinning compared to controls.
  Compared to PreHD far-from-onset, PreHD-close showed bilateral cortical thinning
  in occipital and parahippocampal regions, inversely correlating with burden score
  and prognostic index for HD. CCFS only differed between controls and manifest HD.
  PreHD far-from-onset did not show significant differences in comparison with controls.
  CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that quantitative brain MRI represents a valid biomarker
  of neurodegeneration in preHD. Posturography and Arithmentic tests seem promising
  tools for detecting early changes in premanifest HD, but need to be further confirmed
  in large cohorts.'
