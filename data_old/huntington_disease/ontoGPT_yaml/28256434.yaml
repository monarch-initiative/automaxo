input_text: 'Pathologic correlates of supranuclear gaze palsy with parkinsonism. INTRODUCTION:
  Supranuclear gaze palsy (SGP) is a classic clinical feature of progressive supranuclear
  palsy (PSP) but is not specific for this diagnosis and has been reported to occur
  in several other neurodegenerative parkinsonian conditions. Our objective was to
  evaluate the association between SGP and autopsy-proven diagnoses in a large population
  of patients with parkinsonism referred to a tertiary movement disorders clinic.
  METHODS: We reviewed clinical and autopsy data maintained in an electronic medical
  record from all patients seen in the Movement Disorders Clinic at Washington University,
  St. Louis between 1996 and 2015. All patients with parkinsonism from this population
  who had subsequent autopsy confirmation of diagnosis underwent further analysis.
  RESULTS: 221 unique parkinsonian patients had autopsy-proven diagnoses, 27 of whom
  had SGP documented at some point during their illness. Major diagnoses associated
  with SGP were: PSP (9 patients), Parkinson disease (PD) (10 patients), multiple
  system atrophy (2 patients), corticobasal degeneration (2 patients), Creutzfeld-Jakob
  disease (1 patient) and Huntington disease (1 patient). In none of the diagnostic
  groups was the age of onset or disease duration significantly different between
  cases with SGP and those without SGP. In the PD patients, the UPDRS motor score
  differed significantly between groups (p = 0.01) with the PD/SGP patients having
  greater motor deficit than those without SGP. CONCLUSION: Although a common feature
  of PSP, SGP is not diagnostic for this condition and can be associated with other
  neurodegenerative causes of parkinsonism including PD.'
