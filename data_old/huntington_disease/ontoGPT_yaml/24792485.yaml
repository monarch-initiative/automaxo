input_text: Perspectives of drug-based neuroprotection targeting mitochondria. Mitochondrial
  dysfunction has been reported in most neurodegenerative diseases. These anomalies
  include bioenergetic defect, respiratory chain-induced oxidative stress, defects
  of mitochondrial dynamics, increase sensitivity to apoptosis, and accumulation of
  damaged mitochondria with instable mitochondrial DNA. Significant progress has been
  made in our understanding of the pathophysiology of inherited mitochondrial disorders
  but most have no effective therapies. The development of new metabolic treatments
  will be useful not only for rare mitochondrial disorders but also for the wide spectrum
  of common age-related neurodegenerative diseases shown to be associated with mitochondrial
  dysfunction. A better understanding of the mitochondrial regulating pathways raised
  several promising perspectives of neuroprotection. This review focuses on the pharmacological
  approaches to modulate mitochondrial biogenesis, the removal of damaged mitochondria
  through mitophagy, scavenging free radicals and also dietary measures such as ketogenic
  diet.
