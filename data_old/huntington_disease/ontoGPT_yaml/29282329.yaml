input_text: 'MicroRNAs in CSF as prodromal biomarkers for Huntington disease in the
  PREDICT-HD study. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility of microRNA (miRNA)
  levels in CSF as biomarkers for prodromal Huntington disease (HD). METHODS: miRNA
  levels were measured in CSF from 60 PREDICT-HD study participants using the HTG
  protocol. Using a CAG-Age Product score, 30 prodromal HD participants were selected
  based on estimated probability of imminent clinical diagnosis of HD (i.e., low,
  medium, high; n = 10/group). For comparison, participants already diagnosed (n =
  15) and healthy controls (n = 15) were also selected. RESULTS: A total of 2,081
  miRNAs were detected and 6 were significantly increased in the prodromal HD gene
  expansion carriers vs controls at false discovery rate q < 0.05 (miR-520f-3p, miR-135b-3p,
  miR-4317, miR-3928-5p, miR-8082, miR-140-5p). Evaluating the miRNA levels in each
  of the HD risk categories, all 6 revealed a pattern of increasing abundance from
  control to low risk, and from low risk to medium risk, which then leveled off from
  the medium to high risk and HD diagnosed groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports
  miRNAs as CSF biomarkers of prodromal and diagnosed HD. Importantly, miRNAs were
  detected in the prodromal HD groups furthest from diagnosis where treatments are
  likely to be most consequential and meaningful. The identification of potential
  biomarkers in the disease prodrome may prove useful in evaluating treatments that
  may postpone disease onset. CLINICALTRIALSGOV IDENTIFIER: NCT00051324.'
