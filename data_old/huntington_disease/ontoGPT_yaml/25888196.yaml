input_text: 'A case of atypical adult-onset tic disorder. INTRODUCTION: The differential
  diagnosis of adult tic disorder is complex, and several common and uncommon causes
  have to be taken into consideration. CASE REPORT: A 30-year-old man came to our
  movement disorders clinic with multiple tics which had begun insidiously about 10
  years earlier. No family history was reported, but his 65-year-old otherwise healthy
  father also had very subtle involuntary movements. A diagnosis of atypical Gilles
  de la Tourette syndrome was made. However, the neurological and psychiatric symptoms
  of the patient rapidly progressed over the following 2 years, resulting in increasingly
  severe involuntary movements and profound mood disorder. Further diagnostic tests
  were performed, and a genetic screening for Huntington disease revealed 45 repeats
  of the CAG nucleotide in the IT-15 gene. CONCLUSION: This case underlines the marked
  phenotypic variability of Huntington disease at presentation, including the presence
  of involuntary movements different from chorea and possibility of an apparently
  sporadic disorder.'
