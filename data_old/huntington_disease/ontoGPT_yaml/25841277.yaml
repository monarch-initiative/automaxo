input_text: PET/MR in dementia and other neurodegenerative diseases. The spectrum
  of neurodegenerative diseases covers the dementias, parkinsonian syndromes, Huntington
  disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and prion diseases. In these entities, brain
  MRI is often used in clinical routine to exclude other pathologies and to demonstrate
  specific atrophy patterns. [18F]FDG PET delivers early and sensitive readouts of
  neural tissue loss, and more specific PET tracers currently in use clinically target
  beta-amyloid plaques or dopaminergic deficiency. The recent integration of PET into
  MR technology offers a new chance to improve early and differential diagnosis of
  many neurodegenerative diseases. Initial evidence in the literature is available
  to support this notion. New emerging PET tracers, such as tracers that bind to tau
  or alpha-synuclein aggregates, as well as MR techniques, like diffusion-tensor imaging,
  resting-state functional MRI, and arterial spin labeling, have the potential to
  broaden the diagnostic capabilities of combined PET/MRI to image dementias, Parkinson
  disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases. The ultimate goal is to establish
  combined PET/MRI as a first-line imaging technique to provide, in a one-stop-shop
  fashion with improved patient comfort, all biomarker information required to increase
  diagnostic confidence toward specific diagnoses. The technical challenge of accurate
  PET data attenuation correction within PET/MRI systems needs yet to be solved. Apart
  from the projected clinical routine applications, future research would need to
  answer the questions of whether combined brain PET/MRI is able to improve basic
  research of neurodegenerative diseases and antineurodegeneration drug testing.
