input_text: Proteins in aggregates functionally impact multiple neurodegenerative
  disease models by forming proteasome-blocking complexes. Age-dependent neurodegenerative
  diseases progressively form aggregates containing both shared components (e.g.,
  TDP-43, phosphorylated tau) and proteins specific to each disease. We investigated
  whether diverse neuropathies might have additional aggregation-prone proteins in
  common, discoverable by proteomics. Caenorhabditis elegans expressing unc-54p/Q40::YFP,
  a model of polyglutamine array diseases such as Huntington's, accrues aggregates
  in muscle 2-6 days posthatch. These foci, isolated on antibody-coupled magnetic
  beads, were characterized by high-resolution mass spectrometry. Three Q40::YFP-associated
  proteins were inferred to promote aggregation and cytotoxicity, traits reduced or
  delayed by their RNA interference knockdown. These RNAi treatments also retarded
  aggregation/cytotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease models, nematodes with muscle or
  pan-neuronal Abeta1-42 expression and behavioral phenotypes. The most abundant aggregated
  proteins are glutamine/asparagine-rich, favoring hydrophobic interactions with other
  random-coil domains. A particularly potent modulator of aggregation, CRAM-1/HYPK,
  contributed < 1% of protein aggregate peptides, yet its knockdown reduced Q40::YFP
  aggregates 72-86% (P < 10(-6) ). In worms expressing Abeta1-42, knockdown of cram-1
  reduced beta-amyloid 60% (P < 0.002) and slowed age-dependent paralysis > 30% (P
  < 10(-6)). In wild-type worms, cram-1 knockdown reduced aggregation and extended
  lifespan, but impaired early reproduction. Protection against seeded aggregates
  requires proteasome function, implying that normal CRAM-1 levels promote aggregation
  by interfering with proteasomal degradation of misfolded proteins. Molecular dynamic
  modeling predicts spontaneous and stable interactions of CRAM-1 (or human orthologs)
  with ubiquitin, and we verified that CRAM-1 reduces degradation of a tagged-ubiquitin
  reporter. We propose that CRAM-1 exemplifies a class of primitive chaperones that
  are initially protective and highly beneficial for early reproduction, but ultimately
  impair aggregate clearance and limit longevity.
