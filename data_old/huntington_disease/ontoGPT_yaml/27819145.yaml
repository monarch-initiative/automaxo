input_text: 'Dopamine depleters in the treatment of hyperkinetic movement disorders.
  INTRODUCTION: Abnormal involuntary movements often improve in response to anti-dopaminergic
  drugs. In contrast to classic neuroleptics that block dopamine receptors, drugs
  that deplete presynaptic dopamine by blocking vesicular monoamine transporter type
  2 (VMAT2) seem to be safer and have little or no risk of tardive dyskinesia. This
  is one reason why there has been a recent emergence of novel VMAT2 inhibitors. Areas
  covered: Since the approval of tetrabenazine, the classic VMAT2 inhibitor, in the
  treatment of chorea associated with Huntington disease (HD), other VMAT2 inhibitors
  (e.g. deutetrabenazine and valbenazine) have been studied in the treatment of HD-related
  chorea, tardive dyskinesia and tics associated with Tourette syndrome. This review,
  based largely on a detailed search of PubMed, will summarize the pharmacology and
  clinical experience with the various VMAT2 inhibitors. Expert commentary: Because
  of differences in pharmacology and pharmacokinetics these new VMAT2 inhibitors promise
  to be at least as effective as tetrabenazine but with a lower risk of adverse effects,
  such as sedation, insomnia, depression, parkinsonism, and akathisia.'
