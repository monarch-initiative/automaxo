input_text: 'Huntington disease: pathogenesis and treatment. Huntington disease (HD)
  is an autosomal dominant inherited neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive
  motor, behavioral, and cognitive decline, culminating in death. It is caused by
  an expanded CAG repeat in the huntingtin gene. Even years before symptoms become
  overt, mutation carriers show subtle but progressive striatal and cerebral white
  matter atrophy by volumetric MRI. Although there is currently no direct treatment
  of HD, management options are available for several symptoms. A better understanding
  of HD pathogenesis, and more sophisticated clinical trials using newer biomarkers,
  may lead to meaningful treatments. This article reviews the current knowledge of
  HD pathogenesis and treatment. '

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
  object: <A sign or symptom associated with the disease and targeted by the medical action. For example, Low serum calcitriol, hypoplasia of the thymus, chronic cough, aortic stiffness, low pulse pressure>
  qualifier: <The primary disease the relationship is about, or specifically the disease the symptom is related to. For example, Beck-Fahrner syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, progeria, diabetes mellitus, infectious otitis media>
