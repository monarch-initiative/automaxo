input_text: "How tandem gait stumbled into the neurological exam: a review. Tandem
  gait testing is an integral part of the neurological exam. It is informative in
  a wide variety of disorders ranging from cerebellar disease to vestibular and peripheral
  neuropathies, parkinsonism, and other neurodegenerative conditions. We discuss the
  history and development of tandem gait testing as well as its technique, utility,
  and limitations in the assessment of neurological conditions. Tandem gait has emerged
  as a tool in the assessment of cerebellar disease, Huntington disease, idiopathic
  Parkinson's disease, atypical parkinsonism, peripheral neuropathies, and vestibulopathies.
  Its origin can be deduced from experimental observation and clinical experience
  as far back as the early nineteenth century. Despite the long history and ubiquitous
  performance of tandem gait testing, there is no standardized, guideline-based protocol
  to model for more homogenous research and clinical practices. Such a protocol should
  be developed using historical texts and manuscripts as well as the consensus of
  the medical research community. With standard protocols, further studies could define
  the sensitivity of abnormal tandem gait testing in cerebellar disorders, more diffuse
  neurodegeneration, and peripheral pathologies. Tandem gait can be a useful marker
  of dysfunction in neurologic conditions whose pathologies extend beyond the vermis
  or vestibulocerebellar module to include interconnected networks throughout the
  nervous system."
