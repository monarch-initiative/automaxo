input_text: Longitudinal Anthropometric Assessment of Rhesus Macaque (Macaca mulatta)
  Model of Huntington Disease. The neurodegeneration associated with Huntington disease
  (HD) leads to the onset of motor and cognitive impairment and their advancement
  with increased age in humans. In children at risk for HD, body measurement growth
  abnormalities include a reduction in BMI, weight, height, and head circumference.
  The transgenic HD NHP model was first reported in 2008, and progressive decline
  in cognitive behaviors and motor impairment have been reported. This study focuses
  on longitudinal body measurements in HD macaques from infancy through adulthood.
  The growth of HD macaques was assessed through head circumference, sagittal and
  transverse head, and crown-to-rump ('height') measurements and BMI. The animals
  were measured monthly from 0 to 72 mo of age and every 3 mo from 72 mo of age onward.
  A mixed-effect model was used to assess subject-specific effects in our nonlinear
  serial data. Compared with WT controls, HD macaques displayed different developmental
  trajectories characterized by increased BMI, head circumference, and sagittal head
  measurements beginning around 40 mo of age. The physiologic comparability between
  NHP and humans underscores the translational utility of our HD macaques to evaluate
  growth and developmental patterns associated with HD.
