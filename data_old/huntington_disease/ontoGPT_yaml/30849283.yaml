input_text: "Perceptions of the impact of chorea on health-related quality of life
  in Huntington disease (HD): A qualitative analysis of individuals across the HD
  spectrum, family members, and clinicians. Chorea, a hallmark symptom of Huntington's
  disease (HD), is characterized by jerky involuntary movements affecting the whole
  body that can interfere with daily functioning and impact health-related quality
  of life (HRQOL). To characterize chorea's impact on everyday functioning and HRQOL
  and identify patterns of perception and experiences of chorea among patients, caregivers,
  and providers. Data from focus groups of individuals with manifest HD (n = 8 early-stage
  HD; n = 16 late-stage HD), individuals at-risk or prodromal HD (n = 16), family
  HD caregivers (n = 17), and HD clinicians (n = 25). Focus group recordings were
  transcribed verbatim and analysed via constant comparison to identify meaningful
  and salient themes of living with chorea. Global themes of chorea's impact identified
  included: watching for chorea, experiences of stigma, and constraints on independence
  and relationships. Themes distinct to specific respondent groups included: Vigilance
  (at risk, prodromal); adaptation to chorea (early-stage); loss of autonomy and social
  life (late-stage); monitoring engagement (family caregivers) and safety (clinical
  providers). Living with chorea significantly constrains daily functioning, interactions,
  and HRQOL across the HD disease spectrum. Addressing these impacts via appropriate
  management of chorea can potentially enhance functioning, HRQOL, and overall satisfaction
  for persons with HD and their families."
