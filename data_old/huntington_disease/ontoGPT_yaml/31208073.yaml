input_text: Intranasal Administration of Mesenchymal Stem Cells Ameliorates the Abnormal
  Dopamine Transmission System and Inflammatory Reaction in the R6/2 Mouse Model of
  Huntington Disease. Intrastriatal administration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)
  has shown beneficial effects in rodent models of Huntington disease (HD). However,
  the invasive nature of surgical procedure and its potential to trigger the host
  immune response may limit its clinical use. Hence, we sought to evaluate the non-invasive
  intranasal administration (INA) of MSC delivery as an effective alternative route
  in HD. GFP-expressing MSCs derived from bone marrow were intranasally administered
  to 4-week-old R6/2 HD transgenic mice. MSCs were detected in the olfactory bulb,
  midbrain and striatum five days post-delivery. Compared to phosphate-buffered saline
  (PBS)-treated littermates, MSC-treated R6/2 mice showed an increased survival rate
  and attenuated circadian activity disruption assessed by locomotor activity. MSCs
  increased the protein expression of DARPP-32 and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and downregulated
  gene expression of inflammatory modulators in the brain 7.5 weeks after INA. While
  vehicle treated R6/2 mice displayed decreased Iba1 expression and altered microglial
  morphology in comparison to the wild type littermates, MSCs restored both, Iba1
  level and the thickness of microglial processes in the striatum of R6/2 mice. Our
  results demonstrate significantly ameliorated phenotypes of R6/2 mice after MSCs
  administration via INA, suggesting this method as an effective delivering route
  of cells to the brain for HD therapy.
