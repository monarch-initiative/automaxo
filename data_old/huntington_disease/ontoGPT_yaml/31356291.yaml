input_text: 'Chorea. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article provides an overview of the approach
  to chorea in clinical practice, beginning with a discussion of the phenomenologic
  features of chorea and how to differentiate it from other movement disorders. The
  diagnostic approach, clinical features of important acquired and genetic choreas,
  and therapeutic principles are also discussed. Practical clinical points and caveats
  are included. RECENT FINDINGS: C9orf72 disease is the most common Huntington disease
  phenocopy, according to studies in the European population. Anti-IgLON5 disease
  can present with chorea. The role of immunotherapies in Sydenham chorea has increased,
  and further clinical studies may be useful. Benign hereditary chorea is a syndrome
  or phenotype due to mutations in several genes, including NKX2-1, ADCY5, GNAO1,
  and PDE10A. New-generation presynaptic dopamine-depleting agents provide more options
  for symptomatic treatment of chorea with fewer adverse effects. Deep brain stimulation
  has been performed in several choreic disorders, but features other than chorea
  and the neurodegenerative nature should be taken into consideration. Studies on
  genetic interventions for Huntington disease are ongoing. SUMMARY: Clinical features
  remain crucial in guiding the differential diagnosis and appropriate investigations
  in chorea. Given the complexity of most choreic disorders, treating only the chorea
  is not sufficient. A comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach is required.'
