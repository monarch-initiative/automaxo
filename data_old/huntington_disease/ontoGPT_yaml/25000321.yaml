input_text: "Everyday cognition in prodromal Huntington disease. OBJECTIVE: Assessment
  of daily functions affected by cognitive loss in prodromal Huntington's disease
  (HD) is necessary in practice and clinical trials. We evaluated baseline and longitudinal
  sensitivity of the Everyday Cognition (ECog) scales in prodromal HD and compared
  self- and companion-ratings. METHOD: Everyday cognition was self-assessed by 850
  participants with prodromal HD and 768 companions. We examined internal structure
  using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on baseline data. For longitudinal analysis,
  we stratified participants into Low, Medium, and High disease progression groups.
  We examined ECog scores for group differences and participant-and-companion differences
  using linear mixed effects regression (LMER). Comparison with the Total Functional
  Capacity (TFC) scale was made. RESULTS: CFA revealed good fit of a 5-factor model
  having a global factor (total score), and subfactors (subscales) of memory, language,
  visuospatial perception, and executive function. At study entry, participants and
  companions in the Medium and High groups reported significantly worsened everyday
  cognition as well as significant functional decline over time. Losses became more
  pronounced and participant and companion ratings diverged as individuals progressed.
  TFC showed significant functional loss over time in the High group but not in the
  Medium group. CONCLUSIONS: Disease progression is associated with reduced self-
  and companion-reported everyday cognition in prodromal HD participants who are less
  than 13 years to estimated motor onset. Our findings suggest companion ratings are
  more sensitive than participants' for detecting longitudinal change in daily cognitive
  function. ECog appears more sensitive to specific functional changes in the prodrome
  of HD than the TFC."
