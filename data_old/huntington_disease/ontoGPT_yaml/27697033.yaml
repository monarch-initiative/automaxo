input_text: 'Recombinant Antibody Fragments for Neurodegenerative Diseases. BACKGROUND:
  Recombinant antibody fragments are promising alternatives to full-length immunoglobulins
  and offer important advantages compared with conventional monoclonal antibodies:
  extreme specificity, higher affinity, superior stability and solubility, reduced
  immunogenicity as well as easy and inexpensive large-scale production. OBJECTIVE:
  In this article we will review and discuss recombinant antibodies that are being
  evaluated for neurodegenerative diseases in pre-clinical models and in clinical
  studies and will summarize new strategies that are being developed to optimize their
  stability, specificity and potency for advancing their use. METHODS: Articles describing
  recombinant antibody fragments used for neurological diseases were selected (PubMed)
  and evaluated for their significance. RESULTS: Different antibody formats such as
  single-chain fragment variable (scFv), single-domain antibody fragments (VHHs or
  sdAbs), bispecific antibodies (bsAbs), intrabodies and nanobodies, are currently
  being studied in pre-clinical models of cancer as well as infectious and autoimmune
  diseases and many of them are being tested as therapeutics in clinical trials. Immunotherapy
  approaches have shown therapeutic efficacy in several animal models of Alzheimer
  s disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), frontotemporal
  dementia (FTD), Huntington disease (HD), transmissible spongiform encephalopathies
  (TSEs) and multiple sclerosis (MS). It has been demonstrated that recombinant antibody
  fragments may neutralize toxic extra- and intracellular misfolded proteins involved
  in the pathogenesis of AD, PD, DLB, FTD, HD or TSEs and may target toxic immune
  cells participating in the pathogenesis of MS. CONCLUSION: Recombinant antibody
  fragments represent a promising tool for the development of antibody-based immunotherapeutics
  for neurodegenerative diseases.'
