input_text: "Characterization of structural changes occurring in insulin at different
  time intervals at room temperature by surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. BACKGROUND:
  Insulin storage above the temperature recommended by food and drug administration
  (FDA) causes decrease in its functional efficacy due to degradation and aggregation
  of its protein based active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) that results poor glycemic
  control in diabetic patients. The aggregation of protein causes serious neurodegenerative
  diseases such as type-2 diabetes, Huntington disease, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's
  disease. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has been employed for the denaturation
  study of many proteins at the temperature above the recommendations of food and
  drug administration (FDA) (above 30  C) which indicates potential of technique for
  such studies. OBJECTIVE: SERS along with multivariate discriminating analysis techniques-based
  analysis of degradation of liquid pharmaceutical insulin protein after regular intervals
  of time at room temperature to analyze the structural changes in this protein during
  the storage of insulin pharmaceutical at room temperature. METHODS: Silver nanoparticles
  (Ag-NPs) prepared by chemical reduction method are used as SERS active substrate
  for the surface enhancement of the insulin spectral signal. SERS spectral measurements
  of insulin were collected from eight different samples of insulin in the time range
  of 7pm to 7am first at fridge temperature (5  C), second after half hour and next
  six with the time difference of 2 hours each time at room temperature. The acquired
  SERS spectral data was preprocessed and analyzed. SERS structural transformations
  detection and discrimination potential in insulin was further confirmed by applying
  multivariate discriminating analysis techniques including principal component analysis
  (PCA) and Partial least square regression analysis (PLSR). RESULTS: SERS significantly
  detects the structural changes produced in insulin even after 2h of insulin placement
  at room temperature. PCA successfully differentiates the insulin spectral data obtained
  after regular intervals of time according to PC-1 (77%) explained variance. Application
  of PLSR model provides quantitative confirmation of SERS efficiency, by providing
  insulin data regression coefficients plot, efficient prediction of time with calibration
  data set having 0.77 mean square absolute error of calibration (RMSAEC), validation
  data set with 0.80 mean square absolute error of prediction (RMSAEP) and 0.98 coefficient
  of determination (R2) for both calibration and validation data set. CONCLUSION:
  SERS is proved as a highly sensitive and discriminating technique to detect and
  discriminate insulin structural changes after regular intervals of time at room
  temperature."
