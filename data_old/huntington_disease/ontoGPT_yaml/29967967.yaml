input_text: Perspectives on Genetic Testing and Return of Results from the First Cohort
  of Presymptomatically Tested Individuals At Risk of Huntington Disease. This qualitative
  study gathered opinions about genetic testing from people who received presymptomatic
  testing for Huntington's disease (HD) 20-30 years ago and have lived with the implications
  of that testing for decades. During the last section of a semi-structured interview,
  participants were asked open-ended questions about their opinions on the importance
  of autonomy in the decision to be tested for HD, whether a formal HD testing protocol
  is necessary, whether physician ordering for HD is acceptable without a formal protocol,
  whether online direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing for HD is acceptable, and
  whether incidental/secondary findings should be returned in the context of whole
  exome/genome sequencing. Most-but not all-participants were in favor of an individual's
  right to decide whether and when to pursue HD testing, use of a formal HD testing
  protocol, and returning medically actionable secondary findings. However, the majority
  of participants were opposed not only to physician ordering and DTC HD testing in
  the absence of a formal protocol but also to returning a secondary finding of an
  expanded HD allele. This study presents the opinions of a unique and extremely well-informed
  cohort on issues that need to be taken into careful consideration by genetic counselors
  and other medical professionals who are developing genetic testing protocols, making
  decisions about the availability of genetic tests, and making decisions about whether
  and how to return incidental findings.
