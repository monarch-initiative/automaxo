input_text: 'microLAS: Sizing of expanded trinucleotide repeats with femtomolar sensitivity
  in less than 5 minutes. We present microLAS, a lab-on-chip system that concentrates,
  separates, and detects DNA fragments in a single module. microLAS speeds up DNA
  size analysis in minutes using femtomolar amounts of amplified DNA. Here we tested
  the relevance of microLAS for sizing expanded trinucleotide repeats, which cause
  over 20 different neurological and neuromuscular disorders. Because the length of
  trinucleotide repeats correlates with the severity of the diseases, it is crucial
  to be able to size repeat tract length accurately and efficiently. Expanded trinucleotide
  repeats are however genetically unstable and difficult to amplify. Thus, the amount
  of amplified material to work with is often limited, making its analysis labor-intensive.
  We report the detection of heterogeneous allele lengths in 8 samples from myotonic
  dystrophy type 1 and Huntington disease patients with up to 750 CAG/CTG repeats
  in five minutes or less. The high sensitivity of the method allowed us to minimize
  the number of amplification cycles and thus reduce amplification artefacts without
  compromising the detection of the expanded allele. These results suggest that microLAS
  can speed up routine molecular biology applications of repetitive sequences and
  may improve the molecular diagnostic of expanded repeat disorders.'
