input_text: "Emotion Recognition Correlates With Social-Neuropsychiatric Dysfunction
  in Huntington's Disease. OBJECTIVES: People with Huntington's disease (HD) experience
  poor social quality of life, relationship breakdown, and social withdrawal, which
  are mediated to some extent by socially debilitating neuropsychiatric symptoms,
  such as apathy and disinhibition. Social cognitive symptoms, such as impaired emotion
  recognition, also occur in HD, however, the extent of their association with these
  socially debilitating neuropsychiatric symptoms is unknown. Our study examined the
  relationship between emotion recognition and symptom ratings of apathy and disinhibition
  in HD. METHODS: Thirty-two people with premanifest or symptomatic-HD completed Part
  1 of The Awareness of Social Inference Test (TASIT), which is a facial emotion recognition
  task. In addition, we obtained severity ratings for apathy and disinhibition on
  the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale (FrSBe) from a close family member. Our analyses
  used motor symptom severity as a proxy for disease progression. RESULTS: Emotion
  recognition performance was significantly associated with family-ratings of apathy,
  above and beyond their shared association with disease severity. We found a similar
  pattern for disinhibition ratings, which fell short of statistical significance.
  As expected, worse emotion recognition performance was correlated with higher severity
  in FrSBe symptom ratings. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that emotion recognition
  abilities relate to key socially debilitating neuropsychiatric symptoms in HD. Our
  results help to understand the functional significance of emotion recognition impairments
  in HD, and may have implications for the development of remediation programs aimed
  at improving patients' social quality of life. (JINS, 2018, 24, 417-423)."
