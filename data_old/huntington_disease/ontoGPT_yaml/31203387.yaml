input_text: Uses for humanised mouse models in precision medicine for neurodegenerative
  disease. Neurodegenerative disease encompasses a wide range of disorders afflicting
  the central and peripheral nervous systems and is a major unmet biomedical need
  of our time. There are very limited treatments, and no cures, for most of these
  diseases, including Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Huntington Disease,
  and Motor Neuron Diseases. Mouse and other animal models provide hope by analysing
  them to understand pathogenic mechanisms, to identify drug targets, and to develop
  gene therapies and stem cell therapies. However, despite many decades of research,
  virtually no new treatments have reached the clinic. Increasingly, it is apparent
  that human heterogeneity within clinically defined neurodegenerative disorders,
  and between patients with the same genetic mutations, significantly impacts disease
  presentation and, potentially, therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, stratifying patients
  according to genetics, lifestyle, disease presentation, ethnicity, and other parameters
  may hold the key to bringing effective therapies from the bench to the clinic. Here,
  we discuss genetic and cellular humanised mouse models, and how they help in defining
  the genetic and environmental parameters associated with neurodegenerative disease,
  and so help in developing effective precision medicine strategies for future healthcare.
