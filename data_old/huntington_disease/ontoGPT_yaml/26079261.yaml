input_text: "Presentation of multiple sclerosis with comorbid Huntington's disease.
  We report a case of Huntington's disease (HD) in a 53-year-old male with multiple
  sclerosis (MS). The diagnosis of MS met the McDonald criteria and was based on clinical
  attacks separated in space and time, cerebrospinal fluid, and MRI. The diagnosis
  of HD was established by DNA testing, family history, and positron emission tomography.
  While a number of neurologic and autoimmune diseases have been reported with MS,
  this is the first co-occurrence of HD and MS. Salient features of both disorders
  are reviewed as well as the importance of obtaining a thorough family history. "

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
