input_text: The phasor-FLIM fingerprints reveal shifts from OXPHOS to enhanced glycolysis
  in Huntington Disease. Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal neurodegenerative
  disorder caused by the expansion of Polyglutamine (polyQ) in exon 1 of the Huntingtin
  protein. Glutamine repeats below 36 are considered normal while repeats above 40
  lead to HD. Impairment in energy metabolism is a common trend in Huntington pathogenesis;
  however, this effect is not fully understood. Here, we used the phasor approach
  and Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) to measure changes between free
  and bound fractions of NADH as a indirect measure of metabolic alteration in living
  cells. Using Phasor-FLIM, pixel maps of metabolic alteration in HEK293 cell lines
  and in transgenic Drosophila expressing expanded and unexpanded polyQ HTT exon1
  in the eye disc were developed. We found a significant shift towards increased free
  NADH, indicating an increased glycolytic state for cells and tissues expressing
  the expanded polyQ compared to unexpanded control. In the nucleus, a further lifetime
  shift occurs towards higher free NADH suggesting a possible synergism between metabolic
  dysfunction and transcriptional regulation. Our results indicate that metabolic
  dysfunction in HD shifts to increased glycolysis leading to oxidative stress and
  cell death. This powerful label free method can be used to screen native HD tissue
  samples and for potential drug screening.
