input_text: 'Striatal morphology and neurocognitive dysfunction in Huntington disease:
  The IMAGE-HD study. We aimed to investigate the relationship between striatal morphology
  in Huntington disease (HD) and measures of motor and cognitive dysfunction. MRI
  scans, from the IMAGE-HD study, were obtained from 36 individuals with pre-symptomatic
  HD (pre-HD), 37 with early symptomatic HD (symp-HD), and 36 healthy matched controls.
  The neostriatum was manually segmented and a surface-based parametric mapping protocol
  derived two pointwise shape measures: thickness and surface dilation ratio. Significant
  shape differences were detected between all groups. Negative associations were detected
  between lower thickness and surface area shape measure and CAG repeats, disease
  burden score, and UHDRS total motor score. In symp-HD, UPSIT scores were correlated
  with higher thickness in left caudate tail and surface dilation ratio in left posterior
  putamen; Stroop scores were positively correlated with the thickness of left putamen
  head and body. Self-paced tapping (slow) was correlated with higher thickness and
  surface dilation ratio in the right caudate in symp-HD and with bilateral putamen
  in pre-HD. Self-paced tapping (fast) was correlated with higher surface dilation
  ratio in the right anterior putamen in symp-HD. Shape changes correlated with functional
  measures subserved by corticostriatal circuits, suggesting that the neostriatum
  is a potentially useful structural basis for characterisation of endophenotypes
  of HD.'
