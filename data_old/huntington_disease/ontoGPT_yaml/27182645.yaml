input_text: DNA Methylation Leads to DNA Repair Gene Down-Regulation and Trinucleotide
  Repeat Expansion in Patient-Derived Huntington Disease Cells. Huntington disease
  (HD) is an autosomal dominantly inherited disease that exhibits genetic anticipation
  of affected progeny due to expansions of a trinucleotide repeat (TNR) region within
  the HTT gene. DNA repair machinery is a known effector of TNR instability; however,
  the specific defects in HD cells that lead to TNR expansion are unknown. We hypothesized
  that HD cells would be deficient in DNA repair gene expression. To test this hypothesis,
  we analyzed expression of select DNA repair genes involved in mismatch/loop-out
  repair (APEX1, BRCA1, RPA1, and RPA3) in patient-derived HD cells and found each
  was consistently down-regulated relative to wild-type samples taken from unaffected
  individuals in the same family. Rescue of DNA repair gene expression by 5-azacytidine
  treatment identified DNA methylation as a mediator of DNA repair gene expression
  deficiency. Bisulfite sequencing confirmed hypermethylation of the APEX1 promoter
  region in HD cells relative to control, as well as 5-azacytidine-induced hypomethylation.
  5-Azacytidine treatments also resulted in stabilization of TNR expansion within
  the mutant HTT allele during long-term culture of HD cells. Our findings indicate
  that DNA methylation leads to DNA repair down-regulation and TNR instability in
  mitotically active HD cells and offer a proof of principle that epigenetic interventions
  can curb TNR expansions.
