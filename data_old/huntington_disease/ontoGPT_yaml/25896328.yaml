input_text: "Neuroprotective potential of antioxidant potent fractions from Convolvulus
  pluricaulis Chois. in 3-nitropropionic acid challenged rats. OBJECTIVE: To isolate
  the neuroprotective component from Convolvulus pluricaulis Chois. (Convolvulaceae)
  which can be used as a lead molecule in the treatment of Huntington's disease (HD).
  METHODS: The methanolic extract of whole plant was fractionated into four fractions;
  chloroform, ethyl acetate, n-butanol, and aqueous fraction. The chloroform and ethyl
  acetate fractions were pooled on the basis of antioxidant activity and TLC profile
  and charged into silica gel column. Four subfractions were collected from column
  (FrA, FrB, FrC, and FrD) and further assessed for antioxidant potential by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl
  in vitro assay. 3-Nitropropionic acid (3-NP) was administered to Wister rats for
  induction of HD. Different fractions were administered for 14 days. Different behavioral
  alterations were assessed in between study period. Animals were euthanized immediately
  following the last behavioral session, and biochemical parameters were measured.
  RESULT AND DISCUSSION: Systemic administration of 3-NP showed marked motor deficits
  and oxidative damage in rats. Only FrB showed significant antioxidant activity and
  on further purification gave pure compound (scopoletin). Our study showed that FrB
  (20 mg/kg) pre-treatment significantly attenuated the loss in body weight, improved
  the locomotor activity, grip strength, and gait abnormalities. It also has attenuated
  the increased malondialdehyde and nitrite levels, and restored superoxide dismutase
  and reduced GSH enzyme activity in the striatum and cortex in 3-NP-treated groups.
  These results suggest that C. pluricaulis Chois. exhibits a neuroprotective effect
  by accelerating brain antioxidant defense mechanisms in 3-NP-treated rats."
