input_text: The role of rehabilitation therapy in Huntington disease. The role of
  rehabilitation interventions is increasingly considered a key component to effective
  management of people with Huntington disease (HD). Lifestyle factors, such as activity
  level and exercise, as well as specific motor training may be helpful in managing
  the functional sequelae of HD and possibly slowing disease progression. In this
  chapter, we focus on the role of rehabilitation therapy in secondary and tertiary
  prevention of the potentially devastating consequences of HD. We provide a brief
  overview of the range of motor and cognitive impairments in HD and their effect
  on functional abilities. We further discuss emerging evidence in terms of the role
  of exercise, physical activity, and physical therapies in helping to minimize functional
  loss and maximize quality of life throughout the disease process. Future directions
  with respect to intensive and goal-directed exercise, including aerobic and strengthening
  programs, are also discussed. This is an area of particular importance alongside
  exploring the potential that motor-training paradigms have in mediating the effects
  of disease-modifying drugs, cell replacement therapy, or genetic manipulations,
  when available.
