input_text: Surface-based morphometry reveals caudate subnuclear structural damage
  in patients with premotor Huntington disease. In patients with premotor Huntington's
  disease (pmHD), literature has reported decreases in caudate volume. However, the
  regional vulnerability of the caudate nucleus to pmHD remains to be clarified. We
  aimed to determine whether regional structural damage of the caudate nucleus was
  present in pmHD and was correlated with clinical profile using a surface-based morphometric
  technique applied to T1-weighted MRI. The study cohort consisted of 14 volunteers
  with genetically confirmed pmHD (6 males; 41.8 +- 13.2 years) and 11 age- and sex-matched
  controls (5 males; 46.2 +- 11.9 years, p > 0.3). On 3-T T1-weighted images, bilateral
  caudate volumes were manually delineated. The resulting labels were converted to
  a surface, triangulated with 1002 points equally distributed across subjects using
  SPHARM-PDM. Displacement vectors were then computed between each individual and
  a template surface representing the whole cohort. Computing point-wise Jacobian
  determinants (JD) from these vectors quantified local volumes. We found decreases
  in bilateral global caudate volumes in the pmHD group compared to controls (t =
  3.4; p = 0.002). Point-wise analysis of local volumes mapped caudate atrophy in
  pmHD primarily onto medial surface (t > 2.7; FDR < 0.05), with most pronounced changes
  in anteromedial subdivision. In a combined group of patients and controls, volume
  within the area presenting significant group difference was positively correlated
  with scores of executive function (r = 0.7; p < 0.001) and working memory (r = 0.6;
  p = 0.002). In patients, the caudate atrophy was associated with increase in disease
  burden (r = 0.7; p = 0.005). Caudate subnuclear atrophy measured using our surface-based
  morphometric technique is evident in pmHD, correlates with clinical variables, and
  may provide a more sensitive biomarker than global volumes.
