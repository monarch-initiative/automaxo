input_text: 'Connections between the internal and the external capsules and the globus
  pallidus in the sheep: A dichromate stain X-ray microtomographic study. Sheep are
  recognized as useful species for translational neurodegeneration research, in particular
  for the study of Huntington disease. There is a lack of information regarding the
  detailed anatomy and connections of the basal ganglia of sheep, in normal myeloarchitectonics
  and in tract-tracing studies. In this work, the organization of the corticostriatal
  projections at the level of the putamen and globus pallidus (GP) are explored. For
  the first time, the myeloarchitectonic pattern of connections between the internal
  (IC) and the external (EC) capsules with the GP have been investigated in the sheep.
  Formaldehyde-fixed blocks of the striatum were treated with a metallic stain containing
  potassium dichromate and visualized using micro-CT (micro-CT). The trivalent chromium
  (Cr3+), attached to myelin phospholipids, imparts a differential contrast to the
  grey and white matter compartments, which allows the visualization of myelinated
  fascicles in micro-CT images. The fascicles were classified according to their topographical
  location in dorsal supreme fascicles (X, Y, apex) arising from the IC and EC; pre-commissurally,
  basal fascicles connecting the ventral part of the EC with the lateral zone of the
  ventral pallidum (VP) and, post-commissurally, superior (Z1 ), middle (Z2 ) and
  lower (Z3 ) fascicles, connecting at different levels the EC with the GP. The results
  suggest that the presumptive cortical efferent and afferent fibres to the pallidum
  could be organized according to a dorsal to ventrolateral topography in the sheep,
  similar to that seen in other mammals. The proposed methodology has the potential
  to delineate the myeloarchitectonic patterns of nervous systems and tracts.'
