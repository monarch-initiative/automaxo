input_text: Early pridopidine treatment improves behavioral and transcriptional deficits
  in YAC128 Huntington disease mice. Pridopidine is currently under clinical development
  for Huntington disease (HD), with on-going studies to better characterize its therapeutic
  benefit and mode of action. Pridopidine was administered either prior to the appearance
  of disease phenotypes or in advanced stages of disease in the YAC128 mouse model
  of HD. In the early treatment cohort, animals received 0, 10, or 30 mg/kg pridopidine
  for a period of 10.5 months. In the late treatment cohort, animals were treated
  for 8 weeks with 0 mg/kg or an escalating dose of pridopidine (10 to 30 mg/kg over
  3 weeks). Early treatment improved motor coordination and reduced anxiety- and depressive-like
  phenotypes in YAC128 mice, but it did not rescue striatal and corpus callosum atrophy.
  Late treatment, conversely, only improved depressive-like symptoms. RNA-seq analysis
  revealed that early pridopidine treatment reversed striatal transcriptional deficits,
  upregulating disease-specific genes that are known to be downregulated during HD,
  a finding that is experimentally confirmed herein. This suggests that pridopidine
  exerts beneficial effects at the transcriptional level. Taken together, our findings
  support continued clinical development of pridopidine for HD, particularly in the
  early stages of disease, and provide valuable insight into the potential therapeutic
  mode of action of pridopidine.
