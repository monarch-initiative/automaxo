input_text: "Optical coherence tomography angiography findings in Huntington's disease.
  OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the retinal and choriocapillaris vascular networks in macular
  region and the central choroidal thickness (CCT) in patients affected by Huntington
  disease (HD), using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) and enhanced
  depth imaging spectral-domain OCT (EDI SD-OCT). METHODS: We assessed the vessel
  density (VD) in superficial capillary plexus (SCP), deep capillary plexus (DCP),
  and choriocapillaris (CC) using OCTA, while CCT was measured by EDI SD-OCT. RESULTS:
  Sixteen HD patients (32 eyes) and thirteen healthy controls (26 eyes) were enrolled
  in this prospective study. No significant difference in retinal and choriocapillaris
  VD was found between HD patients and controls while CCT turned to be thinner in
  patients respect to controls. There were no significant relationships between OCTA
  findings and neurological parameters. CONCLUSION: The changes in choroidal structure
  provide useful information regarding the possible neurovascular involvement in the
  physiopathology of HD. Choroidal vascular network could be a useful parameter to
  evaluate the vascular impairment that occurs in this neurodegenerative disease."
