input_text: 'Huntington Mice Demonstrate Diminished Pain Response in Inflammatory
  Pain Model. BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD) affects the nervous system and leads
  to mental and motor dysfunction. Previous studies have shown that HD is caused by
  the exon 1 region of the huntingtin (HTT) gene having expanded CAG trinucleotide
  repeats. However, few studies have focused on the relationship between HD and pain.
  The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between HD and pain
  response. METHODS: We used clinical similar transgenic HD mice carrying a mutant
  HTT exon 1 containing 84 CAG trinucleotide repeats to evaluate the relationship
  between HD and pain. Inflammatory pain models were induced by either formalin or
  complete Freund adjuvant injection over the hind paw. Spinal cord, dorsal root ganglion,
  and paw skin tissues were harvested at the end of the behavioral inflammatory pain
  studies. Immunofluorescence assay, Western blotting, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent
  assay were used to identify changes in cells and cytokines. RESULTS: Our data demonstrate
  that preonset HD mice exhibited less pain behavior than wild-type (WT) mice in both
  young (n = 11 [WT], 13 [HD]) and aged (n = 8 [WT], 9 [HD]) mice. Western blotting
  and immunohistological examination of lumbar spinal cord tissue and dorsal root
  ganglion indicate less activation of glial cells and astrocytes in young HD mice
  (n = 6-7) compared to that in WT mice (n = 6-7). The production levels of tumor
  necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta, and substance P were also lower in young
  HD mice (n = 6-7). CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate less pain behavior and pain-related
  cytokine response at the spinal cord level for HD mice compared to those for WT
  mice. Further studies are needed for determining the mechanism as to how mutant
  HTT leads to altered pain behavior and pain-related cytokine response.'
