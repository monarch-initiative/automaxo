input_text: 'Early Intrathecal T Helper 17.1 Cell Activity in Huntington Disease.
  OBJECTIVE: Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominantly inherited neurodegenerative
  disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. No disease-modifying
  therapy exists for the treatment of patients with HD. The purpose of this study
  was therefore to investigate early disease mechanisms that potentially could be
  used as a target therapeutically. METHODS: Lymphocyte activity in cerebrospinal
  fluid (CSF) from 4 cohorts of HTT gene expansion carriers (n = 121 in total) and
  controls was analyzed by techniques based on flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent
  assays. RESULTS: The data of this study provide evidence of immune abnormalities
  before motor onset of disease. In CSF of HTT gene expansion carriers, we found increased
  levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-17, and increased consumption
  of the lymphocyte growth factor IL-7 before motor onset of HD. In concordance, we
  observed an increased prevalence of IL-17-producing Th17.1 cells in the CSF of HTT
  gene expansion carriers, predominantly in pre-motor manifest individuals. The frequency
  of intrathecal Th17.1 cells correlated negatively with progression of HD and the
  level of neurodegeneration, suggesting a role of Th17.1 cells in the early disease
  stage. We also observed a skewing in the balance between proinflammatory and regulatory
  T cells potentially favoring a proinflammatory intrathecal environment in HTT gene
  expansion carriers. INTERPRETATION: These data suggest that Th17.1 cells are implicated
  in the earliest pathogenic phases of HD and suggest that treatment to dampen T -cell-driven
  inflammation before motor onset might be of benefit in HTT gene expansion carriers.
