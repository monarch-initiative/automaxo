input_text: 'Epidemiology of Huntington disease in Cyprus: A 20-year retrospective
  study. Huntington disease (HD) is most prevalent among populations of western European
  descent and isolated populations where founder effects may operate. The aim of this
  study was to examine the epidemiology of HD in Cyprus, an island in southern Europe
  with extensive western European colonization in the past. All registered HD patients
  in the Cyprus, since 1994, were included. Detailed pedigrees and clinical information
  were recorded and maps, showing the geographic distribution of HD, were constructed.
  Requests for genetic testing were also examined. The project identified 58 clinically
  manifested cases of HD belonging to 19 families. The 16 families of Cypriot origin
  were concentrated in a confined geographical cluster in southeast Cyprus. In 2015,
  prevalence of symptomatic HD was 4.64/100 000 population, while incidence was 0.12/100
  000 person-years. Prevalence displayed a marked increase during the past 20 years.
  Disease characteristics of HD patients were similar to those reported in western
  European populations. Lastly, the uptake of predictive and/or prenatal testing was
  limited. HD disease characteristics, incidence and prevalence in Cyprus were comparable
  to western European populations. Together with the geographical clustering observed,
  these results support the possibility for a relatively recent founder effect of
  HD in Cyprus, potentially of western European origin.'
