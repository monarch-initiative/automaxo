input_text: Assessment of Blood-brain Barrier Permeability by Intravenous Infusion
  of FITC-labeled Albumin in a Mouse Model of Neurodegenerative Disease. Disruption
  of blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity is a common feature for different neurological
  and neurodegenerative diseases. Although the interplay between perturbed BBB homeostasis
  and the pathogenesis of brain disorders needs further investigation, the development
  and validation of a reliable procedure to accurately detect BBB alterations may
  be crucial and represent a useful tool for potentially predicting disease progression
  and developing targeted therapeutic strategies. Here, we present an easy and efficient
  procedure for evaluating BBB leakage in a neurodegenerative condition like that
  occurring in a preclinical mouse model of Huntington disease, in which defects in
  the permeability of BBB are clearly detectable precociously in the disease. Specifically,
  the high molecular weight fluorescein isothiocyanate labelled (FITC)-albumin, which
  is able to cross the BBB only when the latter is impaired, is acutely infused into
  a mouse jugular vein and its distribution in the vascular or parenchymal districts
  is then determined by fluorescence microscopy. Accumulation of green fluorescent-albumin
  in the brain parenchyma functions as an index of aberrant BBB permeability and,
  when quantitated by using Image J processing software, is reported as Green Fluorescence
  Intensity.
