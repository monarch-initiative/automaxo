input_text: 'Corticopallidal Connectome of the Globus Pallidus Externus in Humans:
  An Exploratory Study of Structural Connectivity Using Probabilistic Diffusion Tractography.
  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Electrophysiologic abnormalities of the globus pallidus
  externus have been shown in several disease processes including Parkinson disease,
  dystonia, and Huntington disease. However, the connectivity, nuclear structure,
  and function of the globus pallidus externus are still not well-understood. Increasing
  evidence for the existence of direct corticopallidal connections challenges traditional
  understanding of the connectivity of the globus pallidus externus; nevertheless,
  these corticopallidal connections have yet to be fully characterized in humans.
  The objective of this study was to assess the corticopallidal connections of the
  globus pallidus externus by means of probabilistic diffusion-weighted MR imaging
  tractography using high-resolution, multishell data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Imaging
  data from the open-access Human Connectome Project data base were used to perform
  probabilistic tractography between the globus pallidus externus and the cerebral
  cortex using 34 distinct cortical regions. Group averages were calculated for normalized
  percentages of tracts reaching each of the cortical targets, and side-to-side comparison
  was made. RESULTS: Cortical connectivity was demonstrated between the globus pallidus
  externus and multiple cortical regions, including direct connection to putative
  sensorimotor, associative, and limbic areas. Connectivity patterns were not significantly
  different between the right and left hemispheres with the exception of the frontal
  pole, which showed a greater number of connections on the right (P = .004). CONCLUSIONS:
  Our in vivo study of the human globus pallidus externus using probabilistic tractography
  supports the existence of extensive corticopallidal connections and a tripartite
  functional division, as found in animal studies. A better understanding of the connectivity
  of the globus pallidus externus may help to understand its function and elucidate
  the effects of programming the higher contacts in pallidal deep brain stimulation.'
