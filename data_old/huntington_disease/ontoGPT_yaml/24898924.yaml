input_text: 'Frontal cortex BOLD signal changes in premanifest Huntington disease:
  a possible fMRI biomarker. OBJECTIVE: To identify a possible functional imaging
  biomarker sensitive to the earliest neural changes in premanifest Huntington disease
  (preHD), allowing early therapeutic approaches aimed at preventing or delaying clinical
  onset. METHODS: Sixteen preHD and 18 healthy participants were submitted to anatomical
  acquisitions and functional MRI (fMRI) acquisitions during the execution of the
  exogenous covert orienting of attention task. Due to strong a priori hypothesis,
  all fMRI correlation analyses were restricted to the following: (1) the frontal
  oculomotor cortex identified by the means of a prosaccadic task, comprising frontal
  eye fields and supplementary frontal eye fields; and (2) the data collected during
  inhibition of return, a phenomenon occurring during the executed task. In preHD,
  multiple regression analysis was performed between fMRI data and the probability
  to develop the disease in the next 5 years (p5HD). Moreover, mean blood oxygen level-dependent
  (BOLD) signal changes in the frontal oculomotor cortex and striatal volumes were
  linearly correlated with p5HD. RESULTS: In preHD, multiple regression analysis showed
  that clusters of activity strongly correlated with p5HD in the right frontal oculomotor
  cortex. Importantly, mean BOLD signal changes of this region correlated with p5HD
  (r(2) = 0.52). Among the considered striatal volumes, a modest correlation (r(2)
  = 0.29) was observed in the right putamen and p5HD. CONCLUSION: fMRI activations
  in the right-frontal oculomotor cortex during inhibition of return can be considered
  a possible functional imaging biomarker in preHD.'
