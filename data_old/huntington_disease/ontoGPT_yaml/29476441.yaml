input_text: Association Between Body Mass Index and Disease Severity in Chinese Spinocerebellar
  Ataxia Type 3 Patients. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), the most common subtype
  of SCA worldwide, is caused by mutation of CAG repeats expansion in ATXN3. Body
  mass index (BMI) is an important modulatory factor in the progression of neurodegenerative
  disorders such as Huntington disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However,
  its relevance in SCA3 is not well understood. In this study, BMI was investigated
  in 134 molecularly confirmed SCA3 patients and 136 healthy controls from China.
  The multivariable linear regression models were performed to establish the putative
  risk factors for BMI, and whether BMI could affect the severity of ataxia. We found
  that BMI was significantly lower in the case group than that in the control group.
  The age at onset (positive correlation) and severity of ataxia (negative correlation)
  were the risk factors affecting BMI. Conversely, BMI along with the disease duration,
  the age at onset, and the numbers of CAG repeats could also have influence on the
  severity of ataxia. In conclusion, SCA3 patients had lower BMI than matched controls
  and BMI is a predictor of disease progression in SCA3. Nutritional intervention
  to promote weight gain could be a promising strategy to impede SCA3 progression.
