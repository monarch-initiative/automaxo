input_text: "Network topology and functional connectivity disturbances precede the
  onset of Huntington's disease. Cognitive, motor and psychiatric changes in prodromal
  Huntington's disease have nurtured the emergent need for early interventions. Preventive
  clinical trials for Huntington's disease, however, are limited by a shortage of
  suitable measures that could serve as surrogate outcomes. Measures of intrinsic
  functional connectivity from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging
  are of keen interest. Yet recent studies suggest circumscribed abnormalities in
  resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging connectivity in prodromal Huntington's
  disease, despite the spectrum of behavioural changes preceding a manifest diagnosis.
  The present study used two complementary analytical approaches to examine whole-brain
  resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging connectivity in prodromal Huntington's
  disease. Network topology was studied using graph theory and simple functional connectivity
  amongst brain regions was explored using the network-based statistic. Participants
  consisted of gene-negative controls (n = 16) and prodromal Huntington's disease
  individuals (n = 48) with various stages of disease progression to examine the influence
  of disease burden on intrinsic connectivity. Graph theory analyses showed that global
  network interconnectivity approximated a random network topology as proximity to
  diagnosis neared and this was associated with decreased connectivity amongst highly-connected
  rich-club network hubs, which integrate processing from diverse brain regions. However,
  functional segregation within the global network (average clustering) was preserved.
  Functional segregation was also largely maintained at the local level, except for
  the notable decrease in the diversity of anterior insula intermodular-interconnections
  (participation coefficient), irrespective of disease burden. In contrast, network-based
  statistic analyses revealed patterns of weakened frontostriatal connections and
  strengthened frontal-posterior connections that evolved as disease burden increased.
  These disturbances were often related to long-range connections involving peripheral
  nodes and interhemispheric connections. A strong association was found between weaker
  connectivity and decreased rich-club organization, indicating that whole-brain simple
  connectivity partially expressed disturbances in the communication of highly-connected
  hubs. However, network topology and network-based statistic connectivity metrics
  did not correlate with key markers of executive dysfunction (Stroop Test, Trail
  Making Test) in prodromal Huntington's disease, which instead were related to whole-brain
  connectivity disturbances in nodes (right inferior parietal, right thalamus, left
  anterior cingulate) that exhibited multiple aberrant connections and that mediate
  executive control. Altogether, our results show for the first time a largely disease
  burden-dependent functional reorganization of whole-brain networks in prodromal
  Huntington's disease. Both analytic approaches provided a unique window into brain
  reorganization that was not related to brain atrophy or motor symptoms. Longitudinal
  studies currently in progress will chart the course of functional changes to determine
  the most sensitive markers of disease progression. "
