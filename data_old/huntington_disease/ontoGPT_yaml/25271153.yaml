input_text: 'Forkhead transcription factor FOXO3a levels are increased in Huntington
  disease because of overactivated positive autofeedback loop. Huntington disease
  (HD) is a fatal autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by an increased
  number of CAG repeats in the HTT gene coding for huntingtin. Decreased neurotrophic
  support and increased mitochondrial and excitotoxic stress have been reported in
  HD striatal and cortical neurons. The members of the class O forkhead (FOXO) transcription
  factor family, including FOXO3a, act as sensor proteins that are activated upon
  decreased survival signals and/or increased cellular stress. Using immunocytochemical
  screening in mouse striatal Hdh(7/7) (wild type), Hdh(7/109) (heterozygous for HD
  mutation), and Hdh(109/109) (homozygous for HD mutation) cells, we identified FOXO3a
  as a differentially regulated transcription factor in HD. We report increased nuclear
  FOXO3a levels in mutant Hdh cells. Additionally, we show that treatment with mitochondrial
  toxin 3-nitropropionic acid results in enhanced nuclear localization of FOXO3a in
  wild type Hdh(7/7) cells and in rat primary cortical neurons. Furthermore, mRNA
  levels of Foxo3a are increased in mutant Hdh cells compared with wild type cells
  and in 3-nitropropionic acid-treated primary neurons compared with untreated neurons.
  A similar increase was observed in the cortex of R6/2 mice and HD patient post-mortem
  caudate tissue compared with controls. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and reporter
  assays, we demonstrate that FOXO3a regulates its own transcription by binding to
  the conserved response element in Foxo3a promoter. Altogether, the findings of this
  study suggest that FOXO3a levels are increased in HD cells as a result of overactive
  positive feedback loop. '
