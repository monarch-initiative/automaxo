input_text: Dysregulation of gene expression in the striatum of BACHD rats expressing
  full-length mutant huntingtin and associated abnormalities on molecular and protein
  levels. Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominantly inherited neurodegenerative
  disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the gene coding for the huntingtin
  protein (HTT). Mutant HTT (mHTT) has been proposed to cause neuronal dysfunction
  and neuronal loss through multiple mechanisms. Transcriptional changes may be a
  core pathogenic feature of HD. Utilizing the Affymetrix platform we performed a
  genome-wide RNA expression analysis in two BACHD transgenic rat lines (TG5 and TG9)
  at 12 months of age, both of which carry full-length human mHTT but with different
  expression levels. By defining the threshold of significance at p < 0.01, we found
  1608 genes and 871 genes differentially expressed in both TG5 and TG9 rats when
  compared to the wild type littermates, respectively. We only chose the highly up-/down-regulated
  genes for further analysis by setting an additional threshold of 1.5 fold change.
  Comparing gene expression profiles of human HD brains and BACHD rats revealed a
  high concordance in both functional and IPA (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis) canonical
  pathways relevant to HD. In addition, we investigated the causes leading to gene
  expression changes at molecular and protein levels in BACHD rats including the involvement
  of polyQ-containing transcription factors TATA box-binding protein (TBP), Sp1 and
  CBP as well as the chromatin structure. We demonstrate that the BACHD rat model
  recapitulates the gene expression changes of the human disease supporting its role
  as a preclinical research animal model. We also show for the first time that TFIID
  complex formation is reduced, while soluble TBP is increased in an HD model. This
  finding suggests that mHTT is a competitor instead of a recruiter of polyQ-containing
  transcription factors in the transcription process in HD.
