input_text: 'Sex-specific effects of the Huntington gene on normal neurodevelopment.
  Huntington disease is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a gene (HTT) with a
  unique feature of trinucleotide repeats ranging from 10 to 35 in healthy people;
  when expanded beyond 39 repeats, Huntington disease develops. Animal models demonstrate
  that HTT is vital to brain development; however, this has not been studied in humans.
  Moreover, evidence suggests that triplet repeat genes may have been vital in evolution
  of the human brain. Here we evaluate brain structure using magnetic resonance imaging
  and brain function using cognitive tests in a sample of school-aged children ages
  6 to 18 years old. DNA samples were processed to quantify the number of CAG repeats
  within HTT. We find that the number of repeats in HTT, below disease threshold,
  confers advantageous changes in brain structure and general intelligence (IQ): the
  higher the number of repeats, the greater the change in brain structure, and the
  higher the IQ. The pattern of structural brain changes associated with HTT is strikingly
  different between males and females. HTT may confer an advantage or a disadvantage
  depending on the repeat length, playing a key role in either the evolution of a
  superior human brain or development of a uniquely human brain disease.   2016 Wiley
