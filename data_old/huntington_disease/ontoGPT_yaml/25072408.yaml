input_text: Functional connectivity of primary motor cortex is dependent on genetic
  burden in prodromal Huntington disease. Subtle changes in motor function have been
  observed in individuals with prodromal Huntington disease (prHD), but the underlying
  neural mechanisms are not well understood nor is the cumulative effect of the disease
  (disease burden) on functional connectivity. The present study examined the resting-state
  functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) connectivity of the primary motor
  cortex (M1) in 16 gene-negative (NEG) controls and 48 gene-positive prHD participants
  with various levels of disease burden. The results showed that the strength of the
  left M1 connectivity with the ipsilateral M1 and somatosensory areas decreased as
  disease burden increased and correlated with motor symptoms. Weakened M1 connectivity
  within the motor areas was also associated with abnormalities in long-range connections
  that evolved with disease burden. In this study, M1 connectivity was decreased with
  visual centers (bilateral cuneus), but increased with a hub of the default mode
  network (DMN; posterior cingulate cortex). Changes in connectivity measures were
  associated with worse performance on measures of cognitive-motor functioning. Short-
  and long-range functional connectivity disturbances were also associated with volume
  loss in the basal ganglia, suggesting that weakened M1 connectivity is partly a
  manifestation of striatal atrophy. Altogether, the results indicate that the prodromal
  phase of HD is associated with abnormal interhemispheric interactions among motor
  areas and disturbances in the connectivity of M1 with visual centers and the DMN.
  These changes may, respectively, contribute to increased motor symptoms, visuomotor
  integration problems, and deficits in the executive control of movement as individuals
  approach a manifest diagnosis.
