input_text: 'Concurrent Cross-Sectional and Longitudinal Analyses of Multivariate
  White Matter Profiles and Clinical Functioning in Pre-Diagnosis Huntington Disease.
  BACKGROUND: Gray matter (GM) atrophy in the striatum and across the brain is a consistently
  reported feature of the Huntington Disease (HD) prodrome. More recently, widespread
  prodromal white matter (WM) degradation has also been detected. However, longitudinal
  WM studies are limited and conflicting, and most analyses comparing WM and clinical
  functioning have also been cross-sectional. OBJECTIVE: We simultaneously assessed
  changes in WM and cognitive and motor functioning at various prodromal HD stages.
  METHODS: Data from 1,336 (1,047 prodromal, 289 control) PREDICT-HD participants
  were analyzed (3,700 sessions). MRI images were used to create GM, WM, and cerebrospinal
  fluid probability maps. Using source-based morphometry, independent component analysis
  was applied to WM probability maps to extract covarying spatial patterns and their
  subject profiles. WM profiles were analyzed in two sets of linear mixed model (LMM)
  analyses: one to compare WM profiles across groups cross-sectionally and longitudinally,
  and one to concurrently compare WM profiles and clinical variables cross-sectionally
  and longitudinally within each group. RESULTS: Findings illustrate widespread prodromal
  changes in GM-adjacent-WM, with premotor, supplementary motor, middle frontal and
  striatal changes early in the prodrome that subsequently extend sub-gyrally with
  progression. Motor functioning agreed most with WM until the near-onset prodromal
  stage, when Stroop interference was the best WM indicator. Across groups, Trail-Making
  Test part A outperformed other cognitive variables in its similarity to WM, particularly
  cross-sectionally. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that distinct regions coincide with
  cognitive compared to motor functioning. Furthermore, at different prodromal stages,
  distinct regions appear to align best with clinical functioning. Thus, the informativeness
  of clinical measures may vary according to the type of data available (cross-sectional
  or longitudinal) as well as age and CAG-number.'
