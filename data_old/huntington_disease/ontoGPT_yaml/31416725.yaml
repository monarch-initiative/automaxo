input_text: Positron Emission Tomography in Pediatric Neurodegenerative Disorders.
  Application of molecular neuroimaging using positron emission tomographic techniques
  to assess pediatric neurodegenerative disorders has been limited, unlike in adults
  where positron emission tomography has contributed to clinical diagnosis, monitoring
  of neurodegenerative disease progression, and assessment of novel therapeutic approaches.
  Yet, there is a huge unexplored potential of molecular imaging to improve our understanding
  of the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders in children and provide radiological
  biomarkers that can be applied clinically. The obstacles in performing PET scans
  on children include sedation, radiation exposure, and access but, as will be illustrated,
  these barriers can be easily overcome. This review summarizes findings from PET
  studies that have been performed over the past three decades on children with various
  neurodegenerative disorders, including the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, juvenile
  Huntington disease, Wilson disease, Niemann-Pick disease type C, Dravet syndrome,
  dystonia, mitochondrial disorders, inborn errors of metabolism, lysosomal storage
  diseases, dysmyelinating disorders, Rett syndrome, neurotransmitter disorders, glucose
  transporter Glut 1 deficiency, and Lesch-Nyhan disease. Because positron emission
  tomographic scans have often been clinically useful and have contributed to the
  management of these disorders, we suggest that the time has come for glucose metabolism
  positron emission tomographic scans to be reimbursed by insurance carriers for children
  with neurodegenerative disorders, and not restricted only to epilepsy surgery evaluation.
