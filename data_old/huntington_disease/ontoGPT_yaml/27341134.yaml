input_text: "Wearable Sensors in Huntington Disease: A Pilot Study. BACKGROUND: The
  Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) is the principal means of assessing
  motor impairment in Huntington disease but is subjective and generally limited to
  in-clinic assessments. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility and ability of wearable
  sensors to measure motor impairment in individuals with Huntington disease in the
  clinic and at home. METHODS: Participants with Huntington disease and controls were
  asked to wear five accelerometer-based sensors attached to the chest and each limb
  for standardized, in-clinic assessments and for one day at home. A second chest
  sensor was worn for six additional days at home. Gait measures were compared between
  controls, participants with Huntington disease, and participants with Huntington
  disease grouped by UHDRS total motor score using Cohen's d values. RESULTS: Fifteen
  individuals with Huntington disease and five controls completed the study. Sensor
  data were successfully captured from 18 of the 20 participants at home. In the clinic,
  the standard deviation of step time (time between consecutive steps) was increased
  in Huntington disease (p < 0.0001; Cohen's d = 2.61) compared to controls. At home
  with additional observations, significant differences were observed in seven additional
  gait measures. The gait of individuals with higher total motor scores (50 or more)
  differed significantly from those with lower total motor scores (below 50) on multiple
  measures at home. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, the use of wearable sensors
  in clinic and at home was feasible and demonstrated gait differences between controls,
  participants with Huntington disease, and participants with Huntington disease grouped
  by motor impairment."
