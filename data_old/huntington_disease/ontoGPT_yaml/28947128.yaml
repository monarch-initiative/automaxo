input_text: Preclinical motor manifestations of Huntington disease. Huntington disease
  (HD) is an autosomal-dominant, progressive neurodegenerative condition characterized
  by multiple movement disorders, psychiatric disturbances, and cognitive decline.
  As an insidious, progressive disorder, clinical phenoconversion in HD can be quite
  subtle and difficult to pinpoint. In light of this ambiguity, substantial interest
  has developed in HD research for biomarker identification, with the intent of establishing
  specific changes or "stages" of disease progression. Presumably, earlier stages
  of dysfunction offer greater chance for intervention or modification of disease
  mechanisms. As such, identifying disease processes as early as possible, in a prediagnostic
  period if possible, has been of paramount interest. Emerging evidence suggests motor
  dysfunction in HD long precedes clinical diagnosis, raising questions about the
  initiation of HD pathology and in turn our understanding of disease progression.
  This chapter summarizes advances in characterizing and understanding preclinical
  motor manifestations in HD, including changes in eye movements, gait, and fine motor
  performance. Development of the most sensitive and specific outcome measures for
  trial design is a rapidly evolving field in HD experimental therapeutics, with exciting
  implications for the study and treatment of this challenging disorder.
