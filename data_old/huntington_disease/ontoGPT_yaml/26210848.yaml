input_text: "Association of status redox with demographic, clinical and imaging parameters
  in patients with Huntington's disease. UNLABELLED: Huntington's disease (HD) is
  an autosomal dominant, progressive neurodegenerative disorder, caused by an expanded
  trinucleotide CAG sequence of the huntingtin (Htt) gene, which encodes a stretch
  of glutamines in the Htt protein. The mechanisms of neurodegeneration associated
  with the accumulation of Htt aggregates still remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: To determine
  oxidative stress biomarkers in HD patients and their relationship with clinical,
  demographic and neuroimaging parameters. DESIGN AND METHODS: Fourteen patients and
  39 controls paired by age and sex participated in this study. Oxidative damage was
  assayed in blood by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA) and advanced oxidative protein
  products (AOPPs). Antioxidant status was determined by activities of superoxide
  dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase
  (GR), reduced glutathione (GSH), protein thiols and total antioxidant capacity (FRAP).
  The Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) and neuroimaging studies were
  also employed. RESULTS: MDA, AOPP and GPx were significantly increased in HD patients
  with respect to the control group, while GR activity was decreased. FRAP correlated
  with age of disease onset, AOPP with motor severity (UHDRS score), age of patients
  and age of disease onset. Caudate atrophy was associated with lower plasma concentrations
  of GSH. CONCLUSIONS: These findings point to a redox imbalance in HD patients. GR
  activity could be a potential biomarker for symptom onset in asymptomatic gene carriers,
  while plasmatic GSH could be useful in monitoring the progression of neurodegeneration
  - as an expression of caudate atrophy - during the course of the disease."
