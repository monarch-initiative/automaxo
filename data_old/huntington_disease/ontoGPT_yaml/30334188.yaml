input_text: Laquinimod Treatment Improves Myelination Deficits at the Transcriptional
  and Ultrastructural Levels in the YAC128 Mouse Model of Huntington Disease. Laquinimod,
  an immunomodulatory agent under clinical development for Huntington disease (HD),
  has recently been shown to confer behavioural improvements that are coupled with
  prevention of atrophy of the white matter (WM)-rich corpus callosum (CC) in the
  YAC128 HD mice. However, the nature of the WM improvements is not known yet. Here
  we investigated the effects of laquinimod on HD-related myelination deficits at
  the cellular, molecular and ultrastructural levels. We showed that laquinimod treatment
  improves motor learning and motor function deficits in YAC128 HD mice, and confirmed
  its antidepressant effect even at the lowest dose used. In addition, we demonstrated
  for the first time the beneficial effects of laquinimod on myelination in the posterior
  region of the CC where it reversed changes in myelin sheath thickness and rescued
  Mbp mRNA and protein deficits. Furthermore, the effect of laquinimod on myelin-related
  gene expression was not region-specific since the levels of the Mbp and Plp1 transcripts
  were also increased in the striatum. Also, we did not detect changes in immune cell
  densities or levels of inflammatory genes in 3-month-old YAC128 HD mice, and these
  were not altered with laquinimod treatment. Thus, the beneficial effects of laquinimod
  on HD-related myelination abnormalities in YAC128 HD mice do not appear to be dependent
  on its immunomodulatory activity. Altogether, our findings describe the beneficial
  effects of laquinimod treatment on HD-related myelination abnormalities and highlight
  its therapeutic potential for the treatment of WM pathology in HD patients.
