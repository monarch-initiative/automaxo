input_text: "Development and Delivery of a Physical Activity Intervention for People
  With Huntington Disease: Facilitating Translation to Clinical Practice. BACKGROUND
  AND PURPOSE: We studied the development and delivery of a 14-week complex physical
  activity intervention for people with Huntington disease, where detailed information
  about the intervention was fully embedded in the trial design process. METHODS:
  Intervention Development: The intervention was developed through a series of focus
  groups. The findings from the focus groups informed the development of a logic model
  for the physical activity intervention that was broadly consistent with the framework
  of self-determination theory. Intervention Delivery: Key components underpinning
  the delivery of the intervention were implemented including a defined coach training
  program and intervention fidelity assessment methods. Training of coaches (physical
  therapists, occupational therapists, research nurses, and exercise trainers) was
  delivered via group and 1:1 training sessions using a detailed coach's manual, and
  with ongoing support via video calls, and e-mail communication as needed. Detailed
  documentation was provided to determine costs of intervention development and coach
  training. RESULTS: Intervention delivery coaches at 8 sites across the United Kingdom
  participated in the face-to-face training. Self-report checklists completed by each
  of the coaches indicated that all components of the intervention were delivered
  in accordance with the protocol. Mean (standard deviation) intervention fidelity
  scores (n = 15), as measured using a purpose-developed rating scale, was 11 (2.4)
  (out of 16 possible points). Coaches' perceptions of intervention fidelity were
  similarly high. The total cost of developing the intervention and providing training
  was $30,773 ($47,042 USD). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: An important consideration
  in promoting translation of clinical research into practice is the ability to convey
  the detailed components of how the intervention was delivered to facilitate replication
  if the results are favorable. This report presents an illustrative example of a
  physical activity intervention, including the development and the training required
  to deliver it. This approach has the potential to facilitate reproducibility, evidence
  synthesis, and implementation in clinical practice.Video Abstract available for
