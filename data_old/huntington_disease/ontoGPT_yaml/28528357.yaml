input_text: 'Cerebellar Gray Matter Alterations in Huntington Disease: A Voxel-Based
  Morphometry Study. Neuropathological and neuroimaging studies in Huntington disease
  (HD) have suggested a role for the cerebellum. Our goal was to perform a detailed
  evaluation of cerebellar morphology. We performed the Unified HD rating scale (UHDRS)
  and Montreal cognitive assessment (MOCA) in 26 HD patients and 26 healthy controls.
  We created a two-sample test to analyze cerebellar gray matter (GM) differences
  between groups and another to correlate GM alterations with UHDRS and MOCA, corrected
  for age, expanded cytosine-adenine-guanine repeats, and disease duration using the
  spatially unbiased atlas template (SUIT)-SPM-toolbox which preserves anatomical
  detailing. We found increased GM density in the anterior cerebellum compared to
  controls. Higher GM density in the postero-superior lobe correlated with mood symptoms.
  Worse motor function and better cognitive function correlated with GM changes in
  the posterior cerebellum (false discovery rate (FDR) correction p < 0.05 and k >
  100 voxels). In this detailed study of the in vivo cerebellar morphology in HD,
  we observed GM changes in regions involved in sensorimotor integration, motor planning,
  and emotional processing, supporting cerebellar involvement in the neuropathological
  process of HD.'
