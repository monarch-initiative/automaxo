input_text: Lithium chloride could aggravate brain injury caused by 3-nitropropionic
  acid. Lithium, a well-known drug for the treatment of bipolar disorder, may also
  have the ability to reduce neurodegeneration and stimulate cell proliferation. Systemic
  injection of mitochondrial toxin 3-nitropropionic acid (3NPA) is known to induce
  a relatively selective, Huntington disease-like brain injury. The aim of this study
  was to determine the effect of lithium chloride (LiCl) on brain injury caused by
  3NPA. Female adult Wistar rats were pre-treated with LiCl (127 mg/kg) 1 day before
  the first injection of 3NPA (28 mg/kg), and then for 8 days with the same treatment
  but receiving LiCl 1 hour before 3NPA. Control groups were pre-treated accordingly,
  with LiCl or with normal saline, but were not treated with 3NPA. Staining for cytochrome
  c oxidase activity and in situ hybridization autoradiography of synaptotagmin-4
  and -7 mRNAs were used to evaluate brain injury caused by 3NPA. There was a significant
  reduction of body weight in the 3NPA+LiCl group (79%) compared to the 3NPA group
  (90%, p = 0.031) and both control groups (100%, p = 0.000). Densitometric evaluation
  of cytochrome c oxidase staining and in situ hybridization autoradiograms revealed
  that the pre-treatment with LiCl caused an increase in striatal lesion for about
  40% (p = 0.049). Moreover, the lesion was observed also in the hippocampus of three
  animals from the 3NPA+LiCl group and in two animals from the 3NPA group. However,
  there were no differences between the LiCl and saline group in any of the measured
  parameters. We concluded that the pre-treatment with a relatively nontoxic dose
  of LiCl could aggravate brain injury caused by 3NPA.
