input_text: 'Huntington disease care: From the past to the present, to the future.
  INTRODUCTION: Huntington disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder without
  a cure. Its clinical presentation makes complex the care of patients with HD, further
  impacted by the progressive loss of dependence and disability. Intuitively, HD management
  calls for multispecialty care. METHODS: Literature review and expert-based statement.
  RESULTS: Chorea is the only indication for symptomatic treatments in HD. Surgical
  therapies are experimental, and exercise-based physical interventions have been
  assessed but in small feasibility studies. In HD, multispecialty care requires the
  active involvement of physicians, therapists, social workers and nutritionists.
  In about half of the HD clinics, a multidisciplinary case review is offered. It
  is still unknown what is the care delivery model that is best for HD. Palliative
  care is an important concept in HD care focusing in quality of life, considering
  physical, psychosocial, and spiritual problems. Palliative care may delay nursing
  home placement in advanced HD. CONCLUSION: There is a support for multispecialty
  care in HD, but more evidence needs to be generated through clinical research. The
  implementation of technology in the multispecialty care of patients with HD has
  a significant potential for reducing the care burden for families and the healthcare
  team, and to secure a wider care delivery.'
