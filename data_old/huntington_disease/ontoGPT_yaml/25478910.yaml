input_text: 'Huntingtin interacting proteins 14 and 14-like are required for chorioallantoic
  fusion during early placental development. Huntington disease (HD) is an adult-onset
  neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms
  that is caused by a CAG expansion in the HTT gene. Palmitoylation is the addition
  of saturated fatty acids to proteins by DHHC palmitoylacyl transferases. HTT is
  palmitoylated by huntingtin interacting proteins 14 and 14-like (HIP14 and HIP14L
  or ZDHHC17 and 13 respectively). Mutant HTT is less palmitoylated and this reduction
  of palmitoylation accelerates its aggregation and increases cellular toxicity. Mouse
  models deficient in either Hip14 (Hip14(-/-)) or Hip14l (Hip14l(-/-)) develop HD-like
  phenotypes. The biological function of HTT palmitoylation and the role that loss
  of HTT palmitoylation plays in the pathogenesis of HD are unknown. To address these
  questions mice deficient for both genes were created. Loss of Hip14 and Hip14l leads
  to early embryonic lethality at day embryonic day 10-11 due to failed chorioallantoic
  fusion. The chorion is thickened and disorganized and the allantois does not fuse
  correctly with the chorion and forms a balloon-like shape compared to Hip14l(-/-);
  Hip14(+/+) littermate control embryos. Interestingly, the Hip14(-/-) ; Hip14(-/-)
  embryos share many features with the Htt(-/-) embryos, including folding of the
  yolk sac, a bulb shaped allantois, and a thickened and disorganized chorion. This
  may be due to a decrease in HTT palmitoylation. In Hip14(-/-); Hip14l(-/-) mouse
  embryonic fibroblasts show a 25% decrease in HTT palmitoylation compared to wild
  type cells. This is the first description of a double PAT deficient mouse model
  where loss of a PAT or multiple PATs results in embryonic lethality in mammals.
  These results reinforce the physiological importance of palmitoylation during embryogenesis. '
