input_text: "Body composition analysis as an indirect marker of skeletal muscle mass
  in Huntington's disease. BACKGROUND: Skeletal muscle wasting is likely to play an
  important role in the Huntington's disease (HD) pathogenesis. Our aim was to analyze
  the body composition, and specifically fat-free mass (FFM), as an indirect marker
  of skeletal muscle in patients with HD, and its association with HD severity and
  energy balance. METHODS: Cross-sectional, case-control study. Body composition was
  analyzed using bioelectrical impedance. Information was collected as regards of
  the anthropometrics, disease severity [Unified Huntington Disease Rating (UHDRS)
  and Total functional capacity (TFC) scores], CAG repeats, protein catabolism, energy
  intake and energy expenditure. RESULTS: Twenty two patients with HD [mean age 50.3+-15.6,
  mean UHDRS of 27.9+-23.7, median TFC of 11 (IQR: 7; 13); median body mass index
  23.6 (IQR: 26.8; 22.5)], and 18 controls were included. Both groups were similar
  in terms of age, gender, body mass index, body composition, physical activity level,
  and protein catabolism. FFM was correlated with energy intake (r=0.73, p<0.001),
  resting energy expenditure (r=0.64, p=0.001) and physical activity (r=0.54, p=0.003),
  but not with CAG repeats, or HD severity. CONCLUSIONS: Our results do not support
  the presence of significant muscle wasting in patients with early-moderate Huntington's
  disease. However, to prevent muscle wasting in HD, dietary strategies, in addition
  to physical exercise, should be further investigated."
