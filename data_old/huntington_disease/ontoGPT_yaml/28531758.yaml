input_text: "Factors associated with Mediterranean diet adherence in Huntington's
  disease. BACKGROUND & AIMS: Little is known about the importance of the Mediterranean
  Diet (MeDi) and dietary intake as environmental neuroprotective factors in Huntington's
  disease (HD); so, we evaluated and analyzed the prevalence and factors associated
  with MeDi adherence, and dietary intake in HD. METHODS: Spanish participants of
  the European Huntington Disease Network (EHDN) Registry study diagnosed with HD
  or premanifest HD gene carriers were included from June 2012 to August 2013. Self-reported
  dietary intake was collected by 3-day dietary record, MeDi adherence was assessed
  by 0-9 range (proposed by Trichopoulou et al.) and, other contributing factors related
  to nutrition were collected by telephone. Demographics and clinical variables were
  obtained from the EHDN Registry study database. Association of HD with MeDi adherence
  and nutritional characteristics were performed using logistic regression models.
  RESULTS: Ninety eight participants were included in the study, median age of 48
  years (38-60 range), and median total functional capacity (TFC) 9 (5-13 range).
  HD severity was similar between participants with low vs moderate/high MeDi; however,
  quality of life (P = 0.009) was significantly higher among participants with moderate/high
  MeDi adherence. In terms of nutrients, higher MUFA/SFA intake was moderately correlated
  with better TFC and Unified HD Rating Scale (UHDRS) cognitive. Better TFC was associated
  with having a caregiver (OR = 11.86, P < 0.001), and non-smoking (OR = 0.21, P =
  0.013). Moderate adherence to MeDi, was associated with older participants (OR =
  1.19, P = 0.031), lower comorbidity (OR = 0.18, P = 0.018), lower UHDRS motor (OR
  = 0.90, P = 0.041), and lower risk for abdominal obesity (OR = 0.02, P = 0.011).
  CONCLUSIONS: In HD the moderate MeDi adherence is associated with better quality
  of life, lower comorbidity, lower motor impairment and lower risk for abdominal
  obesity compared to those participants with low MeDi adherence."
