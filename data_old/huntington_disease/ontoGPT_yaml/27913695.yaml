input_text: 'A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of coenzyme Q10
  in Huntington disease. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that chronic treatment
  of early-stage Huntington disease (HD) with high-dose coenzyme Q10 (CoQ) will slow
  the progressive functional decline of HD. METHODS: We performed a multicenter randomized,
  double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients with early-stage HD (n = 609) were
  enrolled at 48 sites in the United States, Canada, and Australia from 2008 to 2012.
  Patients were randomized to receive either CoQ 2,400 mg/d or matching placebo, then
  followed for 60 months. The primary outcome variable was the change from baseline
  to month 60 in Total Functional Capacity score (for patients who survived) combined
  with time to death (for patients who died) analyzed using a joint-rank analysis
  approach. RESULTS: An interim analysis for futility revealed a conditional power
  of <5% for the primary analysis, prompting premature conclusion in July 2014. No
  statistically significant differences were seen between treatment groups for the
  primary or secondary outcome measures. CoQ was generally safe and well-tolerated
  throughout the study. CONCLUSIONS: These data do not justify use of CoQ as a treatment
  to slow functional decline in HD. CLINICALTRIALSGOV IDENTIFIER: NCT00608881. CLASSIFICATION
  OF EVIDENCE: This article provides Class I evidence that CoQ does not slow the progressive
  functional decline of patients with HD.'
