input_text: 'Huntington Disease: Linking Pathogenesis to the Development of Experimental
  Therapeutics. Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative
  condition caused by a CAG trinucleotide expansion in the huntingtin gene. At present,
  the HD field is experiencing exciting times with the assessment for the first time
  in human subjects of interventions aimed at core disease mechanisms. Out of a portfolio
  of interventions that claim a potential disease-modifying effect in HD, the target
  huntingtin has more robust validation. In this review, we discuss the spectrum of
  huntingtin-lowering therapies that are currently being considered. We provide a
  critical appraisal of the validation of huntingtin as a drug target, describing
  the advantages, challenges, and limitations of the proposed therapeutic interventions.
  The development of these new therapies relies strongly on the knowledge of HD pathogenesis
  and the ability to translate this knowledge into validated pharmacodynamic biomarkers.
  Altogether, the goal is to support a rational drug development that is ethical and
  cost-effective. Among the pharmacodynamic biomarkers under development, the quantification
  of mutant huntingtin in the cerebral spinal fluid and PET imaging targeting huntingtin
  or phosphodiesterase 10A deserve special attention. Huntingtin-lowering therapeutics
  are eagerly awaited as the first interventions that may be able to change the course
  of HD in a meaningful way.'
