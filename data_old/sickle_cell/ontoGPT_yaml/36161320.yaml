input_text: "Lovo-cel gene therapy for sickle cell disease: Treatment process evolution
  and outcomes in the initial groups of the HGB-206 study.lovo-cel (bb1111; LentiGlobin
  for sickle cell disease [SCD]) gene therapy (GT) comprises autologous transplantation
  of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells transduced with the BB305 lentiviral
  vector encoding a modified beta-globin gene (betaA-T87Q ) to produce anti-sickling
  hemoglobin (HbAT87Q ). The efficacy and safety of lovo-cel for SCD are being evaluated
  in the ongoing phase 1/2 HGB-206 study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02140554). The treatment
  process evolved over time, using learnings from outcomes in the initial patients
  to optimize lovo-cel's benefit-risk profile. Following modest expression of HbAT87Q
  in the initial patients (Group A, n = 7), alterations were made to the treatment
  process for patients subsequently enrolled in Group B (n = 2, patients B1 and B2),
  including improvements to cell collection and lovo-cel manufacturing. After 6 months,
  median Group A peripheral blood vector copy number (>=0.08 c/dg) and HbAT87Q levels
  (>=0.46 g/dL) were inadequate for substantial clinical effect but stable and sustained
  over 5.5 years; both markedly improved in Group B (patient B1: >=0.53 c/dg and >=2.69
  g/dL; patient B2: >=2.14 c/dg and >=6.40 g/dL, respectively) and generated improved
  biologic and clinical efficacy in Group B, including higher total hemoglobin and
  decreased hemolysis. The safety of the lovo-cel for SCD treatment regimen largely
  reflected the known side effects of HSPC collection, busulfan conditioning regimen,
  and underlying SCD; acute myeloid leukemia was observed in two patients in Group
  A and deemed unlikely related to insertional oncogenesis. Changes made during development
  of the lovo-cel treatment process were associated with improved outcomes and provide
  lessons for future SCD GT studies."
