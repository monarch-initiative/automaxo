input_text: 'Muscle Properties, Gross Motor Performance, and Quality of Life in Children
  With Sickle Cell Disease.PURPOSE: To explore muscle properties, gross motor performance,
  and quality of life (QoL) in children with sickle cell disease (SCD) compared with
  controls and to assess relationships among these outcomes. METHODS: A cross-sectional
  study of 24 children assessed muscle properties including: knee extension strength
  by dynamometry; vastus lateralis (VL) and rectus femoris (RF) muscle thickness by
  ultrasonography; and VL and RF neuromuscular activation (rate of muscle activation
  [RoA]) by electromyography (EMG). Gross motor performance and QoL were assessed
  by standardized tests and questionnaires. RESULTS: Children with SCD had impaired
  knee extension strength, VL EMG RoA, gross motor performance, and QoL compared with
  children without SCD. Relationships among muscle properties, gross motor performance,
  and QoL were identified. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that comprehensive
  muscle properties, gross motor performance, and QoL assessments should be considered
  to support and develop individualized physical therapy plans for children with SCD.'
