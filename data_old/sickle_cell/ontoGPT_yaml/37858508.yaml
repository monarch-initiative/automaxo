input_text: The evolving treatment landscape for children with sickle cell disease.Sickle
  cell disease is the most common inherited pathological haemoglobinopathy. Over the
  past 30 years, disease-related morbidity and mortality have improved in high-income
  countries due to advances in preventive care and treatments. Established disease-modifying
  therapies, such as hydroxyurea (hydrocarbamide), are continuing to have an important
  role in the treatment of sickle cell disease, and newer agents also show promise.
  In the past 5 years, the US Food and Drug Administration approved three additional
  sickle cell disease-modifying medications, and new gene therapies have been developed
  as an alternative curative treatment to haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation.
  In this Review, we discuss the current treatment landscape for paediatric sickle
  cell disease and emerging innovations in care. We also review the need for close,
  long-term management for children receiving newer therapies and the importance of
  ongoing investment in people with sickle cell disease in low-income and middle-income
  countries.
