input_text: 'Eclampsia a preventable tragedy: an African overview.Eclampsia is a multisystemic
  disease associated with various complications which individually or in combination
  can lead to maternal/fetal morbidity and mortality. Developed countries and some
  developing countries were largely successful in reducing the incidence of eclampsia.
  Developing countries especially those in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are still dealing
  with high incidence of eclampsia. The question is why have the incidence and mortality
  of eclampsia remained high in SSA? The risk factors for this disease are globally
  the same but a critical assessment showed that there are certain risk factors that
  are common in Sub-Saharan Africa (multiple pregnancy, sickle cell disease, pregnancies
  at the extremes of reproductive age, pre-existing vasculitis). In addition, there
  are compounding factors (illiteracy, poverty, superstitious beliefs, poor prenatal
  care services, poorly trained manpower and lack of facilities to cater for patients).
  Addressing the menace of this disease require a holistic approach which among others,
  includes education to address beliefs and reduce harmful practices, poverty alleviation
  which will improve the ability for communities to afford health care services. Improving
  transport services to convey patients quickly to facilities on time when there is
  need. Improving the health infrastructure, building more facilities, providing trained
  and motivated manpower and regular supply of quality essential drugs for the management
  of the disease. This review is meant to analyze factors prevalent in Sub-Saharan
  that hinder reducing incidence of the disease and provide comprehensive and cost-effective
  solutions.'
