input_text: 'Ineffective erythropoiesis in sickle cell disease: new insights and future
  implications.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a hemolytic anemia
  caused by a point mutation in the beta globin gene leading to the expression of
  an abnormal hemoglobin (HbS) that polymerizes under hypoxic conditions driving red
  cell sickling. Circulating red cells have been extensively characterized in SCD,
  as their destruction and removal from peripheral blood are the major contributors
  to anemia. However, few reports showed cellular abnormalities during erythropoiesis
  in SCD, suggesting that anemia could also be influenced by defects of central origin.
  RECENT FINDINGS: El Hoss et al. demonstrated ineffective erythropoiesis (IE) in
  SCD and deciphered the molecular mechanism underlying cell death during the hemoglobin
  synthesis phase of terminal differentiation. They showed that HbS polymerization
  induces apoptosis of differentiating erythroblasts and that fetal hemoglobin rescues
  these cells through its antipolymerization function. SUMMARY: IE is the major cause
  of anemia in beta-thalassemia patients, and it is generally surmised that it contributes
  little to anemia of SCD. Recent reports demonstrate the occurrence of IE in SCD
  patients and show important alterations in the hematopoietic and erythroid niches,
  both in SCD patients and in the humanized Townes SCD mouse model. This implies that
  therapeutic strategies initially designed to improve red cell survival in the circulation
  of SCD patients would also positively impact erythropoiesis and bone marrow cellularity.'
