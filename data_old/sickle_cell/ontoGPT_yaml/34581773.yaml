input_text: 'American Society of Hematology 2021 guidelines for sickle cell disease:
  stem cell transplantation.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a life-limiting
  inherited hemoglobinopathy that results in significant complications and affects
  quality of life. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is currently the
  only curative intervention for SCD; however, guidelines are needed to inform how
  to apply HSCT in clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: These evidence-based guidelines of
  the American Society of Hematology (ASH) are intended to support patients, clinicians,
  and health professionals in their decisions about HSCT for SCD. METHODS: The multidisciplinary
  guideline panel formed by ASH included 2 patient representatives and was balanced
  to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. The Mayo Evidence-Based Practice
  Research Program supported the guideline development process, including performing
  systematic evidence reviews (through 2019). The panel prioritized clinical questions
  and outcomes according to their importance for clinicians and patients. The panel
  used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)
  approach, including GRADE Evidence-to-Decision frameworks, to assess evidence and
  make recommendations, which were subject to public comment. RESULTS: The panel agreed
  on 8 recommendations to help patients and providers assess how individuals with
  SCD should consider the timing and type of HSCT. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence review
  yielded no randomized controlled clinical trials for HSCT in SCD; therefore, all
  recommendations are based on very low certainty in the evidence. Key recommendations
  include considering HSCT for those with neurologic injury or recurrent acute chest
  syndrome at an early age and to improve nonmyeloablative regimens. Future research
  should include the development of a robust SCD registry to serve as a comparator
  for HSCT studies.'
