input_text: 'Brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neuroimaging in pediatric patients
  with sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: The risk of neurological complications is increased
  in children with sickle cell disease (SCD), such as silent cerebral infarction (SCI)
  and stroke. Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is a nerve growth factor associated
  with elevated transcranial Doppler (TCD) velocities and increased risk of stroke
  in SCD patients. So, we assessed the BDNF level in children with SCD and its relation
  to neurological complication as silent stroke. METHODS: A comparative cross-sectional
  study was conducted on 40 patients with SCD, recruited from the Hematology Unit,
  Pediatric Department, Menoufia University Hospital, and 40 healthy children as controls.
  Laboratory investigations including BDNF were done. TCD was done for all patients
  and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was done on high-risk patients. RESULTS: BDNF
  levels were significantly higher in children with SCD than in controls with a significant
  relation to TCD findings. There was a statistically significant diagnostic ability
  of BDNF in the prediction of SCD complications as its sensitivity was 89.5%, specificity
  (95% CI) was 80% with a cut-off point >0.69, AUC = 0.702, and p = 0.004). CONCLUSION:
  Serum BDNF levels were higher in sickle disease patients who had abnormal transcranial
  Doppler. BDNF had a significant diagnostic ability in the detection of SCD complications.
  IMPACT: Silent stroke is a very serious complication in children with sickle cell
  disease, so regular follow up should be every six months. BDNF is considered a potential
  biomarker for stroke risk prediction in patients unable to receive TCD.'
