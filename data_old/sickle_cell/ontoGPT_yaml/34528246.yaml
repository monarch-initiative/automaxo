input_text: What is the role of chest X-ray imaging in the acute management of children
  with sickle cell disease?Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) frequently present
  to hospital acutely unwell and are often exposed to diagnostic chest X-rays (CXRs).
  Little evidence exists to determine when CXRs are clinically useful. Using electronic
  hospital records, we audited CXR use in children aged 0-18 who presented to hospital
  over the past 10 years in both an inpatient and emergency department setting. From
  a total of 915 first CXRs, only 28 2% of CXRs (n = 258) had clinically significant
  findings that altered management or final diagnosis. Of these abnormalities, consolidation
  represented 52 3%, effusion 8 9%, cardiomegaly 8 4% and sickle cell-related bone
  changes 6 3%. Indications for CXR of respiratory distress (OR = 3 74, 95% CI 2 28-6
  13), hypoxia (OR = 1 86, 95% CI 1 50-2 31) and cough (OR = 1 64, 95% CI 1 33-2 02),
  were more likely to have significant CXR findings. Patients who had higher peak
  fever (38 4 C vs. 37 4 C, P = 0 001), higher peak CRP (156 4 vs. 46 1, P < 0 001)
  and higher WCC (20 2 vs. 13 6, P < 0 001) were more likely to have clinically significant
  abnormalities on CXR. We found a decision tool using either hypoxia, cough, respiratory
  distress, T > 38 C, CRP > 50 or WCC > 15 x 109 /l as indications for CXR, to have
  a sensitivity of 88% (with 95% CI 0 78-0 95) and specificity of 46% (95% CI 0 43-0
  50) for clinically significant findings.
