input_text: 'Red blood cell alloimmunisation in sickle cell disease patients in the
  Democratic Republic of the Congo.OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of red
  blood cell (RBC) alloimmunisation and alloantibody specificity in sickle cell disease
  (SCD) patients in Kisangani, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in comparison with
  those followed at the Centre Hospitalier Regional (CHR) de la Citadelle of Liege
  (Belgium). BACKGROUND: Data regarding RBC alloimmunisation (immune response of the
  organism to foreign erythrocyte antigens, antigens that lack on its own RBC) in
  SCD patients are scarce in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: We conducted a multi-site-based
  cross-sectional study among 125 SCD patients at Kisangani and 136 at the CHR de
  la Citadelle of Liege. The diagnosis of SCD was confirmed by high-performance liquid
  chromatography. Alloantibodies were screened using the agglutination technique on
  gel cards and their specificity determined using 11 and/or 16 cell panels. Statistical
  analyses were carried out using SPSS. RESULTS: The prevalence of RBC alloimmunisation
  was 9.6% among SCD patients in Kisangani versus 22.8% in those of Liege. At Kisangani
  as well as at Liege, the median age of alloimmunised patients was higher than that
  of non-alloimmunised patients, 15.5 years (IQR:4.8-19.8) and 24 years (IQR:14-31)
  versus 10 years (IQR: 6.5-17) and 17 years (IQR:12-24), respectively. The median
  number of blood units was higher in both Kisangani and Liege immunised patients
  compared to non-immunised patients, 8 (IQR:5-11) versus 5 (IQR:3-13) and 41(IQR:6-93)
  versus 6.5(3-37) respectively. At Kisangani (N = 14), the most frequent antibodies
  were anti-D (28.6%) and anti-C versus anti-E (13.6%), anti-S (13.6%) and anti-Lea
  (11.4%) at Liege (N = 44). CONCLUSIONS: These findings stated that alloimmunisation
  is a common complication in SCD patients in the DRC. In the resource-limited setting
  of this country, blood transfusion with minimal ABO, D, C and E antigen matching
  in addition to the use of compatibility test could significantly reduce the incidence
  of this complication.'
