input_text: "Flow adhesion of whole blood to P-selectin: a prognostic biomarker for
  vaso-occlusive crisis in sickle cell disease.Blood cell adhesion to P-selectin and
  vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) contributes to the pathophysiology of
  vaso-occlusion crisis (VOC) events in individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD).
  We evaluated the use of standardized flow adhesion biomarkers in a six-month, 35-subjects
  longitudinal study (ELIPSIS). Flow adhesion of whole blood on P-selectin (FA-WB-Psel)
  and VCAM1 (FA-WB-VCAM), and of isolated white blood cells on P-selectin (FA-WBC-Psel)
  and VCAM-1 (FA-WBC-VCAM) were elevated on VOC days compared with non-VOC days, but
  only FA-WB-Psel reached statistical significance (P = 0 015). Optimal cut-off values
  were established with Cox regression models for FA-WB-Psel [46 cells/mm2; hazard
  ratio (HR): 2 3; 95% confidence interval (CI):1 4-4 0; P = 0 01] and FA-WB-VCAM
  (408 cells/mm2, HR:1 8; 95% CI: 0 9-3 45; P = 0 01). A combined (FA-WB-Psel and
  FA-WB-VCAM) multimarker risk score was also significantly (P = 0 0006) correlated
  with VOC risk that was two-fold higher for intermediate and 5 64-fold higher for
  high score. The concordance (C)-index for the multimarker score was 0 63 in the
  six-month period (95% CI: 0 56-0 70), indicating a better ability to distinguish
  patient risk of VOC, compared to individual biomarkers FA-WB-VCAM (C-index: 0 57;
  95% CI: 0 49-0 65) or FA-WB-Psel (C-index: 0 58; 95% CI: 0 53-0 62). The presented
  multimarker score can be used to risk-stratify individuals with SCD during their
  steady state into low, intermediate, and high-risk strata for self-reported VOCs.
  Such risk stratification could help focus healthcare resources more efficiently
  to maintiain health, personalize treatment selection to each patient's individual
  needs, and potentially reduce healthcare costs."
