input_text: 'Chronic osteo-articular changes in patients with sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND:
  Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an autosomal recessive genetic disease in which a mutation
  occurs in the beta-globin chain gene, resulting in abnormal hemoglobin levels. In
  an environment with reduced oxygen concentration, red blood cells change their conformation,
  resulting in chronic hemolysis and consequent anemia and vaso-occlusive crises with
  injuries to several organs, with a significant impairment of the osteoarticular
  system. This study aimed to verify the chronic osteoarticular alterations and their
  association with clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with SCD with
  a more severe phenotype (SS and Sbeta0), on a steady-state fasis. METHODS: Fifty-five
  patients were referred to a medical consultation with a specialized assessment of
  the locomotor system, followed by laboratory tests and radiographic examinations.
  RESULTS: In total, 74.5% patients had hemoglobinopathy SS; 67.3% were female; and
  78.2% were non-whites. The mean patient age was 30.5 years. Most patients (61.8%)
  reported up to three crises per year, with a predominance of high-intensity pain
  (65.5%). Radiographic alterations were present in 80% patients. A total of 140 lesions
  were identified, most which were located in the spine, femur, and shoulders. Most
  lesions were osteonecrosis and osteoarthritis and were statistically associated
  with the non-use of hydroxyurea. CONCLUSIONS: There was a high prevalence of chronic
  osteoarticular alterations, which was statistically associated only with the non-regular
  use of hydroxyurea.'
