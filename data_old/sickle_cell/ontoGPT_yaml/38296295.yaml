input_text: "Protocol for an evaluation of the initiation of an integrated longitudinal
  outpatient care model for severe chronic non-communicable diseases (PEN-Plus) at
  secondary care facilities (district hospitals) in 10 lower-income countries.INTRODUCTION:
  The Package of Essential Noncommunicable Disease Interventions-Plus (PEN-Plus) is
  a strategy decentralising care for severe non-communicable diseases (NCDs) including
  type 1 diabetes, rheumatic heart disease and sickle cell disease, to increase access
  to care. In the PEN-Plus model, mid-level clinicians in intermediary facilities
  in low and lower middle income countries are trained to provide integrated care
  for conditions where services traditionally were only available at tertiary referral
  facilities. For the upcoming phase of activities, 18 first-level hospitals in 9
  countries and 1 state in India were selected for PEN-Plus expansion and will treat
  a variety of severe NCDs. Over 3 years, the countries and state are expected to:
  (1) establish PEN-Plus clinics in one or two district hospitals, (2) support these
  clinics to mature into training sites in preparation for national or state-level
  scale-up, and (3) work with the national or state-level stakeholders to describe,
  measure and advocate for PEN-Plus to support development of a national operational
  plan for scale-up. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Guided by Proctor outcomes for implementation
  research, we are conducting a mixed-method evaluation consisting of 10 components
  to understand outcomes in clinical implementation, training and policy development.
  Data will be collected through a mix of quantitative surveys, routine reporting,
  routine clinical data and qualitative interviews. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This
  protocol has been considered exempt or covered by central and local institutional
  review boards. Findings will be disseminated throughout the project's course, including
  through quarterly M&E discussions, semiannual formative assessments, dashboard mapping
  of progress, quarterly newsletters, regular feedback loops with national stakeholders
  and publication in peer-reviewed journals."
