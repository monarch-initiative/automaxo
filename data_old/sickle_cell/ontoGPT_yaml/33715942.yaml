input_text: 'Primary Immunization Series Coverage of Children With Sickle Cell Disease.INTRODUCTION:
  Children with sickle cell disease are at increased risk of serious infections, many
  of which can be prevented by receipt of recommended immunizations. Study objectives
  were to (1) assess the primary immunization series coverage among children with
  sickle cell disease and (2) compare the coverage with that of those without sickle
  cell disease. METHODS: The Michigan Care Improvement Registry was used to obtain
  primary immunization series doses and sickle cell disease status for all eligible
  children in Michigan born in 2001-2016 (analysis was conducted in 2019). Completion
  of series and each individual vaccine were assessed for every child at ages 19 and
  35 months. Proportions were stratified by sickle cell disease status and compared
  using chi-square tests. Logistic regression was used to model the odds of completing
  the series at each age, as predicted by sickle cell disease status and adjusting
  for the presence of Medicaid identification number. RESULTS: The proportion of children
  who completed the immunization series was higher for those with sickle cell disease
  than for those without sickle cell disease at 19 months (58.5% vs 48.0%) and 35
  months (74.7% vs 59.6%) (both p<0.0001). The odds of completing the series were
  1.4 times higher at 19 months (95% CI=1.2, 1.6) and 1.7 times higher at 35 months
  (95% CI=1.5, 2.0) for children with sickle cell disease than for those without,
  adjusting for the presence of Medicaid identification number. CONCLUSIONS: Although
  children with sickle cell disease had higher immunization rates than those without
  sickle cell disease, >40% of children with sickle cell disease did not receive all
  recommended immunizations by age 19 months. Immunization information systems should
  be utilized to improve routine immunization coverage of children with sickle cell
  disease.'
