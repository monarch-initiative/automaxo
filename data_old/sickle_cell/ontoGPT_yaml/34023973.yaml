input_text: 'Impact of a submaximal mono-articular exercise on the skeletal muscle
  function of patients with sickle cell disease.PURPOSE: Sickle cell disease (SCD)
  patients exhibit a limited exercise tolerance commonly attributed to anaemia, as
  well as hemorheological and cardio-respiratory abnormalities, but the functional
  status of skeletal muscle at exercise is unknown. Moreover, the effect of SCD genotype
  on exercise tolerance and skeletal muscle function has been poorly investigated.
  The aim of this study was to investigate skeletal muscle function and fatigue during
  a submaximal exercise in SCD patients. METHODS: Nineteen healthy individuals (AA),
  28 patients with sickle cell anaemia (SS) and 18 with sickle cell-haemoglobin C
  disease (SC) performed repeated knee extensions exercise (FAT). Maximal isometric
  torque (Tmax) was measured before and after the FAT to quantify muscle fatigability.
  Electromyographic activity and oxygenation by near-infrared spectroscopy of the
  Vastus Lateralis were recorded. RESULTS: FAT caused a reduction in Tmax in SS (-
  17.0 +- 12.1%, p < 0.001) and SC (- 21.5 +- 14.5%, p < 0.05) but not in AA (+ 0.58
  +- 29.9%). Root-mean-squared value of EMG signal (RMS) decreased only in SS after
  FAT, while the median power frequency (MPF) was unchanged in all groups. Oxygenation
  kinetics were determined in SS and AA and were not different. CONCLUSION: These
  results show skeletal muscle dysfunction during exercise in SCD patients, and suggest
  different fatigue aetiology between SS and SC. The changes in EMG signal and oxygenation
  kinetics during exercise suggest that the greater skeletal muscle fatigue occurring
  in SCD patients would be rather due to intramuscular alterations modifications than
  decreased tissue oxygenation. Moreover, SS patients exhibit greater muscle fatigability
  than SC.'
