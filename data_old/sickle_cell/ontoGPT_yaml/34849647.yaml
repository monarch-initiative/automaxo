input_text: 'Performance of a Histidine Rich Protein-2 Based (First Response) and
  a p-Lactate Dehydrogenase-based (Optimal) Rapid Diagnostic Test for Diagnosis of
  Malaria in Patients With Pediatric Sickle Cell Disease.BACKGROUND: Rapid diagnostic
  tests (RDTs) have been extensively evaluated and play an important role in malaria
  diagnosis. However, the accuracy of RDTs for malaria diagnosis in patients with
  sickle cell disease (SCD) is unknown. METHODS: We compared the performance of a
  histidine rich protein 2 (HRP-2)-based RDT (First Response) and a lactate dehydrogenase
  (LDH)-based RDT (Optimal) with routine microscopy as reference standard in 445 children
  with SCD and an acute febrile illness in Accra, Ghana. RESULTS: The overall sensitivity,
  specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the HRP-2-based RDTs
  were 100%, 95.7%, 73.8%, and 100%, respectively. Comparable values for the LDH-based
  RDTs were 91.7%, 99.5%, 95.7%, and 99.0%, respectively. A total of 423 results were
  true in both tests, 1 result was false in both tests, 16 results were false in the
  HRP-2 test only, and 5 were false in the LDH test only (McNemar test, P = .03).
  At follow-up, 73.7% (28/38), 52.6% (20/38), 48.6% (17/35), and 13.2% (5/38) of study
  participants were HRP-2 positive on days 14, 28, 35, and 42, respectively, compared
  with 0%, 2.6% (1/38), 2.9% (1/35), and 2.6% (1/38) for LDH. CONCLUSION: The HRP2-based
  RDT fulfilled World Health Organization criteria for malaria diagnosis in patients
  with SCD and may provide diagnostic evidence for treatment to begin in cases in
  which treatment would otherwise have begun presumptively based on symptoms, whereas
  LDH-based RDTs may be more suitable as a confirmatory test in low-parasitemic subgroups,
  such as patients with SCD.'
