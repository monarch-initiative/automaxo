input_text: 'Combination Therapy With Bortezomib in Renal Medullary Carcinoma: A Case
  Series.BACKGROUND: Renal medullary carcinoma (RMC) is a very rare, aggressive neoplasm
  occurring almost exclusively in adolescents and young adults with sickle cell trait.
  Given the rare nature of this tumor, accounting for less than 0.5% of all renal
  carcinomas, most of the published data on therapies is from case reports and small
  case series, and current treatments are insufficient, with most patients succumbing
  to their disease in months. We report our experience with a cytotoxic chemotherapy
  regimen consisting of platinum-based therapy, doxorubicin, and bortezomib. METHODS:
  Three patients with metastatic RMC at a single institution were treated off-label
  with a perioperative chemotherapy regimen for 4 cycles of 2 alternating regimens:
  regimen A consisting of cisplatin, doxorubicin, and bortezomib; regimen B consisting
  of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and gemcitabine. A radical nephrectomy was performed
  on all patients. Surveillance imaging was performed on all patients to assess response
  and disease burden. Patients received up to 12 months of maintenance therapy with
  everolimus. RESULTS: Three African American patients - 2 males and 1 female aged
  14, 28, and 31 - with sickle cell trait and metastatic disease were treated with
  this regimen. The median follow-up was 18 months. All had resection of the primary
  tumor - 2 patients after receiving neoadjuvant therapy, and one patient underwent
  resection prior to referral. All 3 patients achieved complete responses based on
  imaging, 2 of which lasted for 12 months, and another is still in remission over
  7 years after diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: This regimen of alternating cycles of platinum-based
  chemotherapy with bortezomib appeared to be active against RMC and was generally
  well-tolerated. Given the extremely rare nature of this disease and dismal prognosis,
  new treatment modalities should be pursued, and whenever possible, patients should
  be enrolled in a clinical trial. We propose that a multiinstitution clinical trial
  of this regiment may be warranted.'
