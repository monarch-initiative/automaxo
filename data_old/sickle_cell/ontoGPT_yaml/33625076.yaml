input_text: Association of Anemia and Blood Pressure With Novel Markers of Diastolic
  Function in Pediatric Sickle Cell Disease.Diastolic dysfunction is a known cause
  of mortality in adults with sickle cell disease (SCD). Left atrial function (LAf)
  and strain (LAS) are novel echocardiographic parameters to assess early diastolic
  dysfunction, which have not been assessed in pediatric SCD. Through a retrospective
  single-center study, we describe echocardiographic parameters of diastology in children
  with SCD and evaluate their relationship with clinical variables including anemia
  and blood pressure. Baseline clinical data, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring
  data and echocardiography results were collected. LAf and LAS were measured using
  volumetric data and speckle-tracking echocardiography, respectively. Sixty-seven
  children with SCD (13.5+-7 y, 47% male, 7% hypertensive) with a mean hemoglobin
  of 8.8+-1.3 g/dL, LAf of 61+-8% (n=53) and LAS of 46.3+-7.4% (n=28) were included.
  LAS was significantly associated with hemoglobin (rho=0.43, P=0.022) but not with
  maximal left atrial (LA) volume (rho=-0.05, P=0.79) or any blood pressure parameters.
  On multivariate analysis, LAS decreased by 3.2% (1.3, 5.1) and LA volume increased
  by 1.6 mL/m2 (3.1, 0.08) for every 1 g/dL decrease in hemoglobin. Thus, severity
  of baseline anemia in pediatric SCD correlates with diastolic function as measured
  by LAS, independent of LA dilation.
