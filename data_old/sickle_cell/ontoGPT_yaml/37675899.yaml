input_text: Gene therapy for Hemoglobinopathies.Beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease
  (SCD) are autosomal recessive disorders of red blood cells due to mutations in the
  adult ss-globin gene, with a worldwide diffusion. The severe forms of hemoglobinopathies
  are fatal if untreated, and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation can be offered
  to a limited proportion of patients. The unmet clinical need and the disease incidence
  have promoted the development of new genetic therapies based on the engineering
  of autologous hematopoietic stem cells. Here, the steps of ex vivo gene therapy
  development are reviewed along with results from clinical trials and recent new
  approaches employing cutting edge gene editing tools.
