input_text: Stroke and stroke prevention in sickle cell anemia in developed and selected
  developing countries.This comprehensive review provides an insight into the pathophysiology,
  epidemiology, evaluation, and treatment of sickle cell anemia (SCA)-related stroke
  in developed and developing countries. Vascular injury, hypercoagulability and vaso-occlusion
  play a role in the pathophysiology of stroke in SCA. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound
  (TCD) has lowered the incidence of ischemic stroke from 11% to 1% as TCD identifies
  children who are at risk for stroke, providing opportunities for interventions to
  reduce this risk. Whereas blood exchange is indicated in acute stroke, chronic transfusions
  (either simple or exchange on a monthly basis) are used for primary as well as secondary
  stroke prevention in developed countries. Children with abnormally high TCD velocities
  (>= 200 cm/s) are at high risk of stroke and might benefit from hydroxyurea or hydroxycarbamide
  (HU) after a period of a successful transition from chronic transfusions. Hematopoietic
  stem cell transplant presents a cure for SCA. Gene therapy is currently investigated
  and may be offered to patients with SCA who had a stroke or who are at high risk
  of stroke if proven efficacious and safe. However, gene therapy is not likely to
  be implemented in low-income countries due to cost. Alternatively, HU is utilized
  for primary and secondary stroke prevention in developing countries. Further expansion
  of TCD implementation should be a priority in those settings.
