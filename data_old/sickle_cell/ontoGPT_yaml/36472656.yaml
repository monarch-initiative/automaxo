input_text: 'Glomerular hyperfiltration: part 2-clinical significance in children.Glomerular
  hyperfiltration (GHF) is a phenomenon that can occur in various clinical conditions
  affecting the kidneys such as sickle cell disease, diabetes mellitus, autosomal
  dominant polycystic kidney disease, and solitary functioning kidney. Yet, the pathophysiological
  mechanisms vary from one disease to another and are not well understood. More so,
  it has been demonstrated that GHF may occur at the single-nephron in some clinical
  conditions while in others at the whole-kidney level. In this review, we explore
  the pathophysiological mechanisms of GHF in relation to various clinical conditions
  in the pediatric population. In addition, we discuss the role and mechanism of action
  of important factors such as gender, low birth weight, and race in the pathogenesis
  of GHF. Finally, in this current review, we further highlight the consequences of
  GHF in the progression of kidney disease.'
