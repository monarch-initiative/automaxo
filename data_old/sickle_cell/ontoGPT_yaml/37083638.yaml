input_text: 'Adolescents and Young Adults with Sickle Cell Disease: Nociplastic Pain
  and Pain Catastrophizing as Predictors of Pain Interference and Opioid Consumption.OBJECTIVES:
  Some patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) have features of nociplastic pain.
  While research suggests that many patients with nociplastic pain consume more opioids
  due to opioid non-responsiveness, little is known about the impact of nociplastic
  pain and pain catastrophizing on opioid consumption and pain interference among
  adolescents and young adults (AYA) with SCD. The purpose of this study was to (1)
  characterize nociplastic pain and pain catastrophizing among AYA with SCD, and (2)
  determine whether these characterizations are associated with subsequent opioid
  consumption and pain interference one-month after characterization. METHODS: Participants
  completed surveys characterizing nociplastic pain and catastrophizing at a routine
  clinic visit (baseline). Thereafter, participants received weekly text messages
  which included pain interference and opioid consumption surveys. Multi-predictor
  two-part models were used to evaluate the predictive relationships between baseline
  characterizations and subsequent pain interference, and opioid consumption. RESULTS:
  Forty-eight AYA aged 14-35 completed baseline measures. Twenty-five percent of participants
  had scores suggestive of nociplastic pain. Greater nociplastic pain features significantly
  increased the odds of consuming opioids (OR 1.2) and having greater interference
  from pain (OR 1.46). Regression analyses found that greater baseline nociplastic
  pain characteristics were significantly associated with opioid consumption (beta
  0.13) and pain interference (beta 0.061); whereas higher pain catastrophizing scores
  predicted less opioid consumption (beta -0.03) and less pain interference (beta
  -0.0007). DISCUSSION: In this sample of AYA with SCD, features of nociplastic pain
  predicted higher subsequent opioid consumption and pain interference. Being aware
  of nociplastic pain features in patients with SCD may better guide individualized
  pain management.'
