input_text: 'Retinopathy in Egyptian patients with sickle cell disease: A cross-sectional
  study.ABSTRACT: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a disorder that causes red blood cells
  to become sticky and rigid. Sickle cells can block blood flow in small blood vessels
  depriving the eye of oxygen and cause damage. This is called sickle retinopathy
  that can progress to severe proliferative sickle cell retinopathy, bleeding into
  the eye, detachment of the retina or even loss of vision.To assess ocular manifestations
  and detect frequency of retinopathy in patients with SCD.Cross-sectional study was
  conducted on 32 patients with SCD. They were 22 males and 10 females with mean age
  of 12 years. Routine investigations as well as ophthalmological examination including
  visual acuity, fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography were done.We
  found that 8 patients (25%) suffered from proliferative retinopathy, 10 patients
  (31%) showed tortuous retinal veins, while 14 patients (44%) were normal. All patients
  showed macular thinning on optical coherence tomography examination.We concluded
  that frequency of retinopathy in patients with SCD is more than expected and it
  was higher in patients who started transfusion at a later age. More attention should
  be paid for this problem and close observations and follow up is strongly needed.'
