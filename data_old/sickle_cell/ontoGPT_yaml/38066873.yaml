input_text: Alloimmunization and hyperhemolysis in sickle cell disease.Alloimmunization
  against red blood cell antigens and delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR)
  are major barriers to transfusion in sickle cell disease (SCD). In SCD, DHTR is
  a potentially life-threatening. Blood group polymorphism in SCD patients, who are
  of African ancestry and frequently exposed to antigens they do not carry; an inflammatory
  clinical state; and occasional transfusion in acute situations are risk factors
  for alloimmunization and DHTR. In patients at risk, the transfusion indication must
  be balanced against the risk of developing DHTR. However, when transfusion is absolutely
  necessary, protocols combining the prevention of exposure to immunogenic antigens
  with immunosuppressive treatments must be implemented, and patients should be carefully
  monitored during posttransfusion follow-up. This close monitoring makes it possible
  to diagnose hyperhemolysis as soon as possible; to avoid retransfusion, which can
  exacerbate hemolysis; and to administer specific treatments, such as anticomplement
  therapy, in severe cases. Finally, in patients with severe disease, hematopoietic
  stem cell transplantation may be indicated. However, transfusion is also required
  in this context, and its management is complex because these risks must be taken
  into account.
