input_text: 'Autonomic and Vascular Responses during Reactive Hyperemia in Healthy
  Individuals and Patients with Sickle Cell Anemia.Background and Objectives: To compare
  autonomic and vascular responses during reactive hyperemia (RH) between healthy
  individuals and patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA). Materials and Methods: Eighteen
  healthy subjects and 24 SCA patients were subjected to arterial occlusion for 3
  min at the lower right limb level. The pulse rate variability (PRV) and pulse wave
  amplitude were measured through photoplethysmography using the Angiodin  PD 3000
  device, which was placed on the first finger of the lower right limb 2 min before
  (Basal) and 2 min after the occlusion. Pulse peak intervals were analyzed using
  time-frequency (wavelet transform) methods for high-frequency (HF: 0.15-0.4) and
  low-frequency (LF: 0.04-0.15) bands, and the LF/HF ratio was calculated. Results:
  The pulse wave amplitude was higher in healthy subjects compared to SCA patients,
  at both baseline and post-occlusion (p < 0.05). Time-frequency analysis showed that
  the LF/HF peak in response to the post-occlusion RH test was reached earlier in
  healthy subjects compared to SCA patients. Conclusions: Vasodilatory function, as
  measured by PPG, was lower in SCA patients compared to healthy subjects. Moreover,
  a cardiovascular autonomic imbalance was present in SCA patients with high sympathetic
  and low parasympathetic activity in the basal state and a poor response of the sympathetic
  nervous system to RH. Early cardiovascular sympathetic activation (10 s) and vasodilatory
  function in response to RH were impaired in SCA patients.'
