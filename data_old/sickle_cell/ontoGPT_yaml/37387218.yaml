input_text: 'Toward Automated Detection of Silent Cerebral Infarcts in Children and
  Young Adults With Sickle Cell Anemia.BACKGROUND: Silent cerebral infarcts (SCI)
  in sickle cell anemia (SCA) are associated with future strokes and cognitive impairment,
  warranting early diagnosis and treatment. Detection of SCI, however, is limited
  by their small size, especially when neuroradiologists are unavailable. We hypothesized
  that deep learning may permit automated SCI detection in children and young adults
  with SCA as a tool to identify the presence and extent of SCI in clinical and research
  settings. METHODS: We utilized UNet-a deep learning model-for fully automated SCI
  segmentation. We trained and optimized UNet using brain magnetic resonance imaging
  from the SIT trial (Silent Infarct Transfusion). Neuroradiologists provided the
  ground truth for SCI diagnosis, while a vascular neurologist manually delineated
  SCI on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and provided the ground truth for SCI
  segmentation. UNet was optimized for the highest spatial overlap between automatic
  and manual delineation (dice similarity coefficient). The optimized UNet was externally
  validated using an independent single-center prospective cohort of SCA participants.
  Model performance was evaluated through sensitivity and accuracy (%correct cases)
  for SCI diagnosis, dice similarity coefficient, intraclass correlation coefficient
  (metric of volumetric agreement), and Spearman correlation. RESULTS: The SIT trial
  (n=926; 31% with SCI; median age, 6.8 years) and external validation (n=80; 50%
  with SCI; age, 11.5 years) cohorts had small median lesion volumes of 0.40 and 0.25
  mL, respectively. Compared with the neuroradiology diagnosis, UNet predicted SCI
  presence with 100% sensitivity and 74% accuracy. In magnetic resonance imaging with
  SCI, UNet reached a moderate spatial agreement (dice similarity coefficient, 0.48)
  and high volumetric agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.76; rho=0.72;
  P<0.001) between automatic and manual segmentations. CONCLUSIONS: UNet, trained
  using a large pediatric SCA magnetic resonance imaging data set, sensitively detected
  small SCI in children and young adults with SCA. While additional training is needed,
  UNet may be integrated into the clinical workflow as a screening tool, aiding in
  SCI diagnosis.'
