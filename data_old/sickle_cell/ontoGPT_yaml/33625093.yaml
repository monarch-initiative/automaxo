input_text: 'Transcranial Doppler Screening in a Current Cohort of Children With Sickle
  Cell Anemia: Results From the DISPLACE Study.Stroke prevention guidelines for sickle
  cell anemia (SCA) recommend transcranial Doppler (TCD) screening to identify children
  at stroke risk; however, TCD screening implementation remains poor. This report
  describes results from Part 1 of the 28-site DISPLACE (Dissemination and Implementation
  of Stroke Prevention Looking at the Care Environment) study, a baseline assessment
  of TCD implementation rates. This report describes TCD implementation by consortium
  site characteristics; characteristics of TCDs completed; and TCD results based on
  age. The cohort included 5247 children with SCA, of whom 5116 were eligible for
  TCD implementation assessment for at least 1 study year. The majority of children
  were African American or Black, non-Hispanic and received Medicaid. Mean age at
  first recorded TCD was 5.9 and 10.5 years at study end. Observed TCD screening rates
  were unsatisfactory across geographic regions (mean 49.9%; range: 30.9% to 74.7%)
  independent of size, institution type, or previous stroke prevention trial participation.
  The abnormal TCD rate was 2.9%, with a median age of 6.3 years for first abnormal
  TCD result. Findings highlight real-world TCD screening practices and results from
  the largest SCA cohort to date. Data informed the part 3 implementation study for
  improving stroke screening and findings may inform clinical practice improvements.'
