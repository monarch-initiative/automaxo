input_text: 'Evaluation of opioid use disorder treatment outcomes in patients receiving
  split daily versus once daily dosing of buprenorphine-naloxone.INTRODUCTION: In
  clinical practice, sublingual (SL) buprenorphine-naloxone is prescribed as once
  daily or split daily dosing for the management of opioid use disorder (OUD). Evidence
  is lacking that assesses how split daily buprenorphine-naloxone affects OUD outcomes.
  This study aims to evaluate how the dosing frequency of SL buprenorphine-naloxone
  impacts therapy effectiveness when treating patients with OUD. METHODS: This retrospective
  analysis included adult outpatients prescribed treatment with SL buprenorphine-naloxone
  for OUD between July 1, 2016, and March 1, 2020. The study excluded patients with
  sickle cell disease, recent methadone treatment, or pregnancy. We characterized
  study groups by dosing frequency, either once daily or split dosing. The study compared
  retention in treatment, medication adherence, adherence to treatment program, and
  hospital encounters between groups. RESULTS: The study screened eight-hundred and
  seven patients, and included 250 patients newly prescribed SL buprenorphine-naloxone.
  Fifty-seven patients (22.8 %) were prescribed once daily dosing and 193 patients
  (77.2 %) were prescribed split daily dosing. The study found no significant differences
  noted in 12-month rates of treatment retention (52.6 % vs. 45.6 %, p = .35). These
  outcomes remained similar when assessed at three and six months. Within a year of
  buprenorphine-naloxone initiation, the study found no differences in the percentage
  of patients with hospitalizations (26.3 % vs. 38.3 %, p = .10), median number of
  hospitalizations (2 vs. 2), or proportion of days covered by a prescription >=80
  % (93.3 % vs. 92.0 %, p = .82). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, patients receiving once
  daily buprenorphine-naloxone had similar treatment outcomes to patients receiving
  split dosing. Further controlled studies are necessary to evaluate which patients
  are more likely to benefit from split dosing.'
