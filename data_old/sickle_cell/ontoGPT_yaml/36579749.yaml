input_text: 'Trends in blood transfusion, hydroxyurea use, and iron overload among
  children with sickle cell disease enrolled in Medicaid, 2004-2019.BACKGROUND: There
  have been significant changes in clinical guidelines for sickle cell disease (SCD)
  over the past two decades, including updated indications for hydroxyurea, transfusions,
  and iron overload management. In practice however, there are few studies that examine
  SCD care utilization over time. METHODS: We conducted a serial cross-sectional cohort
  study of pediatric SCD patients from 2004 to 2019 using Georgia Medicaid claims
  data. For each year, we reported receipt of any transfusion, chronic transfusion,
  or three or more filled hydroxyurea prescriptions. For children receiving chronic
  transfusion (six or more annual transfusions), we evaluated iron overload diagnosis,
  monitoring, and chelation use. Among children with sickle cell anemia (SCA), we
  examined rates of transfusions and hydroxyurea use. The Cochran-Armitage test was
  used to assess trend. RESULTS: There were 5316 unique children 2-18 years old with
  SCD enrolled in Georgia Medicaid from 2004 to 2019. Children receiving any transfusion
  increased from 2004 to 2010, then stabilized. In SCA patients, chronic transfusions
  initially increased from 2004 to 2010, then stabilized from 2010 to 2019. For chronically
  transfused children, monitoring of iron burden and filled chelator prescriptions
  both increased significantly. Hydroxyurea use in SCA patients increased from 12%
  to 37%, with increases noted within each age group, most notably from 21% to 60%
  in the 13-18-year-old cohort. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated changes in SCD care utilization
  over time, including increased hydroxyurea use, changes in transfusion rates, and
  increased attention to iron overload management. While trends in clinical management
  do follow updates in treatment guidelines, there is still delayed and suboptimal
  uptake of guideline recommendations in pediatric SCD patients.'
