input_text: Significant improvement of child physical and emotional functioning after
  familial haploidentical stem cell transplant.Allogeneic stem cell transplantation
  (AlloSCT) represents the only curative therapy for sickle cell disease (SCD). However,
  limited availability of matched related donors and suboptimal outcomes following
  AlloSCT with unrelated donors has led to investigation of alternative donors. Among
  children with high-risk SCD, we evaluated health-related quality of life (HRQoL)
  impact in the two years following familial haploidentical SCT. HRQoL was collected
  from parent and child raters, using the Child Health Ratings Inventories Generic
  measure and haploidentical SCT-specific module. Repeated measures models were fit
  to assess HRQoL changes over time and by rater. Nineteen children (mean age 12.9
  yrs [standard deviation, 5.3]; 63% male) and their parents were included. There
  were no differences in the 2-yr trajectories of child physical or emotional functioning
  (EF) by rater. Child physical functioning and EF scores were significantly lower
  at day +45 than baseline, but scores recovered by day +180. There was significant
  improvement in EF (p = 0.03) at 2 yrs vs baseline. A similar pattern of scores over
  time was seen for parent ratings of child's global HRQoL. Despite treatment intensity
  in the initial months following AlloSCT, patient scores recovered or exceeded baseline
  scores at two years. This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01461837).
