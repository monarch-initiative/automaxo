input_text: Assessment of Liver Fibrosis by Transient Elastography in Children and
  Young Adults With Sickle Cell Disease With and Without Iron Overload.Transfusion-associated
  iron overload may cause liver fibrosis. We compared transient elastography (TE)
  and aspartate aminotransferase-platelet ratio index (APRI), noninvasive markers
  for hepatic fibrosis, to liver histology in children and young adults with sickle
  cell disease (SCD) who were iron overloaded (cohort 1). Age-matched subjects with
  SCD but without iron overload (cohort 2) were enrolled for APRI and TE assessments.
  Nineteen subjects ages 10 to 21 years were transfused for a mean of 9.67 years,
  had a mean serum ferritin of 4899+-2849 ng/mL, and a liver iron concentration of
  15.56+-10.12 mg/g dry liver weight by R2-magnetic resonance imaging. Mean APRI was
  0.33+-0.13 in cohort 1 and 0.27+-0.10 in cohort 2. The mean liver stiffness measures
  (LSM) in cohort 1, assessed by TE, was 8.46+-3.95 kPa, ranging from 3.5 to 14.6
  kPa (expected normal <7 kPa). Cohort 2 had a mean LSM of 5.72+-1.74 kPa (4.6 to
  8.7 kPa). There was a good correlation between LSM and histologic fibrosis (t value
  6.94, P<0.0001). There was no significant correlation between APRI and histologic
  fibrosis and between APRI and LSM. A high LSM suggests liver fibrosis in children
  and adults with SCD with iron overload and may merit histologic confirmation especially
  if persistent.
