input_text: 'Allogeneic Transplant and Gene Therapy: Evolving Toward a Cure.Curative
  therapies for sickle cell disease (SCD) include allogeneic human leukocyte antigen
  (HLA)- matched sibling and haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT), gene
  therapy, and gene editing. However, comparative trial data that might facilitate
  selecting one curative therapy over another are unavailable. New strategies to decrease
  graft rejection and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) risks are needed to expand
  haploidentical HCT. Myeloablative gene therapy and gene editing also has limitations.
  Herein, we review recent studies on curative therapies for SCD in the past 5 years.'
