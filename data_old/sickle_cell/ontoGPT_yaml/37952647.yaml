input_text: Improvement in cardiac morphology demonstrated by CMR and echo after haploidentical
  hematopoietic cell transplant in adults with sickle cell disease.Cardiopulmonary
  complications account for approximately 40% of deaths in patients with sickle cell
  disease (SCD). Diffuse myocardial fibrosis, elevated tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity
  (TRV) and iron overload are all associated with early mortality. While HLA-matched
  sibling hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) offers a potential cure, fewer than
  20% of patients have a suitable donor. Haploidentical HCT allows for an increased
  donor pool and has recently demonstrated improved safety and efficacy. Our group
  has reported improved cardiac morphology via echocardiography at one year after
  HCT. Herein, we describe the first use of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR),
  the gold standard for measuring volume, mass, and ventricular function, to evaluate
  changes in cardiac morphology post-HCT in adults with SCD. We analyzed baseline
  and 1-year data from 12 adults with SCD who received nonmyeloablative haploidentical
  peripheral blood HCT at the NIH. Patients underwent non-contrast CMR at 3T, echocardiography,
  and laboratory studies. One year after HCT, patients showed marked improvement in
  cardiac chamber morphology by CMR, including left ventricular (LV) mass and volume
  (70.2 to 60.1 g/m2, p = 0.02; 114.5 to 90.6 mL/m2, p = 0.001). Furthermore, mean
  TRV normalized by 1 year, suggesting that HCT may offer a survival benefit. Fewer
  patients had pathologically prolonged native myocardial T1 times, an indirect marker
  of myocardial fibrosis at 1 year; these data showed a trend toward significance.
  In this small sample, CMR was very sensitive in detecting cardiac mass and volume
  changes after HCT and provided complementary information to echocardiography. Notably,
  post-HCT improvement in cardiac parameters can be attributed only in part to the
  resolution of anemia; further studies are required to determine the role of myocardial
  fibrosis reversal, improved blood flow, and survival impact after HCT for SCD.
