input_text: 'Cerebral Hemodynamics and Executive Function in Sickle Cell Anemia.BACKGROUND
  AND PURPOSE: Individuals with sickle cell anemia experience cognitive deficits,
  even in the absence of cerebral infarcts or strokes. This study tested the hypothesis
  that elevated cerebral blood flow and oxygen extraction fraction are associated
  with lower executive function in individuals with sickle cell anemia. METHODS: Three-Tesla
  brain magnetic resonance imaging was performed, including anatomic, gray matter
  cerebral blood flow, and global oxygen extraction fraction imaging. Executive function
  was measured using the working memory index from an age-appropriate Wechsler battery
  and tasks from the National Institutes of Health Toolbox Cognition Battery. Bivariate
  and multivariate models were examined (significance: P<0.05). RESULTS: Fifty-four
  participants (age range=6-31 years) with sickle cell anemia were enrolled. Hematocrit
  was positively related to fluid cognition, cerebral blood flow was inversely related
  to working memory and inhibitory control, and oxygen extraction fraction was inversely
  related to processing speed. Associations remained significant in multivariate analyses
  controlling for age, income, and infarcts. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated cerebral blood
  flow and oxygen extraction fraction, markers of hemodynamic impairment, are associated
  with deficits in executive function in individuals with sickle cell anemia.'
