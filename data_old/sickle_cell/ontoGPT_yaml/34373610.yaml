input_text: 'Deep learning-enabled ultra-widefield retinal vessel segmentation with
  an automated quality-optimized angiographic phase selection tool.OBJECTIVES: To
  demonstrate the feasibility of a deep learning-based vascular segmentation tool
  for UWFA and evaluate its ability to automatically identify quality-optimized phase-specific
  images. METHODS: Cumulative retinal vessel areas (RVA) were extracted from all available
  UWFA frames. Cubic splines were fitted for serial vascular assessment throughout
  the angiographic phases of eyes with diabetic retinopathy (DR), sickle cell retinopathy
  (SCR), or normal retinal vasculature. The image with maximum RVA was selected as
  the optimum early phase. A late phase frame was selected at a minimum of 4 min that
  most closely mirrored the RVA from the selected early image. Trained image analysts
  evaluated the selected pairs. RESULTS: A total of 13,980 UWFA sequences from 462
  sessions were used to evaluate the performance and 1578 UWFA sequences from 66 sessions
  were used to create cubic splines. Maximum RVA was detected at a mean of 41 +- 15,
  47 +- 27, 38 +- 8 s for DR, SCR, and normals respectively. In 85.2% of the sessions,
  appropriate images for both phases were successfully identified. The individual
  success rate was 90.7% for early and 94.6% for late frames. CONCLUSIONS: Retinal
  vascular characteristics are highly phased and field-of-view sensitive. Vascular
  parameters extracted by deep learning algorithms can be used for quality assessment
  of angiographic images and quality optimized phase selection. Clinical applications
  of a deep learning-based vascular segmentation and phase selection system might
  significantly improve the speed, consistency, and objectivity of UWFA evaluation.'
