input_text: Alpha thalassemia, but not betaS-globin haplotypes, influence sickle cell
  anemia clinical outcome in a large, single-center Brazilian cohort. Alpha thalassemia
  and beta-globin haplotype are considered classical genetic disease modifiers in
  sickle cell anemia (SCA) causing clinical heterogeneity. Nevertheless, their functional
  impact on SCA disease emergence and progression remains elusive. To better understand
  the role of alpha thalassemia and beta-globin haplotype in SCA, we performed a retrospective
  study evaluating the clinical manifestations of 614 patients. The univariate analysis
  showed that the presence of alpha-thalassemia -3.7-kb mutation (alphaalpha/-alpha
  and -alpha/-alpha) decreased the risk of stroke development (p = 0.046), priapism
  (p = 0.033), and cholelithiasis (p = 0.021). Furthermore, the cumulative incidence
  of stroke (p = 0.023) and cholelithiasis (p = 0.006) was also significantly lower
  for patients carrying the alpha thalassemia -3.7-kb mutation. No clinical effects
  were associated with the beta-globin haplotype analysis, which could be explained
  by the relatively homogeneous haplotype composition in our cohort. Our results reinforce
  that alpha thalassemia can provide protective functions against hemolysis-related
  symptoms in SCA. Although, several genetic modifiers can impact the inflammatory
  state of SCA patients, the alpha thalassemia mutation remains one of the most recurrent
  genetic aberration and should therefore always be considered first.
