input_text: 'Management of sickle cell disease: current practices and challenges in
  a northeastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. BACKGROUND: The Democratic
  Republic of the Congo (DRC) is the third most affected country worldwide by sickle
  cell disease (SCD). However, this disease is still orphaned in the country; large-scale
  control actions are rare, and little is known about its management. OBJECTIVE: To
  assess current practices in the management of SCD in Kisangani, DRC. METHODS: This
  cross-sectional study was conducted in six health facilities in Kisangani. It involved
  198 presumed sickle cell patients attending the above health facilities. The study
  focused on the sociodemographic and clinical data of the participants, obtained
  through a clinical examination and their medical records. Diagnostic confirmation
  of SCD was made by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry.
  Data were analyzed using SPSS 20.0. RESULTS: The diagnosis of SCD was confirmed
  in 194 (98.0%; 95% CI: 94.9-99.2) participants, while it was not confirmed in 4
  (2.0%; 95% CI: 0.8-5.1) participants. The diagnosis was mainly made by the Emmel
  test (42.9%). 45.8% of participants had previously been transfused with the blood
  of their parents. Folic acid was taken by 48.5% of participants and the previous
  intake of hydroxyurea was reported in 5.1% of participants. The participants vaccinated
  against Pneumococcus were 13.6% and against Haemophilus influenzae type b 28.3%.
  Penicillin prophylaxis was received by only 1.5% and malaria prophylaxis by 11.6%
  of participants. CONCLUSION: Standard-care practices for SCD patients in Kisangani
  are insufficient. The Congolese government should regard this disease as a health
  priority and consider actions to improve its management.'
