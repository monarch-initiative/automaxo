input_text: 'Acute chest syndrome, airway inflammation and lung function in sickle
  cell disease.BACKGROUND: Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is an acute complication in
  SCD but its effects on lung function are not well understood. Inflammation is a
  key component of SCD pathophysiology but with an unclear association with lung function.
  We hypothesized that children with ACS had worse lung function than children without
  ACS and aimed to investigate the association of lung function deficits with inflammatory
  cytokines. METHODS: Patients enrolled in a previous 2-year randomized clinical trial
  who had consented to future data use, were enrolled for the present exploratory
  study. Patients were categorized into ACS and non-ACS groups. Demographic and clinical
  information were collected. Serum samples were used for quantification of serum
  cytokines and leukotriene B4 levels and pulmonary function tests (PFTs) were assessed.
  RESULTS: Children with ACS had lower total lung capacity (TLC) at baseline and at
  2 years, with a significant decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1)
  and mid-maximal expiratory flow rate (FEF25-75%) in the 2 year period (p = 0.015
  and p = 0.039 respectively). For children with ACS, serum cytokines IL-5, and IL-13
  were higher at baseline and at 2 years compared to children with no ACS. IP-10 and
  IL-6 were negatively correlated with PFT markers. In multivariable regression using
  generalized estimating equation approach for factors predicting lung function, age
  was significantly associated FEV1 (p = 0.047) and ratio of FEV1 and forced vital
  capacity (FVC)- FEV1/FVC ratio (p = 0.006); males had lower FEV1/FVC (p = 0.035)
  and higher TLC (p = 0.031). Asthma status was associated with FEV1 (p = 0.017) and
  FVC (p = 0.022); history of ACS was significantly associated with TLC (p = 0.027).
  CONCLUSION: Pulmonary function abnormalities were more common and inflammatory markers
  were elevated in patients with ACS, compared with those without ACS. These findings
  suggest airway inflammation is present in children with SCD and ACS, which could
  be contributing to impaired pulmonary function.'
