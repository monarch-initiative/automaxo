input_text: Integrating deep learning with microfluidics for biophysical classification
  of sickle red blood cells adhered to laminin.Sickle cell disease, a genetic disorder
  affecting a sizeable global demographic, manifests in sickle red blood cells (sRBCs)
  with altered shape and biomechanics. sRBCs show heightened adhesive interactions
  with inflamed endothelium, triggering painful vascular occlusion events. Numerous
  studies employ microfluidic-assay-based monitoring tools to quantify characteristics
  of adhered sRBCs from high resolution channel images. The current image analysis
  workflow relies on detailed morphological characterization and cell counting by
  a specially trained worker. This is time and labor intensive, and prone to user
  bias artifacts. Here we establish a morphology based classification scheme to identify
  two naturally arising sRBC subpopulations-deformable and non-deformable sRBCs-utilizing
  novel visual markers that link to underlying cell biomechanical properties and hold
  promise for clinically relevant insights. We then set up a standardized, reproducible,
  and fully automated image analysis workflow designed to carry out this classification.
  This relies on a two part deep neural network architecture that works in tandem
  for segmentation of channel images and classification of adhered cells into subtypes.
  Network training utilized an extensive data set of images generated by the SCD BioChip,
  a microfluidic assay which injects clinical whole blood samples into protein-functionalized
  microchannels, mimicking physiological conditions in the microvasculature. Here
  we carried out the assay with the sub-endothelial protein laminin. The machine learning
  approach segmented the resulting channel images with 99.1+-0.3% mean IoU on the
  validation set across 5 k-folds, classified detected sRBCs with 96.0+-0.3% mean
  accuracy on the validation set across 5 k-folds, and matched trained personnel in
  overall characterization of whole channel images with R2 = 0.992, 0.987 and 0.834
  for total, deformable and non-deformable sRBC counts respectively. Average analysis
  time per channel image was also improved by two orders of magnitude (~ 2 minutes
  vs ~ 2-3 hours) over manual characterization. Finally, the network results show
  an order of magnitude less variance in counts on repeat trials than humans. This
  kind of standardization is a prerequisite for the viability of any diagnostic technology,
  making our system suitable for affordable and high throughput disease monitoring.
