input_text: 'Red cell exchange transfusions increase cerebral capillary transit times
  and may alter oxygen extraction in sickle cell disease.Persons with sickle cell
  disease (SCD) suffer from chronic hemolytic anemia, reduced blood oxygen content,
  and lifelong risk of silent and overt stroke. Major conventional stroke risk factors
  are absent in most individuals with SCD, yet nearly 50% have evidence of brain infarcts
  by the age of 30 years, indicating alternative etiologies for ischemia. We investigated
  whether radiological evidence of accelerated blood water transit through capillaries,
  visible on arterial spin labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging, reduces following
  transfusion-induced increases in hemoglobin and relates to oxygen extraction fraction
  (OEF). Neurological evaluation along with anatomical and hemodynamic imaging with
  cerebral blood flow (CBF)-weighted pseudocontinuous ASL and OEF imaging with T2
  -relaxation-under-spin-tagging were applied in sequence before and after blood transfusion
  therapy (n = 32) and in a comparator cohort of nontransfused SCD participants on
  hydroxyurea therapy scanned at two time points to assess stability without interim
  intervention (n = 13). OEF was calculated separately using models derived from human
  hemoglobin-F, hemoglobin-A, and hemoglobin-S. Gray matter CBF and dural sinus signal,
  indicative of rapid blood transit, were evaluated at each time point and compared
  with OEF using paired statistical tests (significance: two-sided p < 0.05). No significant
  change in sinus signal was observed in nontransfused participants (p = 0.650), but
  a reduction was observed in transfused participants (p = 0.034), consistent with
  slower red cell transit following transfusion. The dural sinus signal intensity
  was inversely associated with OEF pretransfusion (p = 0.011), but not posttransfusion.
  Study findings suggest that transfusion-induced increases in total hemoglobin may
  lengthen blood transit times through cerebral capillaries and alter cerebral OEF
  in SCD.'
