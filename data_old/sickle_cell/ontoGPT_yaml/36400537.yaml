input_text: The Development of Neuroimaging Biomarkers for Cognitive Decline in Sickle
  Cell Disease.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is complicated by neurologic complications
  including vasculopathy, hemorrhagic or ischemic overt stroke, silent cerebral infarcts
  and cognitive dysfunction. Patients with SCD, even in the absence of vasculopathy
  or stroke, have experience cognitive dysfunction that progresses with age. Transcranial
  Doppler ultrasound and structural brain MRI are currently used for primary and secondary
  stroke prevention, but laboratory or imaging biomarkers do not currently exist that
  are specific to the risk of cognitive dysfunction in patients with SCD. Recent investigations
  have used advanced MR sequences assessing cerebral hemodynamics, white matter microstructure
  and functional connectivity to better understand the pathophysiology of cognitive
  decline in SCD, with the long-term goal of developing neuroimaging biomarkers to
  be used in risk prediction algorithms and to assess the efficacy of treatment options
  for patients with SCD.
