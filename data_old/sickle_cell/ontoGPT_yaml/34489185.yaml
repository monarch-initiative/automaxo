input_text: Complete neurological recovery from fat embolism syndrome in sickle cell
  disease after sequential red cell exchange transfusion and therapeutic plasma exchange.Fat
  embolism syndrome in sickle cell disease is associated with great mortality, while
  more than half of survivors suffer severe neurological sequelae. Release of fat
  droplets leads to obstruction of the microcirculation as well as generation of proinflammatory
  cytokines that can cause direct tissue injury. Red cell exchange transfusion can
  be life-saving but the addition of therapeutic plasma exchange may further improve
  outcomes by removing such inflammatory mediators. Here, we describe the case of
  a 27-year-old male patient with sickle cell anaemia presenting with typical features
  of fat embolism syndrome including neurological involvement with greatly reduced
  level of consciousness. MRI of his brain showed multiple widespread microhemorrhages
  giving the characteristic "star field" pattern but also a cytotoxic lesion of the
  corpus callosum, known to be the result of direct neurotoxicity by proinflammatory
  cytokines. The patient underwent emergency red cell exchange transfusion leading
  only to modest clinical improvement but fully regained consciousness after three
  cycles of therapeutic plasma exchange. This case highlights the deleterious effect
  of the hyperinflammatory state characteristic of many sickle cell complications
  and supports further exploring the potential benefit from plasma exchange as an
  adjunct to red cell exchange in order to remove proinflammatory cytokines during
  acute complications of sickle cell disease.
