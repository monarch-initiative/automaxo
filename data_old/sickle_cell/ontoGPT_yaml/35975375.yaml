input_text: 'Depression among patient with sickle cell disease: Prevalence and prediction.Background:
  Depression is a widespread disorder with either an independent or interrelated relationship
  with chronic disease. Aim: This study aims to assess depression prevalence and its
  predictors among patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Patients and Methods:
  This is a cross-sectional study conducted in Saudi Arabia where patients with SCD
  assessed for having depression through Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9). Results:
  Depression was evaluated among 88 patients with SCD with a median age of 32.6 +-
  11.8. Out of 88 patients, 44 (50%) participants had some form of depression. Out
  of those with depression, 25 (56.8%) had mild depression and 18 (40.9%) had moderate
  depression. However, there was a significant relationship between depression and
  the number of annual emergency visits, intensive care unit admissions, and frequency
  of blood transfusion (P-value < 0.05). There was no significant relationship between
  depression with neither hemoglobin nor HbS (P-value > 0.05). However, depression
  score found to be inversely proportional to the HbF level. Both gender and annual
  emergency visits were significantly related to depression (P-value = 0.01, 0.001.
  respectively). Conclusion: Depression is quite prevalent in patients with SCD though
  it is still being overlooked. Several clinical and laboratory indices found to be
  closely linked to depression. Constellations of these factors may help early recognition
  of depression and disease severity modulation.'
