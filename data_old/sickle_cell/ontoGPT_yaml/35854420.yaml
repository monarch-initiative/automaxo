input_text: "An Integrative Review: The Evolution of Provider Knowledge, Attitudes,
  Perceptions and Perceived Barriers to Caring for Patients with Sickle Cell Disease
  1970-Now.Approximately 100,000 Americans have sickle cell disease (SCD). In the
  USA, the majority of patients with SCD are of African descent. Due to persistent
  racial and ethnic disparities in healthcare in the USA, patients with SCD experience
  disproportionately more health inequities because of providers' implicit biases
  regarding patient race. Lack of access to health insurance, lack of transportation
  to healthcare providers, and inadequate provider knowledge contribute to the morbidity
  and mortality of patients with SCD. The purpose of this integrative review was to
  analyze and synthesize the literature on providers' knowledge, perceptions, beliefs,
  and attitudes toward patients with SCD. A modified (Preferred Reporting Items for
  Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) method was used to conduct a comprehensive
  review of the literature yielding 31 publications included in this review. Three
  connected, yet distinct areas of focus were identified: (1) providers' knowledge,
  attitudes, and perceptions of patients with SCD; (2) providers' perceived or true
  barriers to caring for patients with SCD; and (3) interventions to improve providers'
  attitudes, perceptions, and care of patients with SCD. In each area of focus, research
  has evolved over time. Also included in this integrative review is a synthesis of
  measurement instruments used to assess provider knowledge, attitudes, perceptions,
  and perceived and true barriers to caring for patients with SCD. Adolescents with
  SCD who are transitioning from pediatric to adult care are at a particularly high
  risk for morbidity and mortality, so this review focused on the many opportunities
  that exist to advance the healthcare for young adults with SCD to improve patient
  outcomes later in life. This includes improving providers' knowledge, perceptions,
  beliefs, and attitudes, and lessening the real or perceived barriers to care for
  patients with SCD."
