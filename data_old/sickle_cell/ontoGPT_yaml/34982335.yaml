  Southwest Nigeria: A Qualitative Study.OBJECTIVES: Preconception care (PCC) is a
  recognised strategy for optimising maternal health and improving maternal and neonatal
  outcomes. PCC services are minimally available and not fully integrated into maternal
  health services in Nigeria. This study explored perceptions about PCC services among
  health care providers in Ibadan, Nigeria. METHODS: Using a qualitative case study
  design the perspectives of 26 health care providers-16 specialist physicians and
  nine nurses covering 10 specialties at the primary, secondary and tertiary health
  care levels was explored. In-depth interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed
  verbatim and analysed on MAXQDA using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Almost all participants
  stated that PCC services should be offered at all three levels of health care with
  referral when needed between lower and higher levels. Participants stated that although
  all people of reproductive age would benefit from PCC, those who had medical problems
  like hypertension, sickle cell disease, diabetes and infertility would benefit more.
  Participants opined that delayed health care seeking observed in the community may
  influence acceptability of PCC especially for people without known pre-existing
  conditions. All specialist physicians identified the relevance of PCC to their practice.
  They identified potential benefits of PCC including opportunity to prepare for pregnancy
  to ensure positive pregnancy outcomes. CONCLUSIONS FOR PRACTICE: Preconception care
  is perceived as important for promoting positive pregnancy outcomes in people with
  known medical problems and is relevant to different specialities of medical practice.
  Provision of the service will require establishment of guidelines and uptake will
  depend on acceptability to community members who will benefit from the service.'
