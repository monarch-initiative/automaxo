input_text: 'Platelet volume parameters as a tool in the evaluation of acute ischemic
  priapism in patients with sickle cell anemia.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate
  the predictive value of platelet volume indices (PVIs), such as mean platelet volume
  (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW), and plateletcrit (PCT), as prognostic
  parameters of detumescence in acute ischemic priapism (IP) patients with sickle
  cell anemia (SCA) in steady-state who received intracavernosal injections of phenylephrine
  with aspiration and saline irrigation. METHODS: Fifty-six SCA patients with acute
  IP and 54 healthy male control subjects were included in the research. Priapism
  was diagnosed by penile Doppler ultrasound and corporal blood gas tests before intervention.
  Measurements of PVIs (MPV, PDW, and PCT) and TLC were ordered for all participants.
  Additionally, the duration of priapism was recorded. The area under the curves was
  calculated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) regression analysis. RESULTS:
  The detumescence rate was 71.4% after the intervention. Compared to the control
  group, priapic SCA patients showed significantly higher PLT (p = 0.011), MPV (p
  = 0.002), PDW (p = 0.032), PCT values (p = 0.022), and TLC (p = 0.027). Higher MPV,
  PDW, and PCT values were observed in unsuccessful detumescence patients compared
  to the resolution group (p < 0.05). Statistically significant cutoff values for
  persistent priapism were measured by ROC as PLT: >= 254x103/muL; MPV: >= 13.2 fL;
  PDW: >= 15.6 fL; PCT: >= 24%; and TLC >= 8.5x103/L. Priapism duration of <= 17.9
  hours was significantly related to detumescence rate (p = 0.000). Multivariable
  logistic regression analysis showed that priapism duration and higher MPV are prognostic
  parameters for detumescence in SCA. CONCLUSIONS: The higher MPV and duration of
  priapism can be used as parameters for evaluating detumescence outcomes in steady-state
  SCA with acute IP.'
