input_text: 'The Evaluation of Invasive Prenatal Diagnostic Tests in North Cyprus:
  A Retrospective Study.BACKGROUND: Congenital diseases are still an important medical,
  social, and economic problem all over the world. In North Cyprus, in addition to
  other reasons, early prenatal diagnostic measures are undertaken to prevent births
  with thalassemia major, a locally widespread genetic disease. AIM: This study aims
  to evaluate the results of prenatal invasive diagnostic tests performed in a private
  obstetrics clinic in Northern Cyprus and show the diagnosis process of thalassemia
  and chromosomal anomalies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is a retrospective,
  descriptive study. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) results and the amniocentesis
  tests performed between 1990 and 2022 are evaluated. Thalassemia and chromosome
  analysis of samples obtained by CVS and amniocentesis tests were performed. To diagnose
  alpha or beta thalassemia and sickle cell, 239 CVS was performed. And to diagnose
  chromosomal anomalies, 396 CVS and amniocentesis were performed. RESULTS: The mean
  age of the 480 pregnant women included in the study was 31.12 years (18-46) and
  30% of them were older than 34 years. The most common indications for invasive prenatal
  diagnostic test (IPDT) were; mother/father thalassemia minor/major, advanced maternal
  age, high risk of ultrasonography erase findings, and the noninvasive screening
  test. The result of IPDT detected 7.3% chromosomal anomaly and 69.5% thalassemia
  and sickle cell anemia. Of the 239 CVS performed to diagnose alpha or beta thalasemia
  and sickle cell, 23.4% beta major, 42.3% beta minor, and 2.1% alpha minor were diagnosed.
  Of the 396 CVS and amniocentesis performed to diagnose chromosomal anormalies; 2.8%
  of Down syndrome and 4.54% of other chromosomal anomalies were diagnosed. CONCLUSION:
  IPDT is important in correctly diagnosing fetal anomalies at the prenatal stage
  to help families decide at the right time.'
