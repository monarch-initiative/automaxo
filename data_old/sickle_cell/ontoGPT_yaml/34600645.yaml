input_text: 'Exploring the Use of Exchange Transfusion in the Surgical Management
  of Priapism in Sickle Cell Disease: A Population-Based Analysis.INTRODUCTION: Priapism
  is a urologic emergency that may require surgical intervention in cases refractory
  to supportive care. Exchange transfusion (ET) has been previously used to manage
  sickle cell disease (SCD), including in priapism; however, its utilization in the
  context of surgical intervention has not been well-established. AIM: To explore
  the utilization of ET, as well as other patient and hospital-level factors, associated
  with surgical intervention for SCD-induced priapism METHODS: Using the National
  Inpatient Sample (2010-2015), males diagnosed with SCD and priapism were stratified
  by need for surgical intervention. Survey-weighted regression models were used to
  analyze the association of ET to surgical intervention. Furthermore, negative binomial
  regression and generalized linear models with logarithmic transformation were used
  to compare ET vs surgery to length of hospital stay (LOS) and total hospital charges,
  respectively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Predictors of surgical intervention among patients
  with SCD-related priapism RESULTS: A weighted total of 8,087 hospitalizations were
  identified, with 1,782 (22%) receiving surgical intervention for priapism, 484 undergoing
  ET (6.0%), and 149 (1.8%) receiving combined therapy of both ET and surgery. On
  multivariable regression, pre-existing Elixhauser comorbidities (e.g. >=2 Elixhauser:
  OR: 2.20; P < 0.001), other forms of insurance (OR: 2.12; P < 0.001), and ET (OR:
  1.99; P = 0.009) had increased odds of undergoing surgical intervention. In contrast,
  Black race (OR: 0.45; P < 0.001) and other co-existing SCD complications (e.g. infectious
  complications OR: 0.52; P < 0.001) reduced such odds. Compared to supportive care
  alone, patients undergoing ET (adjusted IRR: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.10-1.83; P = 0.007)
  or combined therapy (adjusted IRR: 1.42; 95% CI: 111-1.82; P < 0.001) had a longer
  LOS vs. surgery alone (adjusted IRR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.74-0.97; P = 0.017). Patients
  receiving ET (adjusted Ratio: 2.39; 95% CI: 1.52-3.76; P < 0.001) or combined therapy
  (adjusted Ratio: 4.42; 95% CI: 1.67-11.71; P = 0.003) had higher ratio of mean hospital
  charges compared with surgery alone (adjusted Ratio: 1.09; 95% CI: 0.69-1.72; P
  = 0.710). CONCLUSIONS: Numerous factors were associated with the need for surgical
  intervention, including the use of ET. Those receiving ET, as well as those with
  combined therapy, had a longer LOS and increased total hospital charges. Ha AS,
