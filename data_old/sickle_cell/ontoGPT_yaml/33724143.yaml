input_text: 'Assessment of cystatin C in pediatric sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia
  as a marker of subclinical cardiovascular dysfunction: a case-control study.Cardiovascular
  complications represent the main determinant of survival in patients with hemoglobinopathies.
  Serum cystatin C is a well-known marker of nephropathy in sickle cell disease (SCD)
  and beta-thalassemia patients that has recently emerged as a strong predictor of
  cardiovascular dysfunction in patients with and without kidney disease. We performed
  a case control study to determine the role of cystatin C as a predictor of subclinical
  cardiovascular dysfunction in SCD and beta-thalassemia patients. We enrolled 40
  SCD patients with a mean age of 12.4 years, 40 beta-thalassemia patients with a
  mean age of 11.4 years and 40 age and sex-matched controls. We assessed hematological
  profile, serum ferritin, urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR), serum cystatin
  C, echocardiography and carotid intima media thickness (CIMT). UACR, cystatin C
  and CIMT were higher in SCD and beta-thalassemia patients compared to controls (p
  < .001). Significantly higher cystatin C levels were observed in SCD and beta-thalassemia
  patients with nephropathy or left ventricular systolic dysfunction (shortening fraction
  <30%, or ejection fraction <55%; p < .001). Moreover, SCD patients with pulmonary
  hypertension had significantly higher cystatin C levels. Cystatin C levels were
  positively correlated with CIMT in SCD (p = .02) and beta-thalassemia patients (p
  < .001) while negatively correlated with ejection fraction and shortening fraction
  (p < .001). The cutoff values of cystatin C >= 16.03 and >= 13.2 (ng/mL) could detect
  subclinical cardiac dysfunction risk among SCD and beta-thalassemia patients respectively.
  Cystatin C appears to be a promising marker for subclinical cardiovascular dysfunction
  in SCD and beta-thalassemia patients.'
