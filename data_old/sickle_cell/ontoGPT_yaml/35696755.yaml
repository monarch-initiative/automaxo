input_text: "The association between sleep disturbances and neurocognitive function
  in pediatric sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Youth with sickle cell
  disease (SCD) without neurological complications continue to be at increased risk
  of neurocognitive difficulties. Nocturnal hypoxemia is associated with neurocognitive
  outcomes and has been identified as a chronic complication in youth with SCD. The
  objective of this study was to assess the relationship between sleep disturbances
  and neurocognitive functioning in youth with SCD, while taking into account demographic
  and socioeconomic factors. METHODS: Youth with SCD were identified through retrospective
  chart review who underwent a standardized polysomnography (PSG) and completed a
  neuropsychological testing battery to assess cognitive skills, including verbal
  comprehension, working memory, processing speed, and cognitive flexibility. Questionnaires
  were also collected to assess parent-reported concerns with their youth's executive
  and adaptive skills. RESULTS: Twenty-seven youth with SCD, ages 6-17, were identified
  who completed both a PSG and neuropsychological testing. Results demonstrated that
  verbal comprehension decreased by 2.37 standard points for every unit decrease in
  mean nocturnal oxygen saturation (SpO2) (p = 0.031). Working memory was also found
  to decrease by 1.46 standard points for each 1% increase in time spent under 90%
  oxygen saturation (pTST SpO2 < 90%) (p = 0.030). Sleep parameters did not significantly
  predict other cognitive scores or parent-reported executive or behavioral ratings.
  CONCLUSION: Our study found that sleep disturbance, mean nocturnal SpO2 and pTST
  SpO2 < 90%, significantly affected verbal comprehension and working memory performance,
  respectively. Overall, these findings have the potential to identify sleep needs
  in youth with SCD to promote sleep-targeted interventions as a modifiable factor
  to reduce neurocognitive deficits."
