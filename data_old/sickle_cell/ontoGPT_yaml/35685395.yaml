input_text: '[Realities for a Sickle Cell Disease Control Strategy in the World Health
  Organization African Region]. The Network for the Study of Sickle Cell Disease in
  Central Africa or REDAC, is a network of African, European and American researchers
  whose aim is to combat sickle cell disease. Its congresses take place every year
  in the partner countries with international symposia alternating with workshops.
  REDAC enables host countries to obtain from local authorities a real involvement
  in the fight through resolutions in line with national strategies of fight. The
  Seventh International Symposium of REDAC was held in 2018 in Antananarivo, Madagascar
  under the auspices of the Malagasy Minister of Health and the Malagasy Senate Authorities.
  The theme chosen was that of strategies to combat sickle cell disease recommended
  by the WHO. The presentations focused on neonatal screening, early diagnosis, management
  of sickle cell disease and new therapies (marrow transplant, gene therapy and treatment
  with hydroxyurea).'
