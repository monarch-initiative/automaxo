input_text: 'Sickle cell disease and pregnancy profile of complicated malaria in 982
  pregnancies in Kinshasa.INTRODUCTION: Malaria is associated with high morbidity
  during pregnancy. Homozygous sickle cell pregnant women are even more exposed during
  complicated malaria. The objective of the study was to evaluate the maternal and
  fetal morbidity of homozygous sickle cell pregnant pregnant women with complicated
  malaria. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case-control study of 982 pregnancies
  in sickle cell pregnant women, during which a group of sickle cell pregnant women
  who received antimalarial chemoprophylaxis was compared to another group without
  chemoprophylaxis. We analyzed the clinical evolution of pregnant women (VOCs and
  transfusions, pregnancy weight gain) and parasite (parasite density at the time
  of diagnosis of complicated malaria and during treatment for three days). We analyzed
  the parameters of newborns at birth (age of pregnancy at the time of delivery, birth
  weight, weight of the placenta and histopathological examination of the placenta.
  RESULTS: Out of 982 pregnancies, 15% of pregnant women suffered from complicated
  malaria, 57% suffered from uncomplicated malaria and 28% did not suffer from malaria.
  Pregnancy weight gain, birth weight, was better in the group of pregnant women who
  received chemoprophylaxis and the placenta had less histological lesions. Parasite
  density was low. There was a significant positive correlation between parasite density
  and the number of CVOs and transfusions and between parasite density and histological
  lesions of the placenta and low birth weight. CONCLUSION: Complicated malaria is
  associated with high maternal and fetal morbidity in sickle cell patients. Malaria
  chemoprophylaxis can reduce maternal and fetal complications and parasite density
  during malaria infection.'
