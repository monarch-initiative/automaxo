input_text: 'Do racial and ethnic disparities lead to the undertreatment of pain?
  Are there solutions?PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The current review aims to empower anesthesiologists,
  specifically pain medicine specialists, to become leaders in ensuring equitable
  care. RECENT FINDINGS: Disparities in both acute and chronic pain medicine lead
  to increased morbidity for patients of color. Gaps in care include misdiagnosis
  or under diagnosis of chronic pain disease states, undertreatment of sickle cell
  disease and other conditions that are common in minorities, under prescription of
  opioids, and lack of access to novel opioid sparing treatments. While the causes
  of these disparities are multifactorial, care team implicit bias and lack of representation
  are two of the major factors. Solutions are challenging, but the authors suggest
  an inside out solution. We believe that this practice will have far-reaching downstream
  effects, including improving diversity in our field and quality of care for our
  patients. SUMMARY: The current article reviews disparities in both acute and chronic
  pain treatment for underrepresented racial and ethnic minorities in the United States.
  The authors examine whether implicit bias and lack of representation are a contributing
  factor for these disparities. Lastly, we will discuss potential solutions.'
