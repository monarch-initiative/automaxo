input_text: 'Evaluation of cardiac fibrosis and subclinical cardiac changes in children
  with sickle cell disease using magnetic resonance imaging, echocardiography, and
  serum galectin-3.BACKGROUND: Myocardial fibrosis has recently been proposed as one
  of the contributing factors to the diverse pathogenicity of cardiomyopathy in sickle
  cell disease. OBJECTIVE: In this study, cardiac fibrosis and subclinical cardiac
  changes in children with sickle cell disease were evaluated using cardiac magnetic
  resonance imaging (MRI), tissue Doppler echocardiography and serum galectin-3. MATERIALS
  AND METHODS: The study included 34 children with sickle cell disease who were compared
  with a similar number of healthy controls. Cardiac MRI was used to evaluate late
  gadolinium enhancement, native T1 mapping, extracellular volume, and T2* for estimation
  of iron load. Cardiac function and myocardial performance index (MPI, evaluated
  by tissue Doppler echocardiography) and serum galectin-3 were compared to controls.
  RESULTS: The mean age of the included patients was 13.3 +- 3.2 years. Myocardial
  iron load by T2* was normal. The mean level of extracellular volume (35.41 +- 5.02%)
  was significantly associated with the frequency of vaso-occlusive crises (P = 0.017)
  and negatively correlated with hemoglobin levels (P = 0.005). Galectin-3 levels
  were significantly higher among cases than controls (P = 0.00), at a cutoff value
  on the receiver operating characteristic curve of 6.5 ng/ml, sensitivity of 82.5%
  and specificity of 72.8%. The extracellular volume was significantly higher in cases,
  with a MPI > 0.4. CONCLUSION: Diffuse interstitial myocardial fibrosis can be detected
  early in children with sickle cell disease using T1 mapping and is associated with
  a high frequency of vaso-occlusive crisis. MPI of the left ventricle and serum galectin-3
  are recommended screening tools for subclinical cardiac abnormalities.'
