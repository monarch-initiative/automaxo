input_text: 'Correctly Establishing and Interpreting Oxygenation Status in Sickle
  Cell Disease.BACKGROUND: As hypoxemia and hypoxia are central elements of disease
  pathophysiology and disease-related morbidity and mortality in individuals affected
  by sickle cell disease (SCD), clinical management aims to optimize oxygenation.
  CONTENT: Hypoxemia is primarily screened for with pulse oximetry. However, in SCD
  pulse oximetry can inaccurately reflect arterial saturation, posing the risk of
  undetected (occult) hypoxemia. Solely relying on pulse oximetry might therefore
  lead to misdiagnosis or mismanagement, with devastating effects on tissue oxygenation.
  The interpretation of oxygenation status is multifaceted, and "oxygen saturation"
  is often used as an umbrella term to refer to distinctly different measured quantities-estimated
  oxygen saturation (O2Sat), hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SO2) by either pulse oximetry
  or co-oximetry, and fractional oxyhemoglobin (FO2Hb). While in many clinical situations
  this ambiguous use is of little consequence, O2Sat, SO2, and FO2Hb cannot be used
  interchangeably in the setting of SCD, as dyshemoglobins, anemia, cardiopulmonary
  comorbidities, concomitant medications, and frequent transfusions need to be accounted
  for. This article describes the parameters that determine blood and tissue oxygen
  concentration, discusses laboratory method performance characteristics and the correct
  interpretation of currently available clinical laboratory testing, and reviews the
  literature on noninvasive vs invasive oxygenation measurements in SCD. SUMMARY:
  By correctly establishing and interpreting oxygenation parameters, clinical and
  laboratory teams can ensure high-quality, equitable healthcare, counteracting systemic
  exacerbations of health disparities frequently experienced by individuals with SCD.'
