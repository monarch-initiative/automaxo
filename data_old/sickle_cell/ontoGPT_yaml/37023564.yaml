input_text: "Cognitive-motor dual-task interference in adults with sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND:
  Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder that causes physical and cognitive
  impairment due to hemolysis, painful vaso-occlusion episodes, joint avascular necrosis,
  and strokes. As individuals with SCD age and develop conditions impacting their
  physical and cognitive function, their ability to multitask successfully and safely
  may decline. Cognitive-motor dual-task interference occurs when there is deterioration
  in one or both tasks while dual-tasking relative to single-tasking. Dual-task assessment
  (DTA) is a valuable measure of physical and cognitive function; however, there is
  limited data on DTA in adults with SCD. RESEARCH QUESTION: Is DTA a feasible and
  safe method of measuring physical and cognitive function in adults with SCD? What
  patterns of cognitive-motor interference occur in adults with SCD? METHODS: We enrolled
  40 adults with SCD (mean age 44 years, range 20-71) in a single-center prospective
  cohort study. We used usual gait speed as the measure of motor performance and verbal
  fluency (F, A, and S) as the measure of cognitive performance. We measured feasibility
  as the proportion of consented participants able to complete the DTA. We calculated
  the relative dual-task effect (DTE %) for each task and identified patterns of dual-task
  interference. RESULTS: Most consented participants completed the DTA (91%, 40/44)
  and there were no adverse events. There were 3 main dual-task interference patterns
  for the first trial using letter 'A': Motor Interference (53%, n = 21), Mutual Interference
  (23%, n = 9), and Cognitive-Priority Tradeoff (15%, n = 6). For the second trial
  using letter 'S', there were two main dual-task interference patterns: Cognitive-Priority
  Tradeoff (53%, n = 21) and Motor Interference (25%, n = 10). STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE:
  DTA was feasible and safe in adults with SCD. We identified specific patterns of
  cognitive-motor interference. This study supports further evaluation of DTA as a
  potentially useful tool to measure physical and cognitive function in ambulatory
  adults with SCD."
