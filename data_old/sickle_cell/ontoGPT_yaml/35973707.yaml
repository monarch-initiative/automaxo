input_text: 'Inpatient palliative care use by patients with sickle cell disease: a
  retrospective cross-sectional study.OBJECTIVE: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a highly
  morbid condition notable for recurrent hospitalisations due to vaso-occlusive crises
  and complications of end organ damage. Little is known about the use of inpatient
  palliative care services in adult patients with SCD. This study aims to evaluate
  inpatient palliative care use during SCD-related hospitalisations overall and during
  terminal hospitalisations. We hypothesise that use of palliative care is low in
  SCD hospitalisations. DESIGN: A retrospective cross-sectional study using data from
  the National Inpatient Sample from 2008 to 2017 was conducted. SETTING: US hospitals
  from 47 states and the District of Columbia. PARTICIPANTS: Patients >18 years old
  hospitalised with a primary or secondary International Classification of Diseases,
  Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) or ICD-10-CM diagnosis of SCD were
  included. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Palliative care service use (documented
  by ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes V66.7 and Z51.5). RESULTS: 987 555 SCD-related
  hospitalisations were identified, of which 4442 (0.45%) received palliative care
  service. Palliative care service use increased at a rate of 9.2% per year (95% CI
  5.6 to 12.9). NH-black and Hispanic patients were 33% and 53% less likely to have
  palliative care services compared with NH-white patients (OR 0.67; 95% CI 0.45 to
  0.99 and OR 0.47; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.84). Female patients (OR 0.40; 95% CI 0.21 to
  0.76), Medicaid use (OR 0.40; 95% CI 0.21 to 0.78), rural (OR 0.47; 95% CI 0.28
  to 0.79) and urban non-teaching hospitals (OR 0.61; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.80) each had
  a lower likelihood of palliative care services use. CONCLUSION: Use of palliative
  care during SCD-related hospitalisations is increasing but remains low. Disparities
  associated with race and gender exist for use of palliative care services during
  SCD-related hospitalisation. Further studies are needed to guide evidence-based
  palliative care interventions for more comprehensive and equitable care of adult
  patients with SCD.'
