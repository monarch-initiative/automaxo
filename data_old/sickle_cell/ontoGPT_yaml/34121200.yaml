input_text: 'Antigen matching for transfusion support in Brazilian female patients
  with sickle cell disease to reduce RBC alloimmunization.BACKGROUND: Red blood cell
  (RBC) alloimmunization is a complication of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD)
  and it has a greater impact on pregnancy, leading to a risk of hemolytic disease
  of the newborn and reducing blood availability for pregnant women. This study proposed
  to evaluate antigen matching transfusion protocols, aiming to reduce RBC alloimmunization
  in Brazilian female patients with SCD. METHODS: Samples from female patients with
  SCD (153) and self-declared Afro-Brazilian donors (307) were genotyped for RBC antigens
  and RH variants were investigated. The transfusion needs of patients during 1-year
  period and the number of compatible donors were assessed using three antigen-matching
  transfusion protocols: prophylactic CEK antigen-matched RBCs, prophylactic extended
  antigen-matched RBCs, and extended-matched red blood cells (RBCs) only for alloimmunized
  patients. In addition, RH molecular matching has been proposed for patients carrying
  variant RHCE. RESULTS: Provision of CEK antigen-matched donors would have been possible
  in 92.4% of transfusion events while provision of prophylactic extended antigen-matched
  RBCs would cover 88.7% of the transfusion events. Extended antigen matching for
  alloimmunized patients would be efficient in 99% of the cases. The presence of partial
  D in 10 patients increased the need of D-negative donors. Compatible donors could
  be enough for four of the five patients with altered RHCE genotypes in both alleles.
  CONCLUSION: In Brazilians, screening African descent donors allows the implementation
  of prophylactic CEK and extended antigen-matching transfusion protocols to female
  patients with SCD to reduce RBC alloimmunization; however, the supply of compatible
  blood can be impaired for patients with Rh variants.'
