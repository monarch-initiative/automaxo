input_text: Modulation of blood pressure regulatory genes in the Agtrap-Plod1 locus
  associated with a deletion in Clcn6.The AGTRAP-PLOD1 locus is a conserved gene cluster
  containing several blood pressure regulatory genes, including CLCN6, MTHFR, NPPA,
  and NPPB. Previous work revealed that knockout of Clcn6 on the Dahl Salt-Sensitive
  (SS) rat background (SS-Clcn6) resulted in lower diastolic blood pressure compared
  to SS-WT rats. Additionally, a recent study found sickle cell anemia patients with
  mutations in CLCN6 had improved survival and reduced stroke risk. We investigated
  whether loss of Clcn6 would delay the mortality of Dahl SS rats on an 8% NaCl (HS)
  diet. No significant difference in survival was found. The ability of Clcn6 to affect
  mRNA expression of nearby Mthfr, Nppa, and Nppb genes was also tested. On normal
  salt (0.4% NaCl, NS) diets, renal Mthfr mRNA and protein expression were significantly
  increased in the SS-Clcn6 rats. MTHFR reduces homocysteine to methionine, but no
  differences in circulating homocysteine levels were detected. Nppa mRNA levels in
  cardiac tissue from SS-Clcn6 rat in both normotensive and hypertensive conditions
  were significantly reduced compared to SS-WT. Nppb mRNA expression in SS-Clcn6 rats
  on a NS diet was also substantially decreased. Heightened Mthfr expression would
  be predicted to be protective; however, diminished Nppa and Nppb expression could
  be deleterious and by preventing or blunting vasodilation, natriuresis, and diuresis
  that ought to normally occur to offset blood pressure increases. The conserved nature
  of this genetic locus in humans and rats suggests more studies are warranted to
  understand how mutations in and around these genes may be influencing the expression
  of their neighbors.
