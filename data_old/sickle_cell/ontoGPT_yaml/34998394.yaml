input_text: 'Cost analysis of acute care resource utilization among individuals with
  sickle cell disease in a middle-income country.BACKGROUND: The costs associated
  with the treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD) are understudied in low and middle-income
  countries (LMIC). We evaluated the cost of treating SCD-related acute complications
  and the potential cost-savings of hydroxyurea in a specialized hematology center
  in Brazil. METHODS: The costs (US dollars) of emergency department (ED) and hospitalizations
  from SCD-related complications between 01.01.2018 and 06.30.2018 were ascertained
  using absorption and micro-costing approaches. The reasons for acute hospital visits
  were grouped as: 1) vaso-occlusive (VOC) pain, 2) infection, 3) anemia exacerbation,
  and 4) chronic organ damage complications. Hydroxyurea adherence was estimated by
  medication possession ratio (MPR) during the study period. RESULTS: In total, 1144
  patients, median age 17 years (range 0-70), 903 (78.9%) with HbSS/HbSbeta0-thalassemia,
  441 (38.5%) prescribed hydroxyurea, visited the ED, of whom 381 (33%) were admitted.
  VOC accounted for 64% of all ED visits and 60% of all admissions. Anemia exacerbation
  was the most expensive reason for ED visit ($321.87/visit), while chronic organ
  damage carried the highest admission cost ($2176.40/visit). Compared with other
  genotypes, individuals with HbSS/HbSbeta0-thalassemia were admitted more often (79%
  versus 21%, p < 0.0001), and their admission costs were higher ($1677.18 versus
  $1224.47/visit, p = 0.0001). Antibiotics and analgesics accounted for 43% and 42%
  of the total ED costs, respectively, while housing accounted for 46% of the total
  admission costs. Costs of ED visits not resulting in admissions were lower among
  HbSS/HbSbeta0-thalassemia individuals with hydroxyurea MPR >=65% compared with visits
  by patients with MPR <65% ($98.16/visit versus $182.46/visit, p = 0.0007). No difference
  in admission costs were observed relative to hydroxyurea use. DISCUSSION: In a LMIC
  hematology-specialized center, VOCs accounted for most acute visits from patients
  with SCD, but costs were highest due to anemia exacerbation. Analgesics, antibiotics,
  and housing drove most expenses. Hydroxyurea may reduce ED costs among individuals
  with HbSS/HbSbeta0-thalassemia but is dependent on adherence level.'
