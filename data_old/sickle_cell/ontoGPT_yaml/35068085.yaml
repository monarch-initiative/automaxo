input_text: "Benefit of pulmonary subspecialty care for children with sickle cell
  disease and asthma.OBJECTIVE: Asthma is a recognized comorbidity in children with
  sickle cell disease (SCD). It increases the risk of acute chest syndrome (ACS),
  vaso-occlusive episodes, and early mortality. We aim to determine whether evaluation
  and management of children with SCD and asthma by a pulmonologist reduce rate of
  asthma exacerbation and ACS. METHODS: The study included 192 patients with SCD (0-21
  years) followed at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Hematology between January
  1, 2015, and December 31, 2018, with a diagnosis of asthma, wheeze, or cough. Patients
  were placed in two groups: those evaluated by a pulmonologist (SCD-A-P) and those
  not (SCD-A). Rates of emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations for
  asthma exacerbation and ACS were compared between groups and over time. RESULTS:
  SCD-A-P patients (n = 70) were predominantly SCD type SS with lower hemoglobin and
  hematocrit compared to SCD-A patients (n = 122). SCD-A-P started with a higher average
  rate of hospital visits for asthma exacerbation and ACS per year (2.69 [1.02-4.37])
  compared to SCD-A (0.43 [0.24-0.63]), (p < 0.001). For SCD-A-P patients with at
  least one hospital visit (n = 48), the average rate decreased from 3.93 (1.57-6.29)
  to 0.85 (0.48-1.23) following pulmonary consultation (p = 0.014) and was comparable
  to the SCD-A rate by study end. CONCLUSION: SCD-A-P was mainly SCD type SS and had
  higher ED/hospitalization rates for asthma exacerbation and ACS compared to SCD-A,
  but the rates significantly decreased following pulmonology consultation. These
  findings support the pulmonologist's role in the multidisciplinary care of SCD patients
  and highlight the need for evidence-based asthma guidelines for children with SCD."
