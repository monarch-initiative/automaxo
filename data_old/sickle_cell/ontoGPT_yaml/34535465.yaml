input_text: 'HbA1c performs well in monitoring glucose control even in populations
  with high prevalence of medical conditions that may alter its reliability: the OPTIMAL
  observational multicenter study.INTRODUCTION: The utility of HbA1c (glycosylated
  hemoglobin) to estimate glycemic control in populations of African and other low-resource
  countries has been questioned because of high prevalence of other medical conditions
  that may affect its reliability. Using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), we aimed
  to determine the comparative performance of HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG)
  (within 5 hours of a meal) and random non-fasting glucose (RPG) in assessing glycemic
  burden. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We assessed the performance of HbA1c, FPG and
  RPG in comparison to CGM mean glucose in 192 Ugandan participants with type 2 diabetes.
  Analysis was undertaken in all participants, and in subgroups with and without medical
  conditions reported to affect HbA1c reliability. We then assessed the performance
  of FPG and RPG, and optimal thresholds, in comparison to HbA1c in participants without
  medical conditions thought to alter HbA1c reliability. RESULTS: 32.8% (63/192) of
  participants had medical conditions that may affect HbA1c reliability: anemia 9.4%
  (18/192), sickle cell trait and/or hemoglobin C (HbC) 22.4% (43/192), or renal impairment
  6.3% (12/192). Despite high prevalence of medical conditions thought to affect HbA1c
  reliability, HbA1c had the strongest correlation with CGM measured glucose in day-to-day
  living (0.88, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.91), followed by FPG (0.82, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.86)
  and RPG (0.76, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.81). Among participants without conditions thought
  to affect HbA1c reliability, FPG and RPG had a similar diagnostic performance in
  identifying poor glycemic control defined by a range of HbA1c thresholds. FPG of
  >=7.1 mmol/L and RPG of >=10.5 mmol/L correctly identified 78.2% and 78.8%, respectively,
  of patients with an HbA1c of >=7.0%. CONCLUSIONS: HbA1c is the optimal test for
  monitoring glucose control even in low-income and middle-income countries where
  medical conditions that may alter its reliability are prevalent; FPG and RPG are
  valuable alternatives where HbA1c is not available.'
