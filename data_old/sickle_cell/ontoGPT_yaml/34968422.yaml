input_text: Accurate long-read sequencing allows assembly of the duplicated RHD and
  RHCE genes harboring variants relevant to blood transfusion.Next-generation sequencing
  (NGS) technologies have transformed medical genetics. However, short-read lengths
  pose a limitation on identification of structural variants, sequencing repetitive
  regions, phasing of distant nucleotide changes, and distinguishing highly homologous
  genomic regions. Long-read sequencing technologies may offer improvements in the
  characterization of genes that are currently difficult to assess. We used a combination
  of targeted DNA capture, long-read sequencing, and a customized bioinformatics pipeline
  to fully assemble the RH region, which harbors variation relevant to red cell donor-recipient
  mismatch, particularly among patients with sickle cell disease. RHD and RHCE are
  a pair of duplicated genes located within an ~175 kb region on human chromosome
  1 that have high sequence similarity and frequent structural variations. To achieve
  the assembly, we utilized palindrome repeats in PacBio SMRT reads to obtain consensus
  sequences of 2.1 to 2.9 kb average length with over 99% accuracy. We used these
  long consensus sequences to identify 771 assembly markers and to phase the RHD-RHCE
  region with high confidence. The dataset enabled direct linkage between coding and
  intronic variants, phasing of distant SNPs to determine RHD-RHCE haplotypes, and
  identification of known and novel structural variations along with the breakpoints.
  A limiting factor in phasing is the frequency of heterozygous assembly markers and
  therefore was most successful in samples from African Black individuals with increased
  heterogeneity at the RH locus. Overall, this approach allows RH genotyping and de
  novo assembly in an unbiased and comprehensive manner that is necessary to expand
  application of NGS technology to high-resolution RH typing.
