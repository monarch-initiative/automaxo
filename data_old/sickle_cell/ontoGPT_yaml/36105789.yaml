input_text: "The Impact of Optical Coherence Tomography in the Early Identification
  of Children with Sickle Cell Retinopathy.Introduction: Sickle cell disease is characterized
  by the production of abnormal hemoglobin, which affects hemoglobin molecule stability
  during hypoxia and leads to the formation of sickle cells, resulting in increased
  hematic viscosity, hemolysis, and microvascular blockage. Vasoocclusion is assumed
  to be the primary cause of vision-threatening retinopathy in sickle cell disease.
  The aim of this study was to improve the early detection of sickle cell retinopathy
  (SCR) in children with sickle cell disease (SCD) and investigate the link between
  systemic and ocular symptoms. Methods: This cross-sectional study comprised children
  with SCD. The patient files provided a detailed medical history. The laboratory
  tests included a blood count, reticulocyte count, and Hb electrophoresis. The slit
  lamp, fundus, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and optical coherence tomography
  angiography (OCTA) were all part of the ophthalmological examination. Results: The
  study comprised 15 children with sickle cell disease who met the inclusion and exclusion
  criteria, with a mean age of 11.15 +- 1.29 years. Nine of the children were males
  (60%) and six were females (40%). 8 (53.3%) of the children had Hb SS, three (20%)
  had Hb SC, three (20%) had Hb SB+, and one (6.7%) had Hb SB0. Four children (26.7%)
  had poor visual acuity. A fundus examination revealed significant abnormal findings
  in 12 of the 7 children's eyes (40 percent). Macular thinning was detected by OCT
  in 10 eyes of 7 children (33.3%). Flow voids at the deep retinal capillary plexus
  were detected by OCTA in 10 eyes of 7 children (33.3%). Longer disease duration,
  higher reticulocytic percent, more painful crises, and noncompliance with hydroxyurea
  medication were all linked to the existence of eye abnormalities on fundus examination
  and OCT. Conclusion: OCTA can show early retinal damage in sickle cell patients
  with macular changes. Sickle cell retinopathy is usually associated with more severe
  disease."
