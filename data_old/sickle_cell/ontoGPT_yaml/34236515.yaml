input_text: 'Hidden brain iron content in sickle cell disease: impact on neurocognitive
  functions.Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at a high risk for neurocognitive
  impairment. We aim to quantitatively measure cerebral tissue R2* to investigate
  the brain iron deposition in children and young adults with SCD in comparison to
  beta thalassemia major (BTM) and healthy controls and evaluate its impact on neurocognitive
  functions in patients with SCD. Thirty-two SCD, fifteen BTM, and eleven controls
  were recruited. Multi-echo fast-gradient echo sequence brain MRI was performed,
  and brain R2* values of both caudate and thalamic regions were calculated. SCD patients
  were examined for the neurocognitive functions. SCD had high iron overload 0.30
  +- 0.12 mg/kg/day. 68.9% of SCD had under-threshold IQ, 12.5% had moderate to severe
  anxiety, and 60.8% had depression. There were no differences between SCD, BTM, and
  controls in brain MRI except that left thalamus R2* higher in BTM than both SCD
  and controls (p = 0.032). Mean right caudate R2* was higher in female than male
  (p = 0.044). No significant association between brain R2* and LIC or heart R2* values
  in SCD. Left caudate R2* directly correlate with age and HbS%, and negatively correlate
  with HbA% while right thalamus R2* negatively correlate with transfusion index and
  among SCD patients.Conclusion: Neurocognitive dysfunction in SCD could not be explained
  solely by brain iron overload. What is Known:   Children with sickle cell disease
  are at great risk of brain damage due to their irregularly shaped red blood cells
  that can interrupt blood flow to the brain.   There are a number of factors that
  have negative brain effects that result in learning difficulties, and this not only
  due to increase brain iron content. What is New:   Assessment of quantitative brain
  iron content using MRI R2* in children and young adults with SCD in comparison to
  beta thalassemia major and healthy controls.   Impact of brain iron content on neurocognitive
  functions of children and young adults with SCD.'
