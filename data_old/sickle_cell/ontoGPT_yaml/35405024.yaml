input_text: 'DNA testing for sickle cell anemia in Africa: Implementation choices
  for the Democratic Republic of Congo.BACKGROUND: Hemoglobin-based tests form the
  reference diagnostic test for SCA. In limited resource countries, these tests face
  limitations including cost, low sensitivity due to recurrent transfusions in endemic
  malaria region, and interference from fetal hemoglobin in neonatal diagnostic. This
  study aimed at adapting DNA-based SCA tests to limited resource countries and evaluating
  the economic benefit. METHODS: 338 participants were recruited in the Democratic
  Republic of Congo, sorted in 3 cohorts based on venous blood, umbilical cord blood
  (UCB) and buccal swab sampling. RFLP was performed to identify mutated allele. The
  feasibility and technical validity of this RFLP was evaluated for specimens collected
  on DBS cards and on EDTA tubes. RFLP on DBS stored at room temperature was regularly
  repeated to assess sample conservation. Finally, the cost analysis was performed.
  RESULTS: DBS cards yielded identical results to extracted DNA. Repeated testing
  returned the same result after four years. The DBS-based test performed on UCB or
  on buccal swab had a sensitivity and a precision of 100%. Cost comparison indicated
  that our approach costs half price of the widely used isoelectrofocussing of hemoglobin.
  CONCLUSION: The implemented DNA-based test approach overcomes the limitations faced
  by hemoglobin-based tests, while being more affordable. We propose to implement
  the RFLP test as a first line diagnostic test after transfusion and as second tiers
  for newborn screening. However, users should be aware that this test is unable to
  differentiate HbC from HbS or identify other point mutation of gene deletion of
  HBB gene.'
