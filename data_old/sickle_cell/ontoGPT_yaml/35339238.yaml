input_text: 'Considerations When Aggregating Data to Measure Performance Across Levels
  of the Health Care System.BACKGROUND: Measuring quality at varying levels of the
  health care system requires attribution, a process of determining the patients and
  services for which each level is responsible. However, it is important to ensure
  that attribution approaches are equitable; otherwise, individuals may be assigned
  differentially based upon social determinants of health. METHODS: First, we used
  Medicaid claims (2010-2018) from Michigan to assess the proportion of children with
  sickle cell anemia who had less than 12 months enrollment within a single Medicaid
  health plan and could therefore not be attributed to a specific health plan. Second,
  we used the Medicaid Analytic eXtract data (2008-2009) from 26 states to simulate
  adapting the 30-Day Pediatric All-Condition Readmission measure to the Accountable
  Care Organization (ACO) level and examined the proportion of readmissions that could
  not be attributed. RESULTS: For the sickle cell measure, an average of 300 children
  with sickle cell anemia were enrolled in Michigan Medicaid each year. The proportion
  of children that could not be attributed to a Medicaid health plan ranged from 12.2%
  to 89.0% across years. For the readmissions measure, of the 1,051,365 index admissions,
  22% were excluded in the ACO-level analysis because of being unable to attribute
  the patient to a health plan for the 30 days post discharge. CONCLUSIONS: When applying
  attribution models, it is essential to consider the potential to induce health disparities.
  Differential attribution may have unintentional consequences that deepen health
  disparities, particularly when considering incentive programs for health plans to
  improve the quality of care.'

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
  object: <A sign or symptom associated with the disease and targeted by the medical action. For example, Low serum calcitriol, hypoplasia of the thymus, chronic cough, aortic stiffness, low pulse pressure>
  qualifier: <The primary disease the relationship is about, or specifically the disease the symptom is related to. For example, Beck-Fahrner syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, progeria, diabetes mellitus, infectious otitis media>
  subject_qualifier: <An optional qualifier or modifier for the subject of the statement, e.g. "high dose" or "intravenously administered">
