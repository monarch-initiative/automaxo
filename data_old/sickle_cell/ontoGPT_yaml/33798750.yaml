input_text: Fluorescence spectroscopy as a novel technique for premarital screening
  of sickle cell disorders.Spectral diagnostic screening for sickle cell disease was
  carried out on volunteer blood samples (N = 100). The samples were subjected to
  different diagnostic methods including conventional complete blood count (CBC),
  hemoglobin electrophoresis (HBE) and spectral diagnosis. For the spectral diagnostic
  method, we discriminated three different characteristic spectral features. In total,
  15 samples were sickle cell trait (SCT), 34 samples were sickle cell disease (SCD),
  and the rest of the samples (N = 51) were normal controls. The spectral discrimination
  of the three different sets of samples was distinguished on the quantification of
  fluorescent biomolecules such as tyrosine, tryptophan, NADH, FAD, and porphyrins.
  The results were compared with the conventional standard CBC and capillary electrophoresis
  findings. The spectral diagnosis method exhibited a sensitivity and specificity
  greater than 90 % for the tested samples. This technique requires only 5 mL blood
  samples, has an analysis time of 20 min, exhibits high accuracy and may be used
  in small clinics in remote villages.
