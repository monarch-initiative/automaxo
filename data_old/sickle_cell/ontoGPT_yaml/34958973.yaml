input_text: Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor Is Safe and Well Tolerated following
  Allogeneic Transplantation in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease.Granulocyte colony-stimulating
  factor (G-CSF) used after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can enhance
  neutrophil recovery in patients rendered neutropenic by the preparative regimen.
  G-CSF is contraindicated in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), because life-threatening
  complications can ensue in the presence of sickle vasculopathy. The safety profile
  of G-CSF after HSCT for SCD has not been described, however. We report clinical
  outcomes in the first 100 days post-HSCT in 62 patients supported with G-CSF until
  neutrophil recovery on a clinical trial of reduced- intensity conditioning HSCT
  for SCD. The patients received G-CSF for a median of 9 days (range, 5 to 33 days)
  post-transplantation from the best available stem cell source. Preparation for transplantation
  included a target hemoglobin S level of <=45%. Neutrophil engraftment (absolute
  neutrophil count >0.5 x 103/mL) was achieved at a median of 13 days (range, 10 to
  34 days), and platelet engraftment (>50 x 103/mL) was achieved at a median of 19
  days (range, 12 to 71 days). The median duration of inpatient hospitalization following
  stem cell infusion (day 0) was 21.5 days (range, 11 to 33 days). No patient developed
  SCD-related complications following G-CSF use. The most common organ toxicities
  encountered between G-CSF initiation (on day +7) and day +100 were anorexia (n =
  14), hypertension (n = 11), and electrolyte imbalance requiring correction (n =
  9). Central nervous system-related events were noted in 5 patients, all of whom
  had preexisting cerebral vasculopathy/moyamoya disease, attributed to reversible
  posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome in the presence of calcineurin inhibitor
  therapy and hypertension. We conclude that G-CSF does not adversely impact SCD HSCT
  recipients and can be safely used post-transplantation to enhance neutrophil recovery.
