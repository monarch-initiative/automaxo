input_text: 'Preventing antibody positive delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions
  in sickle cell disease: Lessons learned from a case.INTRODUCTION: Red blood cell
  (RBC) transfusions are important in the management of patients with sickle cell
  disease (SCD). However, a potentially catastrophic complication of transfusion in
  this population is the delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR). The pathophysiology
  of all DHTRs is not understood, but some are known to be caused by an anamnestic
  resurgence of RBC alloantibodies. CASE PRESENTATION: A child with SCD transfused
  for acute chest syndrome re-presented a week after hospital discharge with severe
  anaemia, hemolysis, and a newly detected anti-E. This patient had been previously
  transfused years ago at an outside institution and the anti-E had not been previously
  documented. DISCUSSION: The presented case of an antibody positive DHTR illustrates
  several concepts critical to the prevention of this complication. RBC alloantibodies
  must be detected and this information must be shared. Prophylactic C/c, E/e, K antigen
  matching is helpful for patients with SCD, but systems must be in place to identify
  these patients. Patients transfused at multiple different hospitals are especially
  at risk for this complication and efforts are needed to prevent them from suffering
  a DHTR.'
