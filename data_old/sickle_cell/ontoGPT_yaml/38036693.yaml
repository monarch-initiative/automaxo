input_text: "Total hip replacement among sickle cell patients in a low-income country-Yemen.PURPOSE:
  Sickle cell patients presented with progressive hip pain and limitation of daily
  activities, as evidenced by low preoperative hip scores and failed conservative
  therapy. Management of femoral head avascular necrosis (AVN) using total hip replacement
  (THR) in sickle cell disease (SCD) is widespread in developed countries, but it
  is still in its initiation stage in developing countries. The outcome of using cementless
  THR among SCD patients is still unknown with lack of published studies from regional
  countries. This study aimed to evaluate the outcome of using cementless primary
  THR among patients with sickle cell disease with end-stage hip avascular necrosis
  in Yemen. METHODS: Thirty cementless primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) were performed
  for AVN of the femoral head in 27 sickle cell patients, at Al.-Thawra Modern General
  Hospital-Sana'a, Yemen, from January 2018 to December 2022. RESULTS: The mean age
  of the patients was 27 +- five years (ranged 18-37 years) with a male to female
  ratio was 3:1. Steinberg staging for hip AVN was stage IV, one patient (3%); stage
  VI, thirteen patients (45%); and stage V, sixteen patients (51%). THR was on right
  side 14 (52%), left side 10 (37%), and bilateral 3 (11%). The implant used was ceramic
  on polyethylene acetabular liner. All patients showed improvement in Harris hip
  score from preoperative mean hip score was 25 +- 8 points to postoperative mean
  hip score was 88 +- 6 points at the last follow-up. Mean of the length of stay in
  hospital was 12.7 +- eight days (ranged from 4 to 32 days); the mean operating time
  was 107 +- 23 min. Three cases had superficial wound infection; four patients had
  five intraoperative fractures; two cases had pulmonary complications; one case had
  abdominal crisis. All patients had postoperative leg length discrepancy less than
  2 cm. None had deep infection, nerve injury, wound hematoma, aseptic loosing, dislocation,
  DVT, heterotopic ossification, or death. CONCLUSION: THR in SCD has a good outcome
  using cementless THA with a low rate of complication in Yemen, a developing country."
