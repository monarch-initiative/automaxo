input_text: 'Improving the diagnosis of severe malaria in African children using platelet
  counts and plasma PfHRP2 concentrations.Severe malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum
  is difficult to diagnose accurately in children in high-transmission settings. Using
  data from 2649 pediatric and adult patients enrolled in four studies of severe illness
  in three countries (Bangladesh, Kenya, and Uganda), we fitted Bayesian latent class
  models using two diagnostic markers: the platelet count and the plasma concentration
  of P. falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2). In severely ill patients with
  clinical features consistent with severe malaria, the combination of a platelet
  count of <=150,000/mul and a plasma PfHRP2 concentration of >=1000 ng/ml had an
  estimated sensitivity of 74% and specificity of 93% in identifying severe falciparum
  malaria. Compared with misdiagnosed children, pediatric patients with true severe
  malaria had higher parasite densities, lower hematocrits, lower rates of invasive
  bacterial disease, and a lower prevalence of both sickle cell trait and sickle cell
  anemia. We estimate that one-third of the children enrolled into clinical studies
  of severe malaria in high-transmission settings in Africa had another cause of their
  severe illness.'
