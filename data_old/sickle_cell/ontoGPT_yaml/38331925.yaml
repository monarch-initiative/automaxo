input_text: 'Role of hydroxyurea therapy in the prevention of organ damage in sickle
  cell disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.BACKGROUND: Hydroxyurea is an
  affordable drug that reduces vaso-occlusive crises and transfusion requirements
  in sickle cell disease. However, its effectiveness in preventing chronic organ damage
  is still unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the
  role of hydroxyurea in preventing organ morbidity. METHOD: We included original
  articles published in English from 1st January 1990 to 31st January 2023, reporting
  hydroxyurea therapy and organ damage from PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and CrossRef
  databases. A total of 45 studies with 4681 sickle cell disease patients were evaluated
  for organ damage. RESULTS: Our analysis showed that hydroxyurea intervention significantly
  lowered transcranial Doppler and tricuspid regurgitant velocity, with a standardized
  mean difference of - 1.03 (- 1.49; - 0.58); I 2 = 96% and - 1.37 (CI - 2.31, - 0.42);
  I 2 = 94%, respectively. Moreover, the pooled estimate for albuminuria showed a
  beneficial effect post-hydroxyurea therapy by reducing the risk of albuminuria by
  58% (risk ratio of 0.42 (0.28; 0.63); I 2 = 28%). CONCLUSION: Our study found that
  a hydroxyurea dose above 20 mg/kg/day with a mean rise in HbF by 18.46% post-hydroxyurea
  therapy had a beneficial role in reducing transcranial doppler velocity, tricuspid
  regurgitant velocity, albuminuria, and splenic abnormality. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION:
