input_text: 'Refractory acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in a patient
  with sickle cell trait successfully treated with caplacizumab.Methods: We report
  a case of a 20-year-old Nigerian male who presented with acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic
  purpura (aTTP) and sickle cell trait. The coexistence of published cases of TTP
  and sickle cell hemoglobinopathies is rare.Results: Despite the initial treatment
  with plasma exchange and glucocorticoids, our patient relapsed and also required
  caplacizumab which resulted in successful remission.Discussion: We conclude by reviewing
  the cases of TTP in patients with sickle cell hemoglobinopathies and review how
  vaso-occlusive crises with multiorgan injury can mimic TTP.Conclusion: Ours is the
  first published case of aTTP with confirmed ADAMTS13 autoantibodies in a patient
  with a sickle cell hemoglobinopathy and contributes to the literature on the successful
  use of caplacizumab in clinical practice.'
