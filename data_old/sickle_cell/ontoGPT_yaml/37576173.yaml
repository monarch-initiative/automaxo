input_text: 'Sonographic Evaluation of Maternal Renal Echogenicity in Healthy Pregnant
  Women in the Niger Delta Region of Nigeria.Background: Increased renal echogenicity
  is a nonspecific ultrasound finding. It may be a normal variation or suggestive
  of various underlying conditions like renal amyloidosis, chronic kidney disease,
  sickle cell disease and HIV associated nephropathy (HIVAN). Objective: To study
  maternal renal echogenicity in normal pregnancy, and explore its relationship with
  maternal baseline characteristics in our subregion. Methods: This descriptive, cross-sectional
  study was conducted in the Obstetrics and Radiology Units of the two tertiary health
  facilities, one secondary facility and one radio-diagnostic facility, all in Bayelsa
  State, South-South Nigeria, between March-August 2022. The relationships between
  maternal renal echogenicity and age, parity and gestational age were explored using
  Chi-square test of proportion, while with an analysis of variance (ANOVA), the mean
  difference of age, weight and height between the grades of renal echogenicity was
  investigated. Kruskal Wallis test was deployed to examine parity in the grades of
  renal echogenicity. The level of significance was set at p<0.05. Results: The study
  participants that had Grade 0, 1 and 2 renal echogenicity were 160 (39.7%), 403
  (58.3%) and 8 (2.0%), respectively. There were statistically significant relationships
  between maternal renal echogenicity and maternal age (chi2=36.94; p=0.001), parity
  (chi2=64.29; p=0.001), gestational age (chi2=16.03; p=0.003) and body mass index
  (BMI) (chi2 = 45.15; p - 0.001). Conclusion: Our study revealed a significant relationship
  between maternal renal echogenicity in normal pregnancy and maternal baseline characteristics
  (age, parity, gestational age and weight).'
