input_text: 'Management of acute chest syndrome in patients with sickle cell disease:
  a systematic review of randomized clinical trials.INTRODUCTION: Acute chest syndrome
  (ACS) accounts for the highest mortality in Sickle cell disease patients. Early
  diagnosis and timely management of ACS results in better outcomes. However, the
  effectiveness of most treatment modalities for ACS management has not been established.
  AREAS COVERED: To review the treatment modalities management protocols and highlight
  the effectiveness of each option a literature search was done. Randomized controlled
  trials that assessed the efficacy of different treatment modalities in ACS management
  in SCD patients were chosen and reviewed. EXPERT OPINION: 11 randomized controlled
  trials were found that evaluated the efficacy of incentive spirometry, positive
  expiratory pressure device, intravenous dexamethasone, oral vs. intravenous morphine,
  inhaled nitric oxide, unfractionated heparin, and blood transfusion in the prevention
  or treatment of ACS. Although there are guidelines for ACS treatment, the available
  evidence is very limited to delineating the effectiveness of various interventions
  in ACS management. More high-quality studies and trials with a larger patient population
  can benefit this area to support the recommendations with stronger evidence.'
