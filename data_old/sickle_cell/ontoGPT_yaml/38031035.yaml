input_text: "Cystatin C-derived estimated glomerular filtration rate in children with
  sickle cell anaemia.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease is the most common inherited
  blood disorder in humans and constitutes a major public health burden. It is a multisystemic
  condition with long-term renal complications. Early detection of sickle cell nephropathy
  and initiation of appropriate interventions are associated with improved survival
  and quality of life. This study aimed to compare the cystatin C-derived estimated
  glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of the study groups and also, to correlate the
  clinical features of chronic kidney disease (CKD) with decreased GFR in children
  with sickle cell anaemia (SCA). METHODS: This hospital-based cross-sectional analytic
  study recruited 86 SCA subjects in steady-state and 86 age and sex-matched healthy
  HbAA controls aged 1-14 years who attended the Paediatric Haematology and Outpatient
  clinics of Federal Medical Centre Bida over six months. Data were collected using
  a semi-structured questionnaire, and participants' length/height, weight, and blood
  pressure were measured using standard procedures. Blood samples were drawn for serum
  cystatin C assay via the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique.
  Filler's equation was used to calculate the glomerular filtration rate. RESULTS:
  There was a significant difference in the mean cystatin C-derived GFR between the
  two groups, i.e. 116 +- 30mL/min/1.73m2 vs. 106 +- 24mL/min/1.73m2 for the SCA and
  control groups, respectively (p = 0.017). The prevalence of supernormal GFR (i.e.
  GFR > 140mL/min/1.73m2) and decreased GFR (i.e. GFR < 90mL/min/1.73m2) was 19.8%
  and 22.1%, respectively, in children with SCA. There was no significant association
  between the age at diagnosis of SCA, blood transfusions, blood pressure, packed
  cell volume and presence of peripheral oedema with decreased GFR in the study subjects.
  CONCLUSIONS: Supernormal GFR is common in children with SCA and there is no significant
  association between clinical features of CKD with decreased GFR. Regular evaluation
  of renal function is, however, recommended in children with SCA for early detection
  and treatment of renal complications in order to halt the progression to end-stage
  kidney disease (ESKD)."
