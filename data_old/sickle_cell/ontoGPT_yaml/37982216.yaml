input_text: Silent Cerebral Infarcts in Iraqi Patients with Sickle Cell Disease.Silent
  ischemic infarcts have been reported to be the most frequent neurological abnormalities
  in sickle cell disease (SCD) in several studies worldwide. However, no previous
  studies investigated this neurological disorder in Iraqi SCD patients. To address
  this issue, a total of 52 patients with a median age of 20 years (range 10-46) and
  including 46.2% males were enrolled. Patients were clinically evaluated and their
  records were reviewed. They had full blood and reticulocyte counts, hemoglobin F
  estimation, serum lactic dehydrogenase and bilirubin assayed, as well as brain magnetic
  resonance imaging (MRI) to screen for silent cerebral infarcts. Six out of the 52
  patients (11.5%) had silent cerebral infarcts, all of which were in the deep white
  matter, ranging from 6 to 10 mm in their largest diameters. There were no significant
  differences in age, sex, or sickle cell genotype between those with silent cerebral
  infarcts and those without it. Those with silent cerebral infarcts had lower median
  hemoglobin, higher reticulocytes and lower pain frequencies than those without it,
  yet again this was not significant. Follow up MRI in four out of the six silent
  infarct patients showed no additional lesions and no increase in size of the original
  ones after six to eight months. In conclusion, it appears that the frequency of
  silent cerebral infarcts in Iraqi SCD patients is lower than the bulk of the literature
  from other populations. Further studies to screen for genetic polymorphisms that
  may explain this lower rate may be informative.
