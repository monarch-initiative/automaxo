input_text: 'Impact of a hospital service for adults with chronic childhood-onset
  disease: A propensity weighted analysis.BACKGROUND: Young adults with chronic childhood-onset
  diseases (CCOD) transitioning care from pediatrics to adult care are at high risk
  for readmission after hospital discharge. At our institution, we have implemented
  an inpatient service, the Med-Peds (MP) line, to improve transitions to adult care
  and reduce hospital utilization by young adults with CCOD. OBJECTIVE: This study
  aimed to assess the effect of the MP line on length of stay (LOS) and 30-day readmission
  rates compared to other inpatient services. METHODS: This was an observational,
  retrospective cohort analysis of patients admitted to the MP line compared to other
  hospital service lines over a 2-year period. To avoid potential confounding by indication
  for admission to the MP line, propensity score weighting methods were used. RESULTS:
  The MP line cared for 302 patients with CCOD from June 2019 to July 2021. Compared
  to other service lines, there was a 33% reduction in relative risk of 30-day readmission
  (26.9% compared to 40.3%, risk ratio = 0.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55-0.81).
  LOS was 10% longer for the MP line (event time ratio (ETR): 1.10 95% CI 1.0-1.21)
  with median LOS 4.8 versus 4.5 days. Patients with sickle cell disease had less
  of a reduction in 30-day readmissions and longer LOS. CONCLUSION: Hospitalization
  for young adults with CCOD on a MP service line was associated with lower 30-day
  readmission rates and longer LOS than hospitalization on other services. Further
  research is needed to assess which components of the line most contribute to decreased
  utilization.'
