input_text: 'Rare emergency in children: Priapism and stepwise treatment approach.BACKGROUND:
  Priapism is a rare condition in children and the treatment algorithm is controversial
  in this age group. Herein, we report eight cases with low-flow priapism and our
  stepwise treatment approach in light of literature. METHODS: We present a simple
  stepwise treatment for low-flow priapism including five steps. Step 1: Cold compress
  and analgesia while evaluation the priapism and its etiology. Step 2: Corporal aspiration
  and adrenaline infusion in the ward. Step 3: Modified Winter shunt in the same place.
  Step 4: Ketamine application and caudal block in the operating room. Step 5: Sapheno-cavernous
  (Grayhack) shunt. Eight cases with low-flow priapism were reviewed retrospectively.
  Symptoms, duration of tumescence, the interventions, and step that provide detumescence
  were recorded. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 8.5 years (1-17 y). The median
  time of the priapism before admission was 15 h (4-165 h). The etiological factors
  were sickle cell disease, hemodialysis due to chronic renal failure, and factor
  V Leiden mutation in three patients. Detumescence was achieved in one patient at
  Step 2, in two patients at Steps 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Rigidity of cavernous
  body was observed in one patient in long-term follow-up. CONCLUSION: Low-flow priapism
  is a urological emergency that may cause erectile dysfunction. Treatment options
  should be selected according to a protocol that prevents time loss and avoids more
  invasive treatment in unnecessary situations. Our algorithm with simple nature and
  its steps from less invasive to more invasive procedures may be an alternative for
  the treatment of low-flow priapism.'
