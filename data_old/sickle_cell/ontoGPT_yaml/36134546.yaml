input_text: 'Risk of COVID-19 hospitalizations among school-aged children in Scotland:
  A national incident cohort study.Background: There is considerable policy, clinical
  and public interest about whether children should be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2
  and, if so, which children should be prioritised (particularly if vaccine resources
  are limited). To inform such deliberations, we sought to identify children and young
  people at highest risk of hospitalization from COVID-19. Methods: We used the Early
  Pandemic Evaluation and Enhanced Surveillance of COVID-19 (EAVE II) platform to
  undertake a national incident cohort analysis to investigate the risk of hospitalization
  among 5-17 years old living in Scotland in risk groups defined by the living risk
  prediction algorithm (QCOVID). A Cox proportional hazard model was used to derive
  hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between
  risk groups and COVID-19 hospital admission. Adjustments were made for age, sex,
  socioeconomic status, co-morbidity, and prior hospitalization. Results: Between
  March 1, 2020 and November 22, 2021, there were 146 183 (19.4% of all 752 867 children
  in Scotland) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections among
  5-17 years old. Of those with confirmed infection, 973 (0.7%) were admitted to hospital
  with COVID-19. The rate of COVID-19 hospitalization was higher in those within each
  QCOVID risk group compared to those without the condition. Similar results were
  found in age stratified analyses (5-11 and 12-17 years old). Risk groups associated
  with an increased risk of COVID-19 hospital admission, included (adjusted HR, 95%
  CIs): sickle cell disease 14.35 (8.48-24.28), chronic kidney disease 11.34 (4.61-27.87),
  blood cancer 6.32 (3.24-12.35), rare pulmonary diseases 5.04 (2.58-9.86), type 2
  diabetes 3.04 (1.34-6.92), epilepsy 2.54 (1.69-3.81), type 1 diabetes 2.48 (1.47-4.16),
  Down syndrome 2.45 (0.96-6.25), cerebral palsy 2.37 (1.26-4.47), severe mental illness
  1.43 (0.63-3.24), fracture 1.41 (1.02-1.95), congenital heart disease 1.35 (0.82-2.23),
  asthma 1.28 (1.06-1.55), and learning disability (excluding Down syndrome) 1.08
  (0.82-1.42), when compared to those without these conditions. Although our Cox models
  were adjusted for a number of potential confounders, residual confounding remains
  a possibility. Conclusions: In this national study, we observed an increased risk
  of COVID-19 hospital admissions among school-aged children with specific underlying
  long-term health conditions compared with children without these conditions.'
