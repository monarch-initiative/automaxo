input_text: "Implementing newborn screening for sickle cell disease in Korle Bu Teaching
  Hospital, Accra: Results and lessons learned.BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of sickle
  cell disease (SCD) through newborn screening (NBS) is a cost-effective intervention,
  which reduces morbidity and mortality. In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where disease
  burden is greatest, there are no universal NBS programs and few institutions have
  the capacity to conduct NBS. We determined the feasibility and challenges of implementing
  NBS for SCD in Ghana's largest public hospital. PROCEDURE: The SCD NBS program at
  Korle Bu Teaching Hospital (KBTH) is a multiyear partnership between the hospital
  and the SickKids Center for Global Child Health, Toronto, being implemented in phases.
  The 13-month demonstration phase (June 2017-July 2018) and phase one (November 2018-December
  2019) focused on staff training and the feasibility of universal screening of babies
  born in KBTH. RESULTS: During the demonstration phase, 115 public health nurses
  and midwives acquired competency in heel stick for dried blood spot sampling. Out
  of 9990 newborns, 4427 babies (44.3%) were screened, of which 79 (1.8%) were identified
  with presumptive SCD (P-SCD). Major challenges identified included inadequate nursing
  staff to perform screening, shortage of screening supplies, and delays in receiving
  screening results. Strategies to overcome some of the challenges were incorporated
  into phase one, resulting in increased screening coverage to 83.7%. CONCLUSIONS:
  Implementing NBS for SCD in KBTH presented challenges with implications on achieving
  and sustaining universal NBS in KBTH and other settings in SSA. Specific steps addressing
  these challenges comprehensively will help build on the modest initial gains, moving
  closer toward a sustainable national NBS program."
