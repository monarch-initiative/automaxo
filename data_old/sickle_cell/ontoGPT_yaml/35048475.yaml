input_text: 'Association between hearing impairment, school performance and cognitive
  function in children and adolescents with sickle cell disease.OBJECTIVE: To investigate
  the association among hearing impairment, school performance, and cognitive function
  in children and adolescents with sickle cell disease. METHODS: Thirty-one participants
  with sickle cell disease (SCD) and 31 healthy participants in the control-comparison
  group (CG), both aged 8-17 years underwent auditory system evaluation (pure tone
  audiometry and acoustic reflex), were screened for the risks of (central) auditory
  processing disorder and dysfunction of cognitive function using the Scale of Auditory
  Behaviors (SAB) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), respectively, and
  were interviewed to obtain clinical data and data on school performance. RESULTS:
  In the SCD group, eight (25.8%) participants presented with sensorineural hearing
  loss (SNHL). The group with SCD and SNHL presented a higher occurrence of poor school
  performance than the group of participants with SCD without SNHL (p = 0.016). The
  MMSE score for aspects related to attention and calculation in the SCD group with
  SNHL was lower than in the SCD group without SNHL (p = 0.016). In the SAB, the SCD
  group with SNHL presented a lower score than the SCD group without SNHL in aspects
  related to academic performance and attention. CONCLUSION: Hearing impairment in
  children and adolescents with SCD, specifically SNHL, is associated with poor school
  performance and enhances the risk of cognitive impairment in terms of attention
  and calculation.'
