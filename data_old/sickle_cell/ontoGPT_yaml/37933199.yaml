input_text: 'Imaging of pediatric skull lytic lesions: A review.Skull lesions in pediatric
  population are common findings on imaging and sometimes with heterogeneous manifestations,
  constituting a diagnostic challenge. Some lesions can be misinterpreted for their
  aggressiveness, as with larger lesions eroding cortical bone, containing soft tissue
  components, leading to excessive and, in some cases, invasive inappropriate etiological
  investigation. In this review, we present multiple several conditions that may present
  as skull lesions or pseudolesions, organized by groups (anatomic variants, congenital
  and development disorders, traumatic injuries, vascular issues, infectious conditions,
  and tumoral processes). Anatomic variants are common imaging findings that must
  be recognized by the neuroradiologist. Congenital malformations are rare conditions,
  such as aplasia cutis congenita and sinus pericranii, usually seen at earlier ages,
  the majority of which are benign findings. In case of trauma, cephalohematoma, growing
  skull fractures, and posttraumatic lytic lesions should be considered. Osteomyelitis
  tends to be locally aggressive and may mimic malignancy, in which cases, the clinical
  history can be the key to diagnosis. Vascular (sickle cell disease) and tumoral
  (aneurismal bone cyst, eosinophilic granuloma, metastases) lesions are relatively
  rare lesions but should be considered in the differential diagnosis, in the presence
  of certain imaging findings. The main difficulty is the differentiation between
  the benign and malignant nature; therefore, the main objective of this pictorial
  essay is to review the main skull lytic lesions found in pediatric age, describing
  the main findings in different imaging modalities (CT and MRI), allowing the neuroradiologist
  greater confidence in establishing the differential diagnosis, through a systematic
  and simple characterization of the lesions.'
