input_text: Disease-Modifying Therapies for Sickle Cell Disease-An Overview.Sickle
  cell disease refers to a group of inherited blood disorders in which hemoglobin
  polymerization leads to hemolysis and vaso-occlusion. This causes a myriad of complications
  during a patient's life span, ranging from anemia, infections, and acute and chronic
  pain to stroke and multiorgan dysfunction. Although there have been dramatic improvements
  in childhood survival thanks to improved supportive care with penicillin prophylaxis,
  immunizations, and improved transfusion practices, there was a dearth of disease-modifying
  therapies, with hydroxyurea being the only medication for >20 years. Here, we discuss
  the newer therapies for sickle cell disease that have emerged in recent years. [Pediatr
  Ann. 2024;53(2):e52-e55.].

  Split the following piece of text into fields in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
  object: <A sign or symptom associated with the disease and targeted by the medical action. For example, Low serum calcitriol, hypoplasia of the thymus, chronic cough, aortic stiffness, low pulse pressure>
  qualifier: <The primary disease the relationship is about, or specifically the disease the symptom is related to. For example, Beck-Fahrner syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, progeria, diabetes mellitus, infectious otitis media>
