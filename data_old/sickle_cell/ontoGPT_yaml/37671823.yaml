input_text: "Associating a standardized reporting tool for chest radiographs with
  clinical complications in pediatric acute chest syndrome.BACKGROUND: Acute chest
  syndrome (ACS) is an important cause of morbidity in sickle cell disease (SCD).
  A standardized tool for reporting chest radiographs in pediatric SCD patients did
  not previously exist. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the interobserver agreement among pediatric
  radiologists' interpretations for pediatric ACS chest radiographs utilizing a standardized
  reporting tool. We also explored the association of radiographic findings with ACS
  complications. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of pediatric ACS admissions
  from a single institution in 2019. ICD-10 codes identified 127 ACS admissions. Two
  radiologists independently interpreted the chest radiographs utilizing a standardized
  reporting tool, a third radiologist adjudicated discrepancies, and kappa analysis
  assessed interobserver agreement. Clinical outcomes were correlated with chest radiograph
  findings utilizing Pearsons' chi2 , t tests, and Mann-Whitney U tests. Odds ratios
  (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. RESULTS: Interobserver
  agreement was moderate to near-perfect across variables, with kappa analysis showing
  near-perfect agreement for opacity reported in the right upper lobe (0.84), substantial
  agreement for right lower lobe (0.63), and vertebral bony changes (0.72), with moderate
  agreement for all other reported variables. On the initial chest radiograph, an
  opacity located in the left lower lobe (LLL) correlated with pediatric intensive
  care unit transfer (p = .03). Pleural effusion on the initial chest radiograph had
  a 3.98 OR (95% CI: 1.35-11.74) of requiring blood products and a 10.67 OR (95% CI:
  3.62-31.39) for noninvasive ventilation. CONCLUSION: The standardized reporting
  tool showed moderate to near-perfect agreement between radiologists. LLL opacity,
  and pleural effusion were associated with increased risk of ACS complications."
