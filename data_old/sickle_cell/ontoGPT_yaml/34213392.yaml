input_text: Increased hemoglobin affinity for oxygen with GBT1118 improves hypoxia
  tolerance in sickle cell mice.Therapeutic agents that increase the Hb affinity for
  oxygen (O2) could, in theory, lead to decreased O2 release from Hb and impose a
  hypoxic risk to tissues. In this study, GBT1118, an allosteric modifier of Hb affinity
  for O2, was used to assess the impact of increasing Hb affinity for O2 on brain
  tissue oxygenation, blood pressure, heart rate, O2 delivery, and tolerance to hypoxia
  in Townes transgenic sickle cell disease (SCD) mice. Brain oxygenation and O2 delivery
  were studied during normoxia and severe hypoxic challenges. Chronic treatment with
  GBT1118 increased Hb affinity for O2, reducing the Po2 for 50% HbO2 saturation (P50)
  in SCD mice from 31 mmHg to 18 mmHg. This treatment significantly reduced anemia,
  increasing hematocrit by 33%, improved cardiac output (CO), and O2 delivery and
  extraction. Chronically increasing Hb affinity for O2 with GBT1118 preserved cortical
  O2 tension during normoxia, improved cortical O2 tension during hypoxia, and increased
  tolerance to severe hypoxia in SCD mice. Independent of hematological changes induced
  by chronic treatment, a single dose of GBT1118 significantly improved tolerance
  to hypoxia, highlighting the benefits of increasing Hb affinity for O2 and consequently
  reducing sickling of RBCs in blood during hypoxia in SCD.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Chronic
  pharmacologically increased hemoglobin affinity for oxygen in sickle cell disease
  mice alleviated hematological consequences of sickle cell disease, increasing RBC
  half-life, hematocrit, and hemoglobin concentration, while also decreasing reticulocyte
  count. Additionally, chronically increased hemoglobin affinity for oxygen significantly
  improved survival as well as cortical tissue oxygenation in sickle cell disease
  mice during hypoxia, suggesting that oxygen delivery and utilization is improved
  by increased hemoglobin affinity for oxygen.
