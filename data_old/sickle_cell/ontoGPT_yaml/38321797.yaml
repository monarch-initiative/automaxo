  Experience.BACKGROUND: Improvements in sickle cell disease (SCD) care have resulted
  in the survival of many patients into adulthood, although this is accompanied by
  the increased incidence of end-organ damage, including chronic kidney disease (CKD).
  OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the prevalence, pattern and predictors of renal
  dysfunction in SCD patients and investigated the associated renal histopathologic
  changes. METHODS: We evaluated 105 patients with SCD, for proteinuria, estimated
  glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and tubular dysfunction. Renal biopsy was conducted
  on 22 patients who qualified. Data were analysed using SPSS package version 23.
  RESULTS: Thirty-seven (35.2%) of the 105 patients had CKD, as defined by an eGFR
  of 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 and/or proteinuria. The fractional excretion of potassium (FEK)
  was elevated in all patients, whereas the fractional excretion of sodium (FENa)
  was elevated in 98.1%. Glomerular filtration rate was negatively correlated with
  irreversible percentage sickle cell count (r = -0.616, P = 0.0001), FEK (r = -0.448,
  P = 0.0001) and FENa (r = -0.336, P = 0.004). Age, irreversible percentage sickle
  cell count, haemoglobin levels and FENa were the major predictors of CKD. The histological
  pattern in the 22 patients who had biopsies was consistent with mesangioproliferative
  glomerulonephritis 11 (50%), minimal change disease 6 (27.3%), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis
  3 (13.6%) and interstitial nephritis 2 (9.1%). CONCLUSIONS: CKD was prevalent in
  SCD patients, and it was characterised by tubular dysfunction and mesangioproliferative
  glomerulonephritis. The main predictors of CKD were increased age, severity of vaso-occlusive
  crisis, worsening anaemia and tubular dysfunction.'
