input_text: Ten-year longitudinal analysis of hydroxyurea implementation in a pediatric
  sickle cell program.Hydroxyurea (HU) has proven benefit in sickle cell anemia (SCA),
  but HU is still underutilized. The Pediatric Sickle Cell Program of Northern Virginia
  prescribes HU regardless of symptoms to all SCA patients age >= 9 months and prospectively
  tracks outcomes. HU is dosed to maximum tolerated dosing (MTD), targeting 30% Hgb
  F. Longitudinal data from 2009 to 2019 encompassing 1222 HU-eligible and 950 HU-exposure
  patient-years were analyzed in 2-year intervals for hemoglobin (Hgb), fetal hemoglobin
  (Hgb F), hospitalizations, transfusions, and treat-and-release ED visits. Comparing
  HU-eligible patients in the interval prior to HU implementation (2009-2011) to the
  last interval analyzed after HU implementation (2017-2019), HU usage increased from
  33% to 93%, average Hgb increased from 8.3 +- 0.98 to 9.8 +- 1.3 g/dl (p < .0001),
  average Hgb F rose from 13 +- 8.7% to 26 +- 9.9% (p < .0001), hospitalizations decreased
  from 0.71 (95% CI 0.54-0.91) to 0.2 (95% CI 0.13-0.28) admissions/person-year, sporadic
  transfusions decreased from 0.4 (95% CI 0.27-0.55) to 0.05 (95% CI 0.02-0.12) transfusions/person-year.
  Treat-and-release ED visit rates remained unchanged, varying between 0.49 (95% CI
  0.36-0.64) and 0.64 (95% CI 0.48-0.83) visits/person-year. By the last interval,
  72% of patients had Hgb >= 9 g/dl, 42% had Hgb F >= 30%, 79% experienced no hospitalizations,
  and 94% received no transfusions. Uniform HU prescription for SCA patients with
  close monitoring to achieve high Hgb F resulted in significant improvements in laboratory
  and clinical outcomes within 2 years, which continued to improve over the next 6
  years. Rigorous HU implementation in a pediatric sickle cell population is feasible,
  effective, and sustainable.
