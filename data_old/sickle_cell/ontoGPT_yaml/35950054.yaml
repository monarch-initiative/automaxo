input_text: 'Pregnancy in the Sickle Cell Disease and Fetomaternal Outcomes in Different
  Sickle cell Genotypes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.Background: Pregnancy
  is a major concern among women with the sickle cell disease (SCD), and it is associated
  with increased adverse outcomes. The aim of the present meta-analysis is to report
  the fetomaternal outcomes in different sickle cell genotypes. Methods: In this systematic
  review and meta-analysis, a comprehensive search of databases and search engines
  such as PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest, Cochrane Library, Science Direct
  and Google Scholar were performed. Any observational studies that had compared at
  least one outcome such as maternal outcomes, fetal outcomes, and morbidity between
  two groups of pregnant women with different types of sickle cell genotypes and pregnant
  women without SCD were evaluated. Results: A total number of 9,827 pregnant women
  with SCD were examined. The results showed that pregnancy in SCD increased the risk
  of adverse outcomes for the mothers (including postpartum hemorrhage, prematurity,
  pregnancy-induced hypertension, pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, cesarean section, lower
  segment cesareansection, maternal death), fetus (including live births, low birth
  weight, intrauterine growth restriction, APGAR score at 5 min <7, stillbirth, neonatal
  death, perinatal mortality, acute fetal distress, intrauterine fetal death) and
  morbidity among the SCD(severe anemia, urinary tract infection, blood transfusion,
  painful crisis, acute chest syndrome, vaso-occlusive crises). Conclusion: According
  to the results of this meta-analysis, pregnancy in the SCD is associated with an
  increased risk of maternal outcomes, fetal outcomes, and morbidity among SCD patients
  with different genotypes. Pregnancy in sickle cell hemoglobinopathies needs careful
  multidisciplinary management and cautious caring so as to decrease maternal and
  fetal morbidity and mortality.'
