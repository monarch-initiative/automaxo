input_text: Characterising the prevalence of overweight and obese status among adults
  with sickle cell disease.Individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) have historically
  been considered underweight. Despite increasing body mass index (BMI) in the general
  population, the prevalence of overweight and obese status remains unclear in the
  adult SCD population. Our primary aim was to determine the prevalence of overweight
  and obese status and to identify associations between BMI, demographic, and clinical
  characteristics. We conducted an analysis of abstracted electronic health record
  data and patient-reported outcomes from the Sickle Cell Disease Implementation Consortium
  registry; individuals aged 20-45 years were included. The median (interquartile
  range) BMI for the 1664 adults in this analysis was 23.9 (21.1-28) kg/m2 . In this
  cohort, 42.9% had a BMI of >25 kg/m2 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
  definition of overweight/obese). In multivariable analysis, higher odds of being
  overweight or obese were associated with female gender, older age, college education,
  private insurance, and hypertension diagnosis. Higher odds of a BMI of >25 kg/m2
  were observed in individuals with HbSC or HbSbeta+ thalassaemia regardless of hydroxycarbamide
  (hydroxyurea) exposure (odds ratio [OR] 3.4, p < 0.0001) and HbSS or HbSbeta0 thalassaemia
  exposed to hydroxycarbamide (OR 1.6, p = 0.0003) compared to those with HbSS or
  HbSbeta0 thalassaemia with no hydroxycarbamide exposure. These data highlight the
  importance of early identification, prevention, and intervention for increasing
  BMI to reduce obesity-related complications that may impact SCD-related complications.
