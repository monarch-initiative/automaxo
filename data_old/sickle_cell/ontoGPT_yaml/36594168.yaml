input_text: "Pregnancy outcomes in women with sickle cell disease in California.Adverse
  pregnancy outcomes occur frequently in women with sickle cell disease (SCD) across
  the globe. In the United States, Black women experience disproportionately worse
  maternal health outcomes than all other racial groups. To better understand how
  social determinants of health impact SCD maternal morbidity, we used California's
  Department of Health Care Access and Information data (1991-2019) to estimate the
  cumulative incidence of pregnancy outcomes in Black women with and without SCD-adjusted
  for age, insurance status, and Distressed Community Index (DCI) scores. Black pregnant
  women with SCD were more likely to deliver at a younger age, use government insurance,
  and live in at-risk or distressed neighborhoods, compared to those without SCD.
  They also experienced higher stillbirths (26.8, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 17.5-36.1
  vs. 12.4 [CI: 12.1-12.7], per 1000 births) and inpatient maternal mortality (344.5
  [CI: 337.6-682.2] vs. 6.1 [CI: 2.3-8.4], per 100 000 live births). Multivariate
  logistic regression models showed Black pregnant women with SCD had significantly
  higher odds ratios (OR) for sepsis (OR 14.89, CI: 10.81, 20.52), venous thromboembolism
  (OR 13.60, CI: 9.16, 20.20), and postpartum hemorrhage (OR 2.25, CI 1.79-2.82),
  with peak onset in the second trimester, third trimester, and six weeks postpartum,
  respectively. Despite adjusting for sociodemographic factors, Black women with SCD
  still experienced significantly worse pregnancy outcomes than those without SCD.
  We need additional studies to determine if early introduction to reproductive health
  education, continuation of SCD-modifying therapies during pregnancy, and increasing
  access to multidisciplinary perinatal care can reduce morbidity in pregnant women
  with SCD."
