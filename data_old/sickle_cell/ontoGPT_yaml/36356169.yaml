input_text: 'Assessment of transition readiness to predict health care utilization
  during transition to adult care in sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: Transition-age
  patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at risk for poor outcomes associated
  with incomplete transition readiness and neurocognitive deficits. Study objectives
  were to: 1) test if a SCD-specific measure of self-management skills was associated
  with transition outcomes and 2) evaluate if caregiver-reported executive functioning
  was associated with self-management skills and transition outcomes among youth with
  SCD. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Youth/caregivers were selected from a longitudinal
  cohort study. Caregivers completed the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function
  (BRIEF); caregivers and youth completed the Self-Management Skills Checklist (SMSC)
  at a median age of 16.8 +- 0.6 years. Non-parametric tests compared SMSC and transition
  outcomes. Regression assessed the incremental validity of SMSC in predicting transition
  outcomes. RESULTS: In total, 95 participants (54% male, 55% severe genotype) completed
  the SMSC assessment. Most participants (87%) transferred to adult care within six
  months and 87% were retained for at least 12 months. BRIEF and caregiver-reported
  SMSC assessments were weakly, negatively correlated (rho = -0.25, p = 0.0392) but
  were not significant in predicting transition outcomes (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS:
  The SMSC and executive function did not predict adult care engagement. Development
  of readiness assessments that predict care engagement and reflect self-efficacy
  is important for monitoring transition-aged patients with SCD.'
