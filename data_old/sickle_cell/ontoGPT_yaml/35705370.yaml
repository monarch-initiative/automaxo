input_text: 'Sickle cell disease in children: an update of the evidence in low- and
  middle-income settings.Sickle cell disease (SCD), one of the most common monogenetic
  diseases in the world, is associated with multisystemic complications that begin
  in childhood. Most of the babies homozygous for the sickle haemoglobin gene are
  born in sub-Saharan Africa. Over the years, progress has been made with early diagnosis
  through newborn screening, penicillin prophylaxis, pneumococcal immunisation, transcranial
  Doppler (TCD) screening, hydroxyurea therapy and chronic blood transfusions with
  remarkably improved survival and quality of life of children with SCD. However,
  wide disparities in outcomes exist between high-income countries (HICs) where over
  90% survive to adulthood, and low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) where
  less than half achieve that milestone. Even in HICs, racial inequities pose barriers
  to accessing specialised care and receiving treatment for acute pain episodes. Better
  understanding of SCD pathophysiology is being exploited to develop new disease-modifying
  drugs and gene therapy approaches to further improve outcomes. Bone marrow transplantation
  is established as a curative treatment for SCD, but it is largely unavailable in
  LMICs. To bridge the disparity and inequity gaps, innovative approaches are needed
  in LMICs. Validated and more affordable, easy-to-use point-of-care tests offer opportunities
  to link early diagnosis with immunisation programmes and healthcare encounters.
  Widespread use of hydroxyurea therapy-a relatively affordable and effective disease-modifying
  drug-in LMICs would help improve survival and quality of life. Integration of SCD
  treatment into primary care linked to district level/provincial hospitals that are
  supported with evidence-based guidelines will help extend needed interventions to
  many more patients living in LMICs.'
