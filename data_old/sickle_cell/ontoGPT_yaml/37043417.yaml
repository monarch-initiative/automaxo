input_text: 'Femoral Head Core Decompression and Bone Marrow Concentrate Injection
  in Pediatric Sickle-cell Related Avascular Necrosis.BACKGROUND: Femoral head avascular
  necrosis affects 10% to 40% of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). The purpose
  of this study was to evaluate the results of femoral head core decompression and
  bone marrow aspirate concentrate (CD-BMAC) injection in pediatric patients with
  SCD. METHODS: Eligible patients were enrolled in this retrospective study of patients
  undergoing CD-BMAC. Patients with SCD who were younger than 18 at the time of surgery
  and had >1 year of follow-up were included in this analysis. Hips were staged based
  on the Ficat system by 2 raters. The visual analog score for pain, hip outcome score,
  modified Harris hip score, and the University of California, Los Angeles activity
  score were used as patient-reported outcome measures preoperatively, at 5 to 9 months
  postoperatively, and final follow-up. Treatment failure was defined as total hip
  arthroplasty or visual analog score >3 at the final follow-up. RESULTS: Twenty-three
  hips in 17 patients were included, with a median age at the time of surgery of 15.8
  years (interquartile range: 13.1 to 17.8 y). Patients were followed for 4.25 +-
  1.7 years. Ten hips showed a 1-stage increase in the Ficat stage at the final follow-up,
  whereas 11 retained the same stage, and 1 hip had a 1-stage regression. All patient-reported
  outcome measures showed significant improvement from the preoperative visit to short-term
  follow-up, but the preoperative to final follow-up improvement was not significant.
  Six treatment failures were recorded, including 3 total hip arthroplasties and 3
  painful hips at the final follow-up. In a multivariate logistic regression model,
  only skeletal maturity (odds ratio = 16.2, 95% CI: 1.44-183.0, P = 0.024) and femoral
  head collapse (odds ratio = 12.0, 95% CI: 1.1-130.5, P = 0.041) were significant
  predictors of treatment failure. CONCLUSIONS: In the largest study on pediatric
  SCD patients undergoing CD-BMAC, we found that CD-BMAC injection offers significant
  improvement in pain and functional outcomes in the short term, with a very low risk
  for complications. Skeletal maturity and femoral head collapse were significant
  predictors of treatment failure. Patients with a collapsed femoral head experienced
  functional deterioration over time after initial improvement, whereas precollapse
  hips maintained their functional improvement up to the latest follow-up. LEVEL OF
  EVIDENCE: Level III, retrospective cohort study.'
