Of the more than 10,000 annual births of children with a severe hemoglobinopathy, only around 10.0% are managed optimally. Thus, genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis (PND) is a valid option for a large and diverse country. Our center was one of the first to initiate PND and we present our experience over 30 years to evaluate the impact of awareness in changing the trends of PND of hemoglobinopathies. Both second and first-trimester diagnoses were undertaken by fetoscopy/cordocentesis and globin biosynthesis/high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of fetal blood and chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and DNA analysis. Over 30 years, 3478 couples (first trimester: 2475; second trimester: 1003) from all over India were offered PND. The number of couples coming in the first trimester increased significantly over each decade and couples coming prospectively increased from 2.5 to 18.4%. A cost-effective stepwise approach was used for molecular analysis. Eight hundred and one fetuses (23.0%) were affected and all except three couples opted for termination of these pregnancies. Genetic counseling and PND is the only way to reduce the burden of disease. With awareness, there was a shift from second trimester to first trimester PND over each decade, with an increasing number of couples coming during the first pregnancy. There are only 15 to 20 centers in India offering PND. We have compared our study with other reports on PND from different regions in India.",
