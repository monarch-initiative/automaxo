            "text": "Anecdotal evidence was recently brought to our attention suggesting a potential difference in velocity estimates between transcranial Doppler (TCD) systems when measuring high velocities (~200 cm/s) close to the threshold for sickle cell disease stroke prevention. As we were unable to identify a suitable commercial TCD phantom, a middle cerebral artery (MCA) flow phantom was developed to evaluate velocity estimates from different devices under controlled conditions. Time-averaged velocity estimates were obtained using two TCD devices: a Spencer Technologies ST3 Doppler system (ST3 PMD150, Spencer Technologies, Seattle, WA, USA) and a DWL Dopplerbox (DWL Compumedics, SN-300947, Singen, Germany). These were compared with velocity estimates obtained using a Zonare duplex scanner (Zonare Medical Systems, Mountain View, CA, USA), with timed collection of fluid as the gold standard. Bland-Altman analysis was performed to compare measurements between devices. Our tests confirmed that velocities measured with the DWL TCD system were +4.1 cm/s (+3.7%; limits of agreement [LoA]: 2%, 5%; p = 0.03) higher than the Spencer system when measuring a velocity 110 cm/s and +12 cm/s higher (+5.7 %; LoA: 4.8%, 6.6%; p = 0.03) when measuring velocities of 210 cm/s, close to the diagnostic threshold for stroke intervention. We found our MCA phantom to be a valuable tool for systematically quantifying differences in TCD velocity estimates between devices, confirming that the DWL system gave consistently higher readings than the Spencer ST3 system. Differences become more pronounced at high velocities, which explains why they were not identified earlier. Our findings have clinical implications for centers using TCD to monitor patients with sickle cell disease, as extra care may be needed to adjust for bias between manufacturers when making treatment decisions about children with sickle cell with velocities close to the diagnostic threshold.",
