            "text": "BACKGROUND: Newborn screening (NBS) for sickle cell disease (SCD) has been shown to reduce early childhood morbidity and mortality associated with sickle cell disease (SCD) but the programme is yet to gain universal coverage in Nigeria. The study assessed the awareness and acceptability of NBS for sickle cell disease for newly delivered mothers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted to assess 780 mothers admitted into the postnatal ward 0-48 hours after delivery at Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki, Nigeria. Pre-validated questionnaires were employed for data collection and statistical analysis was performed using the United States' Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) Epi Info 7.1.4 software. RESULTS: Only 172 (22%) and 96 (12.2%) of the mothers were aware of NBS and comprehensive care for babies with SCD respectively. The acceptance of NBS was high, 718 (92%) among the mothers. The reasons for acceptance of NBS were to know how to take care of the baby 416 (57.9%), know the genotype status 180 (25.1%) while the motivating factors for NBS were knowledge of benefits 455 (58%) and the cost is free 205 (26.1%). The majority of the mothers 561(71.6%) agree that SCD can be ameliorated by NBS while 80 (24.6%) do not know if it can. CONCLUSION: There was low awareness of NBS and comprehensive care for babies with SCD among mothers with newborns, however acceptability for NBS was high. There is a considerable need to bridge the communication gap between health workers and parents to increase their awareness.",
