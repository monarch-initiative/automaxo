input_text: 'Elimination of pain and improvement of exercise capacity in Camurati-Engelmann
  disease with losartan.BACKGROUND: Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is a rare disorder,
  with approximately 250 described cases in the literature. Treatment options are
  limited and have been suboptimal so far. PATIENT AND METHODS: A prepubertal girl
  aged 9 years was diagnosed with CED. Treatment with losartan was initiated at a
  daily dose of 0.75 mg/kg. Over a period of 12 weeks, the dose was gradually increased
  to 1.0 mg/kg/d. The patient was reviewed in clinic regularly and underwent thorough
  clinical assessments 9, 17, and 38 months after treatment initiation. RESULTS: The
  patient experienced marked clinical improvements with losartan. In particular, losartan
  treatment led to the complete elimination of the previously severe and incapacitating
  pain, with an increased ability to walk and perform physical activities. There was
  also a considerable improvement in body composition with increased lean and adipose
  tissue. Notably, the improvement in fat deposition had not been previously observed
  with other treatments in CED. Hematology, liver, and renal function tests were within
  normal ranges at presentation and remained so over the course of treatment. CONCLUSIONS:
  In light of our findings, losartan may be a useful option in CED management.'
