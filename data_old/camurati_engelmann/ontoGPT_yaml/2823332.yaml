input_text: '[Value of various radiological study results in the follow-up of Camurati-Engelmann
  disease].Camurati-Engelmann disease is a rare progressive bone dysplasia; involvement
  of the skull base can lead to deafness, vestibular disturbances, facial paralysis
  and damage to the optic nerves. Treatment with corticosteroids, calcitonin and diphosphonates
  promises only very limited success. Conservative treatment of compression of the
  cranial nerves is almost ineffective, but the aim of surgical treatment is decompression
  of involved nerves. The differential diagnosis depends on radiological findings
  and clinical symptoms. Follow-up depends on radiographic examination and skeletal
  scintigraphy for showing the extent of the disease. CT may help in demonstrating
  compression of cranial nerves and define the indications for surgical decompression.'
