input_text: 'Proband and the Brother.INTRODUCTION: Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED)
  is a rare autosomal dominant disease. It is characterized by hyperostosis of the
  long bones and the skull, Clinically patient will have limb pain, proximal muscle
  weakness a wide-based gait. The gene causing CED is located on chromosome 19, this
  region contains the gene encoding the TGF Beta -1. The diagnosis of CED is established
  in a proband with the characteristic radiographic findings and molecular genetic
  testing for TGF Beta-1 mutation. Treatment is with corticosteroids and Losartan.
  MATERIALS: A 40 year old lady presented with complaints of Left lower limb pain
  for 1 year duration. On examination there was tenderness of left greater trochanter,
  proximal and distal femur was present. Blood investigations showed high PTH and
  low Vitamin-D3. Imaging showed non specific sclerotic lesions in femur. As patient
  brother had limp since childhood genetic disorders were and a provisional diagnosis
  of sclerotic bone disease probable Progressive diaphyseal dysplasia was considered.
  PET-CT was done which revealed abnormal osteoblastic activity in both femurs, focal
  hyperostosis in humeral diaphysis suggestive of CED. She was tested Positive for
  TGF beta 1 mutation consistent with CED. He was started on LOSARTAN. On follow up
  patient is pain free. RESULT: Her brother was also evaluated in view of his limp
  and he was also diagnosed as CED. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis in this case was based
  on the clinical history, family history and characteristic radiological findings
  and genetic testing which confirmed TGF Beta-1 mutation. Family history is crucial
  in this case which led to diagnosis. References Van Hul W, Boudin E, Vanhoenacker
