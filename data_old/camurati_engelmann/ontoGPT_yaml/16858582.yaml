input_text: 'Pitfalls in paediatric gait disturbances: painless bone diseases.INTRODUCTION:
  We describe three boys who were referred for neurological work-up of a tottering
  gait and in whom we diagnosed bone diseases, namely, Camurati-Engelmann disease,
  cartilaginous exostoses and a stress fracture as the underlying causes for the gait-disturbances.
  CONCLUSION: "Non-neurologic disorders" must be considered even if pain is not a
  leading symptom in gait disturbances.'
