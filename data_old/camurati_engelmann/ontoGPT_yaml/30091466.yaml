input_text: Bone-targeted delivery of TGF-beta type 1 receptor inhibitor rescues uncoupled
  bone remodeling in Camurati-Engelmann disease.Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is
  a genetic bone-modeling disorder mainly caused by mutations in the gene that encodes
  transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1). Symptoms of CED include bone pain,
  fractures, and dysplasia. Currently, effective therapies for bone fracture and dysplasia
  in CED are urgently needed. We have demonstrated that TGF-beta1 is a coupling factor
  for bone remodeling and is aberrantly activated in CED. Daily injection of TGF-beta
  type 1 receptor inhibitor (TbetaR1I) attenuated CED symptoms, but this systemic
  administration caused serious side effects. In this study, we created a conjugate
  linking TbetaR1I and alendronate, which delivered TbetaR1I specifically to bone.
  After weekly injection of the conjugate for 8 weeks, normal bone morphology and
  remodeling in CED mice was maintained with a minimum effective dose 700 times lower
  than TbetaR1I injection. Additionally, we found that the conjugate restored normal
  bone turnover by reducing the number of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, maintained
  a regular osteogenic microenvironment by regulating the formation of CD31 and Endomucin
  double-positive vessels, and preserved ordinary bone formation via inhibition of
  the migration of leptin-receptor-positive cells. Thus, targeting delivery of TbetaR1I
  to bone is a promising therapy for CED and other uncoupled bone remodeling disorders.
