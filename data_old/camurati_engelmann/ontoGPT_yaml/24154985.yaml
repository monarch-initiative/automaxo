input_text: 'Camurati-Engelmann disease (progressive diaphyseal dysplasia): reports
  of an Indian kindred.Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED, OMIM 131300), or progressive
  diaphyseal dysplasia, is a rare autosomal dominant skeletal dysplasia, caused by
  mutations in the transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFbeta1) gene. We describe the
  first Indian CED family with genetic confirmation and presenting manifestations.
  The proband is a 17-year-old woman who presented with lower limb pain and proximal
  muscle weakness. Skeletal radiographs of the long bones revealed cortical, periosteal,
  and endosteal thickenings, predominantly affecting the diaphyses of the long bones.
  On detailed evaluation, there was a strong family history of bone disorder with
  similar symptoms of pain and radiological findings in several family members. Exon
  sequencing of the TGFbeta1 gene was performed in available family members. Based
  on clinical and radiographic studies and its familial nature, a diagnosis of CED
  was made and confirmed by mutation analysis. A heterozygous G to A transition in
  exon 4 of the TGFbeta1 gene (R218H) was detected in 5 out of 10 available family
  members, including 4 affecteds and 1 asymptomatic individual. Many of our affected
  individuals responded to glucocorticoids and cortical windowing. CED is a rare genetic
  disease with variable clinical manifestations and incomplete penetrance. CED needs
  to be considered in the differential diagnosis of nonspecific limb pain and waddling
  gait in all young individuals. '
