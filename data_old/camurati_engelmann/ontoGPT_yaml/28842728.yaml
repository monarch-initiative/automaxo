input_text: 'Discrepancy between bone density and bone material strength index in
  three siblings with Camurati-Engelmann disease.Camurati-Engelmann (CE) is a very
  rare disease affecting one in every million persons worldwide. It is characterized
  by an enlargement of long bones. We aimed to assess bone characteristics in three
  siblings with different tools. Even if there was an excess of bone density, quality
  seemed to be deteriorated. INTRODUCTION: CE disease is a rare monogenic disorder
  affecting approximately one in every million persons worldwide. It is mainly characterized
  by a progressive hyperostosis of the periosteum and endosteum of the diaphysis of
  long bones. Limited data are available about bone characteristics in these patients.
  In three siblings with CE disease, we aimed to assess bone mineral density (BMD)
  and trabecular bone score (TBS) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and material
  characteristics at tissue level using bone impact reference point indentation. METHODS:
  Clinical data were collected and a general laboratory workup was performed. At the
  lumbar spine and hip, BMD and TBS were measured using DXA imaging. Bone material
  strength index (BMSi) was measured by bone impact microindentation using an Osteoprobe
  instrument. RESULTS: All three cases had densitometric values consistent with high
  bone mass (sum of Z-score at the lumbar spine and hip > 4). Hip BMD was extremely
  high in all three siblings at both total hip and femoral neck, while at the lumbar
  spine, two of them had normal values but the third again had very high BMD. TBS
  values were in the normal range. In contrast, BMSi measurements were at low or very
  low levels, compared with normal controls. CONCLUSION: Despite strikingly increased
  BMD and normal microarchitecture, BMSi is affected in patients with CE. Microindentation
  could be an appropriate tool for assessing bone fragility in these patients. Bone
  disease in this group of patients requires further study to better understand the
  underlying regulatory mechanisms and their alterations.'
