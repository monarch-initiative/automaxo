input_text: A mutation affecting the latency-associated peptide of TGFbeta1 in Camurati-Engelmann
  disease enhances osteoclast formation in vitro.Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED)
  is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by bone pain and osteosclerosis
  affecting the diaphysis of long bones. CED is caused by various missense mutations
  in the TGFB1 gene that encodes TGFbeta1, the most common of which is an arginine-cysteine
  amino acid change at codon 218 (R218C) in the latency-associated peptide domain
  of TGFbeta1. We studied osteoclast formation in vitro from peripheral blood mononuclear
  cells obtained from three related CED patients harboring the R218C mutation, in
  comparison with one family-based and several unrelated controls. Osteoclast formation
  was enhanced approximately 5-fold (P < 0.001) and bone resorption approximately
  10-fold (P < 0.001) in CED patients, and the increase in osteoclast formation was
  inhibited by soluble TGFbeta type II receptor. Total serum TGFbeta1 levels were
  similar in affected and unaffected subjects, but concentrations of active TGFbeta1
  in conditioned medium of osteoclast cultures was higher in the three CED patients
  than in the unaffected family member. We concluded that the R218C mutation increases
  TGFbeta1 bioactivity and enhances osteoclast formation in vitro. The activation
  of osteoclast activity noted here is consistent with clinical reports that have
  shown biochemical evidence of increased bone resorption as well as bone formation
  in CED.
