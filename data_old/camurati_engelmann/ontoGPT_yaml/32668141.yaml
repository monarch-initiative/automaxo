input_text: 'A Case Report of a 44-Year-Old Woman With Camurati-Englemann Disease:
  A Case Report.CASE: A 44-year-old woman presented with easy fatigability, diplopia,
  dizziness, and a 2-year history of pelvic, hip, and lower extremity aching and pain.
  Radiograph, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and histopathologic
  imaging studies were obtained. Hypersclerosis of the affected bones led to the initiation
  of a sclerotic bone dysplasia workup and sequencing of the transforming growth factor
  beta 1 gene located on chromosome 19q13 revealed a heterozygous rare missense variant
  in exon-4, leading to a final diagnosis of Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED). Medical
  treatment thus far has had a minimal effect on her symptoms, and the patient continues
  to be followed. CONCLUSIONS: This specific mutation has been reported only once
  previously in a patient with CED. This case report expands the typical phenotype
  associated with CED in association with the c.667T>C, p.Cys223Arg variant.'
