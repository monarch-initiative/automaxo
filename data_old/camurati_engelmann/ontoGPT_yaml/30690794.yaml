input_text: Observations on the Natural History of Camurati-Engelmann Disease.Camurati-Engelmann
  disease (OMIM 31300) is a rare cranio-tubular bone dysplasia characterized by osteosclerosis
  of the long bones and skull caused by dominantly-inherited mutations in the transforming
  growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) gene. A wide variation in phenotype has been recognized,
  even within families carrying the same mutation. In addition, aspects of the natural
  history of the disorder, in particular whether it is always progressive or can remit
  spontaneously, remain uncertain. In a large kindred carrying a TGFB1 gene mutation
  (c.653G > A; p.R218H) we have attempted to clarify the extent of phenotypic variability
  and the natural history of the disease through detailed individual histories of
  symptoms, and skeletal imaging by both radiography and scintigraphy. Only one subject
  had the classical childhood onset with bone pain in the legs and gait disturbance.
  Eight subjects reported the onset of leg pain in their teenage years that, by their
  early 20s, had either resolved or persisted at a low level. Two of these eight later
  developed cranial nerve palsies. There was a wide variation in the radiographic
  appearance in adults, but disease extent and activity in long bones, as assessed
  by scintigraphy, was inversely correlated with age (p < 0.025). In younger subjects
  the radiographic and scintigraphic appearances were concordant, but in older subjects
  the scintigram could be quiescent despite florid radiographic changes. Sequential
  scintigrams in two subjects showed reduced activity in the later scan. One subject
  had suffered meningoencephalitis in early childhood that resulted in paresis of
  one arm. The affected arm showed markedly less disease involvement, implicating
  mechanical or growth factors in its etiology. Our data suggest that the natural
  history of Camurati-Engelmann disease can be benign, and that disease activity commonly
  attenuates in adulthood. Severe cases of childhood onset and/or with cranial nerve
  involvement, may occur only in a minority of mutation carriers.   2019 American
