  scintigraphy: A case report.RATIONALE: Camurati-Engelmann disease (i.e., progressive
  diaphyseal dysplasia) is an extremely rare autosomal dominant bone disorder. The
  most common clinical manifestations were chronic skeletal pain, waddling gait, muscular
  weakness. PATIENT CONCERNS: We described that a 27-year-old male with a 1-year history
  of intermittent tetany was referred for bone scintigraphy. The whole body bone scan
  images showed abnormal increased uptake of the tracer in the long bones of the upper
  and lower extremities as well as in the skull. DIAGNOSES: Combined the family history,
  the findings of the images and the genetic study, the diagnosis of Camurati-Engelmann
  disease was confirmed. INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOMES: The patient responded well to
  the treatment of calcium gluconate. LESSONS: Bone scintigraphy would be helpful
  in the diagnosis and assessing the severity of Camurati-Engelmann disease.'
