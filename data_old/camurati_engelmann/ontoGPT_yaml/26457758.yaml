input_text: 'Excess TGF-beta mediates muscle weakness associated with bone metastases
  in mice.Cancer-associated muscle weakness is a poorly understood phenomenon, and
  there is no effective treatment. Here we find that seven different mouse models
  of human osteolytic bone metastases-representing breast, lung and prostate cancers,
  as well as multiple myeloma-exhibited impaired muscle function, implicating a role
  for the tumor-bone microenvironment in cancer-associated muscle weakness. We found
  that transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, released from the bone surface as a
  result of metastasis-induced bone destruction, upregulated NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4),
  resulting in elevated oxidization of skeletal muscle proteins, including the ryanodine
  receptor and calcium (Ca(2+)) release channel (RyR1). The oxidized RyR1 channels
  leaked Ca(2+), resulting in lower intracellular signaling, which is required for
  proper muscle contraction. We found that inhibiting RyR1 leakage, TGF-beta signaling,
  TGF-beta release from bone or Nox4 activity improved muscle function in mice with
  MDA-MB-231 bone metastases. Humans with breast- or lung cancer-associated bone metastases
  also had oxidized skeletal muscle RyR1 that is not seen in normal muscle. Similarly,
  skeletal muscle weakness, increased Nox4 binding to RyR1 and oxidation of RyR1 were
  present in a mouse model of Camurati-Engelmann disease, a nonmalignant metabolic
  bone disorder associated with increased TGF-beta activity. Thus, pathological TGF-beta
  release from bone contributes to muscle weakness by decreasing Ca(2+)-induced muscle
  force production. '
