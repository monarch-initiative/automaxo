input_text: Camurati-Engelmann's disease. A case report.Camurati-Engelmann's syndrome
  is a rare congenital disease characterised by hyperostosis and sclerosis with a
  predilection for the long bones of the lower limbs. The authors report a case in
  an adult with a family history of the disease, and multiple localisations in the
  diaphyses of the long bones. The site of pain and greatest involvement of the disease
  was the right tibia and fibula. The affection was treated by drilling and reaming
  the medullary canal with drills of increasing diameter. This method is easy to carry
  out, causes little trauma, and has undoubted advantages in greatly reducing the
  period of bedrest and aiding functional recovery.
