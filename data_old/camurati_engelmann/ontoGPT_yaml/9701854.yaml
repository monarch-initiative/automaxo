input_text: Camurati-Engelmann disease. Effects of corticosteroids.Camurati-Engelmann
  disease is an uncommon condition, radiologically characterized by symmetric diaphyseal
  sclerosis involving the tubular bones. Clinical features include limb pain, muscle
  weakness, waddling gait and sometimes deafness. The evaluation is made by conjunction
  of radiographic and scintigraphic data. Corticosteroids and analgesics improve the
  quality of life, decrease the pain but do not alter the course of the disease. The
  evolution is unpredictable. The history of a 23 year old male with such a disorder
  is presented hereafter. His clinical course shows a very good response to the administration
  of corticosteroids, whereas no improvement is observed as far as the radiographic
  and isotopic features are concerned.
