input_text: 'Camurati-Engelmann disease: imaging, clinical features and differential
  diagnosis.We report four sporadic and three familial patients with Camurati-Engelmann
  disease. One patient had follow-up examinations over 8 years. Pain in the extremities
  and muscle weakness were common clinical symptoms. Most patients also had cranial
  nerve impairment, hepatosplenomegaly, a waddling gait, and elevated serum alkaline
  phosphatase levels. Long bones were affected in all. We discuss the differential
  diagnosis for this interesting bone entity.'
