input_text: 'Clinical characteristics and identification of a novel TGFB1 variant
  in three unrelated Chinese families with Camurati-Engelmann disease.BACKGROUND:
  To investigate the clinical characteristics and molecular diagnosis of Camurati-Engelmann
  disease (CAEND) in Chinese individuals. METHODS: We recruited six patients aged
  14 to 45 years in three unrelated families with CAEND, including five females and
  one male. Clinical manifestations, biochemical tests, and radiographic examinations
  were analyzed. The TGFB1 gene variants were further identified by Sanger sequencing.
  In addition, one female patient was followed up for 5 years. RESULTS: The onset
  age of the patients ranged from 1 to 6 years. All of them had family histories and
  consisted of an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Gait disturbance, fatigue,
  progressive bone pain, muscle atrophy, and weakness were the main complaints. Laboratory
  examinations revealed that the inflammatory markers were at high levels, in addition
  to the increased bone metabolism indicators. The thickened diaphysis of long bones
  and the narrowed medullary cavity was observed by radiography. Furthermore, bone
  scintigraphy detected abnormal symmetrical radioactive concentrations in the affected
  regions of bone. Sanger sequencing identified a missense heterozygous variant in
  exon 4 of the TGFB1 gene in families 1 and 2, resulting in Arg218Cys, which confirmed
  CAEND. Moreover, one novel variant c.669C > G in exon 4 of the TGFB1 gene harboring
  Cys223Trp was detected in family 3. Subsequent bioinformatics software predicted
  that the novel variant was pathogenic. Of interest, III:2 in family 3 experienced
  heart valve defects and tachycardia at birth, which had never been reported in CAEND
  patients before. Moreover, the response to drug treatment is also full of contradictions
  and is worthy of further study. CONCLUSION: Besides the typical CAEND manifestations,
  the new phenotypic characteristics of tachycardia and heart valve defects were first
  reported in one woman carrying the novel variant p.Cys223Trp in TGFB1 the gene.
  In addition, we demonstrated that increased bone metabolism indicators and inflammatory
  markers may possess auxiliary diagnosis for CAEND.'
