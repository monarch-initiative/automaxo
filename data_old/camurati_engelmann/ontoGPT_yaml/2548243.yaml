input_text: '[Observations on the Camurati-Engelmann syndrome. Demonstration of changes
  of the petrous bone using high-resolution computed tomography].In Camurati-Engelmann
  disease HR-CT can impressively demonstrate the involvement of the skull base and
  also correlate well with the clinical symptoms of deafness, vestibular disturbances
  and facial paralysis. Since conservative treatment with corticosteroids, calcitonin
  and diphosphonates is hardly successful and compression of the cranial nerves practically
  absent, surgical treatment with decompression should be considered. Differential
  diagnosis against other bone affections with deafness depends on age, typical x-ray
  findings, local distribution and clinical signs.'
