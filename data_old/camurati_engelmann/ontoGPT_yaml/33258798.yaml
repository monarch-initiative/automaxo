input_text: Looking for new anabolic treatment from rare diseases of bone formation.Bone
  remodelling is a complex mechanism regulated by osteoclasts and osteoblasts and
  perturbation of this process leads to the onset of diseases, which may be characterised
  by altered bone erosion or formation. In this review, we will describe some bone
  formation-related disorders as sclerosteosis, van Buchem disease, hypophosphatasia
  and Camurati-Engelmann disease. In the past decades, the research focused on these
  rare disorders offered the opportunity to understand important pathways regulating
  bone formation. Thus, the identification of the molecular defects behind the etiopathology
  of these diseases will open the way for new therapeutic approaches applicable also
  to the management of more common bone diseases including osteoporosis.
