input_text: A novel mutation of TGF beta1 in a Chinese family with Camurati-Engelmann
  disease.Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) [OMIM 131300] is a rare autosomal dominant
  disorder characterized by bone pain and osteosclerosis affecting the diaphysis of
  long bones. It has been previously reported that CED is caused by mutations of the
  transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF beta1) gene on chromosome 19q13.1-q13.3.
  Until now, seven mutations (LLL12-13ins, Y81H, R156C, R218C, R218H, H222D, C225R)
  in Australian, French, Belgian, Japanese, and European families have been reported
  and these data showed that there was no correlation between the nature of the mutations
  and the variability of the clinical manifestations. In this study, we found a Chinese
  family with CED and observed some intra-familial clinical variability and symptoms
  that became more severe with the age. A new TGF beta1 mutation (E169K) in exon 2
  was identified in the Chinese family using polymerase chain reaction, direct sequencing
  analysis of PCR products and single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. This
  mutation has not been previously reported in other countries in the world.
