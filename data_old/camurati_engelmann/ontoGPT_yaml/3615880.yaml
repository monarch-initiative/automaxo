input_text: 'Progressive diaphyseal dysplasia (Camurati-Engelmann): radiographic follow-up
  and CT findings.Sixteen patients with progressive diaphyseal dysplasia (PDD) and
  aged six months to 76 years were examined. Fourteen cases were hereditary, two were
  not. The progression of the radiologic manifestations in 13 patients who were followed
  up from 1 to 32 years and the computed tomography (CT) scans from five patients
  were obtained. The progression of PDD was slow and unpredictable, from minimal endosteal
  thickening of the mid-diaphyses in one pair of long bones to severe sclerosis of
  long bones, skull, and vertebrae. The severity of the osseous changes was not age
  dependent. A six-stage system was used to grade the severity of involvement and
  progression of PDD. CT scans demonstrated muscle mass that was preserved and showed
  the distribution of the osteosclerotic process, which was irregular and inhomogeneous.
  CT scanning was advantageous over plain radiography in this respect. Endosteal involvement
  was more extensive than periosteal thickening. CT scans also showed a distinct pattern
  of vertebral sclerosis that was confined to the posterior areas of the vertebral
  body and arches. In light of the paucity of characteristic clinical signs of PDD,
  the recognition of the radiologic features is mandatory for the diagnosis of this
  disease.'
