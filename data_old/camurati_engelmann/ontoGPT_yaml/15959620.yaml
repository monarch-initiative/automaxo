input_text: Camurati-Engelmann disease (progressive diaphyseal dysplasia) in a Moroccan
  family.We report on a 46-year-old mother of Moroccan origin, suffering mainly from
  painful, swollen legs, and her 26-year-old son who had experienced intense pain
  in his legs, without fever, for approximately 3 years. They did not have dysmorphic
  features or abnormal gaits. Radiographic studies of the mother revealed diaphyseal
  sclerosis of the tibia and spondylosis of the thoracal and lumbar vertebrae. The
  son had sclerosis of the diaphyses of the metacarpalia of the left hand, the femur
  and the fibula. The other parts of the skeleton were normal. Several osteosclerotic/hyperostotic
  disorders, such as melorheostosis (present mostly in sporadic cases and affecting
  lower extremities) and van Buchem's disease (autosomal recessive and commonly affecting
  the mandible) were considered as a diagnosis in the proposita. However, similar
  symptoms in the son of the proposita suggested an autosomal dominant inheritance
  pattern. This brought us to the diagnosis of progressive diaphyseal dysplasia (PDD)
  or Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized
  by limb pain, reduced muscle mass, weakness, a waddling gait, progressive periosteal
  and endosteal sclerosis of the diaphyses of the long bones and sclerosis of the
  skull base. Mutations in the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 gene on chromosome
  19q13.1 have been reported to cause this disorder. The diagnosis of PDD/CED in this
  family was confirmed at the molecular level by detection of a C-to-T transition
  at position 466, leading to an arginine-to-cysteine amino acid change (position
  156) in exon 2 of the transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFB1) gene.
