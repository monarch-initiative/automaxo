input_text: "Camurati-Engelmann disease presenting as 'juvenile otosclerosis'.Camurati-Engelmann
  disease (CED, MIM # 131300) was diagnosed in a 27-year-old woman, who had pain in
  her lower legs. There was no history of hearing loss (or CED) in her family. She
  had been suffering from progressive hearing impairment since childhood. Serial audiograms
  demonstrated progressive mixed hearing loss from the age of 11 years onwards, for
  which she underwent successful stapes surgery bilaterally at the age of 13-18 years.
  Clinical ('juvenile') otosclerosis was found with stapes footplate fixation. Unfortunately,
  the sensorineural hearing loss component proved to be progressive bilaterally after
  surgery. At the age of 30 years, she experienced more rapid deterioration of her
  hearing loss in the right ear and episodes of vertigo. Vestibular examinations demonstrated
  progressive vestibular impairment 'otospongiotic' lesions with encroachment on the
  cochlear and vestibular labyrinth were found on high resolution CT scans at the
  age of 40 years; the internal auditory canal was normal bilaterally. CED may have
  formed a chance combination with juvenile otosclerosis in our patient, or otosclerosis
  may be part of the CED phenotype."
