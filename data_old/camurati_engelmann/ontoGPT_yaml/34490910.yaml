input_text: 'Alteration of Bone Density, Microarchitecture, and Strength in Patients
  with Camurati-Engelmann Disease: Assessed by HR-pQCT.Camurati-Engelmann disease
  (CED) is a rare autosomal-dominant skeletal dysplasia caused by mutations in the
  transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFB1) gene. In this study, a retrospective review
  of patients with CED evaluated at Peking Union Medical College Hospital in Beijing,
  China, between November 30, 2000 and November 30, 2020 was conducted. Data including
  demographic data, manifestations, and examination results were characterized. Furthermore,
  bone geometry, density, and microarchitecture were assessed and bone strength was
  estimated by HR-pQCT. Results showed the median age at onset was 2.5 years. Common
  manifestations included pain in the lower limbs (94%, 17/18), abnormal gait (89%,
  16/18), genu valgum (89%, 16/18), reduced subcutaneous fat (78%, 14/18), delayed
  puberty (73%, 8/11), muscle weakness (67%, 12/18), hearing loss (39%, 7/18), hepatosplenomegaly
  (39%, 7/18), exophthalmos or impaired vision or visual field defect (33%, 6/18),
  and anemia (33%, 7/18). Twenty-five percent (4/16) of patients had short stature.
  Serum level of alkaline phosphatase was elevated in 41% (7/17) of patients whereas
  beta-C-terminal telopeptide was elevated in 91% of patients (10/11). Among 12 patients,
  the Z-scores of two patients were greater than 2.5 at the femur neck and the Z-scores
  of five patients were lower than -2.5 at the femur neck and/or lumbar spine. HR-pQCT
  results showed lower volumetric BMD (vBMD), altered bone microstructure and lower
  estimated bone strength at the distal radius and tibia in patients with CED compared
  with controls. In addition, total volume bone mineral density and cortical volumetric
  bone mineral density at the radius were negatively correlated with age in patients
  with CED, but positively correlated with age in controls. In conclusion, the largest
  case series of CED with characterized clinical features in a Chinese population
  was reported here. In addition, HR-pQCT was used to investigate bone microstructure
  at the distal radius and tibia in nine patients with CED, and the alteration of
  bone density, microstructure, and strength was shown for the first time.   2021
