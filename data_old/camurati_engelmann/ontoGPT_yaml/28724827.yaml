input_text: Angioid streaks in a case of Camurati-Engelmann disease.Camurati-Engelmann
  disease (CED) is a rare autosomal dominant disease with various phenotypic expressions.
  The hallmark of the disease is bilateral symmetric diaphyseal hyperostosis of the
  long bones with progressive involvement of the metaphysis. Ocular manifestations
  occur rarely and mainly result from bony overgrowth of the orbit and optic canal
  stenosis. We report a case of CED showing angioid streaks (ASs) in both fundi with
  no macular involvement and discuss the possible theories of the pathogenesis of
  AS in this disease.
