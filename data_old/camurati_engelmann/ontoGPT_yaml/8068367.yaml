input_text: "[Otolaryngological aspects of Camurati-Engelmann disease (progressive
  diaphyseal dysplasia): review of literature and report of one case].Camurati-Engelmann's
  disease (progressive diaphyseal dysplasia) is a rare hereditary condition characterized
  by symmetrical hyperostosis of the long bones and the skull-base, myopathies and
  neurological disturbances. So far, little more than one hundred cases have been
  reported. The diagnosis is based on radiological imaging (traditional X rays and
  CT scan) and family history. Our patient (a 15-year-old male) had high-grade skull-base
  hyperostosis producing audiological signs, such as progressive deafness, persistent
  otorrhea and otalgia with progressive stenosis of the external acoustic meatus."
