input_text: "Correlative bone imaging in a case of Schnitzler's syndrome and brief
  review of the literature.UNLABELLED: Schnitzler's syndrome is a rare disease characterized
  by a monoclonal IgM (or IgG) paraprotein, a nonpruritic urticarial skin rash, and
  2 (or 3) of the following: recurrent fever, objective signs of abnormal bone remodeling,
  elevated CRP level or leukocytosis, and a neutrophilic infiltrate on skin biopsy.
  It responds well to treatment with the interleukine-1-inhibitor anakinra. We report
  the bone scintigraphy and MRI findings in a 45 years old man with this syndrome
  and compare them with data from the literature. CONCLUSION: None of the imaging
  findings are specific, but they lead to a differential diagnosis including infiltrative
  diseases (e.g. systemic mastocytosis or Erdheim-Chester disease) and dysplastic
  diseases (e.g. melorheostosis, Camurati-Engelmann disease or van Buchem disease).
  The bone scintigraphy pattern may be very suggestive of the correct diagnosis and
  of bone involvement in this syndrome."
