input_text: "Significant Improvement After Surgery for a Symptomatic Osteoblastoma
  in a Patient with Camurati-Engelmann Disease: Case Report and Literature Review.Camurati-Engelmann
  disease (CED) is a rare, progressive diaphyseal dysplasia characterized as diaphyseal
  hyperostosis and sclerosis of the long bones. Corticosteroids, bisphosphonates,
  and losartan have been reported to be effective systemic medications used to reduce
  CED symptoms. There are no reports of osteoblastoma in patients with CED, and osteoblastoma
  in the distal radius is rare. We present a patient diagnosed with CED, based on
  radiological and histological examinations, at 11 years old. At 22 years old, she
  experienced severe pain in her right forearm and was treated with bisphosphonate,
  losartan, and prednisolone; however, the pain continued. An expansive and sclerotic
  lesion at the distal radius was observed on radiography. A follow-up plain radiograph
  indicated that the lesion was growing. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography
  revealed solitary, intense radiotracer uptake, and a biopsy and surgical resection
  were performed due to suspected malignancy. Pathologic analysis showed anastomosing
  bony trabeculae rimmed by osteoblasts observed in a loose fibrovascular stroma.
  The lesion was diagnosed as an osteoblastoma. Following bone excision and artificial
  bone grafting, the patient's severe pain almost completely disappeared. At final
  follow-up, no evidence of osteoblastoma recurrence was noted. To our knowledge,
  this is the first case report of osteoblastoma arising in a patient with CED. Bone
  excision and artificial bone grafting may be a treatment option for local symptomatic
  osteoblastoma in patients with CED."
