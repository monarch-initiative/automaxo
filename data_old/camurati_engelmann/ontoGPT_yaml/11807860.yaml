input_text: 'Camurati-Engelmann disease type II: progressive diaphyseal dysplasia
  with striations of the bones.We recently found mutations of the transforming growth
  factor beta 1 (TGF-beta1) gene (TGFB1) in 9 families, in which progressive diaphyseal
  dysplasia (Camurati-Engelmann disease) is segregating [Kinoshita et al., 2000: Nat
  Genetics 26:19-20]. During the study, we encountered two unrelated girls, aged 17
  and 11 years, who had clinical manifestations of the disorder, such as marfanoid
  habitus, waddling gait, muscular weakness, intense leg pain, flexion contracture
  of the hip and knee joints, delayed sexual development, increased serum alkaline
  phosphatase levels, and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rates. Radiographic
  studies in the two girls demonstrated not only diaphyseal dysplasia (cortical thickening
  of the diaphyses) resembling that of progressive diaphyseal dysplasia but also metaphyseal
  expansion of the long bones, coarse and thick trabeculae of the long and short tubular
  bones, striations in the spinal, pelvic, and long bones, and cranial sclerosis restricted
  to the petromastoid regions. These radiographic changes were overall identical with
  those seen in hyperostosis generalisata with striations of the bones rather than
  those in progressive diaphyseal dysplasia. Polymerase chain reaction-direct sequencing
  of all exons and their flanking regions of TGFB1 did not detect any mutations. PCR-single
  strand conformational polymorphism analysis of the TGF-beta type 1 receptor gene
  (TGFBR1) did not demonstrate any aberrant DNA fragments. We concluded from these
  findings that the two girls we described belong to a unique entity distinct from
  either of the two disorders.'
