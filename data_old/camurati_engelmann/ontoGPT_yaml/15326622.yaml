input_text: 'Marked phenotypic variability in progressive diaphyseal dysplasia (Camurati-Engelmann
  disease): report of a four-generation pedigree, identification of a mutation in
  TGFB1, and review.Progressive diaphyseal dysplasia (PDD) (Camurati-Engelmann disease)
  is an autosomal dominant craniotubular dysplasia characterized by hyperostosis and
  sclerosis of the diaphyses of the long bones and the skull. Mutations in transforming
  growth factor beta-1 (TGFB1) were recently found in patients with PDD. We report
  on a four-generation pedigree with seven individuals affected by PDD, linkage and
  mutational analysis results, and review the literature. This pedigree demonstrates
  the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, remarkable variation in expressivity,
  and reduced penetrance. The most severely affected individual had progression of
  mild skull hyperostosis to severe skull thickening and cranial nerve compression
  over 30 years. His carrier father remained asymptomatic into his ninth decade and
  had no radiographic hyperostosis or sclerosis of the bones. Symptomatic relatives
  presented with lower limb pain and weakness. They were initially diagnosed with
  a variety of other conditions. Two of the symptomatic individuals were treated successfully
  with prednisone. We genotyped 7 markers from chromosome region 19q13.1-13.3 in 15
  relatives and confirmed linkage to this region in this family. We screened the TGFB1
  gene for mutations and identified a missense mutation resulting in an R218H substitution
  in the affected individuals, the asymptomatic obligate carrier, and another unaffected
  relative. We genotyped the family for seven known TGFB1 polymorphisms and a novel
  TAAA tetranucleotide repeat in intron 1. These polymorphisms did not appear to account
  for the variability in disease severity in this family. Our review illustrates how
  the disorder can significantly compromise health. Cranial involvement, which occurs
  in 61% of patients, can be severe, entrapping cranial nerves or causing increased
  intracranial pressure. Therapy with corticosteroids should be attempted in all symptomatic
  patients.'
