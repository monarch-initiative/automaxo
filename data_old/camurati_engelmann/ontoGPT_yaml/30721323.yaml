input_text: Camurati-Engelmann Disease.Camurati-Engelmann disease or progressive diaphyseal
  dysplasia is a rare autosomal dominant sclerosing bone dysplasia. Mainly the skull
  and the diaphyses of the long tubular bones are affected. Clinically, the patients
  suffer from bone pain, easy fatigability, and decreased muscle mass and weakness
  in the proximal parts of the lower limbs resulting in gait disturbances. The disease-causing
  mutations are located within the TGFbeta-1 gene and expected to or thought to disrupt
  the binding between TGFbeta1 and its latency-associated peptide resulting in an
  increased signaling of the pathway and subsequently accelerated bone turnover. In
  preclinical studies, it was shown that targeting the type I receptor ameliorates
  the high bone turnover. In patients, treatment options are currently mostly limited
  to corticosteroids that may relieve the pain, and improve the muscle weakness and
  fatigue. In this review, the clinical and radiological characteristics as well as
  the molecular genetics of this condition are discussed.
