input_text: Linkage analysis for prenatal diagnosis in a familial case of Stickler
  syndrome. The Stickler syndrome is among the most common heritable disorders of
  connective tissue. The syndrome fully expressed clinical phenotype includes the
  degeneration of the vitreous gel and retina, frequently associated with myopia,
  accompanied by non-ocular features, such as craniofacial dysmorphisms or malformations,
  hearing impairment, skeletal dysplasia and progressive arthropathy. So far, mutations
  at three collagen loci, COL2A1, COL11A1 and COL11A2, have been found in Stickler
  syndrome patients, with about two thirds of investigated familial cases found to
  be associated to COL2A1 gene mutations. We report on a three generation family in
  which a diagnosis of Stickler syndrome was made and linkage analysis suggested COL2A1
  to be the causing gene. These data permitted us to perform two prenatal diagnosis
  analysing the 3'VNTR polymorphism of the involved gene on amniocytes' DNA and to
  provide the family with genetic counselling and paediatric support at the delivery.
