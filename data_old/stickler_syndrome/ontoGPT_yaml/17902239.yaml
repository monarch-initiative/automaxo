input_text: Orthodontic treatment of a patient with Stickler syndrome. Stickler syndrome
  (MIM 108300, 604841, 184840) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by midfacial
  flattening and variable disorders of vision, hearing and articulation. There are
  three types of the syndrome caused by mutations in different genes (type 1, COL2A1;
  type 2, COL11A1; and type 3, COL11A2). About 20% of type 1 patients have cleft palate
  or bifid uvula, but there have been no case reports of orthodontic treatment of
  this syndrome so far. The Japanese female patient presented here with Stickler syndrome
  was characterized by a flat midface and had high myopia, sensorineural hearing loss,
  enlarged joints, and cleft of the soft palate. She had fairly small SNA and SNB
  angles and a steep mandibular plane with an enlarged gonial angle. The incisors
  of both arches were retroclined, and a large overjet and overbite were noted. Orthodontic
  treatment was initiated at 11 years of age using a lingual arch appliance followed
  by an edgewise multibracket appliance. Stable functional occlusion was obtained
  after the treatment. Most of the other seven Stickler syndrome patients exhibited
  pretreatment characteristics of small SNA and SNB angles, steep mandibular planes,
  enlarged gonial angles, and retroclined incisors of both arches, demonstrating the
  characteristic skeletal and occlusal features of this syndrome.
