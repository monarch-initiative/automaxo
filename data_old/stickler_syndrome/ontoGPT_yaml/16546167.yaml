input_text: "A mouse model for Stickler's syndrome: ocular phenotype of mice carrying
  a targeted heterozygous inactivation of type II (pro)collagen gene (Col2a1). The
  influences of targeted heterozygous inactivation of type II (pro)collagen gene (Col2a1)
  on eye structures in the 15-month-old C57BL/6JOlaHsd mouse was studied. The eyes
  were collected from C57BL mice heterozygous for a targeted inactivation of one allele
  of the Col2a1 gene (Col2a1(+/-) mice). The eyes of C57BL mice with normal gene alleles
  were used as controls (Col2a1(+/+) mice). Ocular histology was analyzed from tissue
  sections, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, toluidine blue and alcian blue. Type
  II collagen was localized by immunohistochemistry. Hyaluronan (HA) was stained utilizing
  the biotinylated complex of the hyaluronan-binding region of aggrecan and link protein
  (bHABC). The anterior segment of the eye was well-formed in both genotypes, but
  typical folding of ciliary processes was decreased, while increased stromal extracellular
  matrix vacuolization was seen in the Col2a1(+/-) mice. In the lens of these mice,
  subcapsular extracellular matrix changes were observed. Differences in retinal structures
  or the number of the eyes with retinal detachment were not detected between the
  genotypes. In Col2a1(+/-) mice, staining for type II collagen was weaker in cornea,
  ciliary body, iris, lens, vitreous, retina, choroid and sclera than in the control
  mice. HA staining was detected in the extraocular tissues, ciliary body, iris and
  the choroid of both genotypes. HA staining was observed only in the vitreous body
  of the control animals. Heterozygous inactivation of Col2a1 gene causes structural
  defects in the murine eye. The observed structural changes in the ciliary body,
  lens and vitreous of the Col2a1(+/-) mice may represent ocular features found in
  the human Stickler syndrome, where the abnormalities result from COL2A1 gene mutations
  which lead to functional haploinsufficiency."
