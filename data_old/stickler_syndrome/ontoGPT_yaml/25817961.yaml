input_text: 'Stickler syndrome. Epidemiology of retinal detachment. OBJECTIVE: A review
  was performed on all patients with Stickler syndrome that had been treated in our
  Centre since it was diagnosed, in order to evaluate the risk of suffering a retinal
  detachment (RD). METHODS: A total of 14 patients, diagnosed by clinical criteria,
  were included. The following variables were evaluated: age, gender, ocular background,
  follow-up, initial and final visual acuity (VA), optical prescription, prophylactic
  treatment, surgery and techniques performed. The risk age to suffer a RD, as well
  as cataracts, was determined by using the Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis.
  RESULTS: From a total of 5 men and 9 women, the median initial VA was 0.35, which
  was the same as the final VA. The median optical prescription was -9.5 D myopia.
  The median of follow-up was 7 years. Ocular background was 4 RD cases and 2 Lasik
  surgeries. The operations performed were 8 RD, 12 cataract, 2 glaucoma, 2 macular
  hole, and one endotropia. The median age of RD was 20 years and cataract 34 years.
  As regards surgical tecnique, 4 scleral buckle cases, and 4 scleral buckle+pars
  plana vitrectomy cases were formed. The prophylactic treatments performed were:
  one scleral buckle case, 4 endolaser photocoagulation, and one cryotherapy. Two
  of which presented with RD. CONCLUSION: In the series presented, retinal detachment
  in Stickler syndrome mainly occurs in the second decade of life, with cataracts
  mainly developing in the fourth decade.'
