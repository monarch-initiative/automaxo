input_text: Exon-Trapping Assay Improves Clinical Interpretation of COL11A1 and COL11A2
  Intronic Variants in Stickler Syndrome Type 2 and Otospondylomegaepiphyseal Dysplasia.
  Stickler syndrome (SS) is a hereditary connective tissue disorder affecting bones,
  eyes, and hearing. Type 2 SS and the SS variant otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia
  (OSMED) are caused by deleterious variants in COL11A1 and COL11A2, respectively.
  In both genes, available database information indicates a high rate of potentially
  deleterious intronic variants, but published evidence of their biological effect
  is usually insufficient for a definite clinical interpretation. We report four previously
  unpublished intronic variants in COL11A1 (c.2241 + 5G>T, c.2809 - 2A>G, c.3168 +
  5G>C) and COL11A2 (c.4392 + 1G>A) identified in type 2 SS/OSMED individuals. The
  pathogenic effect of these variants was first predicted in silico and then investigated
  by an exon-trapping assay. We demonstrated that all variants can induce exon in-frame
  deletions, which lead to the synthesis of shorter collagen XI alpha1 or 2 chains.
  Lacking residues are located in the alpha-triple helical region, which has a crucial
  role in regulating collagen fibrillogenesis. In conclusion, this study suggests
  that these alternative COL11A1 and COL11A2 transcripts might result in aberrant
  triple helix collagen. Our approach may help to improve the diagnostic molecular
  pathway of COL11-related disorders.
