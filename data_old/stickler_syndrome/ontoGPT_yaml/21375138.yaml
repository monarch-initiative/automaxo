input_text: 'Stickler syndrome in Pierre-Robin sequence prenatal ultrasonographic
  diagnosis and postnatal therapy: two cases report. The Pierre-Robin Syndrome (PRS)
  is a rare congenital abnormality, with an approximately 1/30,000 estimated rate,
  characterized by the presence of the combination of mandibular hypoplasia (micrognathia
  or small jaw), glossoptosis (retrusion of the tongue into the pharyngeal airway)
  and, often, a posterior cleft of the secondary palate. It may be an isolated occurrence
  or part of a more complex syndrome and it is associated with long-term respiratory,
  nutritional, and developmental difficulties. Stickler syndrome (SS) is a rare autosomal
  dominant connective tissue disorder estimated to affect approximately 1/7500 newborns.
  It is diagnosed clinically and, at present, there is no consensus on a minimal clinical
  diagnostic criterion. The most frequent diagnosis in patients with syndromic Pierre
  Robin sequence is Stickler syndrome, which may be complicated by congenital high
  myopia and substantial risk of retinal detachment. However, cases of Stickler syndrome
  with probable visual complications are rarely identified among this group of patients
  by members of the cleft team. The patient had an acute unilateral hydrops, with
  a monolateral keratoconus. The ocular abnormalities included: severe myopia, abnormalities
  of the vitreous, and high risk of retinal detachment (with subsequent blindness).
  We report two extremely rare cases of prenatal diagnosis of PRS and SS, prematurely
  identified by prenatal ultrasonography and successively managed by oculists ophthalmogists.'
