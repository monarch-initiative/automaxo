input_text: Hereditary arthro-ophthalmopathy (Stickler syndrome). We report a 34-year-old
  woman with hereditary arthro-ophthalmopathy (HAO; Stickler syndrome). This disorder
  is a rare inherited generalized connective tissue disorder involving the eyes, facial
  structures and the skeleton, resulting from defective type II collagen formation.
  There is premature degenerative arthritis and osteopenia with increased incidence
  of fractures. The differential diagnosis and treatment for bone loss are discussed.
