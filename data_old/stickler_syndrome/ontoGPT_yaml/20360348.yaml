input_text: 'Syndromes of the first and second branchial arches, part 2: syndromes.
  A variety of congenital syndromes affecting the face occur due to defects involving
  the first and second BAs. Radiographic evaluation of craniofacial deformities is
  necessary to define aberrant anatomy, plan surgical procedures, and evaluate the
  effects of craniofacial growth and surgical reconstructions. High-resolution CT
  has proved vital in determining the nature and extent of these syndromes. The radiologic
  evaluation of syndromes of the first and second BA should begin first by studying
  a series of isolated defects (cleft lip with or without CP, micrognathia, and EAC
  atresia) that compose the major features of these syndromes and allow a more specific
  diagnosis. After discussion of these defects and the associated embryology, we discuss
  PRS, HFM, ACS, TCS, Stickler syndrome, and VCFS.'
