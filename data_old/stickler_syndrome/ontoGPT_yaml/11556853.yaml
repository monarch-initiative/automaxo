input_text: 'Auditory dysfunction in Stickler syndrome. OBJECTIVES: To characterize
  the natural history and possible mechanisms of hearing loss in Stickler syndrome
  (OMIM 108300; or hereditary progressive arthro-ophthalmopathy) and to determine
  if the auditory phenotype is a useful discriminating feature for the differential
  diagnosis of this group of disorders. DESIGN: Multifamily study. SETTING: Outpatient
  audiology and otolaryngology clinics at the Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center
  of the National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Md. SUBJECTS: Forty-six affected
  individuals from 29 different families segregating Stickler syndrome. INTERVENTIONS:
  Clinical audiologic and otolaryngological examinations were performed on all individuals,
  including pure-tone audiometry, speech audiometry, and middle ear immittance testing.
  Otoacoustic emissions, auditory brainstem response, infrared video electronystagmography,
  and temporal bone computed tomography were performed on a subset of participants.
  RESULTS: The hearing loss was most often sensorineural in adults, and approximately
  28 (60%) of the 46 adult patients had 2 or more thresholds greater than the corresponding
  95th percentile values for an age-matched, otologically normal population. The hearing
  loss most often affected high frequencies (4000-8000 Hz) and was generally no more
  progressive than that due to age-related hearing loss. Type A(D) tympanograms (classification
  using the Jerger model), indicating hypermobile middle ear systems, were observed
  in 21 (46%) of the 46 affected individuals. Computed tomography of the temporal
  bones revealed no inner ear malformations in 19 affected individuals. CONCLUSIONS:
  The hypermobile middle ear systems observed in ears with normal-appearing tympanic
  membranes represent a novel finding for Stickler syndrome and are likely to be a
  useful diagnostic feature for this disorder. The overall sensorineural hearing loss
  in type I Stickler syndrome is typically mild and not significantly progressive.
  It is less severe than that reported for types II and III Stickler syndrome linked
  to COL11A2 (OMIM 120290) and COL11A1 (OMIM 120280) mutations, respectively, or the
  closely related Marshall syndrome. This difference will be a useful discriminatory
  feature in the differential diagnosis of this group of disorders.'
