input_text: 'Radiographic and tomographic analysis in patients with stickler syndrome
  type I. OBJECTIVE: To further investigate the underlying pathology of axial and
  appendicular skeletal abnormalities such as painful spine stiffness, gait abnormalities,
  early onset osteoarthritis and patellar instability in patients with Stickler syndrome
  type I. Radiographic and tomographic analyses were organized. METHODS: From a series
  of Stickler syndrome patients followed from early life to late childhood. Ten patients
  (6 boys and four girls of different ethnic origins were consistent with the diagnosis
  of Stickler syndrome type I ). Phenotypic characterization was the baseline tool
  applied for all patients and genotypic correlation was performed on four families
  RESULTS: A constellation of axial abnormalities namely; anterolateral ossification
  of the anterior longitudinal spinal ligament with subsequent fusion of two cervical
  vertebrae, early onset Forestier disease (progressive spinal hyperostosis with subsequent
  vertebral fusion on top of bridging osteophytes and "Bamboo-like spine" resembling
  ankylosing spondylitis) and severe premature spine degeneration were evident. Appendicular
  abnormalities in connection with generalized epiphyseal dysplasia were the underlying
  aetiology in patients with Intoeing gait and femoral anteversion, early onset severe
  osteoarthritis of the weight bearing joint. Remarkable trochleo-patellar dysplasia
  secondary to severe osteoarthritis causing effectively the development of patellar
  instability was additional pathology. Mutation of COL2A1 has been confirmed as the
  causative gene for Stickler syndrome type I CONCLUSION: We concluded that conventional
  radiographs and the molecular determination of a COL2A1 in patients with (Stickler
  syndrome type I) are insufficient tools to explain the reasons behind the tremendous
  magnitude of axial and appendicular skeletal abnormalities. We were able to modify
  the criteria of the clinical phenotype as designated by Rose et al in accordance
  with the novel axial and appendicular criteria as emerged from within our current
  study.'
