input_text: 'Familial retinal detachment associated with COL2A1 exon 2 and FZD4 mutations.
  BACKGROUND:   To characterize the clinical and genetic abnormalities within two
  Australian pedigrees with high incidences of retinal detachment and visual disability.
  DESIGN:   Prospective review of two extended Australian pedigrees with high rates
  of retinal detachment. PARTICIPANTS:   Twenty-two family members from two extended
  Australian pedigrees with high rates of retinal detachment were examined. METHODS:   A
  full ophthalmic history and examination were performed, and DNA was analysed by
  linkage analysis and mutation screening. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:   Characterization
  of a causative hereditary gene mutation in each family. RESULTS:   All affected
  family members of one pedigree carried a C192A COL2A1 exon 2 mutation. None of the
  affected family members had early-onset arthritis, hearing abnormalities, abnormal
  clefting or facial features characteristic of classical Stickler syndrome. All affected
  members of the familial exudative vitreoretinopathy pedigree carried a 957delG FZD4
  mutation. CONCLUSIONS:   Patients with retinal detachment and a positive family
  history should be investigated for heritable conditions associated with retinal
  detachment such as Stickler syndrome and familial exudative vitreoretinopathy. The
  absence of non-ocular features of Stickler syndrome should raise the possibility
  of mutations in exon 2 of COL2A1. Similarly, late-onset familial exudative vitreoretinopathy
  may appear more like a rhegmatogenous detachment and not be correctly diagnosed.
  When a causative gene mutation is identified, cascade genetic screening of the family
  will facilitate genetic counselling and screening of high-risk relatives, allowing
  targeted management of the pre-detachment changes in affected patients.'
