input_text: 'Audiometric characteristics of two Dutch families with non-ocular Stickler
  syndrome (COL11A2). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate hearing impairment and cochlear function
  in non-ocular Stickler syndrome. STUDY DESIGN: Multifamily study. PATIENTS & METHODS:
  Ten patients from two different families with non-ocular Stickler syndrome (Stickler
  syndrome type 3) were included. Six members of the first family and four members
  of the second family participated in this study. Otorhinolaryngologic examinations
  were performed. Pure-tone and speech audiograms were obtained. Longitudinal analysis
  was performed. Psychophysical measurements, including loudness scaling, gap detection,
  difference limen for frequency and speech perception in noise were administered
  to assess cochlear function at a deeper level. RESULTS: Affected individuals in
  the first family were carriers of a heterozygous splice donor mutation in the COL11A2
  gene. Affected individuals in the second family were carriers of a novel heterozygous
  missense mutation in COL11A2. Both families showed bilateral, non-progressive hearing
  impairment with childhood onset. The severity of the hearing impairment exhibited
  inter- and intrafamilial variability and was mostly mild to moderate. The results
  of the psychophysical measurements were similar to those previously published for
  DFNA8/12 (TECTA) and DFNA13 (COL11A2) patients and thus consistent with an intra-cochlear
  conductive hearing impairment. This is in line with the theory that mutations in
  COL11A2 affect tectorial membrane function. CONCLUSION: Hearing impairment in non-ocular
  Stickler syndrome is characterized by non-progressive hearing loss, present since
  childhood, and mostly mild to moderate in severity. Psychophysical measurements
  in non-ocular Stickler patients were suggestive of intra-cochlear conductive hearing
  impairment.'
