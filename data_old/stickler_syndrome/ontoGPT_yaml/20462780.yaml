input_text: Early-onset progressive osteoarthritis with hereditary progressive ophtalmopathy
  or Stickler syndrome. Stickler syndrome is a group of rare genetic conditions (incidence,
  1/7500 births) related to mutations in the collagen genes. Both the mutations and
  the clinical features vary widely across affected patients. The main manifestations
  are craniofacial birth defects, bone and joint symptoms, ocular abnormalities, and
  hearing loss. Stickler syndrome may be revealed at birth (25% of cases) by a combination
  of cleft palate, retrognathism, and micrognathism known as Pierre Robin sequence,
  which may cause neonatal respiratory problems. The ocular abnormalities include
  severe myopia, abnormalities of the vitreous, and a high risk of retinal detachment
  (60% of cases), which may cause blindness (4% of cases). Severe hearing loss with
  onset in early childhood may impair performance at school. Osteoarthritis (75% of
  patients) with onset before 30 years of age is a severe manifestation that causes
  chronic hip and low back pain and functional impairments. Joint replacement surgery
  is often required. The risk associated with multiple anesthesias is highest in patients
  with craniofacial defects. The bone status may deserve to be evaluated, as the combination
  of genetic abnormalities and physical impairments may promote bone loss. Clinicians
  should be cognizant of Stickler syndrome so that they can detect the disease in
  patients and their family members, prevent functional impairments, organize a multidisciplinary
  management strategy, and arrange for genetic counseling.
