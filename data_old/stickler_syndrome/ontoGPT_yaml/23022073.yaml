input_text: Applying and testing the conveniently optimized enzyme mismatch cleavage
  method to clinical DNA diagnosis. Establishing a simple and effective mutation screening
  method is one of the most compelling problems with applying genetic diagnosis to
  clinical use. Because there is no reliable and inexpensive screening system, amplifying
  by PCR and performing direct sequencing of every coding exon is the gold standard
  strategy even today. However, this approach is expensive and time consuming, especially
  when gene size or sample number is large. Previously, we developed CEL nuclease
  mediated heteroduplex incision with polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver
  staining (CHIPS) as an ideal simple mutation screening system constructed with only
  conventional apparatuses and commercially available reagents. In this study, we
  evaluated the utility of CHIPS technology for genetic diagnosis in clinical practice
  by applying this system to screening for the COL2A1, WRN and RPS6KA3 mutations in
  newly diagnosed patients with Stickler syndrome (autosomal dominant inheritance),
  Werner syndrome (autosomal recessive inheritance) and Coffin-Lowry syndrome (X-linked
  inheritance), respectively. In all three genes, CHIPS detected all DNA variations
  including disease causative mutations within a day. Direct sequencing of all coding
  exons of these genes confirmed 100% sensitivity and specificity. We demonstrate
  high sensitivity, high cost performance and reliability of this simple system, with
  compatibility to all inheritance modes. Because of its low technology, CHIPS is
  ready to use and potentially disseminate to any laboratories in the world.
