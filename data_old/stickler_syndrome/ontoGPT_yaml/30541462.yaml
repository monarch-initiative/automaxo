input_text: 'Pathogenic gene screening in 91 Chinese patients with short stature of
  unknown etiology with a targeted next-generation sequencing panel. BACKGROUND: Dwarfism
  is a common severe growth disorder, but the etiology is unclear in the majority
  of cases. Recombinant human growth hormone may be a treatment option, but it has
  limited efficacy. The currently known laboratory assays do not meet the precision
  requirements for clinical diagnosis. Here, we have constructed a targeted next-generation
  sequencing (NGS) panel of selected genes that are suspected to be associated with
  dwarfism for genetic screening. METHODS: Genetic screening of 91 children with short
  stature of unknown etiology was performed with the help of the NGS panel. All the
  coding regions and exon-intron boundaries of 166 genes were included in the panel.
  To clarify the pathogenicity of these mutations, their clinical data were reviewed
  and analyzed. RESULTS: The assay identified p.A72G, p.I282V, and p.P491S variants
  of the PTPN11 gene and a p.I437T variant of the SOS1 gene in 4 cases with Noonan
  syndrome. A frameshift mutation (p.D2407fs) of the ACAN gene was identified in a
  case of idiopathic short stature with moderately advanced bone age. A p.R904C variant
  of the COL2A1 gene was found in a patient, who was accordingly diagnosed with Stickler
  syndrome. Severe short stature without limb deformity was associated with a p.G11A
  variant of HOXD13. In addition, we evaluated evidence that a p.D401N variant of
  the COMP gene may cause multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings
  suggest that syndromes, particularly Noonan syndrome, may be overlooked due to atypical
  clinical features. This gene panel has been verified to be effective for the rapid
  screening of genetic etiologies associated with short stature and for guiding precision
  medicine-based clinical management.'
