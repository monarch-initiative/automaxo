input_text: "The Stickler syndrome: case reports and literature review. BACKGROUND:
  Stickler syndrome is a progressive autosomal-dominant connective tissue disorder
  with numerous ocular and systemic manifestations. Ocular abnormalities include:
  retinal detachment, glaucoma, premature cataracts, high myopia, optically empty
  vitreous cavities, and retinal pigmentary changes. Systemic signs include premature
  osteoarthritis and hearing loss, as well as numerous skeletal and facial malformations,
  such as maxillofacial hypoplasia and cleft palate. While many affected patients
  are diagnosed as children who exhibit obvious skeletal abnormalities, diagnosis
  can be delayed due to variable expressivity. In some cases, systemic problems may
  be mild or nonexistent. Thus, Stickler syndrome should be considered in the differential
  diagnosis of any patient who manifests a strong family history of premature cataracts,
  glaucoma, or retinal detachment. CASE REPORTS: Three patients representing three
  different generations within the same family manifested severe ocular manifestations
  of Stickler syndrome, and minimal systemic involvement: a 56-year-old woman, her
  25-year-old son, and the first patient's 8-year-old grandson. CONCLUSIONS: Our cases
  highlight the need for appropriate vigilance in examining patients with a strong
  family history of common ocular disorders such as cataract, glaucoma, and retinal
  detachment. By recognizing the ocular and sometimes subtle systemic signs of Stickler
  syndrome, optometrists can play a vital role in limiting vision loss and improving
  the quality of life of affected patients and family members."
