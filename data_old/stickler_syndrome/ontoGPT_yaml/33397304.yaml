input_text: 'Choroidal and peripapillary changes in high myopic eyes with Stickler
  syndrome. BACKGROUND: To compare different clinical and Spectral-Domain Optical
  Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) features of high myopic eyes with Stickler syndrome
  (STL) with matched controls. METHODS: Patients with genetically confirmed STL with
  axial length >= 26 mm and controls matched for axial length were included. The following
  data were obtained from SD-OCT scans and fundus photography: choroidal and retinal
  thickness (respectively, CT and RT), peripapillary atrophy area (PAA), presence
  of posterior staphyloma (PS). RESULTS: Twenty-six eyes of 17 patients with STL and
  25 eyes of 19 controls were evaluated. Compared with controls, patients with STL
  showed a greater CT subfoveally, at 1000 mum from the fovea at both nasal and temporal
  location, and at 2000 and 3000 mum from the fovea in nasal location (respectively,
  188.7+-72.8 vs 126.0+-88.7 mum, 172.5+-77.7 vs 119.3+-80.6 mum, 190.1+-71.9 vs 134.9+-79.7
  mum, 141.3+-56.0 vs 98.1+-68.5 mum, and 110.9+-51.0 vs 67.6+-50.7 mum, always P<
  0.05). Furthermore, patients with STL showed a lower prevalence of PS (11.5% vs
  68%, P< 0.001) and a lower PAA (2.2+-2.1 vs 5.4+-5.8 mm2, P=0.03), compared with
  controls. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that high myopic patients with STL show
  a greater CT, a lower PAA and a lower prevalence of PS, compared with controls matched
  for axial length. These findings could be relevant for the development and progression
  of myopic maculopathy in patients with STL.'
