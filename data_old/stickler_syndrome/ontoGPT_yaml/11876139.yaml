input_text: "[Stickler's syndrome--an underdiagnosed condition?]. BACKGROUND: Stickler's
  syndrome is an autosomal dominantly inherited connective tissue disorder characterised
  by ocular, orofacial, skeletal and auditory features. The estimated prevalence is
  1:10,000. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We present a girl with the salient features of Stickler
  syndrome. Based on a literature search on Medline, we present an overview of this
  disorder. RESULTS: The patient presented at birth with Pierre Robin sequence and
  bilateral exophtalmus. Serial ophthalmological investigations have revealed a non-progressive
  myopia of high degree and abnormalities of the vitreous gel architecture. From the
  age of three, she had joint hypermobility and joint pain. Her intelligence is normal,
  but she requires speech therapy because of problems with articulation. INTERPRETATION:
  Recent research has provided a better understanding of the molecular genetic background
  of this condition. According to mutations in three genes encoding type II- and/or
  type XI-collagen, Stickler's syndrome can be subclassified into type 1, 2 and 3,
  but there is a considerable clinical overlap in symptoms. Patients with mild symptoms
  may be undiagnosed. Once the diagnosis is established, a coordinated multidisciplinary
  follow-up approach is recommended."
