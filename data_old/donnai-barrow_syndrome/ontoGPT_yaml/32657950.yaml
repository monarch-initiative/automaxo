input_text: 'A Case Report of Donnai-Barrow Syndrome. BACKGROUND: A genetic disorder
  should be considered when an infant presents with multiple congenital anomalies.
  Because of the acute presentation of an infant with multiple life-threatening defects,
  a genetic diagnosis of a rare disorder took weeks to delineate. CLINICAL FINDINGS:
  This case describes a late preterm infant who presented at birth with congenital
  diaphragmatic hernia, tetralogy of Fallot, cleft lip, low-set ears, and hypertelorism.
  PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: Donnai-Barrow syndrome was the final diagnosis confirmed by a
  defect observed on the LRP2 (2q31.1) gene using sequence analysis. This is a rare
  disorder that presents with a variety of phenotypic features in infants. INTERVENTIONS:
  Initial neonatal resuscitation in the delivery room included intubation, positive
  pressure ventilation, and oxygen supplementation. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
  therapy was initiated from day of life 3 to 15. Initial surgery included correction
  of the congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and further surgical procedures included
  tracheostomy, gastrostomy tube, circumcision, ventricular septal defect repair,
  and cleft lip repair. Physical, occupational, and speech therapies were also initiated.
  OUTCOMES: The infant was transported to a pediatric rehabilitation facility at 6
  months of life for further management of his chronic lung disease requiring tracheostomy
  with ventilator dependence. PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS: Early recognition and diagnosis
  of genetic syndromes can improve family education and guide treatment interventions.
  An underlying syndrome should be suspected when an infant presents with multiple
  congenital defects. Infants with Donnai-Barrow syndrome should have thorough cardiac,
  neurologic, ophthalmologic, audiologic, and renal examinations due to the gene mutation
  effects on those systems.'
