input_text: "Cochlear Implantation Outcomes in Children with Agenesis of the Corpus
  Callosum: A Retrospective Study and A Review of the Literature. OBJECTIVES: The
  aim of the present study was to analyze the outcomes of cochlear implantation (CI)
  in patients with agenesis of the corpus callosum (CCA). A literature review and
  a retrospective analysis of our cochlear implant database were performed. MATERIALS
  AND METHODS: To the best of our knowledge, in the English literature, there was
  only one case reported with CCA who had undergone CI surgery. This case had Donnai-Barrow
  syndrome. In the Cukurova University School of Medicine Department of Otorhinolaryngology
  database, 5 of the 1317 patients who underwent CI surgery who had CCA were selected.
  The patients' demographic characteristics, operative findings, surgical outcomes,
  and additional disabilities were investigated. The patients' preoperative and postoperative
  Listening Progress Profile (LiP) and Meaningful Auditory Integration Scale (MAIS)
  tests were done to analyze the auditory performances. RESULTS: The participants
  of the study were 5 (0.38%) individuals (2 male and 3 female patients; ages 5.5,
  7.5, 8, 9, and 12 years). Two of the patients had total agenesis, and the other
  three had partial agenesis of the CCA. In the histories of the patients, one patient
  had parental consanguinity, and one had febrile convulsion. No patient had an additional
  disability. None had experienced device failure. No patients were non-users or limited
  users of cochlear implants. Postoperative LiP and MAIS test scores were improved
  for all patients nearly as the patients without any deformity. They showed normal
  auditory performance in the analysis in their postoperative 48 months of follow-up.
  CONCLUSION: Patients who had CCA are good candidates for CI surgery."
