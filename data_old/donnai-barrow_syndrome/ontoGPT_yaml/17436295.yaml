input_text: Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) etiology as revealed by pathway
  genetics. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a common birth defect with high
  mortality and morbidity. Two hundred seventy CDH patients were ascertained, carefully
  phenotyped, and classified as isolated (diaphragm defects alone) or complex (with
  additional anomalies) cases. We established different strategies to reveal CDH-critical
  chromosome loci and genes in humans. Candidate genes for sequencing analyses were
  selected from CDH animal models, genetic intervals of recurrent chromosomal aberration
  in humans, such as 15q26.1-q26.2 or 1q41-q42.12, as well as genes in the retinoic
  acid and related pathways and those known to be involved in embryonic lung development.
  For instance, FOG2, GATA4, and COUP-TFII are all needed for both normal diaphragm
  and lung development and are likely all in the same genetic and molecular pathway.
  Linkage analysis was applied first in a large inbred family and then in four multiplex
  families with Donnai-Barrow syndrome (DBS) associated with CDH. 10K SNP chip and
  microsatellite markers revealed a DBS locus on chromosome 2q23.3-q31.1. We applied
  array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) techniques to over 30, mostly
  complex, CDH patients and found a de novo microdeletion in a patient with Fryns
  syndrome related to CDH. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and multiplex
  ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) techniques allowed us to further define
  the deletion interval. Our aim is to identify genetic intervals and, in those, to
  prioritize genes that might reveal molecular pathways, mutations in any step of
  which, might contribute to the same phenotype. More important, the elucidation of
  pathways may ultimately provide clues to treatment strategies.
