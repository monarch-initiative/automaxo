input_text: Kv1.1 knock-in ataxic mice exhibit spontaneous myokymic activity exacerbated
  by fatigue, ischemia and low temperature. Episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1) is an autosomal
  dominant neurological disorder characterized by myokymia and attacks of ataxic gait
  often precipitated by stress. Several genetic mutations have been identified in
  the Shaker-like K(+) channel Kv1.1 (KCNA1) of EA1 individuals, including V408A,
  which result in remarkable channel dysfunction. By inserting the heterozygous V408A,
  mutation in one Kv1.1 allele, a mouse model of EA1 has been generated (Kv1.1(V408A/+)).
  Here, we investigated the neuromuscular transmission of Kv1.1(V408A/+) ataxic mice
  and their susceptibility to physiologically relevant stressors. By using in vivo
  preparations of lateral gastrocnemius (LG) nerve-muscle from Kv1.1(+/+) and Kv1.1(V408A/+)
  mice, we show that the mutant animals exhibit spontaneous myokymic discharges consisting
  of repeated singlets, duplets or multiplets, despite motor nerve axotomy. Two-photon
  laser scanning microscopy from the motor nerve, ex vivo, revealed spontaneous Ca(2+)
  signals that occurred abnormally only in preparations dissected from Kv1.1(V408A/+)
  mice. Spontaneous bursting activity, as well as that evoked by sciatic nerve stimulation,
  was exacerbated by muscle fatigue, ischemia and low temperatures. These stressors
  also increased the amplitude of compound muscle action potential. Such abnormal
  neuromuscular transmission did not alter fiber type composition, neuromuscular junction
  and vascularization of LG muscle, analyzed by light and electron microscopy. Taken
  together these findings provide direct evidence that identifies the motor nerve
  as an important generator of myokymic activity, that dysfunction of Kv1.1 channels
  alters Ca(2+) homeostasis in motor axons, and also strongly suggest that muscle
  fatigue contributes more than PNS fatigue to exacerbate the myokymia/neuromyotonia
  phenotype. More broadly, this study points out that juxtaparanodal K(+) channels
  composed of Kv1.1 subunits exert an important role in dampening the excitability
  of motor nerve axons during fatigue or ischemic insult.
