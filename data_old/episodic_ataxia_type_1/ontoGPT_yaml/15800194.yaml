input_text: Kv1.1 deletion augments the afferent hypoxic chemosensory pathway and
  respiration. Mutations in the potassium channel gene Kv1.1 are associated with human
  episodic ataxia type 1 (EA-1) syndrome characterized by movement disorders and epilepsy.
  Ataxic episodes in EA-1 patients are often associated with exercise or emotional
  stress, which suggests a prominent role for the autonomic nervous system. Many of
  these alterations are reproduced in the Kv1.1-null mouse. Kv1.1 also regulates excitability
  of sensory neurons essential in cardiovascular and respiratory reflexes. We examined
  the neural control of the respiratory system of littermate wild-type (control) and
  Kv1.1-null mice during low O2 (hypoxia). Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated
  Kv1.1 in the afferent limb of the carotid body chemoreflex (the major regulator
  in the response to hypoxia), consisting of the carotid body, petrosal ganglion,
  and nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). Respiration was examined by plethysmography.
  Null mice exhibited a greater increase in respiration during hypoxia compared with
  controls. In vitro carotid body sensory discharge during hypoxia was greater in
  null than control mice. In the caudal NTS, evoked EPSCs in brainstem slices were
  similar between control and null mice. However, the frequency of spontaneous and
  miniature EPSCs was greater in null mice. Null mice also exhibited more asynchronous
  release after a stimulus train. These results demonstrate the important role of
  Kv1.1 in afferent chemosensory activity and suggest that mutations in the human
  Kv1.1 gene have functional consequences during stress responses that involve respiratory
  reflexes.
