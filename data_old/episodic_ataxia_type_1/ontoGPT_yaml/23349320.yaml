input_text: 'Clinical, genetic, neurophysiological and functional study of new mutations
  in episodic ataxia type 1. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Heterozygous mutations in KCNA1
  cause episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1), an ion channel disorder characterised by brief
  paroxysms of cerebellar dysfunction and persistent neuromyotonia. This paper describes
  four previously unreported families with EA1, with the aim of understanding the
  phenotypic spectrum associated with different mutations. METHODS: 15 affected individuals
  from four families underwent clinical, genetic and neurophysiological evaluation.
  The functional impact of new mutations identified in the KCNA1 gene was investigated
  with in vitro electrophysiology and immunocytochemistry. RESULTS: Detailed clinical
  documentation, dating back to 1928 in one family, indicates that all patients manifested
  episodic ataxia of varying severity. Four subjects from three families reported
  hearing impairment, which has not previously been reported in association with EA1.
  New mutations (R167M, C185W and I407M) were identified in three out of the four
  families. When expressed in human embryonic kidney cells, all three new mutations
  resulted in a loss of K(v)1.1 channel function. The fourth family harboured a previously
  reported A242P mutation, which has not been previously described in association
  with ataxia. CONCLUSIONS: The genetic basis of EA1 in four families is established
  and this report presents the earliest documented case from 1928. All three new mutations
  caused a loss of K(v)1.1 channel function. The finding of deafness in four individuals
  raises the possibility of a link between K(v)1.1 dysfunction and hearing impairment.
  Our findings broaden the phenotypic range associated with mutations in KCNA1.'
