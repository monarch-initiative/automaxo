input_text: Pathophysiology of epilepsy. This work reviews the current knowledge on
  epileptogenesis and pathophysiology of epilepsy. Recently, gene defects underlying
  four monogenic epilepsies (generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures, autosomal
  dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, benign familial neonatal convulsions and
  episodic ataxia type 1 with partial seizures) have been identified, shedding new
  light on the pathophysiology of epilepsy as these diseases are caused by ion channel
  mutations. Although epileptic syndromes differ pathophysiologically, common ictogenesis-related
  characteristics as increased neuronal excitability and synchronicity are shared
  as well as mechanisms involved in interictal-ictal transition. Emerging insights
  point to alterations of synaptic functions and intrinsic properties of neurons as
  common mechanisms underlying hyperexcitability. This work also reviews the neurochemical
  mechanisms of epilepsy. An imbalance between glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid
  neurotransmitter systems can lead to hyperexcitability but catecholaminergic neurotransmitter
  systems and opioid peptides were shown to play a role in epileptogenesis as well.
  An overview of currently available anti-epileptic drugs and their presumed mechanisms
  of action is given as an illustration of the neurochemistry of epileptogenesis.
  Most anti-epileptic drugs exert their anti-epileptic properties through only a few
  neurochemical mechanisms that are meanwhile basic pathophysiological mechanisms
  thought to cause seizures.
