input_text: A channelopathy mutation in the voltage-sensor discloses contributions
  of a conserved phenylalanine to gating properties of Kv1.1 channels and ataxia.
  Channelopathy mutations prove informative on disease causing mechanisms and channel
  gating dynamics. We have identified a novel heterozygous mutation in the KCNA1 gene
  of a young proband displaying typical signs and symptoms of Episodic Ataxia type
  1 (EA1). This mutation is in the S4 helix of the voltage-sensing domain and results
  in the substitution of the highly conserved phenylalanine 303 by valine (p.F303V).
  The contributions of F303 towards K+ channel voltage gating are unclear and here
  have been assessed biophysically and by performing structural analysis using rat
  Kv1.2 coordinates. We observed significant positive shifts of voltage-dependence,
  changes in the activation, deactivation and slow inactivation kinetics, reduced
  window currents, and decreased current amplitudes of both Kv1.1 and Kv1.1/1.2 channels.
  Structural analysis revealed altered interactions between F303V and L339 and I335
  of the S5 helix of a neighboring subunit. The substitution of an aromatic phenylalanine
  with an aliphatic valine within the voltage-sensor destabilizes the open state of
  the channel. Thus, F303 fine-tunes the Kv1.1 gating properties and contributes to
  the interactions between the S4 segment and neighboring alpha helices. The resulting
  channel's loss of function validates the clinical relevance of the mutation for
  EA1 pathogenesis.
