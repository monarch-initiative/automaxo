input_text: Action potential broadening in a presynaptic channelopathy. Brain development
  and interictal function are unaffected in many paroxysmal neurological channelopathies,
  possibly explained by homoeostatic plasticity of synaptic transmission. Episodic
  ataxia type 1 is caused by missense mutations of the potassium channel Kv1.1, which
  is abundantly expressed in the terminals of cerebellar basket cells. Presynaptic
  action potentials of small inhibitory terminals have not been characterized, and
  it is not known whether developmental plasticity compensates for the effects of
  Kv1.1 dysfunction. Here we use visually targeted patch-clamp recordings from basket
  cell terminals of mice harbouring an ataxia-associated mutation and their wild-type
  littermates. Presynaptic spikes are followed by a pronounced afterdepolarization,
  and are broadened by pharmacological blockade of Kv1.1 or by a dominant ataxia-associated
  mutation. Somatic recordings fail to detect such changes. Spike broadening leads
  to increased Ca(2+) influx and GABA release, and decreased spontaneous Purkinje
  cell firing. We find no evidence for developmental compensation for inherited Kv1.1
  dysfunction.
