input_text: Kv1.1 channelopathy abolishes presynaptic spike width modulation by subthreshold
  somatic depolarization. Although action potentials propagate along axons in an all-or-none
  manner, subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations at the soma affect neurotransmitter
  release from synaptic boutons. An important mechanism underlying analog-digital
  modulation is depolarization-mediated inactivation of presynaptic Kv1-family potassium
  channels, leading to action potential broadening and increased calcium influx. Previous
  studies have relied heavily on recordings from blebs formed after axon transection,
  which may exaggerate the passive propagation of somatic depolarization. We recorded
  instead from small boutons supplied by intact axons identified with scanning ion
  conductance microscopy in primary hippocampal cultures and asked how distinct potassium
  channels interact in determining the basal spike width and its modulation by subthreshold
  somatic depolarization. Pharmacological or genetic deletion of Kv1.1 broadened presynaptic
  spikes without preventing further prolongation by brief depolarizing somatic prepulses.
  A heterozygous mouse model of episodic ataxia type 1 harboring a dominant Kv1.1
  mutation had a similar broadening effect on basal spike shape as deletion of Kv1.1;
  however, spike modulation by somatic prepulses was abolished. These results argue
  that the Kv1.1 subunit is not necessary for subthreshold modulation of spike width.
  However, a disease-associated mutant subunit prevents the interplay of analog and
  digital transmission, possibly by disrupting the normal stoichiometry of presynaptic
  potassium channels.
