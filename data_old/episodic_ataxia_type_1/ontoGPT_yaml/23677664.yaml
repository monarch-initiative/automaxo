input_text: Acetazolamide-responsive ataxia. Acetazolamide-responsive ataxia represents
  a unique collection of genetically distinct episodic ataxia (EA) disorders associated
  with paroxysmal cerebellar symptoms many of which are responsive to medical treatment
  with acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. Among all of the subtypes of
  episodic ataxia, types 2 (EA2), 3 (EA3), and 5 (EA5) are thought be the most medication
  responsive. Some patients with episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1) will also describe improvement
  with acetazolamide. Each of these individual genetic syndromes is characterized
  by its own unique mechanism and clinical presentation. In this review, the author
  provides an overview of the pathophysiology of acetazolamide-responsive ataxia,
  its natural history, and its clinical management.
