input_text: 'Expanding the phenotype of potassium channelopathy: severe neuromyotonia
  and skeletal deformities without prominent Episodic Ataxia. We report an unusual
  family in which the same point mutation in the voltage-gated potassium channel gene
  KCNA1 resulted in markedly different clinical phenotypes. The propositus presented
  in infancy with marked muscle stiffness, motor developmental delay, short stature,
  skeletal deformities, muscle hypertrophy and muscle rippling on percussion. He did
  not experience episodic ataxia. His mother presented some years later with typical
  features of Episodic Ataxia type 1 (EA1), with episodes of ataxia lasting a few
  minutes provoked by exercise. On examination she had myokymia, joint contractures
  and mild skeletal deformities. A heterozygous point mutation in the voltage-gated
  K(+) channel (KCNA1) gene (ACG-AGG, Thr226Arg) was found in both. We conclude that
  mutations in the potassium channel gene (KCNA1) can cause severe neuromyotonia resulting
  in marked skeletal deformities even if episodic ataxia is not prominent.'
