## Running the Script

You can run the script using the following command:

```shell
python main.py --disease_name "YourDiseaseName" --max_articles_to_save 100
```

Replace "YourDiseaseName" with the name of the disease you want to process and adjust 100 to the desired number of articles to save.

or you can just run this command:

```bash
python main.py
```

and then enter a disease name, and number of articles to be saved.
