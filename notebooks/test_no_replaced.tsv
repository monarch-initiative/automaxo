In hypoxic conditions, HbS suffers autoxidation and polymerizes inside red blood cells, altering their morphology into a sickle shape, with increased rigidity and fragility. This triggers complex pathophysiological mechanisms, including inflammation, cell adhesion, oxidative stress, and vaso-occlusion, along with metabolic alterations and endocrine complications. SCA is phenotypically heterogeneous due to the modulation of both environmental and genetic factors. Pediatric cerebrovascular disease (CVD), namely ischemic stroke and silent cerebral infarctions, is one of the most impactful manifestations. In this review, we highlight the role of oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of pediatric CVD. Since oxidative stress is an interdependent mechanism in vasculopathy, occurring alongside (or as result of) endothelial dysfunction, cell adhesion, inflammation, chronic hemolysis, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and vaso-occlusion, a brief overview of the main mechanisms involved is included. Moreover, the genetic modulation of CVD in SCA is discussed. The knowledge of the intricate network of altered mechanisms in SCA, and how it is affected by different genetic factors, is fundamental for the identification of potential therapeutic targets, drug development, and patient-specific treatment alternatives.
38239353	associate|@DISEASE_Inflammation|@GENE_CCL2	Role of MCP-1 as an inflammatory biomarker in nephropathy.The Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), also referred to as chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), belongs to the extensive chemokine family and serves as a crucial mediator of innate immunity and tissue inflammation. It has a notable impact on inflammatory conditions affecting the kidneys. Upon binding to its receptor, MCP-1 can induce lymphocytes and NK cells' homing, migration, activation, differentiation, and development while promoting monocytes' and macrophages' infiltration, thereby facilitating kidney disease-related inflammation. As a biomarker for kidney disease, MCP-1 has made notable advancements in primary kidney diseases such as crescentic glomerulonephritis, chronic glomerulonephritis, primary glomerulopathy, idiopathic proteinuria glomerulopathy, acute kidney injury; secondary kidney diseases like diabetic nephropathy and lupus nephritis; hereditary kidney diseases including autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and sickle cell kidney disease. MCP-1 not only predicts the occurrence, progression, prognosis of the disease but is also closely associated with the severity and stage of nephropathy. When renal tissue is stimulated or experiences significant damage, the expression of MCP-1 increases, demonstrating a direct correlation with the severity of renal injury.
