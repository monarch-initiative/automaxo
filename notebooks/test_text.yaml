  ArithmeticErrorRed blood cell mechanical sensitivity improves in patients with sickle cell disease undergoing chronic transfusion after prolonged, 
  subhemolytic shear exposure.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetically inherited hemoglobinopathy in which deoxygenated hemoglobin S polymerizes, 
  leading to stiff red blood cells (RBCs) and inefficient microcirculatory blood flow. Transfusion therapy acts as primary and secondary prevention of 
  ischemic stroke in SCD. Whether blood transfusion alters the mechanical sensitivity (MS) of RBCs to prolonged subhemolytic shear stress (shear) is unknown. 
  We hypothesized that individuals with SCD undergoing chronic blood transfusion would have improved sensitivity to shear, compared with patients not 
  undergoing transfusion therapy. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Blood suspensions from individuals with SCD not receiving (n = 15) and receiving (n = 15) 
  chronic simple transfusion were conditioned to shear (1, 4, 16, 32, and 64 Pa) for various durations (1, 4, 16, 32, and 64 sec), and then deformability of
  RBCs was immediately measured. Healthy young controls (n = 15) were included for reference. A surface mesh was interpolated using the data to determine the
  effect of blood transfusion on MS of RBCs. RESULTS: There was impaired RBC deformability to prolonged supraphysiologic shear in both SCD groups; however, MS 
  improved in transfused patients when exposed to prolonged physiologic shear. Furthermore, in the transfused patients with SCD, the threshold above which
  subhemolytic damage occurs was similar to controls. CONCLUSION: We found that chronic transfusion therapy normalizes the MS threshold above which RBC 
  subhemolytic damage occurs after prolonged shear exposure in SCD. An important and novel finding in transfused patients with SCD was the improvement in RBC
  deformability in response to prolonged shear exposure over the physiologic range.
