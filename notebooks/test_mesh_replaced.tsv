In diseaseD002534 conditions, HbS suffers autoxidation and polymerizes inside red blood cells, altering their morphology into a sickle shape, with increased rigidity and fragility. This triggers complex pathophysiological mechanisms, including diseaseD007249, cell adhesion, oxidative stress, and diseaseD001157, along with metabolic alterations and diseaseD004700 complications. diseaseD000755 is phenotypically heterogeneous due to the modulation of both environmental and genetic factors. Pediatric diseaseD002561 (diseaseD002561), namely diseaseD002544 and silent diseaseD002544, is one of the most impactful manifestations. In this review, we highlight the role of oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of pediatric diseaseD002561. Since oxidative stress is an interdependent mechanism in diseaseD000090122, occurring alongside (or as result of) diseaseD014652, cell adhesion, diseaseD007249, chronic diseaseD006461, diseaseD007511diseaseD015427, and diseaseD001157, a brief overview of the main mechanisms involved is included. Moreover, the genetic modulation of diseaseD002561 in diseaseD000755 is discussed. The knowledge of the intricate network of altered mechanisms in diseaseD000755, and how it is affected by different genetic factors, is fundamental for the identification of potential therapeutic targets, drug development, and patient-specific treatment alternatives.
38239353	Association | diseaseD007249 | ncbi20296	Role of MCP-1 as an diseaseD007249 biomarker in diseaseD007674.The ncbi20296 (MCP-1), also referred to as chemokine ligand 2 (ncbi20296), belongs to the extensive chemokine family and serves as a crucial mediator of innate immunity and tissue diseaseD007249. It has a notable impact on diseaseD007249 conditions affecting the kidneys. Upon binding to its receptor, MCP-1 can induce lymphocytes and NK cells' homing, migration, activation, differentiation, and development while promoting monocytes' and macrophages' infiltration, thereby facilitating diseaseD007674related diseaseD007249. As a biomarker for diseaseD007674, MCP-1 has made notable advancements in primary diseaseD007674 such as crescentic diseaseD005921, chronic diseaseD005921, diseaseD007674, idiopathic diseaseD011507, diseaseD058186; secondary diseaseD007674 like diseaseD003928 and diseaseD008181; diseaseD030342 including diseaseD016891 and diseaseD000755. MCP-1 not only predicts the occurrence, progression, prognosis of the disease but is also closely associated with the severity and stage of diseaseD007674. When renal tissue is stimulated or experiences significant damage, the expression of MCP-1 increases, demonstrating a direct correlation with the severity of diseaseD007674.
