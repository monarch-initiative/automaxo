30926475	Marfan syndrome: A therapeutic challenge for long-term care.	Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene. Acute aortic dissection is the leading cause of death in patients suffering from MFS and consequence of medial degeneration and aneurysm formation. In addition to its structural function in the formation of elastic fibers, fibrillin has a major role in keeping maintaining transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) in an inactive form. Dysfunctional fibrillin increases TGF-beta bioavailability and concentration in the extracellular matrix, leading to activation of proinflammatory transcription factors. In turn, these events cause increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases and cytokines that control the migration and infiltration of inflammatory cells into the aorta. Moreover, TGF-beta causes accumulation of reactive oxygen species leading to further degradation of elastin fibers. All these processes result in medial elastolysis, which increases the risk of vascular complications. Although MFS is a hereditary disease, symptoms and traits are usually not noticeable at birth. During childhood or adolescence affected individuals present with severe tissue weaknesses, especially in the aorta, heart, eyes, and skeleton. Considering this, even young patients should avoid activities that exert additional stress and pressure on the aorta and the cardiovascular system. Thus, if the diagnosis is made and prophylactic treatment is initiated in a timely fashion, MFS and its preliminary pathophysiologic vascular remodeling can be successfully ameliorated reducing the risk of life-threatening complications. This commentary focuses on new research opportunities and molecular findings on MFS, discusses future challenges and possible long-term therapies.
27343792	Marfan Syndrome: new diagnostic criteria, same anesthesia care? Case report and review.	BACKGROUND: Marfan's Syndrome (MFS) is a disorder of connective tissue, mainly involving the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and ocular systems. The most severe problems include aortic root dilatation and dissection. Anesthetic management is vital for the improvement on perioperative morbidity. CASE REPORT: 61-year-old male with MFS, presenting mainly with pectus carinatum, scoliosis, ectopia lens, previous spontaneous pneumothorax and aortal aneurysm and dissection submitted to thoracoabdominal aortic prosthesis placement. Underwent routine laparoscopic cholecystectomy due to lithiasis. Important findings on preoperative examination were thoracolumbar kyphoscoliosis, metallic murmur on cardiac exam. Chest radiograph revealed Cobb angle of 70 . Echocardiogram showed evidence of aortic mechanical prosthesis with no deficits. DISCUSSION: Preoperative evaluation should focus on cardiopulmonary abnormalities. The anesthesiologist should be prepared for a potentially difficult intubation. Proper positioning and limb support prior to induction is crucial in order to avoid joint injuries. Consider antibiotic prophylaxis for subacute bacterial endocarditis. The patient should be carefully positioned to avoid joint injuries. Intraoperatively cardiovascular monitoring is mandatory: avoid maneuvers that can lead to tachycardia or hypertension, control airway pressure to prevent pneumothorax and maintain an adequate volemia to decrease chances of prolapse, especially if considering laparoscopic surgery. No single intraoperative anesthetic agent or technique has demonstrated superiority. Adequate postoperative pain management is vitally important to avoid the detrimental effects of hypertension and tachycardia.
31836196	Irbesartan in Marfan syndrome (AIMS): a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial.	BACKGROUND: Irbesartan, a long acting selective angiotensin-1 receptor inhibitor, in Marfan syndrome might reduce aortic dilatation, which is associated with dissection and rupture. We aimed to determine the effects of irbesartan on the rate of aortic dilatation in children and adults with Marfan syndrome. METHODS: We did a placebo-controlled, double-blind randomised trial at 22 centres in the UK. Individuals aged 6-40 years with clinically confirmed Marfan syndrome were eligible for inclusion. Study participants were all given 75 mg open label irbesartan once daily, then randomly assigned to 150 mg of irbesartan (increased to 300 mg as tolerated) or matching placebo. Aortic diameter was measured by echocardiography at baseline and then annually. All images were analysed by a core laboratory blinded to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was the rate of aortic root dilatation. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN90011794. FINDINGS: Between March 14, 2012, and May 1, 2015, 192 participants were recruited and randomly assigned to irbesartan (n=104) or placebo (n=88), and all were followed for up to 5 years. Median age at recruitment was 18 years (IQR 12-28), 99 (52%) were female, mean blood pressure was 110/65 mm Hg (SDs 16 and 12), and 108 (56%) were taking beta blockers. Mean baseline aortic root diameter was 34 4 mm in the irbesartan group (SD 5 8) and placebo group (5 5). The mean rate of aortic root dilatation was 0 53 mm per year (95% CI 0 39 to 0 67) in the irbesartan group compared with 0 74 mm per year (0 60 to 0 89) in the placebo group, with a difference in means of -0 22 mm per year (-0 41 to -0 02, p=0 030). The rate of change in aortic Z score was also reduced by irbesartan (difference in means -0 10 per year, 95% CI -0 19 to -0 01, p=0 035). Irbesartan was well tolerated with no observed differences in rates of serious adverse events. INTERPRETATION: Irbesartan is associated with a reduction in the rate of aortic dilatation in children and young adults with Marfan syndrome and could reduce the incidence of aortic complications.

32423364	Trends of vascular surgery procedures in Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.	OBJECTIVES: Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome represent two connective tissue vascular diseases requiring unique consideration in their vascular surgical care. A comprehensive national review encompassing all hospitalizations for the Marfan Syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome patient population is lacking. METHODS: The National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample from 2010 to 2014 was reviewed for all inpatient vascular surgery procedures including those with a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. National estimates of vascular surgery rates were generated from provided weights. Patient demographics, procedure type, and outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: There were 3103 Marfan syndrome and 476 Ehlers-Danlos syndrome vascular procedures identified as well as 3,895,381 vascular procedures in the remainder of population (control group). The percent of aortic procedures from all vascular procedures in Marfan syndrome (23.5%) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (23.5%) were 2.5-fold higher than controls (9.1%), p < 0.0001. Open aortic aneurysm repair was also significantly greater in both Marfan syndrome (16.8%) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (11.2%) compared to controls (4.4%), p < 0.0001. Endovascular aortic repair (p < 0.2302) was similar among the groups. Marfan syndrome (7.7%) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (5.1%) had more thoracic endovascular aortic repair performed than controls (0.7%), p < 0.0001. Percutaneous procedures were fewer in Marfan syndrome (6.3%) than controls (31.3%) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (26.3%), p < 0.0001, while repair of peripheral arteries was greater in Marfan syndrome (5.9%) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (4.1%) than controls (1.5%), p < 0.0001. For total aortic procedures, the mean age of aortic procedures was 68.2 years in controls vs 45.8 years in Marfan syndrome and 55.3 years in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, p < 0.0001. Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome had fewer comorbidities overall, while controls had significantly higher rates of coronary artery disease (controls 39.9% vs Marfan syndrome 8.3% and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 13.0%, p < 0.0001), peripheral vascular disease (controls 34.5% vs Marfan syndrome 4.2% and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 8.7%, p < 0.0001), and diabetes (controls 20.6% vs Marfan syndrome 6.6 and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 4.4%, p < 0.0001). Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome had higher overall complication rate (65.5% and 52.2%) compared to controls (44.6%), p < 0.0001. Postoperative hemorrhage was more likely in Marfan syndrome (42.9%) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (39.1%) than controls (22.2%), p < 0.0001. Increased respiratory failure was noted in Marfan syndrome (20.2%) vs controls (10.7%) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (8.7%), p = .0003. Finally, length of stay was increased in Marfan syndrome 12.5 days vs Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 7.4 days and controls 7.2 days (p < 0.0001) as well as a higher median costs of index hospitalization in Marfan syndrome ($57,084 vs Ehlers-Danlos syndrome $22,032 and controls $26,520, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome differ from other patients undergoing vascular surgical procedures, with a significantly higher proportion of aortic procedures including open aneurysm repair and thoracic endovascular aortic repair. While they are younger with fewer comorbidities, due to the unique pathogenesis of their underlying connective tissue disorder, there is an overall higher rate of procedural complications and increased length of stay and cost for Marfan syndrome patients undergoing aortic surgery.
29286269	Landmark lecture: Perloff lecture: Tribute to Professor Joseph Kayle Perloff and lessons learned from him: aortopathy in adults with CHD.	"Marfan syndrome, bicuspid aortic valve, and/or coarctation of the aorta are associated with medial abnormalities of the ascending aortic or para-coarctation aorta. Medial abnormalities in the ascending aorta are prevalent in other type of patients with a variety of CHDs such as single ventricle, persistent truncus arteriosus, transposition of the great arteries, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, and tetralogy of Fallot, encompassing a wide age range and may predispose to dilatation, aneurysm, and rapture necessitating aortic valve and root surgery. These CHDs exhibit ongoing dilatation of the aortic root and reduced aortic elasticity and increased aortic stiffness that may relate to intrinsic properties of the aortic root. These aortic dilatation and increased stiffness can induce aortic aneurysm, rapture of the aorta, and aortic regurgitation, but also provoke left ventricular hypertrophy, reduced coronary artery flow, and left ventricular failure. Therefore, a new clinical entity can be used to call this association of aortic pathophysiological abnormality, aortic dilation, and aorto-left ventricular interaction - ""aortopathy""."
25935877	Marfan Sartan: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.	AIMS: To evaluate the benefit of adding Losartan to baseline therapy in patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS). METHODS AND RESULTS: A double-blind, randomized, multi-centre, placebo-controlled, add on trial comparing Losartan (50 mg when <50 kg, 100 mg otherwise) vs. placebo in patients with MFS according to Ghent criteria, age >10 years old, and receiving standard therapy. 303 patients, mean age 29.9 years old, were randomized. The two groups were similar at baseline, 86% receiving beta-blocker therapy. The median follow-up was 3.5 years. The evolution of aortic diameter at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva was not modified by the adjunction of Losartan, with a mean increase in aortic diameter at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva of 0.44 mm/year (s.e. = 0.07) (-0.043 z/year, s.e. = 0.04) in patients receiving Losartan and 0.51 mm/year (s.e. = 0.06) (-0.01 z/year, s.e. = 0.03) in those receiving placebo (P = 0.36 for the comparison on slopes in millimeter per year and P = 0.69 for the comparison on slopes on z-scores). Patients receiving Losartan had a slight but significant decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure throughout the study (5 mmHg). During the study period, aortic surgery was performed in 28 patients (15 Losartan, 13 placebo), death occurred in 3 patients [0 Losartan, 3 placebo, sudden death (1) suicide (1) oesophagus cancer (1)]. CONCLUSION: Losartan was able to decrease blood pressure in patients with MFS but not to limit aortic dilatation during a 3-year period in patients >10 years old. beta-Blocker therapy alone should therefore remain the standard first line therapy in these patients.
28523383	Anterior sacral meningocele presenting as intracystic bleeding.	PURPOSE: To report a case of anterior sacral meningocele with intralesional bleeding secondary to sacrococcygeal trauma. Likewise, there is a discussion about the physiopathology and the surgical approach to these types of lesions. METHODS: A 43-year-old man diagnosed with Marfan syndrome suffered sacrococcygeal trauma. He was admitted to the emergency room due to symptoms of headache, nausea, and lower limb subjective weakness. CT and MRI showed a large retroperitoneal mass with hemorrhagic content close to the sacrum. Likewise, the MRI showed an image compatible with subarachnoid hemorrhage in the thoracic spinal area, cerebral convexity, and the basal cisterns. The patient went into surgery for an anterior abdominal approach in the midline to reduce the content of the lesion, and subsequently, in the same act, a posterior approach was done with an S1-S2 laminectomy and obliteration of the pedicle. Postoperative MRI 5 months later showed resolution of the ASM. RESULTS: Anterior sacral meningocele is characterized by herniation of the dura mater and the arachnoid mater outside the spinal canal through a defect of the sacrum. We add the risk of bleeding after trauma-never seen in the literature-as one of the possible inherent complications of this lesion. CONCLUSIONS: This report highlights a complication never seen in the literature of a relatively rare condition. In our case, the combined approach was effective for both clinical control and lesion regression.
26761529	Pre- and Postoperative Imaging of the Aortic Root.	Three-dimensional datasets acquired using computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are ideally suited for characterization of the aortic root. These modalities offer different advantages and limitations, which must be weighed according to the clinical context. This article provides an overview of current aortic root imaging, highlighting normal anatomy, pathologic conditions, imaging techniques, measurement thresholds, relevant surgical procedures, postoperative complications and potential imaging pitfalls. Patients with a range of clinical conditions are predisposed to aortic root disease, including Marfan syndrome, bicuspid aortic valve, vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and Loeys-Dietz syndrome. Various surgical techniques may be used to repair the aortic root, including placement of a composite valve graft, such as the Bentall and Cabrol procedures; placement of an aortic root graft with preservation of the native valve, such as the Yacoub and David techniques; and implantation of a biologic graft, such as a homograft, autograft, or xenograft. Potential imaging pitfalls in the postoperative period include mimickers of pathologic processes such as felt pledgets, graft folds, and nonabsorbable hemostatic agents. Postoperative complications that may be encountered include pseudoaneurysms, infection, and dehiscence. Radiologists should be familiar with normal aortic root anatomy, surgical procedures, and postoperative complications, to accurately interpret pre- and postoperative imaging performed for evaluation of the aortic root. Online supplemental material is available for this article.
29979900	Pharmacological resources, diagnostic approach and coordination of care in joint hypermobility-related disorders.	INTRODUCTION: Joint hypermobility (JH) is the hallmark of many hereditary soft connective tissue disorders, including Ehlers-Danlos syndromes and related disorders, disorders of the TGFbeta-pathway, lateral meningocele syndrome, arterial tortuosity syndrome, and cutis laxa syndromes. Contemporary practice separates individuals with isolated, non-syndromic JH from patients with Mendelian syndromes and those with hypermobility spectrum disorders. The latter is a new nosologic entity grouping together individuals with JH and related musculoskeletal manifestations, but lacking inclusion criteria for well-defined and/or single-gene disorders. Area covered: Nomenclature of JH and JH-related disorders are summarized on a practically oriented perspective. Critical areas of clinical management comprise pain; cardiovascular and respiratory issues; fatigue and dysautonomia; bone fragility; and capillary, skin and soft tissue fragility. Medical management stands on low-evidence data. Ongoing preclinical and clinical studies are aimed to reach a more personalized pharmacological approach to the management of the cardiovascular risk, musculoskeletal pain, and reduced bone mass. Expert commentary: Correct classification of patients with JH-related disorders needs a systematic approach, in which a wide array of molecular tests should be intermingled with strong clinical competences in highly specialized settings. A multispecialty, hierarchical approach should be encouraged for optimal coordination of care in systemic phenotypes.
26113733	Non-aneurysmal abdominal aortic rupture in a patient with Marfan syndrome.	Aortic rupture in the presence of aneurysmal disease is well understood and extensively described in the literature. However, aortic rupture in a non-aneurysmal aorta is far less common. In the few reported cases, perforations are believed to result from a penetrating atheromatous ulcer of the aorta. We describe a rare case of non-aneurysmal aortic rupture in a 68-year-old man with Marfan syndrome and a history of proximal aortic surgery. The urgent need for hemorrhage control precluded any consideration of an endovascular repair. 
25216402	Pelvic pain from a giant presacral Tarlov cyst successfully obliterated using aneurysm clips in a patient with Marfan syndrome.	Patients with Marfan syndrome used to succumb early in life from cardiovascular complications. With the current rapid advance in medical and surgical care, such patients may now have near-normal longevities. Consequently, rare late-life complications are emerging in these patients and represent challenges to clinicians for their diagnoses and treatments. The authors report a rare case of pelvic pain and genital prolapse from a giant presacral Tarlov cyst in a 67-year-old patient with Marfan syndrome. This 67-year-old Caucasian female presented with progressively severe pelvic pain, intermittent explosive diarrhea, and dysuria. Physical and bimanual examination demonstrated genital prolapse and a nontender, cyst-like mass fixed in the midline. She underwent ultrasound, CT, and eventually MRI evaluations that led to the diagnosis of a giant (6.7 x 6.4 x 6.6 cm) Tarlov cyst originating from the right S-2 nerve root sleeve/sacral foramen with intrapelvic extension. She underwent S1-S2 and S2-S3 laminectomy with obliteration of the Tarlov cyst using aneurysm clips. Postoperatively, her pelvic pain and bowel symptoms resolved and the bladder symptoms improved. The 3-month follow-up CT of abdomen/pelvis demonstrated resolution of the cyst. The present case illustrates that clinicians caring for elderly patients with Marfan syndrome need to increasingly recognize such unusual late-life complications. Also, these large Tarlov cysts can be simply and effectively obliterated with aneurysm clips.

32369869	Aortic root valve-sparing repair and dissections in Marfans syndrome during pregnancy: A case series.	INTRODUCTION: Marfan syndrome is a connective tissue disorder caused by mutations in the fibrillar FBN-1 gene. Aortic dissection and rupture are major causes of morbidity and mortality and are of special concern during pregnancy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors report four cases of aortic root repair with preservation of the native aortic valve that have has created a discussion between cardiothoracic surgeons, obstetricians, and gynecologists regarding the best care for Marfan syndrome patients. We present these cases here with a review of the literature. RESULTS: Surgery of the aorta and valves in Marfan syndrome is less risky than in previous eras and surgical management guidelines are generally accepted. Yet, we may be unnecessarily referring women to terminate pregnancies or to avoid pregnancy. We believe there may be alternative options for these patients. CONCLUSIONS: Marfan syndrome during pregnancy can be navigated with preconception counseling, antepartum care, and close postpartum follow-up involving an appropriate multidisciplinary team.
28392101	Surgical and Endovascular Treatments of Extracranial Carotid Artery Aneurysms-Report of Six Cases.	BACKGROUND: Although the natural course of extracranial carotid artery aneurysms (ECAAs) is still unknown, they may cause stroke or cranial nerve dysfunction unless they are treated. In this report, we reviewed the clinical results of 6 patients who underwent endovascular and surgical treatments for ECAAs. METHODS: A total of 6 patients underwent endovascular and surgical treatments for ECAAs for 9 years. The primary causes of ECAAs included Marfan syndrome (1 patient), infection (1 patient), trauma (2 patients), and unknown (2 patients). All 6 ECAAs were symptomatic. RESULTS: One patient underwent surgical resection of the ECAA followed by end-to-end anastomosis of the internal carotid artery (ICA). Another patient underwent proximal ICA ligation combined with high-flow external carotid artery-to-middle cerebral artery bypass using a radial artery graft, because the patient also had a giant thrombosed aneurysm in the cavernous portion of the ipsilateral ICA. Endovascular treatment was selected in the other 4 patients using a covered stent or a bare metal stent combined with coil embolization. Of these patients, one required proximal ICA ligation followed by superficial temporal artery-to-middle cerebral artery anastomosis due to an anatomical problem for stent placement. There was no neurological deterioration at the discharge in all but 1 patient who suffered ischemic stroke during surgery. CONCLUSION: Surgical or endovascular treatment yielded a relatively satisfactory outcome in patients with ECAAs.

28929526	The influence of Marfans and bicuspid valves on outcomes following aortic valve reimplantation.	BACKGROUND: We analyzed our early and midterm results with aortic valve reimplantation surgery to determine the influence of Marfan syndrome and bicuspid valves on outcomes with this technique. METHODS: Between March 2004 and December 2015, 267 patients underwent aortic valve reimplantation operations. The mean diameter of the sinuses of Valsalva was 50 +- 3 mm and moderate/severe aortic regurgitation was present in 34.4% of these patients. A bicuspid aortic valve was present in 21% and 40% had Marfan syndrome. RESULTS: Overall 30-day mortality was 0.37% (1/267). Mean follow-up was 59.7 +- 38.7 months. Overall survival at 1, 3, and 5 years was 98 +- 8%, 98 +- 1%, and 94 +- 2%, respectively. Freedom from reoperation and aortic regurgitation >II was 99 +- 5%, 98 +- 8%, 96.7 +- 8%, and 99 +- 6%, 98 +- 1%, 98 +- 1%, respectively at 1, 3, and 5 years follow-up, with no differences between Marfan and bicuspid aortic valve groups. (p = 0.94 and p = 0.96, respectively). No endocarditis or thromboembolic complications were documented, and 93.6% of the patients did not receive any anticoagulation therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The reimplantation technique for aortic root aneurysms is associated with excellent clinical and functional outcomes at short and mid-term follow-up.
30478167	Patients at Risk for Aortic Rupture Often Exposed to Fluoroquinolones during Hospitalization.	Several studies have indicated that fluoroquinolone use may be associated with an increased risk of aortic aneurysm or dissection (AAD). Because patients with AAD or Marfan syndrome are at increased risk for aortic rupture, we performed a retrospective cohort study to determine the prevalence of systemic fluoroquinolone exposure and predictors of fluoroquinolone use in these patients. Data were obtained from the advisory board billing and administrative database, which contained information on 22 million adult hospitalizations in the United States for the study period (2009 to 2015). International Classification of Diseases (9/10) and Current Procedural Terminology codes were used to identify patients who had AAD or Marfan syndrome or underwent aortic repair. We identified 136,789 admissions for AAD, which involved 99,818 unique patients, 20% of whom received fluoroquinolone during a hospital admission. Of the 7,045 patients with dissection, 18% were exposed to fluoroquinolone. Of the 27,876 AAD patients who underwent aortic repair, 19% received fluoroquinolone during a hospitalization before the repair. In the AAD patients, having a diagnosis of pneumonia or urinary tract infection increased the likelihood of receiving fluoroquinolone during admission by 46% and 40%, respectively (P < 0.001). Additionally, we identified 2,871 admissions for Marfan syndrome, which involved 1,872 patients, 14% of whom received fluoroquinolone during an admission. In these patients, pneumonia and urinary tract infections also increased the risk of fluoroquinolone exposure. If the deleterious effects of fluoroquinolone on aortic integrity are substantiated, reducing fluoroquinolone use in hospitalized patients with aortic disorders will become an urgent safety issue for antibiotic stewardship programs.

27765186	Valve-Sparing Root Replacement Compared With Composite Valve Graft Procedures in Patients With Aortic Root Dilation.	BACKGROUND: Although aortic valve-sparing (AVS) operations are established alternatives to composite valve graft (CVG) procedures for patients with aortic root aneurysms, comparative long-term outcomes are lacking. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to compare the results of patients undergoing AVS procedures with those undergoing CVG operations. METHODS: From 1990 to 2010, a total of 616 patients age <70 years and without aortic stenosis underwent elective aortic root surgery (AVS, n = 253; CVG with a bioprosthesis [bio-CVG], n = 180; CVG with a mechanical prosthesis [m-CVG], n = 183). A propensity score was used as a covariate to adjust for unbalanced variables in group comparisons. Mean age was 46 +- 14 years, 83.3% were male, and mean follow-up was 9.8 +- 5.3 years. RESULTS: Patients undergoing AVS had higher rates of Marfan syndrome and lower rates of bicuspid aortic valve than those undergoing bio-CVG or m-CVG procedures. In-hospital mortality (0.3%) and stroke rate (1.3%) were similar among groups. After adjusting for clinical covariates, both bio-CVG and m-CVG procedures were associated with increased long-term major adverse valve-related events compared with patients undergoing AVS (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.4, p = 0.005; and HR: 5.2, p < 0.001, respectively). They were also associated with increased cardiac mortality (HR: 7.0, p = 0.001; and HR: 6.4, p = 0.003). Furthermore, bio-CVG procedures were associated with increased risk of reoperations (HR: 6.9; p = 0.003), and m-CVG procedures were associated with increased risk of anticoagulant-related hemorrhage (HR: 5.6; p = 0.008) compared with AVS procedures. CONCLUSIONS: This comparative study showed that AVS procedures were associated with reduced cardiac mortality and valve-related complications when compared with bio-CVG and m-CVG. AVS is the treatment of choice for young patients with aortic root aneurysm and normal or near-normal aortic cusps.
31283078	Spinal meningeal cyst in a child with Marfan syndrome: A potential cause for apparent dural puncture during caudal epidural block.	We report a complication from caudal epidural block for anesthesia in a 4-year-old child with Marfan syndrome who was undergoing lensectomy, orchidopexy, and circumcision resulting in apparent accidental dural puncture. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging revealed a lumbosacral spinal meningeal cyst.

28327138	Accuracy of pedicle screw placement in patients with Marfan syndrome.	BACKGROUND: There is no study concerning safety and accuracy of pedicle screw placement in Marfan syndrome. The objective of this study is to investigate accuracy and safety of pedicle screw placement in scoliosis associated with Marfan syndrome. METHODS: CT scanning was performed to analyze accuracy of pedicle screw placement. Pedicle perforations were classified as medial, lateral or anterior and categorized to four grades: <= 2 mm as Grade 1, 2.1-4.0 mm as Grade 2, 4.1-6.0 mm as Grade 3, >=6.1 mm as Grade 4. Fully contained screws or with medial wall perforation <= 2 mm or with lateral wall perforation <= 6 mm and without injury of visceral organs were considered acceptable, otherwise were unacceptable. RESULTS: 976 pedicle screws were placed, 713 screws (73.1%) were fully contained within the cortical boundaries of the pedicle. 924 (94.7%) screws were considered as acceptable, and 52 (5.3%) as unacceptable. The perforation rate was higher using free-hand technique than O-arm navigation technique (30.8% VS. 11.4%, P < 0.05), higher in lumbar region than in thoracic region (34.1% VS. 22.3%, P < 0.05) and higher in concave side than in convex side (33.5% VS. 21.9%, P < 0.05). No injury of visceral organs especially aorta erosion was noted in the series. 7 cases of dural tear caused by misplaced screws occurred, and 4 cases developed cerebro-spinal fluid leak. Drainage and pressure dressings were applied for these patients, and no infection was observed. Leg pain was observed in 7 cases, and 2 cases simultaneously complained of leg weakness. Revision surgery was conducted to remove the misplaced screws for these 2 patients. Conservative treatment was applied for the 5 patients without leg weakness. Symptoms of leg weakness and pain resolved in all patients. CONCLUSION: Placement of pedicle screw in Marfan syndrome is accuracy and safe. O-arm navigation was an effective modality to ensure the safety and accuracy of screw placement. Special attention should be paid when screws were placed at the lumber spine and the concave side of spine deformity to avoid the higher rate of complications.

30207113	Long-Term Results after Modified Bentall Operation in 200 Patients.	BACKGROUND: Composite graft replacement of the aortic root is the treatment of choice for an array of aortic root pathologies, such as annuloaortic ectasia, Marfan syndrome and acute or chronic aortic dissection type A. In this retrospective study of the authors' aortic surgery database, an exploration was made of factors related to early and long-term morbidity and mortality of patients who underwent this procedure. METHODS: Between 2000 and 2009, a total of 200 consecutive patients (male:female ratio 4:1; mean age 56.2 +- 11.66 years) underwent the modified Bentall operation at the authors' institution, with a composite graft (mechanical valve) being used to correct aortic root pathology. All preoperative, perioperative and postoperative data, as well as long-term follow up data, were retrieved from the authors' aortic surgery database. RESULTS: Preoperative characteristics of the patients included elective and emergency operations (83.1% and 15.9%, respectively). Intraoperative and 30-day mortalities were 2% and 3.5%, respectively, while the rate of postoperative cerebrovascular events was 1.5%. Long-term survival at a mean follow up of 110 months for the elective and emergency groups was 88.6% and 71.9%, respectively (p = 0.007). Moreover, during the same period new cerebrovascular events were observed in 5.8% of cases. Predictive factors for late survival were type of surgery (elective versus emergency; p = 0.023), conduit size (<=23 mm versus >23 mm; p = 0.053) , age >65 years (p = 0.001), intensive care unit stay (days; p <0.001) and postoperative creatinine level (p = 0.002). Survival rates at one, three, five and 10 years postoperatively were 93.5%, 92.5%, 91.5% and 85.9%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who underwent the modified Bentall operation presented with minimal major adverse effects and demonstrated a good long-term survival.

29501645	Predictors for Late Reoperation After Surgical Repair of Acute Type A Aortic Dissection.	BACKGROUND: It is impossible to resolve all the problems of the entire diseased aorta with just one operation for acute type A aortic dissection, which requires additional surgical treatment in the long-term. METHODS: From April 2004 to March 2017, 310 patients underwent surgical repair for acute type A aortic dissection at our institution. Of these, 32 (10.3%) died in the hospital. Of the 278 hospital survivors, 38 underwent late reoperation associated with aortic dissection during the follow-up period. We compared the 240 nonreoperation patients and the 38 reoperation patients to analyze risk factors for late reoperation after operations for acute type A dissection. RESULTS: The mean duration from the initial operation to reoperation was 3.54 +- 3.0 years. The rates of actuarial freedom from reoperation were 96.9%, 83.2%, and 64.2% at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively. The multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis revealed the following as independent predictors of late reoperation: younger age, Marfan syndrome, nonprescription of beta-blockers, greater diameter of the descending aorta, ratio of false lumen to true lumen of more than 1, limb malperfusion, and primary entry in the ascending aorta. Log-rank analysis revealed no difference in long-term survival between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: We found several risk factors for both late reoperation and death. Specifically, aortic diameter in the early phase after the initial operation and nonuse of beta-blockers were strong predictors. The ratio of the false lumen to the true lumen may also be a new and useful indicator for late reoperation.
38728516	Acute ischemic stroke with a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome: A report of 3 cases in multifaceted settings.	RATIONALE: Marfan syndrome (MFS), which is a dominantly inherited connective tissue disease resulting from a mutation in the FBN1 gene, exhibits variable manifestations affecting the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, ophthalmologic, and pulmonary systems. Notably, neurologic deficiency, which involves ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, is a rare but severe manifestation. The safety of rt-PA treatment for ischemic stroke caused by MFS is still under discussion. PATIENT CONCERNS: In the current report, we discuss 3 atypical MFS cases presented as acute ischemic stroke, compared to those exhibiting cardiovascular and musculoskeletal abnormalities. DIAGNOSES: Three patients were diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke accompanied by MFS based on clinical manifestations, imaging examinations, and genetic testings. INTERVENTIONS: The first case underwent intravenous thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA, the second case received antiplatelet therapy, and the third case received anticoagulant therapy and perfusion therapy. OUTCOMES: The neurologic deficiency of all three patients showed improvement upon discharge, and there were no symptoms of recurrence observed during the follow-up period. LESSONS SUBSECTIONS: MFS is a rare etiology in young people with embolic stroke of undetermined source. Physicians should take MFS into consideration when they observe the characteristic symptoms during a consultation. The potential pathogenesis of ischemic stroke secondary to MFS may include cardio-embolism, arterial dissection, and hypoperfusion. Although intravenous thrombolysis is a promising therapy to treat acute ischemic stroke, further examinations should be conducted to rule out contraindications in patients with a suspicion of MFS.
30287287	Aortic Surgery Outcomes of Marfan Syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome Patients at Teaching and Nonteaching Hospitals.	BACKGROUND: Despite improvements in prevention and management, aortic aneurysm repair remains a high-risk operation for patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). The goal of this study was to examine differences in characteristics and outcomes of patients with MFS or EDS undergoing aortic aneurysm repair at teaching versus nonteaching hospitals. METHODS: We used the National Inpatient Sample to study patients with MFS or EDS undergoing open or endovascular aortic aneurysm repair from 2000 to 2014. RESULTS: Of 3487 patients (MFS = 3375, EDS = 112), 2974 (85%) had repair at a teaching hospital. Patients who underwent repair at a teaching hospital were slightly younger than those who underwent repair at a nonteaching hospital (38 vs. 43 years, P < 0.01) but otherwise were similar in gender (29% vs. 28% female), race (70% vs. 78% white), and connective tissue disorder diagnosis (97% vs. 97% MFS, all P >= 0.1). There were no differences in anatomy (17% vs. 19% abdominal, 67% vs. 66% thoracic, and 15% vs. 15% thoracoabdominal, all P >= 0.1) or type of repair (5% vs. 5% endovascular), but patients at nonteaching hospitals were more likely to have a dissection (49% vs. 38%, P = 0.02). There was no difference in perioperative mortality (4% vs. 6%, P = 0.5) or length of stay (median 8 days vs. 7 days, P = 0.3) between teaching and nonteaching hospitals. There was also no difference in hemorrhagic (47% vs. 43%), pulmonary (9% vs. 16%), renal (12% vs. 14%), or neurologic (5% vs. 6%) complications between teaching and nonteaching hospitals, respectively (all P >= 0.05). In analysis stratified by anatomic extent of repair, there was a lower prevalence of pulmonary complications in thoracic aorta repairs at teaching hospitals (8.1% vs. 18.4%, P = 0.01) but a higher prevalence of hemorrhage in abdominal aortic repairs at teaching hospitals (45.6% vs. 20.6%, P = 0.04) as compared with nonteaching hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MFS and EDS who undergo aortic aneurysm repair have their operations predominantly at teaching hospitals, but those patients who undergo repair at nonteaching hospitals do not have worse mortality or morbidity despite a higher incidence of dissection.
27898546	Lateral Position for Cesarean Delivery Because of Severe Aortocaval Compression in a Patient With Marfan Syndrome: A Case Report.	Prompt recognition and management of hypotension resulting from aortocaval compression syndrome are essential to optimize the maternal and fetal outcomes. Management involves increasing leftward uterine displacement and sometimes full lateral positioning, although lateral position during cesarean delivery is typically considered to be impractical. We report an obstetric patient case of severe aortocaval compression syndrome resulting in hypotension and loss of consciousness that ultimately underwent cesarean delivery under general anesthesia in the lateral position. Performing cesarean delivery in the lateral position is virtually unreported, and this unique strategy prevented further symptoms of aortocaval compression and enabled safe delivery.
25017773	Hemobilia associated with a giant thrombosed aneurysm of the hepatic artery requiring hepatectomy.	Hemobilia is an unusual and potentially catastrophic cause of gastrointestinal bleeding. Although hepatic artery aneurysm is a cause of hemobilia, nontraumatic cases are infrequently reported. Herein, we describe the case of a giant hepatic artery aneurysm requiring hepatectomy because of repeated hemobilia in a patient with Marfan syndrome. A 53-year-old man presented to our hospital with sudden epigastric pain and jaundice. Abdominal computed tomography showed a giant hepatic arterial aneurysm in the porta hepatis, and emergency endoscopic retrograde cholangiography revealed hemobilia. Assuming that the aneurysm caused the hemobilia, we performed an abdominal angiogram for treatment. The study revealed a thrombosed aneurysm along with tortuous abnormal vessels in the periphery of the left hepatic artery, which appeared to surround the aneurysm. Therefore, we embolized the left hepatic artery, and immediate hemostasis was achieved. Rebleeding occurred 3 times thereafter, and each time, transarterial embolization was performed, resulting in prompt but only temporary hemostasis. Then, emergency left hemihepatectomy and resection of the aneurysm were performed. Pathologic examination of the resected specimen revealed that the aneurysm was completely thrombosed and organized; however, abnormal arterioles proliferated between the aneurysmal wall and the bile duct. The unique feature of this case was that the abnormal arterioles induced by the organized hepatic artery aneurysm, not the aneurysm itself, caused the hemobilia.

31639477	Endovascular Repair of Bilateral Internal Mammary Artery Aneurysms in a Patient with Marfan Syndrome.	BACKGROUND: True internal mammary artery aneurysms are rare but rupture has been described. CASE REPORT: A 39-year-old male patient with Marfan syndrome was diagnosed with large asymptomatic bilateral internal mammary artery aneurysms (IMAAs) on contrast-enhanced CT scan, without other arterial lesions. Both aneurysms were coil embolized, a stent graft was deployed in the left subclavian artery to cover a wide neck that precluded complete and safe embolization of the left IMAA. Reintervention on the right side was performed 5 years later due to recanalization. Eight years after the initial procedure, the patient presented with a type A aortic dissection that was successfully repaired. CONCLUSIONS: Although extremely rare, endovascular treatment should be considered to prevent rupture of internal mammary artery aneurysms.
37330246	Emergency vascular surgical care in populations with unique physiologic characteristics: Pediatric, pregnant, and frail populations.	Vascular surgical emergencies are common in vascular surgical care and require complex decision making and multidisciplinary care. They are especially challenging when they occur in patients with unique physiological characteristics, such as pediatric, pregnant, and frail patients. Among the pediatric and pregnant population, vascular emergencies are rare. This rarity challenges accurate and timely diagnosis of the vascular emergency. This landscape review summarizes these three unique populations' epidemiology and emergency vascular considerations. Understanding the epidemiology is the foundation for accurate diagnosis and subsequent management. Considering each population's unique characteristics is crucial to the emergent vascular surgical interventions decision making. Collaborative and multidisciplinary care is vital in gaining expertise in managing these special populations and achieving optimal patient outcomes.
28838101	Valve-sparing David I procedure in acute aortic type A dissection: a 20-year experience with more than 100 patients.	OBJECTIVES: The aortic valve-sparing David procedure has been applied to the elective treatment of patients with aortic aneurysms with excellent results. The use of this technique in patients with acute aortic dissection type A (AADA) is still a matter of debate. We present our long-term experience with 109 patients with AADA who had the valve-sparing David I procedure. METHODS: Between July 1993 and October 2015, 109 patients with AADA had the valve-sparing David I procedure at our centre. We conducted a retrospective review with follow-up. RESULTS: The mean age was 54 +- 12 years; 78 (72%) patients were men. Marfan syndrome was present in 6 (5%) patients and bicuspid aortic valve in 3 (3%). Only 4 (4%) patients received the isolated David procedure; 50 (46%) underwent additional proximal, 13 (12%) subtotal and 42 (39%) total aortic arch replacement. The in-hospital mortality rate was 11% ( n  = 12). Intraoperative/discharge echocardiography showed aortic insufficiency <= I  in 93 of 97 patients (96%). Mean follow-up time was 8.3 +- 5.7 years. The survival rate after discharge at 1, 5 and 10 years was 94%, 90% and 78%, respectively. Thirteen percent ( n  = 13) of patients underwent valve-related reoperation. Freedom from valve-related reoperation at 1, 5 and 10 years was 96%, 88% and 85%, respectively. Compared to patients who underwent the David I procedure for any reason other than AADA, there were no significant differences in long-term survival rates ( P  = 0.29) and freedom from a valve-related reoperation ( P  = 0.39). CONCLUSIONS: The valve-sparing David I procedure has acceptable long-term results even in emergent operations for AADA and is not inferior when performed in elective settings.
28780581	Developing a shared decision support framework for aortic root surgery in Marfan syndrome.	OBJECTIVE: The study is an early phase of development of a decision support framework for people with Marfan syndrome who are anticipating prophylactic aortic root surgery. Implications of the timing and the nature of the operation chosen were previously elicited in focus groups. In this step, we explored the range of relative values placed by individuals on the implications of decisions made about surgery. METHODS: Following the principles of the Ottawa Decision Support Framework, eight questions in the general form 'How important is it to you ...' were framed by a panel. Marfan people, families and specialist doctors answered online. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed. RESULTS: Worldwide, 142 responses were received including 25 specialist doctors. Respondents were 55% female and 46% had previous aortic root surgery. Overall, active lifestyle was more important to males (p=0.03). Patients placed more importance than doctors on not deferring surgery (p=0.04) and on avoidance of anticoagulation in the interests of childbearing (p=0.009). Qualitative analysis showed differing but cogently reasoned values that were sometimes polarised, and mainly driven by the wish to maintain a good quality of life and active lifestyle. CONCLUSIONS: Given the cogency of these viewpoints, people anticipating root replacement surgery should have ample opportunity to express them and to have them acknowledged ahead of a consultation when they can then be fully explored in a mutually informed forum. If they differ from local medical practice, they can then be discussed in the process of reaching shared and individualised decisions.
32224740	Recent Modifications of the Nuss Procedure: The Pursuit of Safety During the Minimally Invasive Repair of Pectus Excavatum.	OBJECTIVE: To review standardized Nuss correction of pectus excavatum and vacuum bell treatment over the last 10 years. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: In 2010, we reported 21 years of the Nuss procedure in 1215 patients. METHODS: Over the last 10 years, 2008-2018, we evaluated 1885 pectus excavatum patients. Surgery was indicated for well-defined objective criteria. A consistent operation was performed by 8 surgeons in 1034 patients, median 15 years, (range 6-46); 996 were primary, and 38 redo operations. Surgical patients' mean computed tomography index was 5.46. Mitral valve prolapse was present in 5.4%, Marfan syndrome in 1.1% and scoliosis in 29%. Vacuum bell treatment was introduced for 218 patients who did not meet surgical criteria or were averse to surgery. RESULTS: At primary operation, 1 bar was placed in 49.8%; 2 bars, 49.4%; and 3 bars, 0.7%. There were no deaths. Cardiac perforation occurred in 1 patient who had undergone previous cardiac surgery. Paraplegia after epidural catheter occurred once. Reoperation for bar displacement occurred in 1.8%, hemothorax in 0.3%, and wound infection in 2.9%; 1.4% required surgical drainage. Allergy to stainless steel was identified in 13.7%. A good anatomic outcome was always achieved at bar removal. Recurrence requiring reoperation occurred in 3 primary surgical patients. Two patients developed carinate overcorrection requiring reoperation. Vacuum bell treatment produced better results in younger and less severe cases. CONCLUSIONS: A standardized Nuss procedure was performed by multiple surgeons in 1034 patients with good overall safety and results in primary repairs. Vacuum bell treatment is useful.
26639091	Successive MRI Findings of Reversible Cerebral White Matter Lesions in a Patient with Cystathionine beta-Synthase Deficiency.	Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency, well known as classical homocystinuria, is a rare autosomal recessive inborn error of homocysteine and sulfur metabolism. CBS converts homocysteine to cystathionine. The clinical features of untreated CBS deficiency include myopia, ectopia lentis, mental retardation, skeletal anomalies resembling Marfan syndrome, and thromboembolic events. Cerebral white matter lesions (CWMLs), identified in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are related to various clinical conditions including ischemia, inflammation, demyelination, infection, a tumor, and metabolic disorders such as phenylketonuria. The presence of CWMLs is, however, believed to be a very rare condition in CBS-deficient patients. Herein, we report reversible CWMLs associated with hypermethioninemia caused by poor protein restriction and betaine therapy in a 21-year-old male with pyridoxine-nonresponsive CBS deficiency. T2-weighted images (T2WI) and fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) images showed diffuse high signal intensity in subcortical areas extending to the deep white matter. Diffusion-weighted images (DWI) showed high signal intensity, while apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map demonstrated decreased ADC value in the lesions. The course of improvement after correct methionine restriction was successively followed by brain MRI. The CWMLs had regressed at 1 month after restriction, and disappeared after 5 months. ADC values were very low before proper methionine restriction, but normalized after 2 months. Use of betaine in the presence of elevated plasma methionine may increase the risk of reversible CWMLs in some CBS-deficient patients. 
26296785	Lensectomy, vitrectomy, and transvitreal ciliary body photocoagulation as primary treatment for glaucoma in microspherophakia.	Microspherophakia is a rare, bilateral developmental anomaly of the crystalline lens. It can occur in isolation or as a component of a familial disorder. It has been associated with the Weill-Marchesani syndrome and Marfan syndrome. Angle clousure glaucoma can occur in microspherophakia and is the primary cause of visual loss. We describe the management of 2 sisters with bilateral microspherophakia and advanced angle closure glaucoma. 
31589859	Aortic Complications in Marfan Syndrome: Should We Anticipate Preventive Aortic Root Surgery?	BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to analyze the risk of aortic events (death, dissection, or aortic rupture) associated with Marfan syndrome and decide on the optimal timing for preventive surgery on the aortic root. METHODS: From January 2004 to June 2015, 397 patients from Marfan Units were studied by echocardiographic and computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of aorta and periodic annual monitoring. Mean follow-up was 5.6 +- 2.7 years. The annual incidence of aortic events was assessed according to aortic diameters for the optimal time for prophylactic surgery to be decided on. RESULTS: Mean age at the first visit was 28.4 +- 14.5 years, with mean sinuses of Valsalva diameter of 37.1 +- 6.6 mm., Eleven aortic events occurred during follow-up: seven deaths and four acute aortic dissections. Mean annual risk of an aortic event was 0.5% (risk of death 0.32% and risk of aortic dissection 0.18%). The increase in aortic diameters was associated with increased risk of 0.2% per year (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.03 to 0.5) with diameters less than 40 mm, 0.3% per year (95% CI, 0.1 to 1.4) between 40 and 44 mm, 1.3% per year (95% CI, 0.3 to 4.6) between 45 and 49 mm, and 5.2% per year (95% CI, 0.4 to 12.4) with diameters 50 mm or greater. Fifty-six patients underwent elective surgery with no inhospital mortality. Overall survival at 3, 5, and 10 years was 99% +- 5%, 98.6% +- 6%, and 95.5% +- 2.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of aortic events in patients with Marfan syndrome followed at specific units is low, although the risk increases with aortic diameters of 45 mm or greater. These results support current indications, but we consider it reasonable at experienced centers (elective root aortic surgery mortality less than 1%) to indicate an early surgery when the aortic root exceeds 45 mm.
26026739	Heart disease in pregnancy.	Cardiac disease is the leading cause of maternal mortality in the developed world. The majority of women with heart disease are able to successfully undergo pregnancy. However, in women with severely impaired ventricular function, severe left heart obstruction, pulmonary hypertension and aortopathy, such as Marfan syndrome, with significant aortic dilatation, pregnancy is associated with a significant risk, and these women should be counselled against pregnancy if there is no option for treatment that reduces risk. Although there are increasing numbers of women with congenital heart disease who are considering pregnancy, as a result of joint expert specialist cardiac and obstetric care, maternal mortality is low. Most of the observed mortality occurs in women with structurally normal hearts who were not known to have heart disease before their pregnancy. It is therefore important that those caring for pregnant women are aware of the risk factors for and presentation of cardiac conditions in pregnancy. We review the presentation and management of both congenital and acquired heart diseases in pregnancy. 
25037520	Aortopathy in pregnancy.	Up to half of all aortic dissections and ruptures in women younger than 40 years are associated with pregnancy. In pregnancy, women with aortic disease such as arteritis and aortitis are at significant risk of aneurysmal formation and dissection with potential for catastrophic outcomes. Pregnancy places predisposed women at an increased risk of dissection due to physiological and hormonal changes that occur, particularly those with connective tissue disorders, genetic syndromes, congenital heart disease, and other heritable and acquired conditions involving the aorta. Thus, preconception counseling and preparation are advised to determine which patients may cautiously pursue pregnancy, to optimize medical management prior to conception (antihypertensive medications and anticoagulants in the setting of mechanical valves), to identify women in whom aortic root repair should occur prior to pregnancy, and lastly, those in whom pregnancy is contraindicated. Additionally, discussion of the heritable nature of many aortic conditions and associated syndromes is indicated. Preconception and genetic counseling, management by a multidisciplinary team, along with close echocardiographic surveillance and medical management, are recommended if precursors of dissection are identified. 
33864828	In-hospital outcomes and long-term survival of women of childbearing age with aortic dissection.	OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we defined the outcomes and effects of pregnancy in a cohort of women of childbearing age with acute aortic dissection (AAD). METHODS: We reviewed our database of AAD to identify all eligible female patients. Women aged <45 years were included. Data on pregnancy timing with respect to the occurrence of dissection, the demographic data, dissection extent, dissection treatment, dissection-related outcomes, overall maternal and fetal mortality, and genetic testing results were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 62 women aged <45 years had presented to us with AAD from 1999 to 2017. Of the 62 women, 37 (60%) had had a history of pregnancy at AAD. Of these 37 patients, 10 (27%) had had a peripartum aortic dissection, defined as dissection during pregnancy or within 12 months postpartum. Of the 10 AADs, 5 were type A and 5 were type B. Three patients had presented with AAD during pregnancy (one in the second and two in the third trimester). Five patients (50%) had developed AAD in the immediate postpartum period (within 3 months) and two (20%) in the late postpartum period. For the immediate postpartum AADs (<3 months), four of the five patients delivered via cesarean section. Of these 10 peripartum AADs, 3 (30%) had occurred in patients with known Marfan syndrome. In-hospital mortality for those with peripartum AAD was 10% (1 of 10). Fetal mortality was 20% (2 of 10). CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of aortic dissection in women of childbearing age at our institution was low. However, pregnancy might increase the risk of those young women genetically predisposed to dissection events. From these data, this risk appears to be greatest in the immediate postpartum period, even for those who undergo cesarean section. Close clinical and radiographic surveillance is required for all women with suspected aortopathy, especially in the third trimester and early postpartum period.
33256768	Analysis of the corrective contribution of strong halo-femoral traction in the treatment of severe rigid nonidiopathic scoliosis.	INTRODUCTION: Strong halo-femoral traction has been widely used in the field of severe rigid scoliosis correction. The objective of this study was to analyze the corrective contribution of strong halo-femoral traction in the treatment of severe rigid nonidiopathic scoliosis and discuss its meaning. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective review was performed for patients with severe rigid nonidiopathic scoliosis who were treated with halo-femoral traction in our center from December 2008 to December 2015. All cases underwent halo-femoral traction for 2 to 4 weeks before a one-stage posterior operation, and the absolute and relative contribution rates of each orthopedic factor (bending, fulcrum, traction, surgery) were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 38 patients were included (15 males and 23 females), with a mean age of 16.4 +- 3.73 years (10-22 years) and follow-up of 55.05 +- 6.63 months (range 40-68 months). The etiology was congenital in 17 patients, neuromuscular in 14 patients, neurofibromatosis-1 in 3 patients, and Marfan syndrome in 2 patients. Congenital high scapular disease with scoliosis was found in 2 patients. The mean coronal Cobb angle of the major curve was 97.99  +- 11.47  (range 78 -124 ), with a mean flexibility of 15.68% +- 6.65%. The absolute contribution rate (ACR) of bending was 27.26% +- 10.16%, the ACR of the fulcrum was 10.91% +- 2.50%, the ACR of traction was 32.32% +- 11.41%, and the ACR of surgery was 29.50% +- 9.70%. A significant difference in correction was noted between the ACRs of traction and the fulcrum (P < 0.05). DISCUSSION: Strong halo-femoral traction plays a relatively significant role in the treatment of severe rigid nonidiopathic scoliosis while decreasing the risk of operation, and it is a safe and effective method for the treatment of severe rigid nonidiopathic scoliosis.

32679894	Genotype-Phenotype Correlation in Children: The Impact of FBN1 Variants on Pediatric Marfan Care.	Currently, no reliable genotype-phenotype correlation is available for pediatric Marfan patients in everyday clinical practice. We investigated correlations of FBN1 variants with the prevalence and age of onset of Marfan manifestations in childhood and differentiated three groups: missense/in-frame, splice, and nonsense/frameshift variants. In addition, we differentiated missense variants destroying or generating a cysteine (cys-missense) and alterations not affecting cysteine. We categorized 105 FBN1-positive pediatric patients. Patients with cys-missense more frequently developed aortic dilatation (p = 0.03) requiring medication (p = 0.003), tricuspid valve prolapse (p = 0.03), and earlier onset of myopia (p = 0.02) than those with other missense variants. Missense variants correlated with a higher prevalence of ectopia lentis (p = 0.002) and earlier onset of pulmonary artery dilatation (p = 0.03) than nonsense/frameshift, and dural ectasia was more common in the latter (p = 0.005). Pectus excavatum (p = 0.007) appeared more often in patients with splice compared with missense/in-frame variants, while hernia (p = 0.04) appeared earlier in the latter. Findings on genotype-phenotype correlations in Marfan-affected children can improve interdisciplinary therapy. In patients with cys-missense variants, early medical treatment of aortic dilatation seems reasonable and early regular ophthalmologic follow-up essential. Patients with nonsense/frameshift and splice variants require early involvement of orthopedic specialists to support the growing child.
25042925	[Effect of native aortic valve sparing aortic root reconstruction surgery on short- and long-term prognosis in Marfan syndrome patients:a meta-analysis].	OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis was performed to analyze the effect of preserving the native aortic valve on short- and long-term prognosis post aortic root reconstruction surgery for patients with Marfan syndrome. METHODS: Database including Pubmed,Embase, Cochrane library, CNKI, Wanfang,VIP and CBM were searched to collect studies comparing clinical results of valve sparing surgery with composite valve graft surgery for patients with Marfan syndrome. Study quality was assessed by Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of the funnel plot together with Egger test. Clinical outcomes data was extracted from the manuscripts and analyzed with Revman 5.0 supplied by Cochrane collaboration. RESULTS: Seven clinical trials with 690 patients were included. Meta- analysis demonstrated that valve sparing surgery was associated with a lower incidence of re-exploration (RR = 0.51, 95%CI:0.29- 0.90, P < 0.05), thromboembolism (RR = 0.17, 95%CI:0.05-0.57, P < 0.01), endocarditis (RR = 0.31, 95%CI:0.11-0.94, P < 0.05) and significantly lower long-term death rate (RR = 0.37, 95%CI:0.18-0.74, P < 0.01). Reoperation rate was similar between the two groups (RR = 1.07, 95%CI:0.35-3.27, P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Valve sparing aortic root reconstruction surgery is a superior procedure to composite valve graft surgery in term of improving the short- and long-term prognosis for patients with Marfan syndrome.
33371807	Ten-Year Clinical Characteristics and Early Outcomes of Type B Aortic Dissection Patients With Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair.	OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: This study examined the 10-year hospitalization characteristics, economic patterns and early clinical outcomes of type B aortic dissection (TBAD) patients that underwent thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) in one high-volume hospital in China. METHODS: We performed a population-based retrospective analysis based on electronic medical record system data provided by Zhongshan Hospital Fudan University from 2009 to 2018. RESULTS: We identified 1,367 cases of TBAD patients with TEVAR over the past decade. The total incidence of in-hospital complications was 7.6% (104 of 1,367), among which acute kidney injury (AKI) had the highest incidence (3.1%, 42 of 1,367). Aortic-related reintervention was performed in 7 patients (0.5%). The overall aortic-related in-hospital mortality rate was 2.7% (37 of 1,367) and had no significant time-varying trend (P = 0.2). Among these, 27% of in-hospital deaths were caused by retrograde type A dissection (RTAD). Chronic TBAD had a higher risk of in-hospital death versus acute TBAD, with a risk ratio of 2.69 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.19-6.09). Patients with hypertension (risk ratio 4.63, 95% CI: 1.38, 15.54) also had a higher in-hospital death risk. These 2 factors were also the predictive factors for the composite endpoint of in-hospital adverse events (risk ratio 2.17, 95% CI: 1.43, 3.29 and risk ratio 4.83, 95% CI: 1.90, 12.28, respectively), in addition to Marfan syndrome (risk ratio 4.05, 95% CI: 1.61, 10.19). The average length of hospitalization significantly declined during the past decade (annual percentage change -6.3%, 95% CI -8.2 to -4.3), and the stent-grafts (SGs) cost was the main expenditure of the total hospitalization costs. CONCLUSION: Our study showed a favorable early outcome of TEVAR over the past decade. Greater attention should be paid to certain risk factors in order to reduce the in-hospital adverse events. SG expenditure is still the primary economic burden on Chinese TBAD patients.
32497341	Acute complicated type B aortic dissection during the New York City COVID-19 surge.	The impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in New York City (NYC) is dramatic. COVID-19 cases surged, hospitals expanded to meet capacity, and NYC remains the global epicenter of this pandemic. During this unprecedented time, a young woman with known Marfan syndrome presented with an acute complicated type B aortic dissection to our Aortic Center. Using the provisional extension to induce a complete attachment technique, we treated this patient and quickly discharged her the next day to decrease the risk of COVID-19 infection. Her progress was monitored using frequent phone calls and one office visit at two weeks.
25996421	Intraoperative Suprachoroidal Hemorrhage After Penetrating Keratoplasty: Case Series and Review of Literature.	OBJECTIVE: To describe four cases of intraoperative suprachoroidal hemorrhage (SCH) during penetrating keratoplasty and to review the literature. METHODS: Cases with intraoperative SCH during penetrating keratoplasty over 3-year period were reviewed. The parameters evaluated were ocular and systemic risk factors, intraoperative details, and postoperative outcomes. A review of literature of intraoperative SCH during penetrating keratoplasty was also conducted. RESULTS: Of the 543 cases that underwent penetrating keratoplasty for optical indications during the study period, four cases developed intraoperative SCH, which is an incidence of 0.73%. Suprachoroidal hemorrhage occurred in the following cases: failed pediatric graft, donor eye in a case of contralateral autokeratoplasty, Marfan syndrome with aphakic bullous keratopathy who had undergone multiple ocular surgeries, and a case of healed keratitis with corneoiridic scar. The mean age, axial length, and intraocular pressure were 32.75+-22.17 years (range, 4-57 years), 23.29+-2.12 mm (range, 20.38-25.2 mm), and 16.25+-3.86 mm Hg (range, 16-20 mm Hg), respectively. Postoperatively, two eyes had a best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of counting fingers. The third case had BCVA of light perception (LP), and fourth eye had no LP. CONCLUSION: The visual outcomes in cases of open-sky penetrating keratoplasty with SCH continue to be abysmally poor. The importance of thoroughly informing the patient about this complication cannot be underrated.
31194238	Lensectomy Vitrectomy for Ectopia Lentis and Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment in a Patient With Marfan Syndrome.	
32650901	Meta-analysis Examining the Usefulness of Angiotensin Receptor blockers for the Prevention of Aortic Root Dilation in Patients With the Marfan Syndrome.	The Marfan syndrome (MFS) patients are highly predisposed to thoracic aortic aneurysm and/or dissection, with virtually every patient having evidence of aortic disease at some point during their lifetime. We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the efficacy of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in slowing down the progression of aortic dilatation in MFS patients. PUBMED, EMBASE, and COCHRANE databases were searched for relevant articles published from inception to February 1, 2020. We included randomized clinical trials evaluating the effect of ARBs on aortic root size in patients with MFS with a follow-up period of at least 2.5 years. Seven studies were included with a total of 1,510 patients. Our analysis demonstrated a significantly smaller change in aortic root and ascending aorta dilation in the ARBs treated group when compared with placebo (mean difference 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.31 to -0.04; p = 0.04, I2 = 94%, and mean difference -0.13, 95% CI -0.17 to -0.09; p < 0.00001, I2 = 0%, respectively). ARBs as an add-on therapy to beta-blockers resulted in a significantly smaller change in aortic root dilation when compared with the arm without ARBs (mean difference -2.06, 95% CI -2.54 to -1.58; p < 0.00001, I2 = 91%). However, there was no statistically significant difference in the number of clinical events (aortic complications/surgery) observed in the ARBs arm when compared with placebo (Risk ratio of 1.01, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.38; p = 0.94, I2 = 0%). In conclusion, ARBs therapy is associated with a slower progression of aortic root dilation when compared with placebo and as an addition to beta-blocker therapy.
29631804	Influence of Aortic Stiffness on Aortic-Root Growth Rate and Outcome in Patients With the Marfan Syndrome.	The Pediatric Heart Network randomized trial of atenolol versus losartan in the Marfan syndrome showed no treatment differences in the rates of aortic-root growth or clinical outcomes. In this report we present treatment effects on aortic stiffness and determine whether baseline aortic stiffness predicts aortic-root growth and clinical outcomes. Echocardiograms at 0, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months from 608 subjects (6 months to 25 years) who met original Ghent criteria and had a maximum aortic-root z-score (ARz) >3 were centrally reviewed. Stiffness index (SI) and elastic modulus (EM) were calculated for aortic root and ascending aorta. Data were analyzed using multivariable mixed effects modeling and Cox regression. Heart rate-corrected aortic-root SI over 3 years decreased with atenolol but did not change with losartan (-0.298 +- 0.139 vs 0.141 +- 0.139/year, p = 0.01). In the entire cohort, above-median aortic-root SI (>9.1) and EM (>618 mm Hg) predicted a smaller annual decrease in ARz (p <=0.001). Upper-quartile aortic-root EM (>914 mm Hg) predicted the composite outcome of aortic-root surgery, dissection, or death (hazard ratio 2.17, 95% confidence interval 1.02 to 4.63, p = 0.04). Crude 3-year event rates were 10.4% versus 3.2% for higher versus lower EM groups. In conclusion, atenolol was associated with a decrease in aortic-root SI, whereas losartan was not. Higher baseline aortic-root SI and EM were associated with a smaller decrease in ARz and increased risk for clinical outcomes. These data suggest that noninvasive aortic stiffness measures may identify patients at higher risk of progressive aortic enlargement and adverse clinical outcomes, potentially allowing for closer monitoring and more aggressive therapy.
28108550	Cardiac resynchronization therapy in adults with congenital heart disease.	Aims: In adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) heart failure is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality but experience with and reported outcome of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is limited. We investigated the efficacy of CRT in adults with CHD. Methods and results: This was a retrospective study including 48 adults with CHD who received CRT since 2003 in four tertiary referral centres. Responders were defined as patients who showed improvement in NYHA functional class and/or systemic ventricular ejection fraction by at least one category. Ventricular function was assessed by echocardiography and graded on a four point ordinal scale. Median age at CRT was 47 years (range 18-74 years) and 77% was male. Cardiac diagnosis included tetralogy of Fallot in 29%, (congenitally corrected) transposition of great arteries in 23%, septal defects in 25%, left sided lesions in 21%, and Marfan syndrome in 2% of the patients. The median follow-up duration after CRT was 2.6 years (range 0.1-8.8). Overall, 37 out of 48 patients (77%) responded to CRT either by improvement of NYHA functional class and/or systemic ventricular function. There were 11 non-responders to CRT. Of these, three patients died and four underwent heart transplantation. Conclusion: In this cohort of older CHD patients, CRT was accomplished with a success rate comparable to those with acquired heart disease despite the complex anatomy and technical challenges frequently encountered in this population. Further studies are needed to establish appropriate guidelines for patient selection and long term outcome.
28669506	Risk Factors for Late Aortic Valve Dysfunction After the David V Valve-Sparing Root Replacement.	BACKGROUND: Valve-sparing root replacement (VSRR) is an established therapy for aortic root pathology. However, late aortic valve dysfunction requiring reoperation remains a primary concern of this procedure. This study examines risk factors for late aortic insufficiency (AI) and aortic stenosis (AS) after David V VSRR. METHODS: A retrospective review from 2005 to 2015 at a US academic center identified 282 patients who underwent VSRR. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to identify risk factors for late AI and AS after VSRR. RESULTS: The mean age was 46.4 years. Sixty-four patients (22.7%) had bicuspid valves, and 41 patients (14.5%) had Marfan syndrome. The incidence of reoperations was 27 (9.6%), and 42 cases (14.9%) presented with acute type A dissection. Operative mortality was 8 (2.8%). Seven-year survival was 90.9%. Seven-year cumulative incidence of reoperation, greater than 2+ AI and greater than moderate AS were 3.1%, 2.2%, and 0.8%, respectively. Multivariable analysis showed aortic root size 55 mm or larger (hazard ratio 3.44, 95% confidence interval: 1.27 to 9.29, p = 0.01) to be a risk factor for late AI whereas bicuspid valve (hazard ratio 16.07, 95% confidence interval: 3.12 to 82.68, p = 0.001) and cusp repair were found to be risk factors (hazard ratio 5.91, 95% confidence interval: 1.17 to 29.86, p = 0.03) for late AS. CONCLUSIONS: Valve-sparing root replacement can be performed with low operative risk and good overall long-term survival even in complex clinical settings. Durable valve function can be expected; however, aortic root size 55 cm or more, bicuspid valve anatomy, and cusp repair represent independent risk factors for late aortic valve dysfunction after these procedures.
31914988	A case of Marfan syndrome with massive haemoptysis from collaterals of the lateral thoracic artery.	BACKGROUND: Marfan Syndrome (MFS) is a heritable connective tissue disorder with a high degree of clinical variability including respiratory diseases; a rare case of MFS with massive intrathoracic bleeding has been reported recently. CASE PRESENTATION: A 32-year-old man who had been diagnosed with MFS underwent a Bentall operation with artificial valve replacement for aortic dissection and regurgitation of an aortic valve in 2012. Warfarin was started postoperatively, and the dosage was gradually increased until 2017, when the patient was transported to our hospital due to sudden massive haemoptysis. Computed tomography (CT) with a maximum intensity projection (MIP) revealed several giant pulmonary cysts with fluid levels in the apex of the right lung with an abnormal vessel from the right subclavian artery. Transcatheter arterial embolization was performed with angiography and haemostasis was achieved, which suggested that the bleeding vessel was the lateral thoracic artery (LTA) branch. CT taken before the incident indicated thickening of the cystic wall adjacent to the thorax; therefore, it was postulated that the bleeding originated from fragile anastomoses between the LTA and pulmonary or bronchial arteries. It appears that the vessels exhibited inflammation that began postoperatively, which extended to the cysts. CONCLUSION: We experienced a case of MFS with massive haemoptysis from the right LTA. We have to be aware of the possibility that massive haemoptysis could be induced in MFS with inflamed pulmonary cysts.
32783137	A whole-genome sequencing-based novel preimplantation genetic testing method for de novo mutations combined with chromosomal balanced translocations.	PURPOSE: To explore a new preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) method for de novo mutations (DNMs) combined with chromosomal balanced translocations by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) using the MGISEQ-2000 sequencer. METHODS: Two families, one with maternal Olmsted syndrome caused by DNM (c.1246C>T) in TRPV3 and a paternal Robertsonian translocation and one with paternal Marfan syndrome caused by DNM (c.4952_4955delAATG) in FBN1 and a maternal reciprocal translocation, underwent PGT for monogenetic disease (PGT-M), chromosomal aneuploidy, and structural rearrangement. WGS of embryos and family members were performed. Bioinformatics analysis based on gradient sequencing depth was performed, and parent-embryo haplotyping was conducted for DNM diagnosis. Sanger sequencing, karyotyping, and chromosomal microarray analysis were performed using an amniotic fluid sample to confirm the PGT results. RESULTS: After 1 PGT cycle, WGS of 2 embryos from the Olmsted syndrome family revealed euploid embryos without DNMs; after 2 cycles, the 11 embryos from the Marfan syndrome family showed only 1 normal embryo without DNM, copy number variations (CNVs), or aneuploidy. Moreover, 1 blastocyst from the Marfan syndrome family was transferred back to the uterus; the amniocentesis test results were confirmed by PGT and a healthy infant was born. CONCLUSIONS: WGS based on parent-embryo haplotypes was an effective strategy for PGT of DNMs combined with a chromosomal balanced translocation. Our results indicate this is a reliable and effective diagnostic method that is useful for clinical application in PGT of patients with DNMs.
31478365	Chylous Ascites Developing after Open Thoracoabdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair in a Patient with Marfan Syndrome.	Chylous ascites is the pathologic accumulation of chylous fluid in the peritoneal cavity, caused by lymphomas, metastatic malignancies, and abdominal surgeries, rarely due to surgical trauma of the cisterna chyli or its major branches. A 24-year-old man with history of Marfan syndrome presented to our hospital with abdominal distention, abdominal pain, fluid in the incision region, and weakness. He had underwent an elective open aneurysm repair surgery nine days before for thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm. Computed tomography revealed massive fluid collection in the abdominal cavity, which was drained surgically. He was diagnosed with chylous ascites and was discharged after conservative treatment.
27825688	Aortic Dissection in Pregnancy: Management Strategy and Outcomes.	"BACKGROUND: Aortic dissection in pregnancy is a rare but lethal catastrophe. Clinical experiences are limited. We report our experience in 25 patients focusing on etiology, management strategies, and outcomes. METHODS: Between June 1998 and February 2015, we treated 25 pregnant women (mean age, 31.6 +- 4.7 years) in whom aortic dissection developed at a mean of 28 +- 10 gestational weeks (GWs). Type A aortic dissection (TAAD) was present in 20 (80%) and type B (TBAD) in 5 (20%). Marfan syndrome was seen in 17 (68%). Management strategy was based on dissection type and GWs. RESULTS: TAADs were managed surgically in 19 (95.0%) and medically in 1 (5.0%). Maternal and fetal mortalities were, respectively, 14.3% (1 of 7) and 0 (0 of 7) in the ""delivery first"" group (7 of 20), 16.7% (1 of 6) and 33.3% (2 of 6) in ""single-stage delivery and aortic repair"" group (6 of 20), 16.7% (1 of 6) and 66.7% (4 of 6) in ""aortic repair first"" group (6 of 20), and 100% (1 of 1) and 100% (1 of 1) in the ""medical management"" group (1 of 20). TBADs were managed surgically in 60% (3 of 5) and endovascularly and medically in 20% each (1 of 5). No maternal deaths occurred. Fetal mortality was 100% in the surgical group and 0% in the other groups. During late follow-up, which was complete in 95.2% (20 of 21), 3 maternal and 2 fetal deaths occurred in the TAAD group. Overall maternal survival was 68.6% at 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Marfan syndrome predominates among women with aortic dissection in pregnancy. For TAADs, after 28 GWs, delivery followed by surgical repair can achieve maternal and fetal survival adequately; before 28 GWs, maternal survival should be prioritized given the high risk of fetal death. For TBADs in pregnancy, nonsurgical management is preferred."
29934004	Stent-assisted, balloon-induced intimal disruption and relamination of aortic dissection in patients with Marfan syndrome: Midterm outcomes and aortic remodeling.	OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to assess the midterm outcomes and aortic remodeling in patients with Marfan syndrome with complicated acute type B aortic dissection treated with stent-assisted, balloon-induced intimal disruption and relamination. METHODS: We reviewed all patients treated with stent-assisted, balloon-induced intimal disruption and relamination for a complicated acute type B aortic dissection associated with Marfan syndrome according to the revised Ghent criteria. RESULTS: Between 2015 and November 2017, 7 patients with Marfan syndrome underwent stent-assisted, balloon-induced intimal disruption and relamination for a complicated acute type B aortic dissection. The median age of patients was 47 years (range, 23-70). Four patients had a history of aortic root replacement. Technical success was achieved in 100%. Three patients required an adjunctive procedure for renal artery stenting (n = 2) and iliac artery stenting (n = 1). There was no in-hospital death, 30-day postoperative stroke, spinal cord ischemia, ischemic colitis, or renal failure requiring dialysis. At a median follow-up of 15 months (range, 7-28), 1 patient required aortic arch replacement for aneurysmal degeneration associated with a type Ia endoleak at 2 years, giving a late reintervention rate of 14%. There was no other secondary endoleak. The primary visceral patency rate was 100%. There were no all-cause deaths reported. At last computed tomography scan, all patients had complete aortic remodeling of the treated thoracoabdominal aorta. Distally, at the nonstented infrarenal aortoiliac level, 6 patients had persistent false lumen flow with stable aorto-iliac diameter in 5. One patient had iliac diameter growth (27 mm diameter at last computed tomography scan). CONCLUSIONS: Stent-assisted, balloon-induced intimal disruption and relamination of aortic dissection in patients with Marfan syndrome is feasible, safe, and associated with an immediate and midterm persisting thoracoabdominal aortic remodeling.

26771095	[Efficacy of Stent-Assisted Coil Embolization for a Dissecting Aneurysm of the Cervical Internal Carotid Artery Caused by a Systemic Vascular Disease: A Case Report].	Systemic vascular diseases such as fibromuscular dysplasia, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and Behcet's disease are known to cause spontaneous dissecting aneurysms of the cervical internal carotid artery. These diseases are generally associated with vascular fragility; therefore, invasive treatments are avoided in many cases of dissecting aneurysms, and a conservative approach is used for the primary disease. Surgical or intravascular treatment may be chosen when aneurysms are progressive or are associated with a high risk of hemorrhage; however, there is no consensus on which treatment is better. We report a case of a dissecting aneurysm of the cervical internal carotid artery in a patient with suspected Behcet's disease, which was treated using stent-assisted coil embolization. A man in his 40's, with suspected Behcet's disease, presented with an enlarged dissecting aneurysm of the right cervical internal carotid artery. The lesion was present for approximately 10 years. We performed stent-assisted coil embolization for the lesion. Post-surgery, no aneurysms were detected with carotid artery echography. Our case report suggests that stent-assisted coil embolization is a promising treatment for dissecting aneurysms of the cervical internal carotid artery. In addition, the procedure demonstrates the utility of carotid artery echograms for examining recanalization after stent-assisted coil embolization. 
32548607	Internal thoracic artery pseudoaneurysm after redo aortic root replacement.	Pseudoaneurysm of the internal thoracic artery (ITA) or bleeding from the ITA is an extremely rare complication after cardiovascular surgery via a median sternotomy. Early treatment is needed in the case of massive haemorrhage or a rapidly enlarging pseudoaneurysm. Herein, we present a rare case of a delayed large pseudoaneurysm of the right ITA in a 49-year-old woman with Marfan syndrome who underwent redo aortic root replacement via re-median sternotomy and pacemaker implantation. Diagnostic selective angiography revealed the origin of the pseudoaneurysm, and simultaneous transcatheter embolisation of the ITA was successfully performed. Follow-up computed tomography imaging showed no evidence of contrast media extravasation from the ITA and recurrent extra-pleural haemorrhage. Our findings suggest that postoperative management of patients who have undergone median sternotomy, including cardiovascular surgeries, should also focus on the prevention or early detection of pseudoaneurysm of the ITA to avoid life-threatening conditions.
26123456	Left gastric artery aneurysm in Marfan syndrome: a unique case.	A 78-year-old man presented with abdominal pain, high International Normalised Ratio and rapidly falling haemoglobin. He had a background of Marfan syndrome and was on warfarin following mechanical aortic valve replacement. Abdominal CT imaging showed haemoperitoneum with a leaking aneurysm of the left gastric artery measuring 10 mm in diameter. The decision whether to reverse his anticoagulation provided a difficult clinical scenario given the risk of thrombosis associated with the mechanical aortic valve. The patient went on to have a successful percutaneous embolisation of the aneurysm using a metallic coil and Onyx. Left gastric artery aneurysms are rare and have a reported mortality of up to 70%. This is the first case of gastric artery aneurysm described in a patient with Marfan syndrome.
27662508	Economic and care considerations of Marfan syndrome.	INTRODUCTION: Marfan syndrome is a rare multisystem disease of the connective tissue, which affects multiple organ systems. advances in healthcare have doubled the life-expectancy of patients over the past three decades. to date, there is no comprehensive review that consolidates economic considerations and care for marfan patients. Areas covered: Present research suggests that there may be a link between treatment pattern, disease progression and economic costs of Marfan syndrome. It indicates that an early detection of the disease and preventive interventions achieve a dual aim. From a patient perspective, it may reduce the amount of emergency surgery or intervention, and inpatient stays. In addition, it slows disease progression, lowers lifestyle restrictions, reduces psychological stress, and improves health-related quality of life. Expert commentary: Early detection and preventive measures are likely to achieve a dual aim by simultaneously containing costs and reducing the number and length of inpatient stays.
25446311	[Genetics and prevention of genetic aortic syndromes (GAS) and of the Marfan syndrome].	BACKGROUND: Genetic aortic syndromes are autosomal-dominantly heritable aneurysms of the thoracic aorta, which carry a high risk of aortic rupture or acute thoracic aortic dissection at young age. OBJECTIVES: We introduce the reader to the principles of genetic diagnostics and the medical and surgical prevention of thoracic aortic dissection in patients with genetic aortic syndromes. METHODS: A cardiologist, a health economist, a patient representative, a heart surgeon, and a molecular geneticist teamed up to elucidate their perspective on major aspects of genetics and prevention of genetic aortic syndromes. RESULTS: Genetic aortic syndromes reflect a broad spectrum of diverse disease entities comprising the Marfan syndrome, the Loeys-Dietz syndrome or the vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The diagnosis of each respective disease entity requires combined assessment of phenotype and genotype information. A medical prevention of aortic complications such as dissection is mandatory although a curative therapy currently appears unlikely in humans. The single most important measure against acute aortic dissection is the preventive replacement of the aortic root, where valve preserving techniques appear preferable. Comprehensive prophylaxis including molecular diagnostics seem reasonable also from an economic point of view. DISCUSSION: Optimal prevention requires individualization of concepts, which entail a detailed diagnostic characterization of each specific genetic aortic syndrome including characterization of the genotype.
31688710	Successful Thrombolysis in the Setting of Marfan Syndrome and Chronic Aortic Dissection.	INTRODUCTION: Thrombolysis is the standard of care in acute ischemic stroke. It is usually contraindicated in patients with aortic dissection. CASE REPORT: We report a case of Marfan syndrome and chronic aortic dissection presenting with acute ischemic stroke treated with thrombolysis. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first case of Marfan syndrome with chronic aortic dissection undergoing thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke with a near-complete recovery of neurological deficit and favorable long-term outcome.
25085319	Acute aortic dissection in pregnant women.	Acute aortic dissection occurring during pregnancy represents a lethal risk to both the mother and fetus. Management of parturient with acute aortic dissection is complex. We report our experience of two pregnancies with type A acute aortic dissection. One patient is a 31-year-old pregnant woman (33rd gestational week) with a bicuspid aortic valve and the other is a 32-year-old pregnant woman (30th gestational week) with the Marfan syndrome. In both cases, a combined emergency operation consisting of Cesarean section, total hysterectomy prior to corrective surgery for aortic dissection was successfully performed within a relatively short period of time after the onset. Both patients' postoperative recovery was uneventful, and we achieved a favorable maternal and fetal outcome. 
25174594	[Novel pharmacological strategies for aortic dilation in Marfan syndrome: from mouse models to human patients].	Marfan syndrome (MS) is a congenital disorder of the connective tissue characterized by aortic dilation with frequent progression to aortic aneurysms requiring surgical intervention. Although mutations in the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene have been recognized as the genetic cause of MS a long time ago, only recently deeper knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying fibrillin-1 biology and the crucial role of transforming growth factor-beta and angiotensin II receptor type 1 antagonists have been elucidated. This review focuses on the most commonly used animal models to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying MS, and on novel pharmacological strategies to reduce aortic dilation in MS.

31530070	An Endoscopic Solution to Mitral Regurgitation in a Complex Patient With Marfan Syndrome.	Cardiac presentations of Marfan syndrome are not uncommon. Patients with Marfan syndrome can present with aortic pathology, valvular pathology, or both. Hence, Marfan syndrome patients can undergo more than one cardiac surgery in their lifetime. Endoscopic mitral valve surgery can be a good alternative to redo sternotomy. We present a case of a 77-year-old woman who had an aortic root replacement and replacement of the ascending aorta. She presented to our center 13 years later with severe mitral regurgitation. Femoral cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass was not possible due to the presence of a type B aortic dissection that occurred sometime after the initial procedure. Mitral valve replacement was performed with an empty beating heart using axillary artery inflow with an excellent result.
31981153	Preoperative halo-gravity traction for treatment of severe adult kyphosis and scoliosis.	STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of preoperative halo-gravity traction (HGT) in the treatment for severe adult kyphosis and scoliosis. Preoperative HGT improves severe curve magnitude and clinical condition in pediatric spinal deformity. However, the efficacy of HGT on severe adult spinal deformity has rarely been studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 18 patients with severe adult kyphosis and scoliosis (age >= 18) who underwent a preoperative HGT (mean 4 weeks), and subsequent definitive posterior-alone corrective fusion. Etiologies were neurofibromatosis (n = 5), adult idiopathic (n = 3), multiple vertebral fractures due to osteoporosis (n = 1) and multiple myeloma (n = 1), degenerative failed back syndrome (n = 1), Scheuermann kyphosis (n = 1), Marfan syndrome (n = 1), and other genetic and connective tissue disorders (n = 5). We reviewed baseline demographics, including coronal and sagittal radiographic profiles. The changes in major curve magnitude, pulmonary function tests (PFTs), and nutritional status were assessed between pre- and post-traction and immediate post-definitive corrective surgery. RESULTS: There were 11 male and 7 female patients, aged 18-69 years with their major coronal and sagittal curves being 92.0  +- 25.2  and 111.6  +- 40.1 , respectively. The major coronal and sagittal curves were reduced by 18.4% and 16.8% after halo-traction, and 54.7% and 44.2% after definitive fusion, respectively. PFTs showed significant increase in %FEV1 and %FVC when comparing pre- and post-traction [43.0% +- 17.4% vs. 49.6% +- 18.7%, and 44.8%. +- 16.7% vs. 54.3% +- 20.7%, respectively, p < 0.01 (n = 11)]. Effective weight gain was observed after traction (46.8 +- 14.5 vs. 49.3 +- 13.5 kg, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Halo-gravity traction (HGT) for severe coronal and sagittal plane spinal deformity in adult patients significantly reduced Cobb angles, improved PFTs, and allowed for effective weight gain in the preoperative period. The use of preoperative HGT is extremely beneficial to optimize the alignment and overall health of severe adult spinal deformity patients before their spinal reconstruction. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV.
27106438	Palliative Mitral Valve Repair During Infancy for Neonatal Marfan Syndrome.	An infant with neonatal Marfan syndrome (nMFS), a condition that is nearly always lethal during infancy, was referred to our hospital with symptoms of congestive heart failure resulting from severe mitral valve insufficiency. During mitral valve repair, the use of an annuloplasty ring was waived until annular dilatation was achieved after 2 palliative mitral valvuloplasty procedures. After the definitive operation, the patient's mitral valve function remained within normal limits until the last follow-up when the patient was 11 years old. To the best of our knowledge, this patient has the longest recorded survival after mitral valve repair. 
25490352	[Marfan syndrome: clinical and pathomorphological restructurings after surgical treatment of aortic aneurysm].	The authors examined the state of patients suffering from Marfan syndrome (MS) who endured operation for ascending aorta aneurysm with replacement of the ascending aorta and aortic valve (Bentall operation), studying alterations of the skeleton, face, heart and eyes, as well as pathomorphological restructurings in the aortic wall. The study was carried out 7.0 +- 4.2 years after the operation. We examined a total of 39 patients with MS - 27 (69.2%) men and 12 (30.8%) women aged from 22 to 70 years old (average age - 42.1 +- 13.4 years). All patients were operated on for dissecting aneurysm of the ascending aorta accompanied by a considerable degree of aortic valve insufficiency or aortic ostium stenosis. The mean diameter of the aorta at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva amounted to 7.0 +- 1.3 cm (minimal - 5.0 cm, maximal - 12.0 cm), the Z-score prior to operation was 12.7 +- 6.5. The time form making the diagnosis of MS to surgical intervention for aortic aneurysm amounted to 9.6 +- 5.9 years. The condition after operative treatment in all patients was satisfactory, with the haemodynamic indices stable: systolic AP - 133.5 +- 19.1 mm Hg, diastolic AP 85.1 +- 12.9 mm Hg, heart rate 74.8 +- 7.2 bpm. The average systemic score for the symptoms and tests of MS patients amounted to 8.2 +- 3.3 points. Pathohistological alterations of the aorta in patients with Marfan syndrome consisted in pronounced restructuring of the wall with deep irreversible alternative changes. The pathological process extended in the middle aortic layer all alone the length, but not only in the portions of rupture and dissection. The main pathomorphological signs in MS were as follows: focal accumulations of mucoid substances, dystrophic alterations of smooth-muscle cells, ribbon-like anuclear zones, formation of cystlike cavities, alterations of elastic fibres - fragmentation, hyperelastosis, multiplication, thinning and straightening, zones of elastolysis.
27353485	The David V Valve-Sparing Root Replacement Provides Improved Survival Compared With Mechanical Valve-conduits in the Treatment of Young Patients With Aortic Root Pathology.	BACKGROUND: Valve-sparing root replacement (VSRR) is an attractive therapy for aortic root aneurysms; however, there is a paucity of data comparing VSRR with conventional root replacement using a mechanical valve-conduit (MECH). This study evaluates and compares outcomes of VSRR and MECH. METHODS: A retrospective review from 2002 to 2015 at a US academic center identified 444 patients who underwent VSRR (282 patients) or MECH (162 patients). Propensity score matching was performed, based on 22 preoperative and intraoperative characteristics, and 87 matched pairs were identified. RESULTS: There was no difference in mean age between the groups (VSRR 45.0 years, MECH 44.2 years, p = 0.59). The incidence of Marfan syndrome (VSRR 10.3%, MECH 12.6%, p = 0.63), type A acute aortic dissection (VSRR 25.3%, MECH 27.6%, p = 0.73), reoperation (VSRR 23.0%, MECH 21.8%, p = 0.86), and arch replacement (VSRR 54.0%, MECH 52.9%, p = 0.88) were similar in both groups. Ejection fraction was similar (VSRR 52.8% +- 10.9%, MECH 52.4% +- 11.7%, p = 0.83). Operative mortality was 2.3% with VSRR and 8.0% with MECH (p = 0.10). There were no significant differences in renal failure requiring dialysis (VSRR 1.1%, MECH 4.6%, p = 0.24), permanent neurologic dysfunction (VSRR 2.3%, MECH 6.9%, p = 0.16), and pacemaker implantation (VSRR 1.1%, MECH 1.1%, p = 0.99) between the groups. Survival at 7 years was significantly improved in patients who underwent VSSR (VSRR 85.5%, MECH 73.6%, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with patients undergoing MECH, there is improved midterm survival among patients undergoing VSRR, with similar operative mortality and morbidity. For appropriately selected patients, VSRR provides an attractive and potentially superior alternative to MECH.
26313725	Surgery of the aortic root: should we go for the valve-sparing root reconstruction or the composite graft-valve replacement is still the first choice of treatment for these patients?	OBJECTIVE: To compare the results of the root reconstruction with the aortic valve-sparing operation versus composite graft-valve replacement. METHODS: From January 2002 to October 2013, 324 patients underwent aortic root reconstruction. They were 263 composite graft-valve replacement and 61 aortic valve-sparing operation (43 reimplantation and 18 remodeling). Twenty-six percent of the patients were NYHA functional class III and IV; 9.6% had Marfan syndrome, and 12% had bicuspid aortic valve. There was a predominance of aneurysms over dissections (81% vs. 19%), with 7% being acute dissections. The complete follow-up of 100% of the patients was performed with median follow-up time of 902 days for patients undergoing composite graft-valve replacement and 1492 for those undergoing aortic valve-sparing operation. RESULTS: In-hospital mortality was 6.7% and 4.9%, respectively for composite graft-valve replacement and aortic valve-sparing operation (ns). During the late follow-up period, there was 0% moderate and 15.4% severe aortic regurgitation, and NYHA functional class I and II were 89.4% and 94%, respectively for composite graft-valve replacement and aortic valve-sparing operation (ns). Root reconstruction with aortic valve-sparing operation showed lower late mortality (P=0.001) and lower bleeding complications (P=0.006). There was no difference for thromboembolism, endocarditis, and need of reoperation. CONCLUSION: The aortic root reconstruction with preservation of the valve should be the operation being performed for presenting lower late mortality and survival free of bleeding events.

25909269	Giant pseudomeningocele causing urinary obstruction in a patient with Marfan syndrome.	Defective collagen biosynthesis in Marfan syndrome predisposes to dural defects such as dural ectasia, meningocele, and pseudomeningocele; thus, an increased index of suspicion for these conditions should be present in the clinical setting of Marfan syndrome. The authors describe a young woman with Marfan syndrome who was being treated with anticoagulants for a prosthetic heart valve and who presented with a spontaneous retroperitoneal hemorrhage requiring surgical evacuation. No CSF leak was encountered at surgery, but she developed progressively more severe positional headaches over the following year. She then experienced the sudden onset of acute urinary obstruction, at which time CT revealed a 17 x 15 x 13-cm presacral pseudomeningocele communicating with the thecal sac through a sacral bone defect. An anterior surgical approach was used for drainage of the pseudomeningocele as well as for primary closure of the dural defect with a bovine pericardial patch and autologous subcutaneous fat graft. After a short period of lumbar subarachnoid drainage of the CSF, the patient was able to resume normal activity without recurrent symptoms. To the authors' knowledge, such a pseudomeningocele in a patient with Marfan syndrome has been reported only twice, and this case features the largest pseudomeningocele to date. They also review the pertinent literature regarding presentation, diagnosis, and management of these lesions. 
25974974	Femtosecond Laser-assisted Cataract Surgery in Patients With Marfan Syndrome and Subluxated Lens.	PURPOSE: To report femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgeries in patients with Marfan syndrome with mild, moderate, and severe lens subluxation. METHODS: Case reports. RESULTS: Two patients with Marfan syndrome underwent femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (Alcon LenSx Lasers Inc., Aliso Viejo, CA). One patient had a mild lens subluxation in one eye and a moderate lens subluxation in the fellow eye. The other patient had a severe lens subluxation in one eye. In all eyes, the laser was able to perform a circular and free-floating anterior capsulotomy and lens fragmentation. In two of the eyes it was also helpful in decreasing corneal astigmatism by making corneal intrastromal relaxing incisions. There were no postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: Femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery is an effective approach for cataract surgery in patients with Marfan syndrome with mild, moderate, and even severe lens subluxation, with the benefits of causing minimal further zonular damage and being able to treat corneal astigmatism with relaxing incisions.
25520047	Mid-term outcomes of cardiovascular surgery for patients with Marfan syndrome.	OBJECTIVES: Cardiovascular manifestations determine the prognosis and survival of patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS). We assessed the early and mid-term outcomes of cardiovascular surgery for this patient population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective evaluation of patients with MFS who underwent surgery in our department. The endpoint was the requirement for a second cardiovascular surgery, and death from any cause. RESULTS: From February 2002 to March 2013, we performed 24 surgeries on 13 patients with MFS. At the time of initial surgery, the patients' aged ranged from 19 to 64 years of age (mean 34.7 +- 11.3 years) and included 5 men (38.5 %). Five of 13 initial surgeries (38.5 %) were emergencies. Seven patients (53.8 %) presented with aortic dissection at initial surgery, and one of the remaining six patients suffered from new aortic dissection during follow-up. Eight patients (61.5 %) underwent a second surgery, and a second surgery was not required for 100, 75.0, and 53.6 % of patients at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. The mean time interval between the first and the second surgeries was 52.8 +- 28.2 months. No patient died while hospitalized, and three subsequently died from unknown causes. Survival rates were 100, 90.9 and 64.9 % at 3, 5, and 7 years, respectively. CONCLUSION: Although we obtained satisfactory early outcomes for patients with MFS, there were three late deaths from unknown causes. Therefore, we recommend that patients with MFS should remain under close surveillance.
28823387	Losartan in combination with propranolol slows the aortic root dilatation in neonatal Marfan syndrome.	Neonatal Marfan syndrome, in contrast to classical Marfan syndrome, is characterized by rapidly progressive multi-valvular cardiac disease and death from congestive heart failure, typically within the first year of life. Due to the rarity of this condition, treatment for neonatal Marfan syndrome has not been well studied. In this report, a combination of losartan and propranolol reduced the aortic root dilatation rate after three months of losartan therapy. Genetic analysis in this patient revealed a mutation in exon 25 of the FBN1 gene, which typically results in a shorter life expectancy. However, the patient's heart failure was controlled by losartan, propranolol and other anti-congestive medications, which may have prolonged his survival.

32173337	Emergency Ravitch Procedure for Inferior Vena Cava Compression After Surgical Scoliosis Correction.	Pectus excavatum is a common chest malformation, classically asymptomatic. The pectus excavatum surgical procedure allows aesthetic correction. Funnel chest is a malformation frequently associated with thoracic scoliosis, especially in Marfan syndrome. Scoliosis is treated with first-line nonsurgical treatment. Second-line treatment consists of a scoliosis operation. In this case report, we present an exceptional emergency indication of funnel chest correction with the Ravitch procedure for a 14-year-old girl who presented with postoperative acute compression of the inferior vena cava due to a surgical scoliosis correction.
33370003	Growth-friendly Spinal Instrumentation in Marfan Syndrome Achieves Sustained Gains in Thoracic Height Amidst High Rates of Implant Failure.	BACKGROUND: There are few reports on the surgical management of early-onset scoliosis (EOS) associated with Marfan syndrome (MFS). Affected patients tend to have more rapid curve progression than those with idiopathic EOS, and their course is further complicated by medical comorbidities. As surgical techniques and implants for growing spines become more widely applied, this study seeks to better delineate the safety and efficacy of growth-friendly spinal instrumentation in treating this population. METHODS: A prospective registry of children treated for EOS was queried for MFS patients treated between 1996 and 2016. Forty-two patients underwent rib-based or spine-based growing instrumentation and were assessed on preoperative, surgical, and postoperative clinical and radiographic parameters including complications and reoperations. Subgroup analysis was performed based on spine-based versus rib-based fixation. RESULTS: Patients underwent their index surgery at a mean age of 5.5 years, when the major coronal curve and kyphosis measured 77 and 50 degrees, respectively. Over half were treated with traditional growing rods. Patients underwent 7.2 total surgical procedures-4.7 lengthening and 1.9 revision surgeries not including conversion to fusion-over a follow-up of 6.5 (+-4.1) years. Radiographic correction was greatest at index surgery but maintained over time, with a final thoracic height measuring 23.8 cm. Patients experienced a mean of 2.6 complications over the course of the study period; however, a small group of 6 patients experienced >=6 complications while over half of patients experienced 0 or 1. Implant failures represented 42% of all complications with infection and pulmonary complications following. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest report on patients with EOS and MFS. All subtypes of growth-friendly constructs reduced curve progression in this cohort, but complications and reoperations were nearly universal; patients were particularly plagued by implant failure and migration. Further collaborations are needed to enhance understanding of optimal timing and fixation constructs for those with MFS and other connective tissue diseases.
28606654	Management of Marfan Syndrome during pregnancy: A real world experience from a Joint Cardiac Obstetric Service.	BACKGROUND: Pregnancy in Marfan Syndrome (MFS) is associated with increased maternal risk of cardiovascular events. Given the maternal and genetic risks, pre-conception counselling is essential to facilitate informed choices. Multidisciplinary antenatal care with regular imaging is mandatory and best delivered through a Joint Cardiac Obstetric Service (JCOS). The aim of this study was to compare the care delivered in a JCOS against recognised international standards (European Society of Cardiology (ESC)). METHODS: Pregnancies in women with MFS from 2005 to 2015 were identified from our institutional database. Patient records were reviewed and practice assessed against pre-determined standards based on ESC guidelines. RESULTS: There were 23 pregnancies in 15 women with MFS. 13/23 (57%) occurred in women with aortic dilatation at baseline. There were 3 important maternal cardiac events (type A dissection; deterioration in left ventricular function; significant left ventricular and progressive aortic dilatation). Four women did not have access to expert pre-conception counselling. These women were all referred to the JCOS late in established pregnancy. Imaging was often delayed and only 7/23 cases (30%) met the standard for minimum frequency of echocardiographic surveillance. Only 12/23 (52%) had pre-conception imaging of the whole aorta with CT/MRI. Distal aortic dilatation was identified in 7/23 cases but none of these underwent further MRI evaluation during pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Despite having a dedicated JCOS, our data show that facilitating complete obstetric and cardiac care for this group remains challenging. Education of local care providers and timely referral for expert pre-conception counselling in a JCOS are key.
29631308	[S2-Guideline: Pediatric Flat Foot].	In pediatric flat foot a differentiation has to be made between the flexible and the rigid form. The diagnosis is based on the history, clinical examination as well as pedobarography, gait analysis and imaging techniques. It is important to rule out neuropediatric conditions such as muscular dystrophies, Ehlers-Danlos- or Marfan syndrome. In children six years of age and younger a flexible flat foot is nearly always physiological (97% of all 19 months old children). Up to the age of ten years the medial column of the foot is developing. Only a minority of children (4% in ten year olds) has a persistent or progressive deformity. Beyond to age of ten there is a danger of deformity decompensation as well as an increased rigidity. Only a minority of children develops some pain (< 2%). A clear risk factor for persistent pediatric flat foot is obesity (62% of six year old children with flat foot are obese). Pathogenetic factors include muscular, bony or soft tissue conditions. However, there specific rule is still unclear. Prevention consists in a thorough parent information about the normal development as well as encouragement of regular sportive activities. Soft and large enough shoes should be carried as a protection. Barfoot walking has to be encouraged on uneven grounds. If physiotherapy is needed different methods can be applied. Orthosis treatment should include a proprioceptive approach. Surgical interventions in children are rare. If surgical treatment is planned a detailed algorhythm should be used before utilizing one of the many different surgical methods.
25096902	Impact of aortic aneurysm on hospitalizations in patients with marfan syndrome: a multi-institutional study.	Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder affecting 1 in 3,000 people. Cardiovascular involvement is a prominent feature of MFS, with aortic dissection and/or rupture being the leading cause of death. Advances in the medical and surgical care of patients with MFS have improved survival. Hospital resource utilization and outcomes have not been evaluated in a large population of patients with MFS. We sought to analyze pediatric hospital resource utilization and outcomes in patients with MFS. Nationally distributed data from 43 pediatric hospitals in the 2004-2011 Pediatric Health Information System database were used to identify patients admitted to the hospital with International Classification of Diseases-9th Revision codes for a diagnosis of MFS. Aortic aneurysm (AA) with or without dissection, length of stay (LOS), and hospital charges were determined. During the study period, there were 1,978 admissions in 1,228 patients with MFS. AA was present in 217 (11%) admissions in 188 (15%) patients (63% male). Mean age of patients with AA was 13.8 +- 5.9 years. Aortic dissection or rupture was present in 15 (7% with AA) admissions in 15 (8% with AA) patients (mean age 15.7 +- 5.2 years). Other cardiac diagnoses occurred more commonly in the AA cohort (p < 0.0001), regardless of the reason for admission. Cardiothoracic surgical procedures were performed in 116 AA admissions (53%). Mean LOS, hospital charges per admission, and charges per day were significantly higher in AA cohort compared to those without AA. In-hospital mortality for AA was 2%. The presence of AA in patients with MFS increases hospital resource utilization. Cardiothoracic surgeries are commonly performed in this cohort. Other cardiovascular diagnoses are more prevalent in patients with AA suggesting a more severe phenotype.
26908026	Recent progress in understanding the natural and clinical histories of the Marfan syndrome.	Over the past 4 decades, remarkable progress in understanding the cause, pathogenesis, and management of the MFS has led to an increase in life expectancy to near normal for most patients. Accompanying this increased life span has been the emergence of previously rare or unanticipated clinical problems. Despite much more detailed knowledge of the molecular, cellular, and tissue effects of a mutation in FBN1, targeted, effective therapy remains elusive. Until such precision medicine takes hold, management will depend on early diagnosis, regular scrutiny by imaging, chronic beta-blockade, and perhaps ARBs, and prophylactic cardiothoracic surgery. Without question, MFS will remain a fertile subject for basic, translational, and clinical research for the foreseeable future.
31981144	Progressive double major scoliotic curve with concurrent lumbosacral spondylolisthesis in a skeletally immature patient with Marfan syndrome treated with anterior scoliosis correction.	STUDY DESIGN: Case report (review of patient records, imaging, and pulmonary function tests) and literature review. OBJECTIVES: To describe the case of a skeletally immature patient with Marfan syndrome who underwent anterior scoliosis correction (ASC) and muscle-sparing posterior far lateral interbody fusion (FLIF) in a two-stage procedure to correct progressive severe double major scoliosis and spondylolisthesis. Patients with Marfan syndrome suffer from rapidly progressive scoliosis and spondylolisthesis. Operative treatment has typically been limited to PSF, but newer techniques may be less invasive and provide more spine motion. METHODS: A 12-year-old girl with Marfan syndrome, spondylolisthesis, and severe progressive scoliosis underwent a two-stage procedure to achieve correction. Muscle-sparing posterior FLIF of the spondylolisthesis from L4-S1 was initially performed, followed 1 week later by ASC from right T4-T11 and left T11-L3 using an anterior screw/cord construct. RESULTS: Follow-up from the index procedures for the spondylolisthesis and scoliosis is 35 months. No significant complications occurred in perioperative and postoperative follow-up periods. At the 13-month follow-up, the double major scoliosis showed continued curve correction via growth modulation and overcorrection of the lumbar to - 13 . A revision lengthening procedure of the anterior cord from T11-L3 was performed. An asymptomatic elevated hemidiaphragm was discovered at 6 weeks postoperation, which was believed to be secondary to retraction neuropraxia and subsequently improved. At 21 months postlengthening and 35 months postindex procedure, she is skeletally mature and the curves have maintained correction in both the coronal and sagittal planes without any further complications. CONCLUSIONS: Anterior scoliosis correction of both a thoracic and lumbar curve combined with an L4-S1 PSF was effective for this patient and may be promising for patients with Marfan syndrome, progressive scoliosis, and spondylolisthesis. Overcorrection can be planned for and easily corrected by inserting a new cord of a different length.
34428348	Toward precision medicine in vascular connective tissue disorders.	Tremendous progress has been made in understanding the etiology, pathogenesis, and treatment of inherited vascular connective tissue disorders. While new insights regarding disease etiology and pathogenesis have informed patient counseling and care, there are numerous obstacles that need to be overcome in order to achieve the full promise of precision medicine. In this review, these issues will be discussed in the context of Marfan syndrome and Loeys-Dietz syndrome, with additional emphasis on the pioneering contributions made by Victor McKusick.

32079842	Novel double-flanged technique for managing Marfan syndrome and microspherophakia.	A new technique for fixating the capsular bag in patients with ectopia lentis is presented. In this technique, the capsulorhexis is performed using a femtosecond laser, followed by the insertion of a standard capsular tension ring to redistribute capsular forces. The nucleus is hydroprolapsed into the anterior chamber and nuclear disassembly is performed above the iris plane to reduce zonular stress. Finally, a 5-0 polypropylene monofilament is used to fixate a capsular tension segment and subluxated capsular bag. This novel double-flanged method, achieved with cautery, does not require direct suturing of the monofilament on the sclera. This article describes the use of this new technique in 3 eyes, 2 in patients with Marfan syndrome and 1 in a patient with microspherophakia.
38384125	Neurotrophic Keratopathy in Marfan Syndrome Patient After Micropulse Transscleral Cyclophotocoagulation: A Call for Risk Stratification.	BACKGROUND Micropulse transscleral cyclophotocoagulation is a non-invasive, widely employed procedure that uses diode laser to target the ciliary body to lower the intraocular pressure. Despite its acknowledged efficacy, certain complications are recognized, with neurotrophic keratopathy being a rare yet serious consequence. This report seeks to shed light on a potential high-risk subgroup susceptible to neurotrophic keratopathy, exemplified by our patient with Marfan syndrome, a condition characterized by thin sclera. CASE REPORT Our patient, who was confirmed to have Marfan syndrome with pseudophakic glaucoma, underwent micropulse transscleral cyclophotocoagulation due to high intraocular pressure bilaterally and subsequently quickly manifested neurotrophic keratopathy in both eyes postoperatively. Swift initiation of management involved a comprehensive approach, including topical antibiotics, preservative-free lubrication, medroxyprogesterone acetate 1%, serum balanced salt solution (BSS) 50%, and the application of bandage contact lenses to expedite healing. Fortunately, the left eye demonstrated resolution within 10 days, while the right eye exhibited delayed healing, leading to subsequent scarring. CONCLUSIONS This report highlights the critical importance of recognizing populations predisposed to neurotrophic keratopathy before subjecting them to micropulse transscleral cyclophotocoagulation. Such awareness allows for the fine-tuning of procedural parameters, offering a strategic approach to mitigate the risk of neurotrophic keratopathy development. By further exploring and recognizing potential risk factors, clinicians can enhance patient outcomes and refine the safety profile of micropulse transscleral cyclophotocoagulation.
31689252	Syndromic Scoliosis: National Trends in Surgical Management and Inpatient Hospital Outcomes: A 12-Year Analysis.	STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the trends in management and inpatient outcomes in patients with syndromic scoliosis undergoing spinal deformity correction. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Syndromic scoliosis (SS) refers to scoliosis that is most commonly associated with systemic disease including Ehler Danhlos syndrome (EDS), Marfan syndrome (MF), Down syndrome (DS), Achondroplasia (AP), and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Limited data exist evaluating hospital outcomes in patients with SS undergoing spinal deformity correction. METHODS: The Kids' Inpatient Database (KIDS) was queried from 2001 to 2012 to identify all pediatric patients with scoliosis undergoing spinal fusion. These patients were then sub-divided into two cohorts: (1) patients with idiopathic scoliosis (IS) and (2) patients with syndromic scoliosis. Trends in surgical management, and postoperative morbidity and mortality were assessed. Length of stay and total hospital charges were additionally analyzed. A sub-analysis to characterize outcomes in each syndrome was also performed. RESULTS: An estimated 1071 patients with SS were identified and compared with 24,989 pediatric patients with IS. MF (36.8%), Down syndrome (16.0%), and PWS (14.9%) were the most common diagnoses among patients with SS. Between 2001 and 2012, there was a significant decline in the number of anterior procedures performed in both cohorts. Conversely, the number of posterior based procedures increased. SS was associated with increased major complications (2.7% compared with 1.0% in IS; P < 0.001) and minor complication rates (41.0% compared with 28.5% in IS; P < 0.001). Patients with AP incurred the highest rate of major complications (10.7%), minor complications (60.8%), and intraoperative durotomies (6.1%). Total hospital charges increased significantly over the 12-year span. CONCLUSION: Trends in management of syndromic scoliosis have paralleled that of idiopathic scoliosis. Syndromic scoliosis is associated with increased risks with surgical deformity correction. Further prospective studies are warranted to evaluate the reasons for these differences. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.

28350559	Interventional Spine Considerations for Dural Ectasia in a Patient With Marfan Syndrome.	For patients with Marfan syndrome who present with radicular low back pain, interventional spine providers should be familiar with dural ectasia with variable diffuse thinning of the posterior wall of the lumbar spine and sacrum. Providers should carefully weigh the risks and benefits of offering elective procedures because altered anatomy may put these patients at higher risk of dural puncture. Patient selection is essential because hydrostatic pressures and/or neural tension should also be considered as potential pain generators that may not be relieved by steroid injections. Careful evaluation of recent magnetic resonance images and vigilant procedural technique is highly recommended.
31546497	Bimanual irrigation-aspiration for ectopia lentis and use of a small incision for 4-point scleral-sutured foldable intraocular lens and anterior vitrectomy in patients with Marfan syndrome.	Purpose: This study evaluated bimanual intracapsular irrigation-aspiration for ectopia lentis with use of a small incision for 4-point scleral fixation of a foldable posterior-chamber intraocular lens (IOL) and anterior vitrectomy in patients with Marfan syndrome. Methods: We performed a retrospective study of 18 eyes from 10 patients with Marfan syndrome who underwent surgical intervention for ectopia lentis at our clinic between July 2012 and September 2018. In this study, intraoperative and postoperative complications, uncorrected visual acuity, best-corrected visual acuity, spherical equivalent, intraocular pressure, and endothelial cell density were evaluated. Results: No intraoperative complications were reported. In all cases, early postoperative evaluation revealed a clear cornea, round pupil, and well-centered IOL. Mean logMAR uncorrected visual acuity improved from 1.09 preoperatively to 0.56 postoperatively (P < 0.05). Mean logMAR best-corrected visual acuity improved from 0.45 preoperatively to 0.17 postoperatively (P < 0.05). Aside from transient ocular hypertension, no postoperative complications were reported. Conclusion: The combined surgical technique presented above yields excellent visual outcomes with an extremely low incidence of complications. This approach is simple, safe, and effective in the treatment of ectopia lentis in patients with Marfan syndrome.
26373749	Aortic issues in scoliosis and scoliotic operations.	"The spatial relations between the aorta and vertebrae are changing with posture, surgical techniques, and operative maneuvers. ""Risky screws"" (within 1-3 mm proximity to the aorta or other adjacent tissues) were found in 5.8-15.2% screws. In order to avoid early and later aortic complications secondary to scoliotic operations, careful preoperative metrology of aorto-vertebrae relations is of crucial importance. Compared with patients with idiopathic scoliosis, Marfan-related scoliosis is characterized by faster progression and it is more bracing-resistant due to the particular developmental anomalies in Marfan syndrome, implying the refractory nature of the latter. The present study aims to highlight the clinical impact of preoperative aorto-vertebra metrology in the scoliotic operations."
31276187	Aortic dissection during pregnancy - obstetric perspective.	The risk of vascular events during pregnancy is substantially increased. Beyond comparatively frequent vascular diseases, pregnancy may lead also to the development of exceptionally rare vascular events such as the aortic dissection and aortic rupture which are conceivably endangering life conditions. Women with the connective tissue disorders and with a family history of the aorta diseases are especially prone to the aortic complications which may also develop in the absence of these risk factors due to the pregnancy-induced structural changes of the aortic wall. The preconception counselling is vital for patients with aortopathies to assess the risk of the aortic dissection and to establish the most appropriate care plan including the surgical intervention. This review presents the management guidelines in patients with the aortic dissection risk during pregnancy.
38458510	Axillary vs Femoral Arterial Cannulation in Acute Type A Dissection: International Multicenter Data.	BACKGROUND: Cannulation strategy in acute Type A dissection (ATAD) varies widely without known gold standards. We compared ATAD outcomes of Axillary versus Femoral cannulation in a large cohort from the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection (IRAD). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 2145 IRAD Interventional Cohort patients (1996-2021) undergoing ATAD repair with axillary or femoral cannulation (Axillary: N=1106, 52%; Femoral: N=1039, 48%). Endpoints included: early mortality; neurologic, respiratory and renal complications; malperfusion; and tamponade. All outcomes are presented as axillary with respect to femoral. RESULTS: The proportion of patients under age 70 in both groups was similar (N=1577, 74%) as were: bicuspid aortic valve, Marfan syndrome, and previous dissection. Femoral patients had slightly more aortic insufficiency [408 (55%) vs 429 (60%) p=0.058] and coronary involvement [48 (8%) vs 70 (13%) p=0.022]. Axillary patients underwent more total arch [156 (15%) vs 106 (11%) p=0.02] and valve-sparing root replacements [220 (22%) vs 112 (12%) p<0.001]. More Femoral patients underwent commissural resuspension [269 (30.9%) vs 324 (35.3%) p=0.05]. Valve replacement rates were not different. Mean duration of cardiopulmonary bypass was longer among Femoral patients [190 (150-237) vs 200 (160-249) mins p=0.002]. In-hospital mortality was similar between Axillary (N=165, 15%) and Femoral (N=149, 14%) patients (p=0.7). Furthermore, there were no differences in stroke, visceral ischemia, tamponade, respiratory insufficiency, coma, or spinal cord ischemia. CONCLUSIONS: Axillary cannulation is associated with more stable ATAD presentation, but more extensive intervention compared to Femoral. Both have equivalent early mortality, stroke, tamponade, and malperfusion outcomes after statistical adjustment.
34215596	Acceptance and commitment therapy meets peer-support. Development of a supportive self-care intervention for patients with rare diseases: a multistage development process.	OBJECTIVE: We aimed at developing a patient-centred self-help programme, tailored to the needs of patients with rare chronic diseases. DESIGN: Multistage, multimethod development process including a survey with validated self-report scales and open-ended questions (phase 1) and focus groups (phase 2) for needs assessment and, consolidating the first phases and the literature, the intervention development (phase 3). SETTING: Phase 1: nationwide online survey in Germany, phase 2: four separate and diagnostically homogeneous focus groups. The focus groups took place at a university medical centre in Germany. PARTICIPANTS: Target group were patients with rare diseases that occur at a prevalence <1:2000. Phase 1: n=300 participants with different rare diseases. Phase 2: Individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (n=4), primary sclerosing cholangitis (n=5), pulmonary arterial hypertension (n=4) and Marfan syndrome (n=5). RESULTS: The central results of phases 1 and 2 were requests for more information about the disease and contact with other affected persons. Patients also expressed support needs in dealing with difficult emotions and identified acceptance of the disease as a turning point for quality of life. In phase 3, we identified acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) as a suitable therapeutic approach and determined details about implementation and execution of self-management programmes. A 6-week self-help concept led by peer counsellors was developed, which includes disease-specific information and ACT-based exercises. CONCLUSION: Based on a multistage needs assessment, we developed a peer-guided self-help intervention for patients with rare chronic diseases. Combining self-management, peer-counselling and ACT may help living with a rare condition. Further research needs to test the programme's efficacy. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN13738704.
36460281	HTAD patient pathway: Strategy for diagnostic work-up of patients and families with (suspected) heritable thoracic aortic diseases (HTAD). A statement from the HTAD working group of VASCERN.	Heritable thoracic aortic diseases (HTAD) are rare pathologies associated with thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissection, which can be syndromic or non-syndromic. They may result from genetic defects. Associated genes identified to date are classified into those encoding components of the (a) extracellular matrix (b) TGFbeta pathway and (c) smooth muscle contractile mechanism. Timely diagnosis allows for prompt aortic surveillance and prophylactic surgery, hence improving life expectancy and reducing maternal complications as well as providing reassurance to family members when a diagnosis is ruled out. This document is an expert opinion reflecting strategies put forward by medical experts and patient representatives involved in the HTAD Rare Disease Working Group of VASCERN. It aims to provide a patient pathway that improves patient care by diminishing time to diagnosis, facilitating the establishment of a correct diagnosis using molecular genetics when possible, excluding the diagnosis in unaffected persons through appropriate family screening and avoiding overuse of resources. It is being recommended that patients are referred to an expert centre for further evaluation if they meet at least one of the following criteria: (1) thoracic aortic dissection (<70 years if hypertensive; all ages if non-hypertensive), (2) thoracic aortic aneurysm (all adults with Z score >3.5 or 2.5-3.5 if non-hypertensive or hypertensive and <60 years; all children with Z score >3), (3) family history of HTAD with/without a pathogenic variant in a gene linked to HTAD, (4) ectopia lentis without other obvious explanation and (5) a systemic score of >5 in adults and >3 in children. Aortic imaging primarily relies on transthoracic echocardiography with magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography as needed. Genetic testing should be considered in those with a high suspicion of underlying genetic aortopathy. Though panels vary among centers, for patients with thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection or systemic features these should include genes with a definitive or strong association to HTAD. Genetic cascade screening and serial aortic imaging should be considered for family screening and follow-up. In conclusion, the implementation of these strategies should help standardise the diagnostic work-up and follow-up of patients with suspected HTAD and the screening of their relatives.
33078267	Spinal fusion in pediatric patients with marfan syndrome: a nationwide assessment on short-term outcomes and readmission risk.	PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to utilize the National Readmission Database (NRD) to determine estimates for complication rates, 90-day readmission rates, and hospital costs associated with spinal fusion in pediatric patients with Marfan syndrome. METHODS: The 2012-2015 NRD databases were queried for all pediatric (< 19 years old) patients diagnosed with Marfan syndrome undergoing spinal fusion surgery. The primary outcome variables in this study were index admission complications and 90-day readmissions. RESULTS: A total of 249 patients with Marfan syndrome underwent spinal fusion surgery between 2012 and 2015 (mean age +- standard deviation at the time of surgery: 14 +- 2.0, 132 (53%) female). 25 (10.1%) were readmitted within 90 days of the index hospital discharge date. Overall, 59.7% of patients experienced at least one complication during the index admission. Unplanned 90-day readmission could be predicted by older age (odds ratio 2.3, 95% confidence interval 1.3-4.2, p = 0.006), Medicaid insurance status (56.0, 3.8-820.0, p = 0.003), and experiencing an inpatient medical complication (42.9, 4.6-398.7, p = 0.001). Patients were readmitted for wound dehiscence (8 patients, 3.2%), nervous system related complications (3 patients, 1.2%), and postoperative infectious related complications (4 patients, 1.6%). CONCLUSION: This study is the first to demonstrate on a national level the complications and potential risk factors for 90-day hospital readmission for patients with Marfan syndrome undergoing spinal fusion. Patients with Marfan syndrome undergoing spinal fusion often present with multiple medical comorbidities that must be managed carefully perioperatively to reduce inpatient complications and early hospital readmissions.
31129614	Maternal and fetal outcomes in pregnancies complicated by Marfan syndrome.	OBJECTIVES: Information to guide counselling and management for pregnancy in women with Marfan syndrome (MFS) is limited. We therefore conducted a UK multicentre study. METHODS: Retrospective observational study of women with MFS delivering between January 1998 and March 2018 in 12 UK centres reporting data on maternal and neonatal outcomes. RESULTS: In total, there were 258 pregnancies in 151 women with MFS (19 women had prior aortic root replacements), including 226 pregnancies >=24 weeks (two sets of twins), 20 miscarriages and 12 pregnancy terminations. Excluding miscarriages and terminations, there were 221 live births in 139 women. Only 50% of women received preconception counselling. There were no deaths, but five women experienced aortic dissection (1.9%; one type A and four type B-one had a type B dissection at 12 weeks and subsequent termination of pregnancy). Five women required cardiac surgery postpartum. No predictors for aortic dissection could be identified. The babies of the 131 (65.8%) women taking beta-blockers were on average 316 g lighter (p<0.001). Caesarean section rates were high (50%), particularly in women with dilated aortic roots. In 55 women, echocardiographic aortic imaging was available prepregnancy and postpregnancy; there was a small but significant average increase in AoR size of 0.84 mm (Median follow-up 2.3 months) CONCLUSION: There were no maternal deaths, and the aortic dissection rate was 1.9% (mainly type B). There with no identifiable factors associated with aortic dissection in our cohort. Preconception counselling rates were low and need improvement. Aortic size measurements increased marginally following pregnancy.
31003918	The effects of losartan versus beta-blockers on cardiovascular protection in marfan syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Variable effects of beta-blockers (BB) and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) were reported to retard aortic root growth in Marfan syndrome (MFS). This study aimed to compare the effects of BB therapy and ARB-related therapies on cardiovascular protection in MFS. METHODS: Studies of randomized control trials comparing the efficacy of only-BB and ARB-related (only-ARB or ARB-plus-BB) therapies for MFS published before July 31, 2018 in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were selected. The outcomes included changes in aortic growth and cardiovascular events. RESULTS: Eight trials involving 1381 patients were included. Patients received only-BB and ARB-related therapies did not differ significantly in changes in aortic growth (aortic root diameter: standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.04, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.11-0.19, p = 0.63) or cardiovascular events (aortic dissection: Peto odds ratio [OR] = 1.67, 95% CI: 0.42-6.72, p = 0.47; aortic surgery: risk ratio = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.66-1.41, p = 0.86; death: Peto OR = 2.78, 95% CI: 0.39-19.82, p = 0.31). Subgroup analysis revealed that ARB-plus-BB therapy exhibited nonsignificantly better outcomes than only-BB therapy (aortic root diameter: SMD = 0.11, 95% CI: -0.22-0.45, p = 0.52; ascending aorta diameter: SMD = 0.10, 95% CI: -0.07-0.27, p = 0.26; aortic surgery: Peto OR = 1.10, 95% CI: 0.75-1.61, p = 0.62). CONCLUSION: For cardiovascular protection in MFS, only-ARB therapy is not inferior to only-BB therapy. Moreover, the outcomes of ARB-plus-BB therapy seemed to be favourable to those of only-BB therapy.

30041021	Precise Therapy for Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm in Marfan Syndrome: A Puzzle Nearing Its Solution.	Marfan Syndrome (MFS) is a rare connective tissue disorder, resulting from mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene, characterized by pathologic phenotypes in multiple organs, the most detrimental of which affects the thoracic aorta. Indeed, thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA), leading to acute dissection and rupture, are today the major cause of morbidity and mortality in adult MFS patients. Therefore, there is a compelling need for novel therapeutic strategies to delay TAA progression and counteract aortic dissection occurrence. Unfortunately, the wide phenotypic variability of MFS patients, together with the lack of a complete genotype-phenotype correlation, have represented until now a barrier hampering the conduction of translational studies aimed to predict disease prognosis and drug discovery. In this review, we will illustrate available therapeutic strategies to improve the health of MFS patients. Starting from gold standard surgical overtures and the description of the main pharmacological approaches, we will comprehensively review the state-of-the-art of in vivo MFS models and discuss recent clinical pharmacogenetic results. Finally, we will focus on induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) as a technology that, if integrated with preclinical research and pharmacogenetics, could contribute in determining the best therapeutic approach for each MFS patient on the base of individual differences. Finally, we will suggest the integration of preclinical studies, pharmacogenetics and iPSC technology as the most likely strategy to help solve the composite puzzle of precise medicine in this condition.
35152942	Assessment of pleural pressure during sleep in Marfan syndrome.	STUDY OBJECTIVES: Patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) have a high risk for aortic aneurysms. They are also susceptible to sleep-disordered breathing that may expose them to highly negative intrathoracic pressures known to increase aortic transmural pressure, which may accelerate aortic dilatation. Our objective was to quantify overnight intrathoracic pressure changes during sleep in snoring patients with MFS and the therapeutic effect of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). METHODS: We used a questionnaire to identify self-reported snoring patients with MFS. In these patients, we monitored intrathoracic pressure using esophageal pressure (Pes) during overnight baseline and CPAP sleep studies. We defined a peak-inspiratory Pes (Pespeak-insp) < - 5 cm H2O as greater than normal and examined the distribution of Pespeak-insp during baseline and CPAP studies. RESULTS: In our sample of 23 snorers with MFS, we found that 70% of sleep breaths exhibited Pespeak-insp < -5 cm H2O, with apnea/hypopneass accounting for only 12%, suggesting prevalent stable flow-limited breathing and snoring. In a subset (n = 12) with Pes monitoring during a CPAP night, CPAP lowered the mean proportion of breaths with Pespeak-insp < -5 cm H2O from 83.7% +- 14.9% to 3.6% +- 3.0% (P < .001). In addition, contemporaneous aortic root diameter was associated with the mean Pespeak-insp during inspiratory flow-limited breathing and apneas/hypopneas (beta = -0.05, r = .675, P = .033). CONCLUSIONS: The sleep state in MFS revealed prolonged exposure to exaggerated negative inspiratory Pes, which was reversible with CPAP. Since negative intrathoracic pressure can contribute to thoracic aortic stress and aortic dilatation, snoring may be a reversible risk factor for progression of aortic pathology in MFS.

27964919	Clinical Outcomes of the David V Valve-Sparing Root Replacement Compared With Bioprosthetic Valve-Conduits for Aortic Root Aneurysms.	BACKGROUND: Valve-sparing root replacement (VSRR) is an established therapy for aortic root pathology. Limited insight exists when the results of VSRR are compared with those of conventional root replacement with use of a bioprosthetic composite conduit (BIO). This study compares the operative and midterm results of VSRR and BIO. METHODS: A retrospective review from 2002 to 2015 at a United States academic center identified 282 patients who underwent VSRR and 425 patients who underwent BIO. Propensity-score matching was performed based on 20 preoperative characteristics, and 123 matched pairs were identified. RESULTS: The mean age (VSRR 53.5 +- 11.1, BIO 53.0 +- 13.0; p = 0.74) and left ventricular ejection fraction (VSRR 54.5 +- 9.2%, BIO 54.4 +- 9.4%; p = 0.99) were equivalent in both groups. The incidence of bicuspid valves (VSRR 26.0%, BIO 27.6%; p = 0.77), Marfan syndrome (VSRR 6.5%, BIO 4.9%; p = 0.58), type A dissection (VSRR 13.0%, BIO 13.0%; p = 0.99), reoperation (VSRR 15.4%, BIO 20.3%; p = 0.32) and arch replacement (VSRR 60.2%, BIO 63.4%; p = 0.60) were similar between the groups. Operative mortality was 5.7% in VSRR and 0.8% in BIO (p = 0.07). There were no significant differences in postoperative renal failure (VSRR 0.8%, BIO 0.0%; p = 0.99) or stroke (VSRR 3.3%, BIO 0.8%; p = 0.37) between the groups. The 7-year survival (VSSR 82.4%, BIO 83.0%; p = 0.53), 7-year freedom from reoperation (VSRR 97.4%, BIO 95.8%; p = 0.48), and 7-year freedom from greater than moderate aortic insufficiency (AI) (VSRR 98.1%, BIO 100.0%; p = 0.47) were similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS: VSRR and BIO result in equivalent operative mortality and morbidity with similar midterm survival and valve durability. VSRR is an effective alternative to BIO for aortic root pathologic conditions; however, careful patient selection is paramount.
30794782	Aortic Graft Dehiscence After Valve-Sparing Root Replacement.	Postoperative pseudoaneurysm of the left ventricular outflow tract is a rare but potentially lethal complication in patients after valve-sparing root replacement. This report describes a case of postoperative left ventricular outflow tract pseudoaneurysm in a 49-year-old woman with Marfan syndrome after valve-sparing aortic root replacement. Four months postoperatively, severe dehiscence of the aortic root graft resulted in a retrosternal giant pseudoaneurysm. She underwent emergency redo aortic root replacement, and the postoperative course was uneventful. Although valve-sparing aortic root replacement for aortic root dilatation is widely accepted, we must consider the possibility of postoperative pseudoaneurysms in patients with Marfan syndrome.
31357961	Marfan syndrome in childhood: parents' perspectives of the impact on daily functioning of children, parents and family; a qualitative study.	BACKGROUND: Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a heritable connective tissue disease caused by a defect in FBN1. The diagnosis is based on the revised Ghent criteria. The main features involve the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, ophthalmic, pulmonary systems and facial features. Although the clinical manifestations of MFS in children are thoroughly addressed in several studies, literature on the impact of MFS on daily functioning is restricted to pediatric advice on sports and leisure participation. Therefore, the full impact of MFS on daily functioning remains unclear. The aim of this qualitative study was to explore parents' perspectives on the impact of MFS on daily functioning of children with MFS aged 4-12 years, themselves and family regarding functional performance, activities, participation, personal and environmental factors, and disease burden. METHODS: In this qualitative study parents participated in individual semi-structured interviews (n = 10) and 3 focus groups (n = 5, n = 5 and n = 6). Meetings were transcribed, and data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Meaningful concepts were coded, and concepts concerning children with MFS were linked to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health for Children and Youth. Thereafter themes were identified and interpreted. RESULTS: Parents reported their children could not keep up with peers because of fatigue, pain and physical impairments. Children experienced participation restrictions in school, sports, play and other leisure activities. Parents reported their child as being different due to physical appearance, which provoked unsupportive attitudes. Parental burden was caused by high care needs, lack of support, a limited social life, and concerns about the child's development. Family burden was caused by adjusted and complex family schedules, other family members with MFS, and reproductive planning decision-making, whereas family cohesiveness and caring were positively perceived factors. CONCLUSIONS: Parents perceived a large impact of MFS on daily functioning of their children with MFS, themselves and their family. More awareness among all professionals involved in the care of children with MFS and their families is needed so that professionals can address their support needs and provide tailored interventions, rehabilitation and/or educational programs to empower and improve daily functioning of the children, parents and family.
26503076	A marked decrease in heart rate variability in Marfan syndrome patients with confirmed FBN1 mutations.	BACKGROUND: The studies on heart rate variability (HRV), a key predictor of all-cause mortality, in Marfan syndrome (MS), up to now have not been reported, especially in patients with FBN1 mutations. METHODS: Among 18 MS patients with the phenotype of MS meeting inclusion criteria 15 have had a FBN1 gene mutation. Short electrocardiography records were taken in the supine position and during orthostatic tests. The control group consisted of 30 apparently healthy nonathletes matched by age and gender. RESULTS: Heart rates in MS patients with the FBN1 mutation were increased in both the supine position and orthostatic test (p < 0.001). Most of the time-domain (standard deviation, pNN50) and frequency-domain (total power, very low, low, and high frequency) parameters of HRV were significantly reduced in the MS patients (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A marked decrease in HRV, documented in the study, may be an important clinical feature in MS patients with confirmed FBN1 gene mutations.
35972748	Pre-implantation genetic testing for Marfan syndrome using mini-sequencing.	Marfan syndrome (MFS1) is an autosomal dominant condition causing aortopathy including fatal aortic dissection. This study aimed to perform clinical PGT-M in a family with a history of MFS1 for two generations. A family with two members affected by MFS1 approached the hospital for PGT-M. The couple decided to join the project following extensive counselling and informed consent was obtained. The mutation contributory to MFS1 was identified using whole-exome sequencing (WES). A novel PGT-M protocol using multiplex fluorescent PCR and mini-sequencing was developed and tested. Ten blastocysts were subjected to PGT-M in two clinical PGT cycles. Mini-sequencing revealed four normal and six affected embryos. Microsatellite-based linkage analysis confirmed mutation analysis results in all samples. The embryos diagnosed as normal (non-MFS1) were chosen for transfer. A pregnancy was obtained in the third embryo transfer. Invasive prenatal diagnosis confirmed the normal genotype of the baby. This study demonstrated comprehensive management using the application of clinical-based diagnosis, WES for mutation identification within the MFS1 gene, mini-sequencing for embryo selection and microsatellite-based linkage analysis for backup of PGT-M results and contamination detection to assist couples in having a healthy child when there was a family history of Marfan syndrome.Impact StatementWhat is already known on this subject? Marfan syndrome (MFS1, OMIM#154700) is an autosomal dominant condition causing aortopathy including fatal aortic dissection. Pre-implantation genetic testing (PGT) is an alternative to traditional invasive prenatal diagnosis (PND) giving the couples the chance of starting pregnancy with the confidence that the baby will be unaffected. Most of the previous PGT reports employed microsatellite-based linkage analysis. A few PGT studies used sequencing, mini-sequencing and mutation analysis; however, the details of the techniques were not described.What do the results of this study add? Single-cell PCR protocol using multiplex fluorescent PCR and mini-sequencing was developed and validated. Two clinical PGTs cycles for Marfan syndrome were performed. A healthy baby was resulted. The details of multiplex fluorescent PCR and mini-sequencing protocols are described in this study so that the procedures can be reproduced.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Embryo selection can help the family suffering from Marfan syndrome for two generations to start a pregnancy with confidence that their child will be unaffected. This study also shows the use of a mini-sequencing protocol for PGT, which can be a universal protocol for other mutations by changing the PCR primers and mini-sequencing primers.
33109088	Myocardial ischemia 10 years after a modified Cabrol procedure in a 42-year-old patient with Marfan syndrome.	BACKGROUND: Marfan syndrome, a genetic disorder of the connective tissue, may cause aortic root dilation with aortic insufficiency, aortic dissection and mitral prolapse with mitral insufficiency. We present a case of a late complication of the modified Cabrol procedure that included replacing the ascending aorta with a composite graft. CASE PRESENTATION: In February 2019, a 42-year-old female patient with Marfan syndrome who presented with chest pain was sent to the Emergency Department. She had undergone the modified Cabrol procedure 10 years prior. Upon presenting, laboratory analysis revealed elevated troponin-I levels. Electrocardiogram showed new inverted T waves over lead I, aVL and V4 to V6. Contrast computed tomography (CT) revealed thrombosis in the Dacron graft. Percutaneous coronary angiography was conducted, and a large thrombus in the graft was noted. Thrombolytic therapy and percutaneous coronary intervention were performed, after which the patient had no more symptoms and was discharged without complications. CONCLUSIONS: Aortic root surgery, including the Cabrol or modified Cabrol procedure, is necessary for complicated cases of aortic dilations, such as in patients with Marfan syndrome, even though the Cabrol or modified Cabrol procedure has a high complication rate. Regarding this case, we were surprised by the timing of the myocardial ischemia and the position of the thrombus, which differed from other cases. To better manage such a patient's condition and to detect the formation of thrombus early, completeness of the graft and possible stenosis of the anastomosis site to avoid preventable myocardial ischemia, we suggest that patients should have regular image follow-up, even years after the Cabrol or modified Cabrol procedure.

36661250	Outcomes for Treatment of Capsulolabral Adhesions With a Capsular Spacer During Revision Hip Arthroscopy.	BACKGROUND: The presence of adhesions is a common source of pain and dysfunction after hip arthroscopic surgery and an indication for revision surgery. The placement of a capsular spacer in the capsulolabral recess after lysis of adhesions has been developed to treat and prevent the recurrence of adhesions. PURPOSE: To evaluate patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and survivorship at a minimum of 2 years after revision hip arthroscopic surgery with capsular spacer placement for capsular adhesions. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: Between January 2013 and June 2018, a total of 95 patients (99 hips) aged >=18 years underwent revision hip arthroscopic surgery for the treatment of capsular adhesions with the placement of a capsular spacer. Overall, 53 patients (56 hips) met the inclusion criteria and had a minimum 2-year follow-up, forming the cohort of this study. Exclusion criteria included confounding metabolic bone diseases (eg, Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, Marfan syndrome), labral deficiency, or advanced osteoarthritis (Tonnis grade 2 or 3). Preoperative and postoperative outcome scores (modified Harris Hip Score [mHHS], Hip Outcome Score-Activities of Daily Living [HOS-ADL], Hip Outcome Score-Sport-Specific Subscale [HOS-SSS], 12-Item Short Form Health Survey [SF-12], and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index [WOMAC]) were collected and compared in addition to the revision rate, conversion to total hip arthroplasty, and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: The mean age of the cohort was 32 +- 11 years, with 32 female hips (57%) and a median number of previous hip arthroscopic procedures of 1 (range, 1-5). The arthroplasty- and revision-free survivorship rate at 2 years was 91%. Overall, 5 patients (6 hips; 11%) underwent revision surgery at a mean of 2.4 +- 1.4 years after capsular spacer placement, with symptomatic capsular defects being the most common finding. There were 4 patients (7%) who converted to total hip arthroplasty. For hips not requiring subsequent surgery (n = 46), there was a significant improvement in outcome scores except for the SF-12 Mental Component Summary, with rates of achieving the minimal clinically important difference of 70%, 70%, and 65% for the mHHS, HOS-ADL, and HOS-SSS, respectively. CONCLUSION: Capsular spacers, as part of a systematic approach including lysis of adhesions with early and consistent postoperative physical therapy including circumduction exercises, resulted in improved PROs as well as high arthroplasty- and revision-free survivorship (91%) at a minimum 2-year follow-up. Capsular spacers should be considered in revision hip arthroscopic procedures when an adequate labral volume remains but adhesions continue to be a concern.
28304197	Endovascular treatment of a dural arteriovenous fistula in a patient with Loeys-Dietz syndrome: A case report.	Background Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is a recently recognized autosomal dominant connective tissue disease. The manifestations of LDS include vascular tortuosity, scoliosis, craniosynostosis, aneurysm and aortic dissections. Clinical presentation A 35-year-old woman treated with Stanford type B aortic dissection and breast cancer was referred to us for Borden type II dural arteriovenous fistula (dAVF) draining to the vein of Galen, involving the midline of tentorium cerebelli. The dAVF was treated successfully by combined transarterial and transvenous embolization. Because of tortuosity of vertebral arteries, a genetic test was conducted confirming LDS type 2. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first case report of dAVF associated with LDS. The relationship between LDS and dAVF is unknown but this report shows the possibility that mutation of transforming growth factor beta receptors 2 ( TGFBR2) related to LDS may be related to shunt diseases. Because intervention in LDS seems to be feasible compared to Ehlers Danlos syndrome and Marfan syndrome, it is important to make the correct diagnosis.
26422961	[Anesthetic Management of Right Lower Lobectomy in a Patient with Marfan Syndrome].	We report a case of partial lobectomy in a patient with Marfan syndrome. A 56-year-old woman with Marfan syndrome was scheduled for partial lobectomy for suspected lung cancer under general anesthesia. She underwent a Bentall operation and mitral valve replacement 10 months before and strict blood pressure management was required. After induction of general anesthesia with propofol and fentanyl, topical intratracheal lidocaine anesthesia was performed using the Pentax-AWS Airwayscope (AWS) for visualization, allowing for the Soft-tipped Tube Exchanger (TE-Soft) to be inserted into the trachea. Next, a double-lumen tracheal tube was uneventfully intubated via the TE-Soft with minimal change in vital signs. During the operation, pressure-controlled ventilation was performed to minimize the risk of pneumothorax. After the operation, under continuous administration of landiorol and dexmedetomidine, the double-lumen tracheal tube was extubated uneventfully. Strict airway and circulation management is needed for lung or vessel preservation in patients whose conditions are complicated by Marfan syndrome.
35275761	D-dimer in Marfan syndrome: effect of obstructive sleep apnea induced blood pressure surges.	Aortic dissection and rupture are the major causes of premature death in persons with Marfan syndrome (MFS), a rare genetic disorder featuring cardiovascular, skeletal, and ocular impairments. We and others have found that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) confers significant vascular stress in this population and may accelerate aortic disease progression. We hypothesized that D-dimer, a diagnostic biomarker for several types of vascular injury that is also elevated in persons with MFS with aortic enlargement, may be sensitive to cardiovascular stresses caused by OSA. To test this concept, we recruited 16 persons with MFS without aortic dissection and randomized them to two nights of polysomnography, without (baseline) and with OSA treatment: continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). In addition to scoring OSA by the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), beat-by-beat systolic BP (SBP) and pulse-pressure (PP) fluctuations were quantified. Morning blood samples were also assayed for D-dimer levels. In this cohort (male:female, 10:6; age, 36 +- 13 yr; aortic diameter, 4 +- 1 cm), CPAP eliminated OSA (AHI: 20 +- 17 vs. 3 +- 2 events/h, P = 0.001) and decreased fluctuations in SBP (13 +- 4 vs. 9 +- 3 mmHg, P = 0.011) and PP (7 +- 2 vs. 5 +- 2 mmHg, P = 0.013). CPAP also reduced D-dimer levels from 1,108 +- 656 to 882 +- 532 ng/mL (P = 0.023). Linear regression revealed a positive association between the maximum PP during OSA and D-dimer in both the unadjusted (r = 0.523, P = 0.038) and a model adjusted for contemporaneous aortic root diameter (r = 0.733, P = 0.028). Our study revealed that overnight CPAP reduces D-dimer levels commensurate with the elimination of OSA and concomitant hemodynamic fluctuations. Morning D-dimer measurements together with OSA screening might serve as predictors of vascular injury in MFS.NEW & NOTEWORTHY What is New? Surges in blood pressure caused by obstructive sleep apnea during sleep increase vascular stress and D-dimer levels in Marfan syndrome. Elevations in D-dimer can be lowered with CPAP. What is Noteworthy? D-dimer levels might serve as a marker for determining the significance of obstructive sleep apnea in persons with Marfan syndrome. D-dimer or obstructive sleep apnea screening is a potential method to identify persons with Marfan syndrome at risk for adverse cardiovascular events.
28482718	Pregnancy and mesenchimal dysplasias (Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia).	The objective of this article is to attract the attention of clinical physicians to the rare but extremely relevant clinical pathology of mesenchymal dysplasias (Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia) and especially specific characteristics of such diseases during pregnancy. Connective tissue pathology can cover different organs and systems, symptoms of the same disease can vary in different patients thus making diagnostics significantly difficult. Here clinical diagnostic criteria and methods of molecular diagnostics of diseases are described. The pathogenesis of mesenchymal dysplasias is not currently well understood. For the patients with mesenchymal dysplasias pregnancy is fraught with high risk of life-threatening complications. The preferred delivery method for such patients is caesarean section.
31513900	Pigment dispersion syndrome and response to laser peripheral iridotomies in a child with Marfan syndrome.	Pigment dispersion syndrome (PDS) and pigmentary glaucoma have rarely been reported in Marfan syndrome and have never been reported in a child with Marfan syndrome. We report the clinical and ultrasound biomicroscopic findings of PDS in a 14-year-old girl with Marfan syndrome and its favorable response to bilateral laser peripheral iridotomy.

27278058	[Spontaneous intracranial hypotension and Marfan syndrome].	Spontaneous intracranial hypotension is the most common complication in patients undergoing a lumbar puncture. A much rarer entity is headaches attributed to spontaneous (or idiopathic) low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure but the combination with a connective tissue disorder is even rarer. The first case of a patient with spontaneous intracranial hypotension and genetically established Marfan syndrome was published in 1995. This article describes the cases of two female patients who presented with postural headache. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple leakages of CSF and both patients had a genetically confirmed diagnosis of Marfan syndrome. The initial symptomatic treatment did not result in a significant relief of the headaches. Epidural blood patching was performed and the intervention was successful in both patients. Finally, the most important epidemiological, diagnostic and pathophysiological aspects are demonstrated and the therapeutic procedures are presented. 
27483660	[Safe and Effective Analgesia with Bilateral Continuous TAP Block for a Patient with Marfan Syndrome after Open Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair].	A patient with Marfan syndrome underwent emergency open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. She was referred to our department for postoperative analgesia. Taking the risk of possible dural ectasia into consideration, we avoided epidural block. Alternatively, we performed bilateral continuous transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block with sufficient analgesia. Lumbosacral dural ectasia is frequently observed in patients with Marfan syndrome. A few reports described that their fragile dura may contribute to an increased risk of dural puncture and postdural puncture headache (PDPH). Thus, in planning neuraxial block for a patient with Marfan syndrome, the possible consequences of lumbosacral dural ectasia should be considered. A case we herein present shows bilateral continuous TAP block could be a safe and effective alternative to epidural block.
30684615	"The ""Destino-guided BEVAR"" to Catheterize Downward Branches from a Femoral Access: Technical Note and Case Report."	BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to report the Destino-guided branched endovascular aortic repair approach as a valid alternative to catheterization downward branches in complex aortic arch/descending thoracic anatomies. METHODS & RESULTS: A 53-year-old woman with Marfan syndrome underwent a thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair for a type III dissecting aneurysm. A custom repair with an endograft having 3 fenestrations (for renal arteries and superior mesenteric artery) and 1 branch for the celiac trunk was planned. The right axillary artery was chronically occluded; the left subclavian artery (LSA) was aneurysmatic. The catheterization of the celiac trunk branch was demanding but ultimately a bare stent was used as a bridging component between the graft and the target vessel, for spinal cord preconditioning. At the 2-month computed tomography angiography, when planning the relining of the bare metal stent, a 1 cm increase in diameter of the LSA aneurysm was documented and therefore a Destino-guided branched endovascular aortic repair was planned. This approach consists of branch catheterization via femoral access using the Destino steerable guiding sheath inside which, after bending, a smaller Cook Flexor is placed to easily deliver the stent, while maintaining stability. CONCLUSIONS: The Destino-guided branched endovascular aortic repair is a reproducible and effective alternative to the classic catheterization of side branches via brachial/axillary access allowing their completion from a femoral access.
25662437	Early and medium term results of the sleeve valve-sparing procedure for aortic root ectasia.	"BACKGROUND: The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate our experience of using a simplified aortic valve sleeve procedure to treat aortic root ectasia and aneurysms with or without aortic regurgitation. In experienced hands, 2 aortic valve-sparing procedures, ie, Yacoub and David, have yielded excellent long-term results in the treatment of aortic root aneurysms, with or without aortic regurgitation. However, these techniques are demanding and not widely used. Recently, a new and simplified valve-sparing technique, named ""sleeve procedure,"" has been proposed, and has yielded encouraging early results. METHODS: Ninety consecutive patients with aortic root aneurysms underwent sleeve procedures from October 2006 to October 2012. Follow-up data (clinical 100% complete and echocardiographic 93% complete) were acquired from our outpatient clinic or from the referring cardiologist. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 61.5 +- 12.5 years, 79% were male, 16 (18%) had a bicuspid valve, 3 had Marfan syndrome, and 2 had aortic dissection. Over a mean clinical follow-up of 34 +- 19 months, 2 patients died from noncardiac causes and 1 was reoperated on for the recurrence of aortic regurgitation. On follow-up echocardiography after a mean of 18 +- 9 months, aortic regurgitation was absent/negligible, mild or moderate in 62%, 37%, and 1% of patients, respectively, and the diameters of the annulus, Valsalva sinuses, and sinotubular junction were 27.3 + 2.2, 37.0 + 3.4, and 30.6 + 3.1 mm, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our encouraging early and medium term results suggest that the sleeve procedure is a safe and effective aortic valve-sparing technique for the treatment of aortic root ectasia and aneurysm. However, longer follow-up is needed in order to draw definitive conclusions."
27206743	Systemic Multiple Aneurysms Caused by Vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.	Systemic multiple aneurysms are rare and usually associated with collagen tissue disease, such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) or Marfan syndrome. In the present case, we describe a 39-year-old male patient with systemic multiple aneurysms and acute intraperitoneal hemorrhage who was clinically diagnosed with vascular EDS. Coil embolization of the distal segment of the common hepatic artery was performed, which resolved the patient's symptoms. With this case presentation, we aim to increase the awareness of vascular EDS among clinicians and emphasize the extreme fragility of the arteries in patients with vascular EDS. 
30369143	[Surgical correction of contractural arachnodactyly deformity of a child with Marfan syndrome].	"A Marfan syndrome child with contractural arachnodactyly deformity of both hands was admitted to our unit in June 2015. The left and right middle fingers and ring fingers of the child received the continuous "" Z"" skin flap and "" V-Y"" plasty to reduce the palmar tension on the skin and release the contracture. Due to the improper therapeutic strategy and the underestimation of effect of underlying lesions of Marfan syndrome on the therapeutic strategy, the right middle finger of child was with ischemic necrosis and amputated, and the finger tip was accompanied with distension and paroxysmal neuropathic pain at a specified future date. The skin flaps of the other three surgical fingers were with local necrosis and scar healing. The child was complicated by distal interphalangeal joints stiffness and some serious complications post-discharge. Combined with this case, the similar disorders are not recommended to carry out one-stage operation."
35428473	Association of initial management on readmissions for spontaneous pneumothorax in adolescents.	BACKGROUND: In adolescents, initial treatment of spontaneous pneumothorax (PTX) must balance the recurrence risk with invasiveness. While institutional series have sought to define the role of early intervention, large-scale analysis is lacking. The present study aimed to evaluate the impact of initial strategy on recurrence and resource utilization in a nationally representative cohort. METHODS: Patients (10-20 years) admitted for first-time pneumothorax were identified using the 2010-2019 Nationwide Readmissions Database. Based on the initial management strategy, patients were classified as nonoperative management, chest tube drainage only, and operative intervention. Multivariable regression was used to evaluate the impact of approach on outcomes of interest. The primary outcome was recurrence within 90 days, while length of stay and hospitalization costs were secondarily considered. RESULTS: Of an estimated 20,887 patients, 35.5% were classified as nonoperative management, 35.2% as chest tube drainage only, and 29.2% as operative intervention. Compared to others, the operative intervention cohort more frequently had Marfan syndrome and emphysematous blebs. After adjustment, patients initially managed operatively experienced lower odds of recurrence (adjusted odds ratio: 0.48, 95% confidence interval: 0.36-0.64), while chest tube drainage only had increased risk (adjusted odds ratio: 1.93, 95% confidence interval: 1.59-2.34) with nonoperative management as reference. Incremental 90-day length of stay was greater in operative intervention (beta: +2.4 days, 95% confidence interval: 1.8-3.0) compared to nonoperative management, but 90-day costs were similar. CONCLUSION: Initial operative management for first-time pneumothorax appears to reduce risk of recurrence while demonstrating similar total costs. Due to high recurrence rates associated with conservative approaches, initial surgical intervention may be considered in this patient population.
28219577	Method of Hemorrhage Control From the Aorta After Repair of a Dissected Aortic Aneurysm.	Patients with Marfan syndrome and presenting with acute aortic dissection have fragile aorta, causing bleeding problems in the anastomosis between the graft and the aorta. Hemostatic impairment following circulatory arrest and prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass contribute to these problems. We describe a technique to control persistent bleeding from the anastomosis in the aortopulmonary recess using two kissing inflated balloons at the tip of two Foley catheters to tamponade the bleeding sites.
33301243	A reimplantation valve-sparing root replacement (T. David-V) and aortic valve repair procedure in a patient with Marfan syndrome.	Valve-sparing aortic root replacement using the reimplantation technique (T. David-V operation) has become the gold standard in patients with annuloaortic ectasia, given that the aortic valve is morphologically intact or repairable. The benefits of preserving the native aortic valve extend beyond avoiding the inconvenience and complications of prolonged exposure to anticoagulants. This video tutorial provides a step-by-step guide to the T. David-V procedure in a male patient with Marfan syndrome, annuloaortic ectasia, and moderate-to-severe aortic regurgitation.
