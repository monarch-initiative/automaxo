NEGATIVE,30212788	Parental-reported neurodevelopmental issues in Loeys-Dietz syndrome. BACKGROUND: Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is a congenital multisystem disorder affecting the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal system. Limited data have reported neurodevelopmental (ND) issues in LDS. AIMS: To determine the extent of ND issues in patients with LDS. METHODS: A prospective study was performed of LDS patients or their caregivers. The study included data collected via an online survey of age-specific questions. Standard statistical methods were used for baseline and demographic characteristics,as well as group comparisons. OUTCOMES: Data were obtained from 67 patients with LDS (54% female). Median age was 14.9 years. Gene mutations included TGFBR1 (39%),TGFBR2 (40%),SMAD3 (7%),and unknown (14%). Motor delays (30%,18/61) and hypotonia (63%,37/60) occurred frequently. Physical (62%,39/62),occupational (41%,23/56),and speech therapies (34%,20/58) were common. Feeding issues were common (41%,23/56). TGFBR1 mutations were more frequent among those with motor delays and feeding issues. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with LDS and/or their caregivers report at least one ND problem in most cases,and many require therapies. These data suggest ND disorders should be considered to be part of the phenotype.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,27662508        Economic and care considerations of Marfan syndrome. INTRODUCTION: Marfan syndrome is a rare multisystem disease of the connective tissue,which affects multiple organ systems. advances in healthcare have doubled the life-expectancy of patients over the past three decades. to date,there is no comprehensive review that consolidates economic considerations and care for marfan patients. Areas covered: Present research suggests that there may be a link between treatment pattern,disease progression and economic costs of Marfan syndrome. It indicates that an early detection of the disease and preventive interventions achieve a dual aim. From a patient perspective,it may reduce the amount of emergency surgery or intervention,and inpatient stays. In addition,it slows disease progression,lowers lifestyle restrictions,reduces psychological stress,and improves health-related quality of life. Expert commentary: Early detection and preventive measures are likely to achieve a dual aim by simultaneously containing costs and reducing the number and length of inpatient stays.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,34428348	Toward precision medicine in vascular connective tissue disorders. Tremendous progress has been made in understanding the etiology,pathogenesis,and treatment of inherited vascular connective tissue disorders. While new insights regarding disease etiology and pathogenesis have informed patient counseling and care,there are numerous obstacles that need to be overcome in order to achieve the full promise of precision medicine. In this review,these issues will be discussed in the context of Marfan syndrome and Loeys-Dietz syndrome,with additional emphasis on the pioneering contributions made by Victor McKusick.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,33258798	Looking for new anabolic treatment from rare diseases of bone formation. Bone remodelling is a complex mechanism regulated by osteoclasts and osteoblasts and perturbation of this process leads to the onset of diseases,which may be characterised by altered bone erosion or formation. In this review,we will describe some bone formation-related disorders as sclerosteosis,van Buchem disease,hypophosphatasia and Camurati-Engelmann disease. In the past decades,the research focused on these rare disorders offered the opportunity to understand important pathways regulating bone formation. Thus,the identification of the molecular defects behind the etiopathology of these diseases will open the way for new therapeutic approaches applicable also to the management of more common bone diseases including osteoporosis.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,30091466        Bone-targeted delivery of TGF-beta type 1 receptor inhibitor rescues uncoupled bone remodeling in Camurati-Engelmann disease. Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is a genetic bone-modeling disorder mainly caused by mutations in the gene that encodes transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1). Symptoms of CED include bone pain,fractures,and dysplasia. Currently,effective therapies for bone fracture and dysplasia in CED are urgently needed. We have demonstrated that TGF-beta1 is a coupling factor for bone remodeling and is aberrantly activated in CED. Daily injection of TGF-beta type 1 receptor inhibitor (TbetaR1I) attenuated CED symptoms,but this systemic administration caused serious side effects. In this study,we created a conjugate linking TbetaR1I and alendronate,which delivered TbetaR1I specifically to bone. After weekly injection of the conjugate for 8 weeks,normal bone morphology and remodeling in CED mice was maintained with a minimum effective dose 700 times lower than TbetaR1I injection. Additionally,we found that the conjugate restored normal bone turnover by reducing the number of osteoblasts and osteoclasts,maintained a regular osteogenic microenvironment by regulating the formation of CD31 and Endomucin double-positive vessels,and preserved ordinary bone formation via inhibition of the migration of leptin-receptor-positive cells. Thus,targeting delivery of TbetaR1I to bone is a promising therapy for CED and other uncoupled bone remodeling disorders.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,27928112	An ENU-induced p.C225S missense mutation in the mouse Tgfb1 gene does not cause Camurati-Engelmann disease-like skeletal phenotypes. Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is a rare sclerosing bone disorder in humans with autosomal dominant inheritance. Mutations in the gene (TGFB1) that encodes transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) are causative for CED. TGF-beta1 signaling is enhanced by the CED-causing mutations. In this study,we performed Tgfb1 mutation screening in an ENU-mutagenized mouse genomic DNA library. We identified a missense mutation in which cysteine was substituted by serine at position 225 (p.C225S),that corresponded to the CED-causing mutation (p.C225R). TGF-beta1 mutant protein carrying p.C225S was secreted normally into the extracellular space. Reporter gene assays showed that the p.C225S mutants enhanced TGF-beta signaling at the same level as p.C225R mutants. We generated p.C225S homozygous mice and confirmed that the mature TGF-beta1 levels in the culture supernatants of the calvarial cells from the homozygotes were significantly higher than those from wild-type mice. Although the skull and femur are sclerotic in CED,these phenotypes were not observed in p.C225S homozygous mice. These results suggest that human and mouse bone tissue react differently to TGF-beta1. These findings are useful to pharmacological studies using mouse models in developing drugs that will target TGF-beta signaling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,29581211        Effects of vaccines in patients with sickle cell disease: a systematic review protocol. INTRODUCTION: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited haematological disorder caused by a single point mutation (Glub6Val) that promotes polymerisation of haemoglobin S and sickling of erythrocytes. Inflammation,haemolysis,microvascular obstruction and organ damage characterise the highly variable clinical expression of SCD. People with SCD are at increased risk of severe infections,hence the need for vaccination against common disease-causing organisms in this population. We aim to review the evidence on the efficacy and safety of vaccines in people with SCD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The present systematic review will examine the current data as indexed in PubMed,CENTRAL,EMBASE and EBSCOHost. We will consult Strategic Advisory Group of Experts practice statements,conference abstracts,reference lists of relevant articles,WHO ICTRP trial registry and experts in the field. Two authors will independently screen search outputs,select studies,extract data and assess risk of bias; resolving discrepancies by discussion and consensus between the two authors or arbitration by a third author when necessary. We will perform a meta-analysis for clinically homogenous studies. Evidence from clinically diverse studies will be aggregated using narrative synthesis of the findings. In either case,we will use the GRADE approach to assess the strength of the available evidence. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study draws on data that are readily available in the public domain,hence no formal ethical review and approval is required. The findings of this review will be disseminated through conference presentations and a publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

NEGATIVE,37541800        Global burden of transfusion in sickle cell disease. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common hereditary hemoglobinopathy. The underlying pathophysiology of the red blood cell (RBC) leads to pan-systemic complications which manifest at an early age. While curative and disease-modifying treatments exist for SCD,a key intervention in the management and treatment of SCD is RBC transfusion,which can alleviate or prevent many complications. SCD patients often require chronic RBC transfusion therapy which can result in complications,such as iron overload,alloimmunization and infection. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs),SCD patients lack appropriate access to healthcare such as newborn screening,health education,prophylaxis for infection,and treatments to reduce both mortality and SCD-related adverse effects. Poor access to RBCs for transfusion,coupled with donated blood not meeting safety standards set by the World Health Organization,presents a significant barrier for patients requiring chronic transfusions in LMICs. Unmet needs associated with blood collection,blood component processing and recipient matching all pose a serious problem in many LMICs,although this varies depending on geographic location,political organizations and economy. This review aims to provide an overview of the global burden of SCD,focusing on the availability of current treatments and the burden of chronic RBC transfusions in patients with SCD.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,29112240	Splenectomy versus conservative management for acute sequestration crises in people with sickle cell disease. BACKGROUND: Acute splenic sequestration crises are a complication of sickle cell disease,with high mortality rates and frequent recurrence in survivors of first attacks. Splenectomy and blood transfusion,with their consequences,are the mainstay of long-term management used in different parts of the world. This is a 2017 update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2002,and previously updated,most recently in 2015. OBJECTIVES: To assess whether splenectomy (total or partial),to prevent acute splenic sequestration crises in people with sickle cell disease,improved survival and decreased morbidity in people with sickle cell disease,as compared with regular blood transfusions. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register,which comprises of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearching relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also searched clinical trial registries. Additional trials were sought from the reference lists of the trials and reviews identified by the search strategy.Date of the most recent search: 14 August 2017. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing splenectomy (total or partial) to prevent recurrence of acute splenic sequestration crises with no treatment or blood transfusions in people with sickle cell disease. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: No trials of splenectomy for acute splenic sequestration were found. MAIN RESULTS: No trials of splenectomy for acute splenic sequestration were found. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Splenectomy,if full,will prevent further sequestration and if partial,may reduce the recurrence of acute splenic sequestration crises. However,there is a lack of evidence from trials showing that splenectomy improves survival and decreases morbidity in people with sickle cell disease. There is a need for a well-designed,adequately-powered,randomized controlled trial to assess the benefits and risks of splenectomy compared to transfusion programmes,as a means of improving survival and decreasing mortality from acute splenic sequestration in people with sickle cell disease.There are no trials included in the review and we have not identified any relevant trials up to August 2017. We will continue to run searches to identify any potentially relevant trials; however,we do not plan to update other sections of the review until new trials are published.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,"36790450	""A Qualitative Systematic Review of Pediatric Patient and Caregiver Perspectives on Pain Management for Vaso-Occlusive Episodes in the Emergency Department. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study is to describe the experiences of pediatric patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and their caregivers who have presented to the emergency department (ED) for management of vaso-occlusive pain events. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative systematic review. The search protocol was developed to identify both published and unpublished literature that met inclusion/exclusion criteria. Included articles were primary hospital-based research with study populations that included (but were not limited to) pediatric patients aged 21 years or younger and qualitative or mixed-method analysis. RESULTS: Four themes were identified: (1) patients and caregivers perceive the ED as the last resort; (2) health care professionals in the ED lacked knowledge about SCD but rejected patients' and caregiver's attempts to share experience or advocate for their needs; (3) patients' accounts of pain are doubted because they do not always have """"typical"""" signs of pain; and (4) caregivers identify racism as a reason for suboptimal care in the ED. CONCLUSIONS: There are multiple opportunities to improve management for vaso-occlusive pain events in the ED",including education of health care providers about SCD and complications,partnership between patients/caregivers and providers,"and efforts to reduce the impact of systemic racism on health care delivery.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,32897878	BCL11A enhancer-edited hematopoietic stem cells persist in rhesus monkeys without toxicity. Gene editing of the erythroid-specific BCL11A enhancer in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) induces fetal hemoglobin (HbF) without detectable toxicity,as assessed by mouse xenotransplant. Here,we evaluated autologous engraftment and HbF induction potential of erythroid-specific BCL11A enhancer-edited HSPCs in 4 nonhuman primates. We used a single guide RNA (sgRNA) with identical human and rhesus target sequences to disrupt a GATA1 binding site at the BCL11A +58 erythroid enhancer. Cas9 protein and sgRNA ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) was electroporated into rhesus HSPCs,followed by autologous infusion after myeloablation. We found that gene edits persisted in peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) for up to 101 weeks similarly for BCL11A enhancer- or control locus-targeted (AAVS1-targeted) cells. Biallelic BCL11A enhancer editing resulted in robust gamma-globin induction,with the highest levels observed during stress erythropoiesis. Indels were evenly distributed across PB and BM lineages. Off-target edits were not observed. Nonhomologous end-joining repair alleles were enriched in engrafting HSCs. In summary,we found that edited HSCs can persist for at least 101 weeks after transplant and biallelic-edited HSCs provide substantial HbF levels in PB red blood cells,together supporting further clinical translation of this approach.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,35605629	Post-discharge morbidity and mortality in children admitted with severe anaemia and other health conditions in malaria-endemic settings in Africa: a systematic review and meta-analysis. BACKGROUND: Severe anaemia is associated with high in-hospital mortality among young children. In malaria-endemic areas,surviving children also remain at increased risk of mortality for several months after hospital discharge. We aimed to compare the risks of morbidity and mortality among children discharged from hospital after recovery from severe anaemia versus other health conditions in malaria-endemic settings in Africa. METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines,we searched PubMed,Scopus,Web of Science,and Cochrane Central from inception to Nov 30,"$2,021.00",without language restrictions,for prospective or retrospective cohort studies and randomised controlled trials that followed up children younger than 15 years for defined periods after hospital discharge in malaria-endemic countries in Africa. We excluded the intervention groups in trials and studies or subgroups involving children with sickle cell anaemia,malignancies,or surgery or trauma,or those reporting follow-up data that were combined with the in-hospital period. Two independent reviewers extracted the data and assessed the quality and risk of bias using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale or the Cochrane Collaboration's tool. The coprimary outcomes were all-cause death and all-cause readmissions 6 months after discharge. This study is registered with PROSPERO,CRD42017079282. FINDINGS: Of 2930 articles identified in our search,27 studies were included. For children who were recently discharged following hospital admission with severe anaemia,all-cause mortality by 6 months was higher than during the in-hospital period (n=5 studies; Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio 1 72,95% CI 1 22-2 44; p=0 0020; I2=51 5%) and more than two times higher than children previously admitted without severe anaemia (n=4 studies; relative risk [RR] 2 69,95% CI 1 59-4 53; p<0 0001; I2=69 2%). Readmissions within 6 months of discharge were also more common in children admitted with severe anaemia than in children admitted with other conditions (n=1 study; RR 3 05,1 12-8 35; p<0 0001). Children admitted with severe acute malnutrition (regardless of severe anaemia) also had a higher 6-month mortality after discharge than those admitted for other reasons (n=2 studies; RR=3 12,2 02-4 68; p<0 0001; I2=54 7%). Other predictors of mortality after discharge included discharge against medical advice,HIV,bacteraemia,and hypoxia. INTERPRETATION: In malaria-endemic settings in Africa,children admitted to hospital with severe anaemia and severe acute malnutrition are at increased risk of mortality in the first 6 months after discharge compared with children admitted with other health conditions. Improved strategies are needed for the management of these high-risk groups during the period after discharge.

NEGATIVE,28460533	A Multidisciplinary Approach to Impact Acute Care Utilization in Sickle Cell Disease. Sickle cell disease (SCD),an inherited red blood cell disorder,is characterized by anemia,end-organ damage,unpredictable episodes of pain,and early mortality. Emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations are frequent,leading to increased burden on patients and increased health care costs. This study assessed the effects of a multidisciplinary care team intervention on acute care utilization among adults with SCD. The multidisciplinary care team intervention included monthly team meetings and development of individualized care plans. Individualized care plans included targeted pain management plans for management of uncomplicated pain crisis. Following implementation of the multidisciplinary care team intervention,a significant decrease in ED utilization was identified among those individuals with a history of high ED utilization. Findings highlight the potential strength of multidisciplinary interventions and suggest that targeting interventions toward high-utilizing subpopulations may offer the greatest impact.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NEGATIVE,31743315	Social Determinants of Health and Emergency Department Use Among Children With Sickle Cell Disease. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with disproportionate emergency department (ED) use. This study described the social determinants of health associated with ED visits and hospital admission from the ED among children with SCD using a nationally representative dataset. We analyzed data from 126 children 0 to 17 years of age with SCD included in the 2011 to 2017 rounds of the National Health Interview Survey (mean age,8 y; 50% female individuals; 74% African American). Study variables were summarized using weighted means and proportions and compared according to ED use and admission by Wald tests. Fifty-two identified children had visited the ED within the last 12 months and 21 were admitted to the hospital after their most recent ED visit. Children living in a single-mother household were more likely to visit the ED (P=0.040),as were younger children (mean age,6 vs. 9 y; P=0.034),with no evaluated social determinants of health significantly impacting hospital admission from the ED. The lack of association between ED use and either poverty or insurance type may be related to the overall high level of social disadvantage among children with SCD. Our findings demonstrate the need to better characterize specific social factors impacting acute care use among children with SCD.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,32889827	Role of complement in alloimmunization and hyperhemolysis. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to summarize the role of complement in regulating the removal of a target alloantigen following an incompatible red blood cell (RBC) transfusion,the formation of alloantibodies following RBC alloantigen exposure,and the development of hyperhemolysis in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies demonstrate that complement can accelerate alloantibody-mediated removal of target alloantigens from the RBC surface following incompatible transfusion. Complement also influences alloantigen availability during developing alloimmune responses and serves as a unique mediator of CD4 T-cell-independent alloantibody formation following RBC alloantigen exposure. Finally,alternative complement pathway activation appears to play a key role in the development of acute hemolytic episodes in patients with SCD,providing a potential druggable target to prevent acute complications in patients with this disease. SUMMARY: Recent studies suggest that complement can regulate a wide variety of processes germane to hematology,from transfusion complications to baseline hemolysis in patients with SCD. As the role of complement in various disease processes becomes more fully understood,the ability to leverage recently developed complement modulating drugs will only continue to enhance providers' ability to favorably intervene in many hematological diseases.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,28748763	Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Technology: A Paradigm Shift in Medical Science for Drug Screening and Disease Modeling. BACKGROUND: Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (IPSC) Technology is the most advanced research as it offers an attractive alternative for establishing patient-specific IPSCs to recapitulate phenotypes of not only monogenic diseases (viz. Thalassaemia,Sickle cell anemia,Haemophilia,Tay-Sachs disease),but also late-onset polygenic diseases (viz. Parkinson's disease,Alzheimer's disease,schizophrenia). Over the hindsight,numerous studies of the past and current scientists have led to the production,maturation and understanding of induced pluripotent stem cell technology and its use in basic and clinical research. METHODS: A systematic search of peer-reviewed scientific literature and clinical trials in public databases were carried out to summarize the evidence on the use of IPSC. RESULTS: Current review sheds light upon the use of patient-derived iPSC models in drug toxicity,screening and discovery which have been derived after referring to more than 200 articles in literature. Furthermore,their use as disease models was also studied signifying the versatility of iPSC lines. CONCLUSION: Through this review,we describe the advent of iPSC technology,where we comprehensively cover the generation of iPSCs and their characterization along with their prospective applications using IPSC banks in disease modeling and drug screening.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,28464177	Hospital Readmissions from Patients' Perspectives. OBJECTIVES: Healthcare expenditures in the United States have increased exponentially and hospital care accounts for one-third of these costs. Approximately 18% of hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries are being readmitted to the hospital within 30 days. Engaging patients in the discharge process can help better identify patients' postdischarge needs and implement more effective readmission prevention strategies. The objective of our study was to identify the factors that contribute to hospital readmission as seen from patients' perspectives in a large urban community hospital. METHODS: We evaluated all consecutive,unplanned readmissions to the hospitalist service within 30 days of discharge,using the STate Action on Avoidable Rehospitalizations diagnostic worksheet with face-to-face patient interviews and retrospective chart reviews. RESULTS: During the study period,80 patients were readmitted within 30 days of their discharge,with 28 of them having more than one readmission. The mean age was 50.8 +- 18.3 years. Of the 80 patients,51% were men and 51% were black. Sickle cell disease was the leading diagnosis (11.3%) in both index admissions and readmissions. Patient interviews identified some modifiable risk factors for readmissions such as the inability to obtain medications or schedule follow-up appointments as well as problems related to transportation,housing,and social support. Despite clear discharge planning and patient understanding of the plan being recorded at discharge,almost one-third of patients appeared to lack the ability to self-manage symptoms and understand the disease process. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that engaging patients in discharge planning can help identify barriers within the process. Improvements in socioeconomic/environmental layers of population health have the potential to prevent hospitalizations and readmissions in the long term.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NEGATIVE,32448738	A Healthcare Improvement Initiative to Increase Multidisciplinary Pain Management Referrals for Youth with Sickle Cell Disease. BACKGROUND: Chronic pain is a complex integration of biological,psychological,and social variables. Multidisciplinary pain management experts design interventions that treat the multidimensional experience. Children and adolescents with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at risk for chronic pain. Increased risk is associated with multiple characteristics including sickle cell genotype,age,gender,frequency of hospitalization,duration of hospitalization,and certain comorbid diagnoses. Referral to pain management professionals for this population is often delayed. AIMS: To increase multidisciplinary pain management referrals for youth with SCD identified to be at risk for chronic pain. DESIGN: Implementation research. SETTING: One pediatric,academic medical facility serving as a regional sickle cell treatment center in the Midwest. PARTICIPANTS: Children greater than 2 years of age and less than 21 years of age with laboratory confirmed SCD. METHODS: Implementation of an evidence-based screening tool using the consolidated framework for implementation research (CFIR) to guide project planning,design,and evaluation. The CFIR model was paired with the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) quality improvement methodology to operationalize workflow and sustain project aims. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Eighty-four percent of all eligible patients were screened during their routine sickle cell appointments resulting in a 110% increase in multidisciplinary pain management referrals. Future interventions and PDSA cycles are targeted at improving attendance at scheduled appointments,reducing hospitalizations,decreasing 30-day readmissions,and shortening length of stay.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,36120980	Rates of Opioid Misuse Amongst Patients Receiving Pain Management for Sickle Cell Disease in An Urban Setting. Background and Objective: Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is known to cause acute severe pain episodes known as vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) mainly treated with opioid analgesics. Since the opioid epidemic there is an interest in determining the opioid misuse potential in these patients. Therefore,the primary objective of this study is to determine the rates of opioid misuse among patients with SCD by assessing the rate of unexpected drug screening results in a sickle cell disease clinic. Methods: This was a retrospective chart review study conducted at the outpatient sickle cell disease clinic. The primary independent variables were the prescribed opioid medications while the primary dependent variable was the collected opioid metabolite. Descriptive statistics,linear regression and multivariate logistic regression analysis were conducted using SPSS version 24. Results: A total of 100 participants were recruited from July 1,"$2,018.00",to June 30,2020 with 71 included in the analysis. The total mean of morphine milligram equivalents (MME) for all participants was 71.1+-104.9 with 71% of participants having a daily calculated MME of <90MME. The odds of misusing an opioid were 6.72 times higher (P<.02) if a participant used marijuana compared to a participant who didn't. In addition,the odds of misusing an opioid were 2.47 times higher (P<.04) if the patient was prescribed an opioid daily dose greater than 90 MME as opposed to a daily dose less than 90 MME. Conclusion: Participants who consumed greater than 90 MME's per day and utilized marijuana were more likely to misuse opioids.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,32586619	Parents of Children with Sickle Cell Disease Are Interested in Preimplantation Genetic Testing. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate awareness of and attitudes toward preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) for sickle cell disease (SCD) among parents of children with SCD. STUDY DESIGN: Parents of children with SCD were given an educational handbook on PGT before a routine SCD clinic visit. After their clinic visit,parents were asked to complete an anonymous survey. RESULTS: Of 83 patents approached,67 (81%) completed the survey. Only 16 of the 67 parents (24%) were previously aware of PGT for SCD. After our clinic-based education,65 of the 67 parents (97%) indicated that it was important or very important for parents of children with SCD to know about PGT. Among parents interested in having more children,29 of 32 (91%) would personally consider using PGT if covered by insurance. CONCLUSIONS: Parents of children with SCD are generally not aware of PGT. When educated in clinic,parents viewed information on PGT as valuable. Pediatricians and other health care professionals should inform parents of children with SCD about this reproductive option.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,32089275	Sickle Cell Disease is Associated with Increased Morbidity,Resource Utilization,and Readmissions after Common Abdominal Surgeries: A Multistate Analysis,2007-2014. INTRODUCTION: Sickle cell disease (SCD),the most commonly inherited hemoglobinopathy in the United States,increases the likelihood of postoperative complications,resulting in higher costs and readmissions. We used a retrospective cohort study to explore SCD's influence on postoperative complications and readmissions after cholecystectomy,appendectomy,and hysterectomy. METHODS: We used an administrative database's 2007-2014 data from California,Florida,New York,Maryland,and Kentucky. RESULTS: 1,$934.00,562 patients aged >=18 years were included. Compared to non-SCD patients,SCD patients experienced worse outcomes: increased odds of blood transfusion and major and minor complications,higher adjusted odds of 30- and 90-day readmissions,longer length of stay,and higher total hospital charges. CONCLUSION: Sickle cell disease patients are at high risk for poor outcomes based on their demographic characteristics. Therefore,perioperative physicians including hematologists,anesthesiologists,and surgeons need to take this knowledge into consideration for management and counselling of SCD patients on the risks of surgery and recovery.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,37939877	Sickle cell disease and pregnancy. Pregnancy is a particularly risky period in the life of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Physiological changes during pregnancy increase the risk of vaso-occlusive crises (VOC),acute chest syndrome,venous thromboembolic events,and infections. This concerns haemoglobin (Hb) S/C and S/beta+-thalassaemia patients as much than S/S or S/beta0-thalassaemia patients. SCD also increases the risk of obstetrical complications,such as preeclampsia,in utero foetal death,preterm delivery mostly induced,and intrauterine growth restriction. Thus,pregnancy should be planned and closely monitored by a multidisciplinary team involving obstetricians and sickle cell disease specialists. Before pregnancy,the parents should also be informed about the risk of transmission of this autosomal recessive disease,and the father should therefore be prescribed haemoglobin electrophoresis. Treatments have to be revised when planning pregnancy: hydroxyurea (HU) should be stopped as soon as pregnancy is suspected or confirmed. Preventive blood transfusion is not systematic,but is recommended in the case of a pre-existing transfusion program prior to pregnancy,severe pre-existing organ damage,severe obstetric history,and severe or repeated crises during follow-up,especially in patients taking HU before. Despite the risks of prematurity,systematic administration of corticosteroids for foetal lung maturation is not recommended due to the risk of maternal vaso-occlusive event. Although more frequent,due to obstetrical and maternal complications,caesarean section is not systematic,in the absence of maternal contraindications. It is advisable not to exceed the term of 39 weeks of amenorrhoea. Post-partum follow-up is recommended,particularly because of the risk of thromboembolism.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,28506281	A telephonic mindfulness-based intervention for persons with sickle cell disease: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial. BACKGROUND: One of the most difficult symptoms for persons with sickle cell disease (SCD) to manage is chronic pain. Chronic pain impacts approximately one-third of persons with SCD and is associated with increased pain intensity,pain behavior,and frequency and duration of hospital visits. A promising category of nonpharmacological interventions for managing both physical and affective components of pain are mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs). METHODS/DESIGN: The primary aim of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled study to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility,as well as to determine the preliminary efficacy,of a telephonic MBI for adults with SCD who have chronic pain. We will enroll 60 adult patients with SCD and chronic pain at an outpatient comprehensive SCD center in the southeastern United States. Patients will be randomized to either an MBI or a wait-listed control group. The MBI group will complete a six-session (60 minutes),telephonically delivered,group-based MBI program. The feasibility,acceptability,and efficacy of the MBI regarding pain catastrophizing will be assessed by administering questionnaires at baseline and weeks 1,$3.00,and 6. In addition,ten randomly selected MBI participants will complete semistructured interviews to help determine intervention acceptability. DISCUSSION: In this study protocol,we report detailed methods of the randomized controlled trial. Findings of this study will be useful to determine the acceptability,feasibility,and efficacy of an MBI for persons with SCD and chronic pain.

NEGATIVE,36541848	Delayed haemolytic transfusion reaction in paediatric patients with sickle cell disease: A retrospective study in a French national reference centre. Delayed haemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR) is a life-threatening haemolytic anaemia following red blood cell transfusion in patients with sickle cell disease,with only scarce data in children. We retrospectively analysed 41 cases of DHTR in children treated between 2006 and 2020 in a French university hospital. DHTR manifested at a median age of 10.5 years,symptoms occurred a median of 8 days after transfusion performed for an acute event (63%),before surgery (20%) or in a chronic transfusion programme (17%). In all,93% of patients had painful crisis. Profound anaemia (median 49 g/L),low reticulocyte count (median 140 x109 /L) and increased lactate dehydrogenase (median 2239 IU/L) were observed. Antibody screening was positive in 51% of patients,and more frequent when there was a history of alloimmunisation. Although no deaths were reported,significant complications occurred in 51% of patients: acute chest syndrome (12 patients),cholestasis (five patients),stroke (two patients) and kidney failure (two patients). A further transfusion was required in 23 patients and corticosteroids were used in 21 to reduce the risk of additional haemolysis. In all,13 patients subsequently received further transfusions with recurrence of DHTR in only two. The study affords a better overview of DHTR and highlights the need to establish guidelines for its management in children.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NEGATIVE,36450880	Bone loss is ameliorated by fecal microbiota transplantation through SCFA/GPR41/ IGF1 pathway in sickle cell disease mice. Bone loss is common in sickle cell disease (SCD),but the molecular mechanisms is unclear. Serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) was low in SCD subjects and SCD mice. To determine if decreased IGF1 associated with low bone mass in SCD is due to reduced SCFA production by gut microbiota,we performed reciprocal fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) between healthy control (Ctrl) and SCD mice. uCT and histomorphometry analysis of femur showed decreased bone volume/total volume (BV/TV),trabecular number (Tb.N),osteoblast surface/bone surface (Ob.S/BS),mineralizing surface/ bone surface (MS/BS),inter-label thickness (Ir.L.Th) in SCD mice were significantly improved after receiving Ctrl feces. Bone formation genes Alp,Col1,Runx2,and Dmp1 from SCD mice were significantly decreased and were rescued after FMT from Ctrl feces. Transplantation of Ctrl feces increased the butyrate,valerate,and propionate levels in cecal content of SCD mice. Decreased G-coupled protein receptors 41 and 43 (GPR41 and GPR43) mRNA in tibia and lower IGF1 in bone and serum of SCD mice were partially restored after FMT from Ctrl feces. These data indicate that the healthy gut microbiota of Ctrl mice is protective for SCD bone loss through regulating IGF1 in response to impaired bacterial metabolites SCFAs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,38190311	An Updated Equitable Model of Readiness for Transition to Adult Care: Content Validation in Young People With Sickle Cell Disease. Importance: Despite elevated health risks during young adulthood,many adolescents and young adults with serious health care needs face barriers during the transfer to an adult specialty practitioner,and health disparities may occur during the transition. Objective: To validate the content of an updated Social-Ecological Model of Adolescent and Young Adult Readiness for Transition to Promote Health Equity (SMART-E) in a group of adolescents and young adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) and their supports. Design,Setting,and Participants: Health equity framework components were reviewed. Systems of power (eg,institutional and practitioner bias) and environments or networks (eg,peer or school support) were added as SMART-E preexisting factors,and health literacy was included within readiness factors. Adolescents and young adults aged 16 to 29 years with SCD,caregivers,and practitioners participated in this convergent,mixed-methods study within Children's Hospital of Philadelphia between January and August 2022. Main Outcomes and Measures: Content validity was assessed through nominations of top 3 most important transition barriers prior to interviews and focus groups,ratings on importance of SMART-E factors (0-4 scale; ratings >2 support validity) after interviews and focus groups,nominations of 3 most important factors for transition and for health equity,and qualitative content analysis of interview transcripts. Results: The study enrolled 10 pediatric adolescents and young adults (mean [SD] age,18.6 [2.9] years; 4 female and 6 male),10 transferred adolescents and young adults (mean [SD] age,22.9 [2.1] years; 8 female and 2 male),9 caregivers (mean [SD] age,49.8 [8.7] years; 5 female and 4 male),and 9 practitioners (mean [SD] age,45.6 [10.5] years; 8 female and 1 male). Quantitative ratings supported the content validity of SMART-E and met established criteria for validity. Systems of power was the most endorsed transition barrier (14 of 38 participants) reported prior to interviews and focus groups. After the interview,participants endorsed all SMART-E factors as important for transition,with new factors systems of power and environments and networks rated at a mean (SD) 2.8 (1.23) and 3.1 (0.90),respectively,on a 0 to 4 scale of importance. The most important factors for transition and equity varied by participant group,with all factors being endorsed,supporting the comprehensiveness of SMART-E. Qualitative data corroborated quantitative findings,further supporting validity,and minor modifications were made to definitions. Conclusions and Relevance: SMART-E obtained initial content validation with inclusion of health equity factors for adolescents and young adults with SCD,caregivers,and practitioners. The model should be evaluated in other populations of adolescents and young adults with chronic disease.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transition from pediatric to adult care for adolescents and young adults (AYA) with sickle cell disease (SCD) comes at a time when a range of biopsychosocial issues occur simultaneously. A new survey sought information from physicians who treat AYA with SCD about their practices in how they transition pediatric patients to adult care.

A large proportion of children have been affected by COVID-19; we evaluated the association between comorbidities and hospitalization/ICU (intensive care unit) admission among 4097 children under age 21 years with symptomatic COVID-19 (not just polymerase chain reaction [PCR]-positive or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children associated with COVID-19 [MIS-C]) from 2 large health systems from March 2020 to September 2021. Significant comorbidities and demographic factors identified by univariable analysis were included in a multivariable logistic regression compared with children ages 6 to 11 without comorbidities. In all,475 children (11.6%) were hospitalized,of whom 25.5% required ICU admission. Children under 1 year had high hospitalization risk,but low risk of ICU admission. Presence of at least 1 comorbidity was associated with hospitalization and ICU admission (odds ratio [OR] > 4). Asthma,obesity,chronic kidney disease,sickle cell disease,bone marrow transplantation,and neurologic disorders were associated with hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] > 2). Malignancy,intellectual disability,and prematurity were associated with ICU admission (AOR > 4).

NEGATIVE,33626864	Chronic organ injuries in children with sickle cell disease. Median life expectancy of patients with sickle cell disease has increased to up to 55 years but there are still frequent cases of premature death,mostly in patients with pre-existing organ failure such as pulmonary hypertension,kidney injury,and cerebral vasculopathy. Most organ injuries remain asymptomatic for a long time and can only be detected through early systematic screening. Protocols combining assessment of velocities on transcranial Doppler and regular transfusions in patients with abnormal velocities have been demonstrated to dramatically reduce the risk of stroke. In contrast,no consensus has been reached on systematic screening or therapy for silent cerebral infarcts. The prognostic significance of increased tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity on echocardiography has not yet been identified in children,whereas increased albuminuria is a good predictor of kidney injury. Finally,screening for hip and eye disorder is recommended; however,different countries adopt different screening strategies. Hydroxyurea is probably of potential benefit in preventing chronic organ damage but this requires further study in order to be fully demonstrated. Efficacy and safety of the other new drugs available are also under investigation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,34881428	Perinatal outcomes in women with sickle cell disease: a matched cohort study from London,UK. There are limited data on contemporary outcomes for women with sickle cell disease (SCD) in pregnancy. We conducted a single-site matched cohort study,comparing 131 pregnancies to women with SCD between 2007 and 2017 to a comparison group of 1310 pregnancies unaffected by SCD. Restricting our analysis to singleton pregnancies that reached 24 weeks of gestation,we used conditional Poisson regression to estimate adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) for perinatal outcomes. Infants born to mothers with SCD were more likely to be small for gestational age [aRR 1 69,95% confidence interval (CI) 1 13-2 48],preterm (aRR 2 62,95% CI 1 82-3 78) and require Neonatal Unit (NNU) admission (aRR 3 59,95% CI 2 18-5 90). Pregnant women with SCD were at higher risk of pre-eclampsia/eclampsia (aRR 3 53,95% CI 2 00-6 24),more likely to receive induction of labour (aRR 2 50,95% CI 1 82-1 76) and caesarean birth (aRR 1 44,95% CI 1 18-1 76). In analysis stratified by genotype,the risk of adverse outcomes was highest in haemoglobin SS (HbSS) pregnancies (n = 80). There was no strong evidence that haemoglobin SC (HbSC) pregnancies (n = 46) were at higher risk of preterm birth,caesarean delivery,or NNU admission. Pre-eclampsia/eclampsia was more frequently observed in HbSC pregnancies. Despite improvements in the care of pregnant women with SCD,the increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes remains.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,32573838	COVID-19 and thalassaemia: A position statement of the Thalassaemia International Federation. OBJECTIVES: Many patients with haemoglobinopathies,including thalassaemia and sickle cell disease,are at increased risk of developing severe complications from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although epidemiologic evidence concerning the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection in these patients is currently lacking,the COVID-19 pandemic represents a significant challenge for haemoglobinopathy patients,their families and their attending physicians. METHODS: The present statement summarizes the key challenges concerning the management of haemoglobinopathies,with particular focus on patients with either transfusion-dependent or non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia,identifies the gaps in knowledge and suggests measures and strategies to deal with the pandemic,based on available evidence and expert opinions. Key areas covered include patients' risk level,adaptation of haemoglobinopathy care,safety of blood transfusions,blood supply challenges,and lifestyle and nutritional considerations. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed measures and strategies may be useful as a blueprint for other disorders which require regular hospital visits,as well as for the timely adaptation of patient care during similar future pandemics.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,37736806	CRISPR-Cas9 system: a novel and promising era of genotherapy for beta-hemoglobinopathies,hematological malignancy,and hemophilia. Gene therapy represents a significant potential to revolutionize the field of hematology with applications in correcting genetic mutations,generating cell lines and animal models,and improving the feasibility and efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. Compared to different genetic engineering tools,clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) emerged as an effective and versatile genetic editor with the ability to precisely modify the genome. The applications of genetic engineering in various hematological disorders have shown encouraging results. Monogenic hematological disorders can conceivably be corrected with single gene modification. Through the use of CRISPR-CAS9,restoration of functional red blood cells and hemostasis factors were successfully attained in sickle cell anemia,beta-thalassemia,and hemophilia disorders. Our understanding of hemato-oncology has been advanced via CRIPSR-CAS9 technology. CRISPR-CAS9 aided to build a platform of mutated genes responsible for cell survival and proliferation in leukemia. Therapeutic application of CRISPR-CAS9 when combined with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy in multiple myeloma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia was feasible with attenuation of CAR T cell therapy pitfalls. Our review outlines the latest literature on the utilization of CRISPR-Cas9 in the treatment of beta-hemoglobinopathies and hemophilia disorders. We present the strategies that were employed and the findings of preclinical and clinical trials. Also,the review will discuss gene engineering in the field of hemato-oncology as a proper tool to facilitate and overcome the drawbacks of chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy (CAR-T).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,33020528	Non-hematopoietic deficiency of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 deficiency leads to more severe anemia in a murine model of sickle cell disease. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) deficiency leads to lower cholesterol and is associated with reduced vascular complications in the general population. Cholesterol lowering may also have beneficial effects in sickle cell disease (SCD). The objective of this study was to determine effects of PCSK9 deficiency in a mouse model of SCD. Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was performed from donor SCD mice to wild-type,PCSK9-deficient,and LDLR-deficient recipients to generate SCD controls (Pcsk9+/+,SCDbmt) with preserved PCSK9 status,SCD mice with deficiency of PCSK9 (Pcsk9-/-,SCDbmt),and SCD mice with deficiency of LDLR (Ldlr-/-,SCDbmt). Although cholesterol levels were lower in Pcsk9-/-,SCDbmt mice compared to Pcsk9+/+,SCDbmt mice,anemia was more severe in Pcsk9-/-,SCDbmt mice. Increased reticulocytosis,enhanced ex vivo erythrocyte sickling,and increased erythrocyte phosphatidylserine exposure was also observed. Livers,spleens,and kidneys contained increased iron in Pcsk9-/-,SCDbmt mice compared to Pcsk9+/+,SCDbmt mice consistent with greater hemolysis. SCD mice with deficiency of LDLR (Ldlr-/-,SCDbmt mice) had similar anemia as Ldlr+/+,SCDbmt mice despite higher serum cholesterol. In conclusion,deficiency of PCSK9 is associated with worsened anemia in SCD mice due to increased hemolysis. These findings may have implications for lipid-lowering strategies in patients with SCD,as well as for potential novel modifiers of anemia severity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,32201151	How to setup a successful transplant program for hemoglobinopathies in developing countries: The Cure2Children approach. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the only established definitive cure for severe hemoglobinopathies,such as sickle cell disease (SCD) and thalassemia-the most prevalent life-threatening non-communicable disease of childhood globally. HSCT can not only cure over 85% of children with a compatible sibling but also restore normal health-related quality of life in most cases who do not have major irreversible organ damage at transplant. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs),particularly in sub-Saharan Africa,SCD carrier rate can be up to 30% and 1% of live births have SCD. Relatively simple and inexpensive measures such as newborn screening,early diagnosis,caregiver education,and timely institution of anti-pneumococcal prophylaxis and hydroxyurea therapy can substantially reduce SCD-related mortality and morbidity. Improved prevention and early care should proceed in parallel with the development of transplant services and hope for cure. Cure2Children,an Italian NGO,has supported the startup of several bone marrow transplantation programs in LMICs where over 500 transplants have been performed over the last 10 years,with outcomes not substantially different from high-income countries but at a fraction of the cost. This report summarizes this experience and suggests some strategies to set up new HSCT units.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NEGATIVE,32814708	Curative in vivo hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy of murine thalassemia using large regulatory elements. Recently,we demonstrated that hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) mobilization followed by intravenous injection of integrating,helper-dependent adenovirus HDAd5/35++ vectors resulted in efficient transduction of long-term repopulating cells and disease amelioration in mouse models after in vivo selection of transduced HSPCs. Acute innate toxicity associated with HDAd5/35++ injection was controlled by appropriate prophylaxis,making this approach feasible for clinical translation. Our ultimate goal is to use this technically simple in vivo HSPC transduction approach for gene therapy of thalassemia major or sickle cell disease. A cure of these diseases requires high expression levels of the therapeutic protein (gamma- or beta-globin),which is difficult to achieve with lentivirus vectors because of their genome size limitation not allowing larger regulatory elements to be accommodated. Here,we capitalized on the 35 kb insert capacity of HDAd5/35++ vectors to demonstrate that transcriptional regulatory regions of the beta-globin locus with a total length of 29 kb can efficiently be transferred into HSPCs. The in vivo HSPC transduction resulted in stable gamma-globin levels in erythroid cells that conferred a complete cure of murine thalassemia intermedia. Notably,this was achieved with a minimal in vivo HSPC selection regimen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,28944997	Desire for parenthood and reproductive health knowledge in adolescents and young adults with sickle cell disease and their caregivers. BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Sickle cell disease (SCD) and hydroxyurea have implications for fertility and reproductive health. The goal of this study was to examine desire for parenthood and reproductive health knowledge among a cohort of adolescent and young adult (AYA) with SCD receiving hydroxyurea and their caregivers at a large pediatric academic center. METHODS: Patients with SCD were approached from September 2016 to July 2017 if they were: (1) 12-20 years old,(2) prescribed hydroxyurea for at least 6 months,(3) proficient in English,and (4) accompanied by a caregiver who was proficient in English and willing to participate.  Participants self-reported sociodemographic characteristics and completed surveys to assess their/their child's desire for parenthood and other life goals,and reproductive health knowledge. RESULTS: Eighteen patient-caregiver dyads completed the study (78.3% of those eligible); 61.1% indicated that they wanted to have future biological children.  Few participants reported receiving information about fertility (16.7% of AYA and 27.8% of caregivers) or birth control (11.1% of AYA and 22.2% of caregivers) from their/their child's health care provider,and the majority had received no information on these topics. Less than half of participants reported that SCD (22.2% of AYA and 50.0% of caregivers) or hydroxyurea (11.1% of AYA and 27.8% of parents) could potentially impair fertility. CONCLUSIONS: Biological parenthood was important to this cohort yet fertility and reproductive health knowledge was low,suggesting that clinicians should prioritize conversations about infertility risk and birth control options with AYA with SCD on hydroxyurea and their caregivers.  More research is needed to identify optimal approaches to these discussions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,33524905	Motivations and deterrents toward blood donation in Kampala,Uganda. Severe malaria,hemorrhage during childbirth,sickle cell anemia,injury from road accidents,and other medical conditions that necessitate blood transfusions affect thousands of Ugandans every year. However,only 0.3-0.5% of the population donates blood,which is less than half of the proportion recommended by the World Health Organization to maintain a sufficient supply in blood banks and health facilities. In January 2018,Uganda faced crisis level blood shortages,increasing preventable deaths in the country as patients lacked access to life-saving transfusions. To understand the factors that impact a person's decision to give blood and to inform public health campaigns that seek to promote donation,researchers collaborated with Uganda Blood Transfusion Services (UBTS) and the Uganda Red Cross Society (URCS),the primary actors in blood donation in Uganda,to conduct 50 semi-structured in-depth interviews with blood donors and non-donors and 22 key informant interviews with UBTS and URCS staff members. Through qualitative data analysis using Dedoose software,this study identified several key motivations that promote donation,including altruism,civic duty,and opportunities for disease testing,as well as important deterrents,including fear of needles and blood and lack of awareness of or access to blood donation drives. Results have been shared with blood collection agencies to inform public health campaigns that seek to dispel fears and promote motivations toward donation to increase the blood supply and decrease preventable deaths in Uganda.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bone marrow histological features of sickle cell anaemia (SCA) patients during early stages and in the asymptomatic phase of the disease appear an interesting area of study,representing early-stage consequences of SCA with a close relation to its pathophysiology. Unfortunately,this field of research has never been specifically addressed before. Bone marrow biopsies from 26 consecutive Black African SCA patients (M:F=1.6:1; age 2-17 years),free of clinical signs of chronic bone marrow damage,with no recent history of symptomatic vaso-occlusive episodes,and waiting for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT),underwent morphological,immunohistochemical and electron microscopy evaluation. Additional comparison with three bone marrow specimens from post-HSCT SCA patients and 10 bone marrow specimens from AS healthy carriers was performed. Bone marrow of SCA patients was normocellular or slighly hypercellular in all cases. Erythroid hyperplasia was a common feature. Myeloid lineage was slightly decreased with normal to slightly diminished neutrophilic granulocytes; CD68 positive monocytic-macrophagic cells appeared slightly increased,with a predominant CD163 positive M2/M(Hb) phenotype. A positive correlation was found between haemoglobin values and number of bone marrow erythroid cells (R2=0.15,p=0.05). Intravascular and interstitial clusters of erythroid sickle cells were found in bone marrow of pre-HSCT homozygous SS SCA patients,as well as heterozygous AS healthy carriers,and the single post-HSCT patient matched to an AS health carrier donor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,32220342	Paediatric to adult transition care for patients with sickle cell disease: a global perspective. Sickle cell disease is a life-threatening inherited condition designated as a public health priority by WHO. Increased longevity of patients with sickle cell disease in high-income,middle-income,and low-income countries present unprecedented challenges for all settings; however,a globally standardised solution for patient transition from paediatric to adult sickle cell disease health care is unlikely to address the challenges. We established a task force of experts from a multicountry (the USA,Europe,Middle East,and Africa) consortium. We combined themes from the literature with viewpoints from members of the task force and invited experts to provide a global overview of transition care practice,highlighting barriers to effective transition care and provide baseline recommendations that can be adapted to local needs. We highlighted priorities to consider for any young person with sickle cell disease transitioning from paediatric to adult health care: skills transfer,increasing self-efficacy,coordination,knowledge transfer,linking to adult services,and evaluating readiness (the SICKLE recommendations). These recommendations aim to ensure appropriate benchmarking of transition programming,but multisite prospective studies are needed to address this growing public health need.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,31229639	Identification and Characterization of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Candidates in a Sickle Cell Disease Cohort. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with significant morbidity,and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the primary curative treatment. Recently,the Brazilian Ministry of Health released a regulation that required the publically funded healthcare system to pay for HSCT for SCD patients with defined indications. We used an existing 2794-member SCD cohort established during 2013 to 2015 to characterize candidates for HSCT and estimate the number of possible donors. Of 2064 patients with SC anemia (SCA),152 of 974 children (16%) and 279 of 1090 adults (26%) had at least 1 HSCT indication. The most common indication for transplant was stroke (n = 239) followed by avascular necrosis (n = 96),priapism (n = 82),cerebrovascular disease (n = 55),>2 vaso-occlusive episodes (n = 38),alloantibodies and chronic transfusion therapy (n = 18),and >2 acute chest syndrome episodes (n = 11). Increasing age,number of transfusions,abnormal transcranial Doppler,retinopathy,dactylitis,and use of hydroxyurea were more frequent in the 152 children with an indication for HSCT compared with 822 without (P < .001). Of 152 children and 279 adults meeting the eligibility definition,77 (50%) and 204 (73%),respectively,had at least 1 non-SCD full sibling who could potentially serve as a donor. In conclusion,in a large cohort of SCA patients,16% of children and 26% of adults had at least 1 indication for HSCT; these indications were associated with the severity of the disease. This study provides clinical data necessary for estimating the costs and infrastructure that would be required to implement HSCT in a public healthcare system.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,29883237	Stem cell transplantation in sickle cell disease: therapeutic potential and challenges faced. INTRODUCTION: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited hemoglobinopathy worldwide,and is a life-limiting disease with limited therapeutic options to reduce disease severity. Despite being a monogenic disorder,the clinical phenotypes of SCD are variable,with few reliable predictors of disease severity easily identifying patients where the benefits of curative therapy outweigh the risks. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative option,though significant advances in gene therapy raise the promise for additional curative methods. Areas covered: Allogeneic transplantation in SCD has evolved and improved over the last two decades,now offering a standard of care curative option using a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling donor. Many of the seminal transplantation studies are reviewed here,demonstrating how initial failures and successes have influenced and led to current HSCT strategies. Such strategies aim to overcome setbacks and limitations,and focus on conditioning regimens,immune suppression methods,the use alternative donor sources,and gene therapy approaches. Expert commentary: SCD is a curable disease. Each dedicated effort to refine transplantation methods,expand the donor pool,and bring gene therapy models to fruition will make enormous impacts reducing disease burden and improving outcomes and quality of life for patients with SCD.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,34488784	Combining malaria vaccination with chemoprevention: a promising new approach to malaria control. Malaria control has stalled in a number of African countries and novel approaches to malaria control are needed for these areas. The encouraging results of a recent trial conducted in young children in Burkina Faso and Mali in which a combination of the RTS,S/AS01E malaria vaccine and seasonal malaria chemoprevention led to a substantial reduction in clinical cases of malaria,severe malaria,and malaria deaths compared with the administration of either intervention given alone suggests that there may be other epidemiological/clinical situations in which a combination of malaria vaccination and chemoprevention could be beneficial. Some of these potential opportunities are considered in this paper. These include combining vaccination with intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in infants,with intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (through vaccination of women of child-bearing age before or during pregnancy),or with post-discharge malaria chemoprevention in the management of children recently admitted to hospital with severe anaemia. Other potential uses of the combination are prevention of malaria in children at particular risk from the adverse effects of clinical malaria,such as those with sickle cell disease,and during the final stages of a malaria elimination programme when vaccination could be combined with repeated rounds of mass drug administration. The combination of a pre-erythrocytic stage malaria vaccine with an effective chemopreventive regimen could make a valuable contribution to malaria control and elimination in a variety of clinical or epidemiological situations,and the potential of this approach to malaria control needs to be explored.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,33471938	Sickle cell disease: progress towards combination drug therapy. Dr. John Herrick described the first clinical case of sickle cell anaemia (SCA) in the United States in 1910. Subsequently,four decades later,Ingram and colleagues characterized the A to T substitution in DNA producing the GAG to GTG codon and replacement of glutamic acid with valine in the sixth position of the betaS -globin chain. The establishment of Comprehensive Sickle Cell Centers in the United States in the 1970s was an important milestone in the development of treatment strategies and describing the natural history of sickle cell disease (SCD) comprised of genotypes including homozygous haemoglobin SS (HbSS),HbSbeta0 thalassaemia,HbSC and HbSbeta+ thalassaemia,among others. Early drug studies demonstrating effective treatments of HbSS and HbSbeta0 thalassaemia,stimulated clinical trials to develop disease-specific therapies to induce fetal haemoglobin due to its ability to block HbS polymerization. Subsequently,hydroxycarbamide proved efficacious in adults with SCA and was Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved in 1998. After two decades of hydroxycarbamide use for SCD,there continues to be limited clinical acceptance of this chemotherapy drug,providing the impetus for investigators and pharmaceutical companies to develop non-chemotherapy agents. Investigative efforts to determine the role of events downstream of deoxy-HbS polymerization,such as endothelial cell activation,cellular adhesion,chronic inflammation,intravascular haemolysis and nitric oxide scavenging,have expanded drug targets which reverse the pathophysiology of SCD. After two decades of slow progress in the field,since 2018 three new drugs were FDA-approved for SCA,but research efforts to develop treatments continue. Currently over 30 treatment intervention trials are in progress to investigate a wide range of agents acting by complementary mechanisms,providing the rationale for ushering in the age of effective and safe combination drug therapy for SCD. Parallel efforts to develop curative therapies using haematopoietic stem cell transplant and gene therapy provide individuals with SCD multiple treatment options. We will discuss progress made towards drug development and potential combination drug therapy for SCD with the standard of care hydroxycarbamide.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,34078644	Trends in Technology Assistance Among Patients With Childhood Onset Chronic Conditions. OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence,types,and trends over time of medical technology assistance (TA) in patients at the age of transition to adult care with childhood onset chronic conditions (COCCs) cared for at children's hospitals. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective repeated annual cross-sectional cohort study of the Pediatric Health Information Systems inpatient data,patients with at least 1 hospitalization from January 1,"$2,008.00",to December 31,2018 with a selected COCC were included. The COCCs investigated were brain and spinal cord malformation,cerebral palsy,heart and great vessel malformation,cystic fibrosis,sickle cell anemia,and chronic renal failure. TA was defined as requiring an indwelling medical device to maintain health status. Trends over time in TA were analyzed with the Cochran-Armitage test and generalized linear models. RESULTS: During the study,381 289 unique patients accounted for 940 816 hospitalizations. Transition-aged patients (19-21 years old) represented 2.4% of all included hospitalizations over the 11-year period,whereas patients ages 21 and above represented 2.7%. The annual proportion of patients with TA increased significantly from 31.3% in 2008 to 36.9% in 2018,a 17.9% increase (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients with select COCCs hospitalized at children's hospitals,a substantial and growing number of patients at the age of transition to adult care required TA. Identifying adult providers with resources to manage COCCs and maintain medical devices placed in childhood is challenging. These trends warrant special attention to support the timely and successful transition of medically complex patients from pediatric to adult care.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,36752670	An outpatient pain plan and ED pain pathway for adults with sickle cell disease. ABSTRACT: Sickle cell disease (SCD),one of the most common inherited diseases,is associated with lifetime morbidity and reduced life expectancy. In the United States,SCD primarily affects Black patients and,to a lesser degree,those of Hispanic descent. These populations are known to have healthcare disparities related to lower socioeconomic status,limited access to healthcare,and racial bias. The quality-adjusted life expectancy of patients with SCD is less than 35 years,because of progressive complications of the disease. The most common complication is severe episodic pain related to vaso-occlusive ischemic events. Despite guidelines,pain management often is delayed as patients struggle with resistance from clinicians based on concerns over opioid use or abuse,overdose,or drug-seeking behavior. Effective pain management can be accomplished with collaboration between clinicians and patients,a documented outpatient pain management plan,and when necessary,an ED clinical pain pathway for acute SCD pain management.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,34287597	Contraception and reproductive planning from the perspective of women with sickle cell disease. OBJECTIVE: To understand the perceptions of women with sickle cell disease (SCD) about reproductive planning in a public health service. METHOD: This is a qualitative study conducted with 15 women with SCD attended at a public hospital in Recife,between August 2018 and May 2019. Bardin's content analysis technique was used. RESULTS: The women were between 25 and 38 years old,married,and had low education. After the analysis,four thematic categories emerged: information about contraception,use of contraceptive methods,feelings about pregnancy,and gynecological consultation. It was found that women with SCD are influenced by factors such as fear of complications during pregnancy,lack of information on reproductive planning,partners and health professional opinion,and difficulties in health service access. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS: The reports demonstrate that health workers need to improve the way through which information reaches the patient,to offer a more satisfactory professional practice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,30196969	Risks associated with fertility preservation for women with sickle cell anemia. OBJECTIVE: To highlight the risk of complications among women with sickle cell anemia (SCA) receiving fertility preservation treatment (FPT) before hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). DESIGN: Single-center case series. SETTING: Academic fertility center. PATIENT(S): Women aged 15-32 years with SCA undergoing FPT before HSCT. INTERVENTION(S): Retrospective,systematic review. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): FPT modality,SCA complications during FPT. RESULT(S): Over an 8-year period (2009-2017),seven women with SCA ages 15-32 years (mean 28.5 years) underwent FPT with embryo cryopreservation (n = 1),oocyte cryopreservation (n = 4),and ovarian tissue cryopreservation (n = 2). The five women subjects who underwent oocyte or embryo cryopreservation were treated with an antagonist controlled ovarian hyperstimulation protocol and individualized gonadotropin dosing. The trigger medications included leuprolide acetate (n = 2),and human chorionic gonadotropin (n = 3). Most patients (n = 5) received a disease-modifying therapy for SCA (hydroxyurea or chronic transfusions) before FPT. Three patients experienced periprocedural SCA complications that included life-threatening respiratory failure,painful crisis requiring interruption of a stimulation cycle,and severe postharvest painful crisis. CONCLUSION(S): Women with SCA may choose to undergo diverse FPT strategies before HSCT and are at risk for serious SCA-related complications. Evidence-based strategies to mitigate SCA-related morbidity and to optimize fertility preservation outcomes are needed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,31804727	Prevalence of serologic markers of transfusion and sexually transmitted infections and their correlation with clinical features in a large cohort of Brazilian patients with sickle cell disease. BACKGROUND: Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) often require red blood cell (RBC) transfusion for clinical complications,so may be exposed to transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs). The prevalence of markers for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),hepatitis C virus (HCV) and B (HBV),human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1/2),Chagas disease,and syphilis in an SCD cohort in Brazil were studied. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Clinical history,interview data,blood samples,and medical chart review data were collected during cohort enrollment from November 2013 to May 2015. Serologic markers of infection were assessed. Standard measures of statistical association were calculated,and multivariable models were developed for the most prevalent infections to identify associated factors. RESULTS: Infection markers were evident in 5.2% (144/2779) of the enrolled cohort. Anti-HCV was detected in 69 (2.5%),syphilis antibodies in 34 (1.2%),anti-HTLV-1/2 in 17 (0.6%),HBV surface antigen in 13 (0.5%),Chagas disease antibodies in 13 (0.5%),and anti-HIV in 8 (0.3%) of participants. Factors associated with increased odds of being anti-HCV reactive were older age,illegal drug use,increasing number of RBCs,more than three pain crises in the previous year,and geographic location. Syphilis was associated with older age,females,and smoking history. CONCLUSION: HCV infection was more common in older patients who may have received RBCs before testing was performed on donations,suggesting possible historic transfusion transmission. The cohort showed decreasing rates of infections and a reduction in transfusion transmission markers in younger patients compared to historical literature except for syphilis,indicating contemporary reduced risk of TTI.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,35995392	Comparison of Anti-Mullerian Hormone Levels Pre- and Post-Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation in Pediatric and Adolescent Females with Sickle Cell Disease. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell therapy (HCT) is an established cure for sickle cell disease (SCD); however,HCT conditioning regimens are known to be gonadotoxic. Anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) measures ovarian reserve,and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) defines premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) at values >40 mIU/mL in pubertal females. The present study was conducted to assess ovarian reserve and function before and after transplantation in pediatric and adolescent females with SCD treated with allogeneic HCT between January 2015 and June 2020 at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. In this retrospective review of 17 females age <21 years with SCD who had AMH levels measured at baseline and at 2 years post-HCT,AMH levels were categorized as normal,low,or undetectable,and FSH levels were measured and used to identify pubertal females who had developed POI. Demographic and treatment data were abstracted from the institutional database and medical records,and a descriptive statistical analysis was conducted. Of the 17 patients in the study cohort,14 had been treated with hydroxyurea and 3 had chronic transfusions but with no significant iron overload. AMH levels were normal in 15 patients (88%) and low in 2 patients (12%) at baseline. The median age at HCT was 7.5 years (range,3.7 to 20.3 years),and 14 patients (82%) underwent matched related donor HCT. After HCT,15 patients (88%) had undetectable AMH and 2 (12%) had low AMH,with no apparent differences by HCT conditioning regimen. No pubertal patients had POI at baseline,whereas 55% of pubertal patients had progressed to POI by 2 years post-HCT. In this cohort,the majority of females had normal AMH levels at baseline but undetectable levels after HCT. Females with SCD considering HCT should be counseled about the treatment-related risk of gonadal dysfunction.   2022 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.

NEGATIVE,35320302	Perspectives of individuals with sickle cell disease on barriers to care. INTRODUCTION: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hemoglobinopathy that predominantly affects African Americans in the United States. The disease is associated with complications leading to high healthcare utilization rates,including emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations. Optimal SCD care requires a multidisciplinary approach involving SCD specialists to ensure preventive care,minimize complications and prevent unnecessary ED visits and hospitalizations. However,most individuals with SCD receive sub-optimal care or are unaffiliated with care (have not seen an SCD specialist). We aimed to identify barriers to care from the perspective of individuals with SCD in a multi-state sample. METHODS: We performed a multiple methods study consisting of surveys and interviews in three comprehensive SCD centers from March to June 2018. Interviews were transcribed and coded,exploring themes around barriers to care. Survey questions on the specific themes identified in the interviews were analyzed using summary statistics. RESULTS: We administered surveys to 208 individuals and conducted 44 in-depth interviews. Barriers to care were identified and classified according to ecological level (i.e.,individual,family/interpersonal,provider,and socio-environmental/organizational level). Individual-level barriers included lack of knowledge in self-management and disease severity. Family/interpersonal level barriers were inadequate caregiver support and competing life demands. Provider level barriers were limited provider knowledge,provider inexperience,poor provider-patient relationship,being treated differently,and the provider's lack of appreciation of the patient's SCD knowledge. Socio-environmental/organizational level barriers included limited transportation,lack of insurance,administrative barriers,poor care coordination,and reduced access to care due to limited clinic availability,services provided or clinic refusal to provide SCD care. CONCLUSION: Participants reported several multilevel barriers to SCD care. Strategies tailored towards reducing these barriers are warranted. Our findings may also inform interventions aiming to locate and link unaffiliated individuals to care.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,33034160	The burden of respiratory syncytial virus infections among children with sickle cell disease. BACKGROUND: Although respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of pediatric lower respiratory tract infections,the burden of RSV in children with sickle cell disease (SCD) is unknown. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective,nested,case-control study of children with SCD <18 years who had respiratory viral panels (RVPs) performed at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta from 2012 to 2019. We abstracted the medical records to describe the demographics,clinical features,and outcomes of children who tested positive for RSV (cases) versus children who tested negative (controls). We calculated the annual incidence of RSV and related hospitalization rates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and used multivariate logistic regression to evaluate associations. RESULTS: We identified 3676 RVP tests performed on 2636 patients over seven respiratory seasons resulting in 219/3676 (6.0%) RSV-positive tests among 160/2636 (6.1%) patients. The average annual incidence of laboratory-confirmed RSV infection among children with SCD was 34.3 (95% CI 18.7-49.8) and 3.8 (95% CI 0.5-7.0) cases per 1000 person-years for those <5 years and 5-18 years,respectively. The RSV-related hospitalization rate for children <5 years was 20.7 (95% CI 8.5-32.8) per 1000 person-years. RSV-positive cases were significantly younger than RSV-negative patients (3.8 years vs 7.6 years,P < .001). Of RSV-positive cases,22 (13.8%) developed acute chest syndrome and nine (5.6%) required intensive care,which was not significantly different from RSV-negative children with SCD. CONCLUSION: RSV infections are common in children with SCD with higher burden in younger patients. RSV is associated with considerable morbidity,including higher rates of hospitalization compared to the general population.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,34537420	Haploidentical Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation in Sickle Cell Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is the sole established curative treatment option for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). However,a lack of HLA-identical sibling donors is a limiting factor. Haploidentical related donors are a promising donor pool,potentially extending SCT as a curative treatment option to a larger group of patients with no other meaningful treatment options for their severe SCD. In the present study,we aimed to systematically review the results of haploidentical SCT in patients with SCD. A comprehensive search was performed in MEDLINE/PubMed and Embase up to May 2021. Data were extracted by 2 reviewers independently,and the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale was used to assess the quality of the studies. Fourteen studies met our inclusion criteria. To provide an overview of the results of haploidentical SCT,we grouped the studies into myeloablative conditioning versus nonmyeloablative conditioning as well as into in vitro versus in vivo (ie,with post-transplantation cyclophosphamide) T cell depletion with a subgroup meta-analysis of proportions. All the included studies were observational cohort studies. Only 3 of these studies reported data for both matched sibling donor (MSD) SCT and haploidentical SCT. Based on a comparative meta-analysis of the 3 studies that included both haploidentical and MSD transplantation,graft failure was significantly higher in the haploidentical group than in the MSD group (odds ratio,5.3; 95% confidence interval [CI],1.0 to 27.6). Overall survival was not significantly different between the groups. A subgroup meta-analysis of the results of haploidentical SCT showed relatively low overall pooled proportions of graft failure (7%; 95% CI,2% to 20%),acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (4%; 95% CI,2% to 12%),and chronic GVHD (11%; 95% CI,7% to 16%). Overall survival (OS) was high in all the included studies (91%; 95% CI,85% to 94%). Adjustments to the conditioning regimens,robust pretransplantation and post-transplantation T cell depletion,and improved supportive care have resulted in reduced graft failure and improved OS following haploidentical SCT in patients with SCD. We conclude that the safety of haploidentical SCT in SCD patients has improved significantly,and that this should be considered as a curative option in patients with severe SCD.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,36058780	Acute and chronic pain management in patients with sickle cell disease in the modern era: a comprehensive review. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited red blood cell (RBC) disorder worldwide,resulting in chronic hemolytic anemia,vaso-occlusion,tissue hypoxia,and ultimately end organ damage. The hallmark of the disease is manifested by vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) resulting in acute on chronic pain,and the most common cause for presentation to the emergency department and hospital admission. The management of pain for patients with SCD in the U.S. has historically been socially and politically complex with most patients experiencing pain on a daily basis but not seeking immediate medical attention. The pathophysiology of acute and chronic pain in SCD is multifactorial and complex. Here,we describe factors contributing to acute and chronic pain in SCD and management strategies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,37653351	Kidney failure outcomes in children and young adults with sickle cell disease in the United States Renal Data System. BACKGROUND: Children and young adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) develop kidney disease early in childhood,with some patients progressing to require dialysis and kidney transplantation. The prevalence and outcomes of children with kidney failure (chronic kidney disease stage 5) due to SCD are not well described. This study aimed to assess the outcome of children and young adults with SCD with kidney failure compared to matched children and young adults without SCD with kidney failure in a large national database. METHODS: Utilizing the United States Renal Data System (USRDS),we retrospectively examined kidney failure outcomes in children and young adults with SCD from 1998 to 2019. RESULTS: We identified 97 patients with SCD who developed kidney failure and identified 96 matched controls with a median age of 19 years (IQR 17,21) at the time of kidney failure diagnosis. SCD patients had significantly shorter survival (8.4 years vs. 14.0 years,p < 0.001) and had a longer waiting time for their first transplant when compared to matched non-SCD kidney failure patients (12.1 years vs. 7.3 years,p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Children and young adults with SCD kidney failure have significantly higher mortality when matched to non-SCD kidney failure children and experience a longer mean time to kidney transplant.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,36860093	Attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccine among pediatric patients with sickle cell disease and their caregivers. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate attitudes toward vaccination and vaccine uptake regarding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among pediatric patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and their caregivers. PROCEDURE: Adolescent patients and caregivers of children with SCD were surveyed during routine clinic visits; we then conducted a logistic regression analysis to understand differences in vaccine status,while qualitative responses were coded thematically. RESULTS: Among respondents,the overall vaccination rate among adolescents and caregivers was 49% and 52%,respectively. Among the unvaccinated,60% and 68% of adolescents and caregivers,respectively,preferred to remain unvaccinated,most commonly due to lack of perceived personal benefit from vaccination or mistrust in the vaccine. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that child's age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.1,95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0-1.2,p < .01) and caregiver education (measured by the Economic Hardship Index [EHI] score,OR = 0.76,95% CI: 0.74-0.78,p < .05) were independent predictors of getting vaccinated. CONCLUSION: Despite the increased risk of severe illness due to COVID-19 in patients with SCD,vaccine hesitancy remains high in this population of families whose children have SCD. Fortunately,the reasons cited for deferring vaccination among those who are unvaccinated were largely due to barriers that may be overcome with quality communication around the utility of the vaccine and information about vaccine safety.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,35731941	Transition for Adolescents and Young Adults With Sickle Cell Disease in a US Midwest Urban Center: A Multilevel Perspective on Barriers,Facilitators,and Future Directions. BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD),an inherited red blood cell disorder,primarily affects African Americans in the United States. Adolescents and young adults with SCD (AYA-SCD) are at risk of high morbidity and mortality when transitioning from pediatric to adult care. The goal of this qualitative study was to understand factors associated with optimal implementation of the AYA-SCD transition. METHODS: Participants were recruited from a large hospital system and the community. Interview guides included topics on access to primary and specialized care,beliefs and practices related to pain control,transition from pediatric to adult care,and patient experiences in the emergency department. Data were coded and analyzed using an inductive thematic coding approach in combination with a deductive coding approach using domains from the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). RESULTS: Fifty-nine participants,including 21 AYA-SCD from both the pediatric and adult clinics,17 caregivers,9 pediatric SCD providers,6 adult SCD providers,and 6 emergency department providers,completed 11 focus groups and 5 semistructured interviews. Results identified multiple factors within the domains of CFIR including the outer setting,inner setting,individual characteristics,and intervention characteristics. Results were incorporated into a transition framework to inform local practice improvement. CONCLUSION: Our study highlights the importance of multilevel barriers and facilitators for AYA-SCD transition from pediatric to adult care. Future studies could use implementation science frameworks to understand local context and identify strategies and intervention characteristics to improve transition programming. These efforts will ultimately reduce health disparities and ensure health equity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,33127654	Sensitive manipulation of CAR T cell activity using a chimeric endocytosing receptor. BACKGROUND: Most adoptive cell therapies (ACTs) suffer from an inability to control the therapeutic cell's behavior following its transplantation into a patient. Thus,efforts to inhibit,activate,differentiate or terminate an ACT after patient reinfusion can be futile,because the required drug adversely affects other cells in the patient. METHODS: We describe here a two domain fusion receptor composed of a ligand-binding domain linked to a recycling domain that allows constitutive internalization and trafficking of the fusion receptor back to the cell surface. Because the ligand-binding domain is designed to bind a ligand not normally present in humans,any drug conjugated to this ligand will bind and endocytose selectively into the ACT. RESULTS: In two embodiments of our strategy,we fuse the chronically endocytosing domain of human folate receptor alpha to either a murine scFv that binds fluorescein or human FK506 binding protein that binds FK506,thereby creating a fusion receptor composed of largely human components. We then create the ligand-targeted drug by conjugating any desired drug to either fluorescein or FK506,thereby generating a ligand-drug conjugate with ~10-9 M affinity for its fusion receptor. Using these tools,we demonstrate that CAR T cell activities can be sensitively tuned down or turned off in vitro as well as tightly controlled following their reinfusion into tumor-bearing mice. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest this 'chimeric endocytosing receptor' can be exploited to manipulate not only CAR T cells but other ACTs following their reinfusion into patients. With efforts to develop ACTs to treat diseases including diabetes,heart failure,osteoarthritis,cancer and sickle cell anemia accelerating,we argue an ability to manipulate ACT activities postinfusion will be important.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,28500682	Red blood cell transfusions during sickle cell anemia vaso-occlusive crises: a report from the magnesium in crisis (MAGiC) study. BACKGROUND: Little is known about red blood cell (RBC) transfusion practices for children hospitalized for a sickle cell vaso-occlusive pain crisis (VOC). We hypothesized that transfusion would be associated with the development of acute chest syndrome (ACS),lower hemoglobin (Hb) concentration,and lack of hydroxyurea therapy. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of all children admitted for a sickle cell pain crisis enrolled in the Magnesium in Crisis (MAGiC) randomized trial; all had HbSS or S-beta0 thalassemia. ACS development and transfusion administration were prospectively collected during the parent trial. All Hb values during the hospitalization were recorded,as was parent report of child receiving hydroxyurea. Relative risks (RRs) of transfusion were compared between groups. RESULTS: Of 204 enrolled children,40 (19.6%) received a transfusion. Of the 30 children who developed ACS,22 (73.3%) received transfusions compared to 18 of 174 (10.3%) without ACS: the RR of transfusion in children with ACS was 7.1 (95% confidence interval [CI],4.4-11.5). Among those without ACS,the lowest Hb was most strongly associated with transfusions: RR was 3.1 (95% CI 2.0 - 4.7) for each 1 g/dL decrease in lowest Hb. In a binary recursive partitioning model for those without ACS,a lowest recorded Hb level of less than 6.3 g/dL was significantly associated with transfusion during admission (p < 0.01). Hydroxyurea use was not associated with transfusions in any analysis. CONCLUSION: ACS increased the RR of transfusion in children hospitalized for VOC sevenfold. In children without ACS,transfusion was associated with lowest Hb concentration,particularly Hb concentration of less than 6.3 g/dL.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,28602890	Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome after Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation in Children with Hemoglobinopathies. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a serious adverse event associated with calcineurin inhibitors used for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. We compared the incidence of PRES in children with thalassemia (n = 222,1.4 to 17.8 years old) versus sickle cell disease (SCD; n = 59,2 to 17 years old) who underwent hematopoietic cell transplantation from HLA-matched siblings or alternative donors and analyzed the risk factors for PRES. Overall,31 children developed calcineurin inhibitor-related PRES (11%),including 30 patients with seizures and 1 patient without seizures. PRES incidence was significantly higher in SCD patients (22%; 95% confidence interval [CI],10% to 32%) than in thalassemia patients (8%; 95% CI,5% to 12%;P = .002). In multivariate analysis,factors associated with PRES were hypertension (hazard ratio [HR],5.87; 95% CI,2.57 to 13.43; P = .0001),SCD (HR,2.49; 95% CI,1.25 to 4.99; P = .009),and acute GVHD (HR 2.27; 95% CI,1.06 to 4.85; P= .031). In the entire cohort overall survival (OS) was significantly higher in patients without versus with PRES (90% versus 77%; P = .02). In a subgroup analysis that including matched sibling transplants,OS and disease-free survival (DFS) were similar in thalassemia patients without PRES (92% and 88%,respectively) and with PRES (82% and 73%,respectively),whereas SCD patients with PRES had significantly lower OS (67%) and DFS (67%) than patients without PRES (94% and 94%,respectively; P = .008). Thus,SCD patients had a significantly higher incidence of PRES than thalassemia patients,and hypertension and GVHD were the 2 main risk factors for PRES in patients with hemoglobinopathies. Although PRES did not significantly influence survival in patients with thalassemia,patients with SCD had significantly lower survival after PRES.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,34251034	Low rates of transfusion-transmitted infection screening in chronically transfused adults with sickle cell disease. BACKGROUND: Adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) on chronic transfusion therapy are exposed to a large volume of blood products,thus increasing their risk of transfusion-associated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),hepatitis C (HCV),and hepatitis B (HBV). METHODS: We performed a systematic chart review of chronically transfused SCD subjects at the Johns Hopkins Sickle Cell Center for Adults between October 2014 and September 2019 to determine our Center's adherence to the 2014 National Heart,Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) SCD guidelines for annual screening for Transfusion Transmitted infections (TTI) and assessed HBV immunity and HBV vaccination rates. RESULTS: The study included 85 subjects with a median age of 34 years (23-63); 52% were female. No subject received annual screening; 68 subjects (80%) were screened for HIV,60 subjects (71%) for HCV and 53 subjects (62%) for HBV infections at least once in the study period. Of those screened,one patient was newly diagnosed with HCV infection,and none with HIV or HBV infection. Among 31 subjects tested for anti-Hepatitis B surface antibody,16 subjects (52%) tested negative. Nineteen (20%) subjects had HBV vaccination documented. CONCLUSIONS: Low adherence to the NHLBI TTI screening guidelines,especially for HBV,highlights the resource intensiveness of this patient population. The low rates of anti-Hepatitis B surface antibody positivity highlight the need to confirm vaccination,provide boosters as indicated,and investigate the adults with SCD's immune response to HBV vaccination.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,38206762	Managing sickle cell disease and related complications in pregnancy: results of an international Delphi panel. ABSTRACT: Data to guide evidence-based management of pregnant people with sickle cell disease (SCD) are limited. This international Delphi panel aimed to identify consensus among multidisciplinary experts for SCD management during pregnancy. The 2-round Delphi process used questionnaires exploring 7 topics (antenatal care,hydroxyurea use,transfusion,prevention of complications,treatment of complications,delivery and follow-up,and bottlenecks and knowledge gaps) developed by a steering committee. Thirteen panelists (hematologists,physiologists,obstetricians,maternal fetal medicine,and transfusion medicine physicians) from the United States,the United Kingdom,Turkey,and France completed the first survey; 12 panelists completed the second round. Anonymized responses were collected and summarized by a contract research organization (Akkodis Belgium). Consensus and strong consensus were predefined as 75% to 90% (9-10 of 12) and >90% (>=11 of 12) of panelists,respectively,agreeing or disagreeing on a response to a predefined clinical scenario or statement. In several areas of SCD management,consensus was achieved: experts recommended performing at least monthly multidisciplinary antenatal follow-up,administering prophylactic aspirin for preeclampsia prevention between gestational weeks 12 and 36,initiating prophylactic transfusion therapy in certain cases,or choosing automated red blood cell exchange over other transfusion methods for patients with iron overload or severe acute chest syndrome. No consensus was reached on several topics including the prophylactic aspirin dose,indications for starting infection prophylaxis,routine use of prophylactic transfusions,or use of prophylactic transfusions for preventing fetal complications. These recommendations could inform clinical care for patients with SCD who are pregnant in the absence of large clinical trials involving this population; the identified knowledge gaps can orient future research.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,31345791	Clinical meaning of PROMIS pain domains for children with sickle cell disease. The Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) pain interference and pain behavior domains are valid and reliable for children with sickle cell disease (SCD). However,clinical interpretation of the scores is unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the clinical meaning of PROMIS pain scores for children with SCD. We used 2 approaches to determine clinical meaning: dichotomization of item responses and T-score ranges. T-score ranges determined thresholds for no/mild,moderate,and severe pain. We compared the proportion of patients who needed pain medications among pain severity groups using chi2/Fisher's exact tests. The study included 117 children (mean age,11.5 years [standard deviation,2.9 years]). Using the dichotomization approach,43 children had pain interference T-scores <=48 reflecting minimal pain,and 30 children had T-scores >60 reflecting substantial pain. For pain behavior,34 children had T-scores <=41 reflecting minimal problems,and 23 patients had T-scores >57 reflecting substantial problems with pain. Using T-score ranges,clinical thresholds of no/mild and severe pain interference were determined as <=48.3 and >63.6,respectively. The thresholds for no/mild and severe pain behavior were <=41.3 and >57.3,respectively. Overall,the proportion of patients who took pain medications was significantly different among those with no/mild,moderate,and severe pain as identified by pain interference (P = .002) and pain behavior domains (P = .0113). We identified T-scores for PROMIS pain domains that facilitate clinical interpretation and provide necessary information for PROMIS users in a clinical setting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,33093353	Complications of Central Venous Access Devices in Patients With Sickle Cell Disease and Thalassemia Major. Pediatric patients with sickle cell disease and thalassemia major present clinical characteristics that could lead to a higher incidence of central venous access devices-associated complications (CVAD-C). With the objective of analyzing the safety of the use of CVAD in these patients,a retrospective review including all pediatric patients with these pathologies who required the implantation of a CVAD between 2004 and 2019 was performed. In all,54 patients with 100 CVAD (65 totally implantable venous access port with subcutaneous reservoir,35 single-lumen or double-lumen partially tunneled catheter) were included. During 60,410 days at risk of suffering a CVAD-C,55 complications (complication rate [CR]/1000 catheter-days at risk=0.91) were reported in 46 CVAD: 19 mechanicals (CR=0.32),32 infectious (CR=0.53),and 4 thrombotic complications (CR=0.066). Incidence of mechanical and infectious complications was significantly higher in double-lumen partially tunneled catheter than in totally implantable venous access port with subcutaneous reservoir (P<0.001). Lower age at insertion was related with a higher incidence of any complication (odds ratio=0.88/y,P=0.02). Patients who required a stem cell transplantation (31 patients and 65 CVAD) had no significant higher incidences of CVAD-C. In conclusion,our study supports the safety of using CVAD in these patients,with a low incidence of infectious,thrombotic,and mechanical complications.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,33075179	Randomized control trial of oral arginine therapy for children with sickle cell anemia hospitalized for pain in Nigeria. Low arginine bioavailability is associated with vaso-occlusive painful crisis (VOC) severity in sickle cell anemia (SCA) and predicts need for pediatric hospitalization. Intravenous arginine therapy has opioid-sparing effects and was found to significantly decrease pain scores in children hospitalized with SCA-VOC in a phase-two randomized placebo-controlled trial (RCT). Efficacy of oral arginine is unknown. Our objective was to determine the safety and efficacy of oral arginine therapy in Nigerian children with SCA. A double-blind RCT of oral L-arginine-hydrochloride (100 mg/kg TID) was conducted in children with SCA-VOC,aged 5-17 years,hospitalized at two Nigerian sites. The primary outcome measure was analgesic usage,quantified by difference in the mean Analgesic Medication Quantification Scale (MQS). Secondary outcomes included daily pain scores,time-to-crisis-resolution and length-of-hospital-stay. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed. Sixty-eight children (age 5-17 years,mean 10.6 +- 0.4 years; 56% male),were randomized to receive L-arginine (35 patients) or placebo (33 patients). The mean total MQS for the arginine group was 73.4 (95% CI,62.4-84.3) vs 120.0 (96.7-143.3) for placebo (P < .001). The mean rate of decline in worst pain scores was faster in the arginine arm vs placebo (1.50 [1.23-1.77] vs 1.09 [0.94-1.24] point/d,P = .009). Children receiving arginine had a shorter time-to-crisis-resolution (P = .02),shorter hospital-stay (P = .002) and experienced no serious adverse event. Pain control was more rapid,total analgesic requirement was significantly reduced,and most notably,time-to-crisis-resolution and length-of-hospital-stay were shorter in children with SCA-VOC receiving arginine vs placebo. Given the established safety and low cost,oral arginine is a promising adjuvant therapy for SCA-VOC management.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,32651584	Unrecognized Hemoglobin Variants in the Donor Blood Supply Are Detectable in the Transfused Population. OBJECTIVES: The US Food and Drug Administration requires donated blood to be tested for various infectious diseases to ensure safety and purity. However,testing for hemoglobin variants is not required,despite reported occurrences of hemoglobin variant transfusion and concerns about the safety of such transfusions. This study aimed to investigate the frequency of hemoglobin variants within the blood supply. METHODS: We performed a 2-part study. First,we tested all RBC units in our blood bank by high-performance liquid chromatography for the presence of hemoglobin variants. Second,we performed a retrospective analysis of hemoglobin variant testing completed for routine management of sickle cell disease patients at our institution over a 5-month period to identify cases of hemoglobin variant transfusion. RESULTS: We found that 2 of 476 (0.4%) RBC units in our blood bank contained a hemoglobin variant,and 5 of 563 (0.9%) sickle cell patients seen at our institution in a 5-month period were transfused with RBCs containing a hemoglobin variant. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that hemoglobin variants are present within the blood supply,and the frequency of hemoglobin variant transfusion is elevated for patients with sickle cell disease given the increased prevalence of hemoglobin variants in the population of matched donors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,38775255	Antioxidant supplementation for sickle cell disease. BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) refers to a group of genetic disorders characterized by the presence of an abnormal haemoglobin molecule called haemoglobin S (HbS). When subjected to oxidative stress from low oxygen concentrations,HbS molecules form rigid polymers,giving the red cell the typical sickle shape. Antioxidants have been shown to reduce oxidative stress and improve outcomes in other diseases associated with oxidative stress. Therefore,it is important to review and synthesize the available evidence on the effect of antioxidants on the clinical outcomes of people with SCD. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of antioxidant supplementation for improving health outcomes in people with SCD. SEARCH METHODS: We used standard,extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 15 August 2023. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing antioxidant supplementation to placebo,other antioxidants,or different doses of antioxidants,in people with SCD. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently extracted data,assessed the risk of bias and certainty of the evidence,and reported according to Cochrane methodological procedures. MAIN RESULTS: The review included 1609 participants in 26 studies,with 17 comparisons. We rated 13 studies as having a high risk of bias overall,and 13 studies as having an unclear risk of bias overall due to study limitations. We used GRADE to rate the certainty of evidence. Only eight studies reported on our important outcomes at six months. Vitamin C (1400 mg) plus vitamin E (800 mg) versus placebo Based on evidence from one study in 83 participants,vitamin C (1400 mg) plus vitamin E (800 mg) may not be better than placebo at reducing the frequency of crisis (risk ratio (RR) 1.18,95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 2.18),the severity of pain (RR 1.33,95% CI 0.40 to 4.37),or adverse effects (AE),of which the most common were headache,nausea,fatigue,diarrhoea,and epigastric pain (RR 0.56,95% CI 0.31 to 1.00). Vitamin C plus vitamin E may increase the risk of SCD-related complications (acute chest syndrome: RR 2.66,95% CI 0.77 to 9.13; 1 study,83 participants),and increase haemoglobin level (median (interquartile range) 90 (81 to 96) g/L versus 93.5 (84 to 105) g/L) (1 study,83 participants) compared to placebo. However,the evidence for all the above effects is very uncertain. The study did not report on quality of life (QoL) of participants and their caregivers,nor on frequency of hospitalization. Zinc versus placebo Zinc may not be better than placebo at reducing the frequency of crisis at six months (rate ratio 0.62,95% CI 0.17 to 2.29; 1 study,36 participants; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether zinc is better than placebo at improving sickle cell-related complications (complete healing of leg ulcers at six months: RR 2.00,95% CI 0.60 to 6.72; 1 study,34 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Zinc may be better than placebo at increasing haemoglobin level (g/dL) (MD 1.26,95% CI 0.44 to 1.26; 1 study,36 participants; low-certainty evidence). The study did not report on severity of pain,QoL,AE,and frequency of hospitalization. N-acetylcysteine versus placebo N-acetylcysteine (NAC) 1200 mg may not be better than placebo at reducing the frequency of crisis in SCD,reported as pain days (rate ratio 0.99 days,95% CI 0.53 to 1.84; 1 study,96 participants; low-certainty evidence). Low-certainty evidence from one study (96 participants) suggests NAC (1200 mg) may not be better than placebo at reducing the severity of pain (MD 0.17,95% CI -0.53 to 0.87). Compared to placebo,NAC (1200 mg) may not be better at improving physical QoL (MD -1.80,95% CI -5.01 to 1.41) and mental QoL (MD 2.00,95% CI -1.45 to 5.45; very low-certainty evidence),reducing the risk of adverse effects (gastrointestinal complaints,pruritus,or rash) (RR 0.92,95% CI 0.75 to 1.14; low-certainty evidence),reducing the frequency of hospitalizations (rate ratio 0.98,95% CI 0.41 to 2.38; low-certainty evidence),and sickle cell-related complications (RR 5.00,95% CI 0.25 to 101.48; very low-certainty evidence),or increasing haemoglobin level (MD -0.18 g/dL,95% CI -0.40 to 0.04; low-certainty evidence). L-arginine versus placebo L-arginine may not be better than placebo at reducing the frequency of crisis (monthly pain) (RR 0.71,95% CI 0.26 to 1.95; 1 study,50 participants; low-certainty evidence). However,L-arginine may be better than placebo at reducing the severity of pain (MD -1.41,95% CI -1.65 to -1.18; 2 studies,125 participants; low-certainty evidence). One participant allocated to L-arginine developed hives during infusion of L-arginine,another experienced acute clinical deterioration,and a participant in the placebo group had clinically relevant increases in liver function enzymes. The evidence is very uncertain whether L-arginine is better at reducing the mean number of days in hospital compared to placebo (MD -0.85 days,95% CI -1.87 to 0.17; 2 studies,125 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Also,L-arginine may not be better than placebo at increasing haemoglobin level (MD 0.4 g/dL,95% CI -0.50 to 1.3; 2 studies,106 participants; low-certainty evidence). No study in this comparison reported on QoL and sickle cell-related complications. Omega-3 versus placebo Very low-certainty evidence shows no evidence of a difference in the risk of adverse effects of omega-3 compared to placebo (RR 1.05,95% CI 0.74 to 1.48; 1 study,67 participants). Very low-certainty evidence suggests that omega-3 may not be better than placebo at increasing haemoglobin level (MD 0.36 g/L,95% CI -0.21 to 0.93; 1 study,67 participants). The study did not report on frequency of crisis,severity of pain,QoL,frequency of hospitalization,and sickle cell-related complications. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There was inconsistent evidence on all outcomes to draw conclusions on the beneficial and harmful effects of antioxidants. However,L-arginine may be better than placebo at reducing the severity of pain at six months,and zinc may be better than placebo at increasing haemoglobin level. We are uncertain whether other antioxidants are beneficial for SCD. Larger studies conducted on each comparison would reduce the current uncertainties.,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,38753737	Burden and outcome of respiratory morbidities among children and adolescents with sickle cell disease-A retrospective review of emergency presentations in some Nigerian tertiary institutions. BACKGROUND: Despite the huge burden of sickle cell disease (SCD) among Nigerian children,the burden and outcome of respiratory illnesses remain undocumented. Thus,we aimed to describe the spectrum and outcome of respiratory illnesses among SCD childrenand adolescentadmissions in ten Nigerian tertiary hospitals. METHOD: A retrospective review of the SCD admission records of children and adolescents with a confirmed diagnosis of respiratory illnesses from 2012 to 2021 in ten tertiary health facilities across five geopolitical zones in Nigeria was conducted. The data,collectedbetween March and June 2023,included the age,sex,diagnosis,complications,duration and outcome of hospitalization. RESULTS: Of the 72,333 paediatric admissions,$7.00,256 (10.0%) had SCD; the proportion of SCD from the total admission ranged from 2.1 to 16.3% in the facilities. Of the 7,256 children and adolescents with SCD,$1.00,213 (16.7%) had respiratory morbidities. Lower respiratory disease was the most common (70.0%) respiratory entity and the majority were pneumonia (40.1.0%),followed by acute chest syndrome (26.7%). Seventeen (1.4%) patients died; all had lower respiratory diseases [(acute chest syndrome ACS (11,64.7%),pneumonia; 5,$0.29,and asthma (1,5.9%). Based on the proportion of deaths among overall SCD,the 17 death cases contributed 9.4% (95% CI 5.9 to 14.5). Factors associated with deaths included duration of hospitalization less than 72 hours and lower respiratory tract diseases. CONCLUSION: Sickle cell disease is a major contributor to hospitalization among Nigerian children and adolescents,with high respiratory morbidity and mortality. Pneumonia and acute chest syndrome were associated with mortality,andthe highest risk of death within the first 72 hours.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,34419981	Core Decompression and Bone Marrow Aspirate Concentrate in the Treatment of Femoral Head Avascular Necrosis in Pediatric Sickle Cell Disease: Can We Improve Natural History? INTRODUCTION: Femoral head avascular necrosis (AVN) affects between 10% and 41% of children with sickle cell disease (SCD),resulting in the development of proximal femoral deformity and residual hip pain in the majority of patients without treatment. There have been multiple adult studies published on the outcomes of core decompression with and without the use of bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) injection both in idiopathic and SCD-related AVN with promising results,however,few studies have reported on outcomes in skeletally immature patients. PURPOSE: This study sought to report on a single surgeon's outcomes for core decompression with BMAC injection in pediatric patients with AVN of the femoral head secondary to underlying SCD. METHODS: A single-center,retrospective review was performed for pediatric patients undergoing core decompression with BMAC injection for femoral head AVN in patients with SCD with a minimum of 12-month follow-up. Demographic,radiographic,and clinical variable were collected. Patients were subdivided based upon presence of open femoral physes at the time of surgery. Successful treatment was defined as the ability to return to activities without limitations. RESULTS: A total of 13 patients (average age 14.1+-2.8 y,84.6% male,6 skeletally immature and 7 skeletally mature) with 18 affected extremities were identified. Open physes were present in 50% of operative extremities. Skeletally immature patient demonstrated reconstitution of the femoral head in 78% of cases and 89% demonstrated regression of at least 1 Steinberg grade and none had progression. Skeletally immature patients were significantly more likely to return to activities (100% vs. 55.6%,P=0.023) and achieve a final Tonnis grade <2 (89% vs. 44%,P=0.046). CONCLUSION: Core decompression appears to alter the natural history of AVN in skeletally immature patients with SCD. Skeletal immaturity was a positive prognostic factor for the ability to return to activities without pain and achieve a lower Tonnis grade at final follow-up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,36413684	Pregnancy and sickle cell disease: an overview of complications and suggested perinatal care. INTRODUCTION: Pregnancy in women with sickle cell disease (SCD) has been identified as high risk owing to increased incidence of materno-fetal complications across various studies and reports. These complications include consequences related to the underlying hemoglobinopathy; chronic anemia/associated inflammation,and pregnancy related including the risk for thromboembolism,bleeding and maternal mortality. Outcomes of neonates born to women with SCD has been suboptimal over the years with recent improvement due to strict monitoring,preventive and therapeutic measures. Much is yet to be unraveled regarding the optimal management of women with SCD during pregnancy,identifying target hemoglobin,delivery mode or timing among others. AREAS COVERED: This review includes a summary of available data of the maternal and fetal outcomes; in addition to current recommendations for monitoring and management of women with SCD during pregnancy. EXPERT OPINION: To have a successful pregnancy,women should be closely monitored,and interventions provided as needed to guarantee adequate management of anemia,as well as prevention,diagnosis and management of disease. They should also be educated regarding their reproductive health,emphasizing that pregnancy is possible,and achieving optimal results depends on providing adequate care in a health care facility with expertise in high-risk pregnancies and SCD.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,31990287	Pathologic angiogenesis in the bone marrow of humanized sickle cell mice is reversed by blood transfusion. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a monogenic red blood cell (RBC) disorder with high morbidity and mortality. Here,we report,for the first time,the impact of SCD on the bone marrow (BM) vascular niche,which is critical for hematopoiesis. In SCD mice,we find a disorganized and structurally abnormal BM vascular network of increased numbers of highly tortuous arterioles occupying the majority of the BM cavity,as well as fragmented sinusoidal vessels filled with aggregates of erythroid and myeloid cells. By in vivo imaging,sickle and control RBCs have significantly slow intravascular flow speeds in sickle cell BM but not in control BM. In sickle cell BM,we find increased reactive oxygen species production in expanded erythroblast populations and elevated levels of HIF-1alpha. The SCD BM exudate exhibits increased levels of proangiogenic growth factors and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. Transplantation of SCD mouse BM cells into wild-type mice recapitulates the SCD vascular phenotype. Our data provide a model of SCD BM,in which slow RBC flow and vaso-occlusions further diminish local oxygen availability in the physiologic hypoxic BM cavity. These events trigger a milieu that is conducive to aberrant vessel growth. The distorted neovascular network is completely reversed by a 6-week blood transfusion regimen targeting hemoglobin S to <30%,highlighting the plasticity of the vascular niche. A better insight into the BM microenvironments in SCD might provide opportunities to optimize approaches toward efficient and long-term hematopoietic engraftment in the context of curative therapies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,34420880	Alloimmunization in transfused patients with constitutional anemias in Norway. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The status of red blood cell alloimmunization in patients with constitutional anemias including hemoglobinopathies is not known in Norway. The study objective was to investigate the impact of a strategy based on phenotype-matching for C,c,E,e,K,Jka,Jkb,Fya,Fyb,S and s on alloimmunization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed transfusions of 40 patients retrospectively using the computerized blood bank management system and medical records; including diagnosis,age at start of transfusion therapy,gender,number and age of packed red blood cell units transfused,follow-up time,phenotypes of the donors and patients,antigen-negative patients exposed to antigen-positive packed red blood cell units,transfusion reactions and alloantibody specificities. RESULTS: Forty patients received 5402 packed red blood cell units. Alloimmunization frequency was 20 % for the whole group,being 7%,25 % and 30 % in patients with sickle cell disease (n = 14),thalassemia (n = 16) and other conditions (n = 10),respectively. The alloantibodies detected were anti-E,-c,-C,-Cw,-K,-Jka and -Lua. CONCLUSION: Good communication between the clinicians and the transfusion services is essential for successful management of patients with constitutional anemias. Providing full phenotype-matched units was not always possible. Extended pheno-/genotyping before the first transfusion and providing antigen-negative units for antigen-negative patients for at least C,c,E and K in every red cell transfusion would probably have reduced the alloimmunization rate. Non-phenotype-matched transfusions seem to be the main reason for alloimmunization. Finding markers for identifying responders prone to alloimmunization will ensure targeted transfusion strategies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,29693782	Access to hematopoietic stem cell transplant for patients with sickle cell anemia. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a curative therapy for patients with phenotypically severe sickle cell anemia,and survival rates following matched-sibling HSCT are very high. However,despite cure rates much higher than HSCT for malignant diseases,the field has been slow to adopt this treatment modality for sickle cell anemia. This article explores some of the social forces that may contribute to this dichotomy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,34419651	Increased Rates of Rhabdomyolysis in Male Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Recipients Taking Sirolimus and Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole. Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) offers long-term cure against early morbidity and mortality of hemoglobinopathies,such as sickle cell disease (SCD) and beta-thalassemia. Following HCT,sirolimus is an immunosuppressant used to prevent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) while receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis and other antimicrobial agents (including acyclovir). One rare adverse event associated with both drugs is rhabdomyolysis,defined as creatine kinase (CK) elevation at least 5 to 10 times the upper limit of normal. This study was conducted to evaluate the rate of and risk factors for developing rhabdomyolysis in the post-HCT setting. Across 4 haploidentical and matched related donor (MRD) nonmyeloablative protocols,CK levels were prospectively monitored and patients were retrospectively identified for rhabdomyolysis. The rhabdomyolysis was graded based on the severity of CK elevation and other organ injury. At diagnosis,patients were queried for concurrent medication use (ie,sirolimus,TMP-SMX,acyclovir,or statins),sex,age,donor genotype,and time from transplantation. Among 127 patients with mostly SCD,rhabdomyolysis occurred in 22 (17%),including 2 recipients of haploidentical donor HCT and 20 recipients of MRD HCT. The time to the development of rhabdomyolysis was 61 and 73 days for the 2 recipients of haploidentical HCT and a median of 73 days for the MRD HCT recipients. Among the 22 patients who developed rhabdomyolysis,20 (91%) were receiving sirolimus (2 haploidentical HCT recipients and 18 MRD HCT recipients),and 14 (64%) were also receiving TMP-SMX (all in the MRD HCT group). Seventy-five percent of the haploidentical donors and 69% of the MRDs had sickle cell trait. All but 2 patients with rhabdomyolysis were male. No patients who developed rhabdomyolysis were receiving statins at any point. Higher-than-expected rates of rhabdomyolysis were found post-transplantation for patients with SCD and beta-thalassemia. Contributing risk factors included immunosuppression with sirolimus,TMP-SMX,male sex,and sickle trait donor. These factors differ from the excessive muscle strain or injury,seizures,infections,or HMG-CoA inhibitors typically identified in non-HCT recipients.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,30403414	How we evaluate red blood cell compatibility and transfusion support for patients with sickle cell disease undergoing hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation. Multiple hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) transplantation options for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are currently under investigation. Patients with SCD have a high rate of alloimmunization to red blood cell antigens,often complicating transfusion support. Transfusion reactions,including acute and delayed hemolytic reactions,have been observed despite immunosuppressive regimens. Allogeneic donor transplants have been shown to carry a risk of prolonged reticulocytopenia and acute hemolysis with severe anemia in nonmyeloablative regimens. We discuss our experience providing transfusion support to patients with SCD undergoing HPC transplantation,propose an outline for a complete pretransplantation evaluation,and discuss donor/recipient compatibility issues and their implications.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,"30387290	""Pediatric residents' perceived barriers to opioid use in sickle cell disease pain management. OBJECTIVE: Current guidelines recommend high-priority treatment of severe sickle cell disease (SCD) pain with opioids; however",patients with SCD have historically been undertreated. We used mixed methods to assess pediatric residents' perceptions toward opioid use in SCD pain management. METHODS: We distributed a survey to 88 residents at an urban pediatric medical center in a cross-sectional study. Participants responded to questions about perceived barriers to acute SCD pain management and attitudes toward patients with SCD. Responses were examined using bivariate analyses. Five pediatric residents were interviewed,"to provide more in-depth understanding of barriers to SCD pain management. RESULTS: Fifty-three residents (60%) completed the survey. Participants were divided into """"more experienced"""" (had seen >= 21 patients with SCD; 45.3%) or """"less experienced."""" Both groups reported potential for tolerance and dependence as major barriers to opioid use in SCD. Less experienced residents reported a greater need for additional training in SCD pain management (P < 0.05)",more concern about addiction,"and greater empathy for patients with SCD (P < 0.05). Both groups agreed that patients with SCD were """"frustrating to care for."""" Thematic analysis revealed that increased patient and provider barriers led to distrust",ultimately leading to undertreatment of pain and inadequate care. CONCLUSION: Although more experienced residents reported feeling more comfortable treating acute SCD pain and were less concerned with addiction compared with less experienced residents,"certain negative views of patients with SCD were prevalent among all residents. Findings suggest that residency training must address provider attitudes as well as knowledge about SCD.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,29196076	Experiences and Decision Making in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant in Sickle Cell Disease: Patients' and Caregivers' Perspectives. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most commonly inherited hemoglobin disorders that has a significant impact on quality of life,increased childhood morbidity,and premature mortality. Currently,hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is the only treatment with a curative intent. The objective of this study was to determine patients' and caregivers' knowledge of HSCT,the factors influencing the decision to pursue HSCT,their experiences,and the impact of a successful HSCT on their daily living. At Children's Healthcare of Atlanta,we conducted a qualitative study using a semistructured interview guide of patient-caregiver dyads and 2 focus-group sessions of adult long-term survivors of HSCT to elicit key factors in decision making,their experiences with HSCT,and the impact of HSCT. Interviews and focus-group sessions were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were coded and analyzed for emerging themes using NVivo 10.0. We enrolled 11 patient-caregiver dyads (n = 6,female patients; n = 10,mothers) in the qualitative interviews and 2 focus groups with 5 (n = 2,females) and 7 (n = 3,females) participants in each group,respectively. Our analysis revealed 3 prominent themes: (1) factors and concerns influencing HSCT decision making; (2) HSCT experiences; and (3) impact of HSCT on daily life. Participants reported that progression of disease-related complications and availability of a matched donor strongly influenced the decision to pursue HSCT. Although patients and caregivers had to deal with the arduous process of HSCT and transplant-related morbidities,participants were satisfied with their decision and expressed no decisional regrets. Decision making for HSCT for patients with SCD is a complex process. Understanding the key influential factors in decision making and the impact HSCT has on these patients and their families will generate crucial insights that can guide the care of future patients and research studies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE DESCRIPTION: We present two cases of sickle cell disease variants (haemoglobinopathies),from unrelated families,in the state of Balochistan (Pakistan). One was diagnosed with sickle cell disease in the haemoglobin electrophoresis,whereas the other was diagnosed with sickle cell SE disease. Both were diagnosed based on the presentation of osteomyelitis. COMMENTS: Haemoglobin SD disease (Hb SD) and haemoglobin SE disease (Hb SE) are rare haemoglobinopathies in the world. The lack of available literature suggests that both are variants of sickle cell disease (SCD),with heterogeneous nature. The prevalence of sickle cell disease with compound heterozygotes was found at a variable frequency in the population of the Asian Southeast. The frequency of osteomyelitis in SCD is 12 to 18%,but its occurrence among variant haemoglobinopathies is little reported. Both reported cases presented with osteomyelitis as a characteristic of the disease presentation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,31891655	Assessment of health-related quality of life among adults hospitalized with sickle cell disease vaso-occlusive crisis. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by painful vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs). Self-reported pain intensity is often assessed with the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS),whereas newer patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) assess multidimensional pain in SCD. We describe pain experiences among hospitalized adults with VOCs,using 2 PROMs: the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Global Health and the Adult Sickle Cell Quality of Life Measurement System (ASCQ-Me). Adults with SCD hospitalized with VOCs at 2 academic centers in Boston,Massachusetts,from April 2016 to October 2017 were eligible. Participants completed the NRS and PROMs at admission and 7 days postdischarge. PROM scores were described and compared with population norms. Length of stay (LOS) and 30-day readmission rates were assessed. Forty-two (96%) of 44 eligible patients consented and completed admission assessments. Mean age was 30.2 years (standard deviation,9.1),60% were women,76% were non-Hispanic black,and 64% had hemoglobin SS. Twenty-seven participants (64%) completed postdischarge assessments. Sixty percent had >=4 VOCs in the last year. Nearly all PROMIS Global Health and ASCQ-Me scores were worse than population norms. NRS and PROMIS Global Physical Health scores improved after discharge,the latter driven principally by improvements in pain. Overall median LOS was 7 days,and 30-day readmission rate was 40.5%. Administration of PROMs among adults with SCD hospitalized for VOCs is feasible and demonstrates participants experienced recurrent,prolonged,and severe VOCs. PROMIS Global and ASCQ-Me scores indicated substantial suffering,and the striking 30-day readmission rate highlights the vulnerability of these patients.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,34846319	Breaking the Cycle: Care Coordination Interventions and Sickle Cell Readmissions. PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: Approximately 100,000 people in the United States are affected by sickle cell disease (SCD). Sickle cell disease represents one of the highest readmitting diagnoses at this organization. The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of implementing care coordination interventions to reduce hospital readmissions of patients with SCD. PRIMARY PRACTICE SETTING: The setting for conducting the interventions took place at the flagship hospital of a seven hospital system in Houston,TX. The hospital is a not-for-profit,faith-based,907-bed academic facility that provides highly specialized health services to the community and the world. The population of focus was adult patients (18 years of age and older) admitted to the hospital with a primary diagnosis of SCD. FINDINGS/CONCLUSION: Two interventions were implemented: Disease-specific discharge education and scheduling postdischarge follow-up appointments prior to discharge. These interventions were conducted by bedside nurses,case managers,and SCD champions over a 6-month period. The 30-day readmission rate for SCD was reduced by 22%. There was also a 0.9-day reduction in length of stay and a 17% reduction in emergency,observation,and inpatient encounters of patients with SCD. IMPLICATIONS FOR CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES: This project found that implementing evidence-based care coordination interventions can reduce the 30-day readmission rate for patients with SCD. Implementation of effective evidence-based care coordination is a key aspect to reducing hospital readmissions of patients with SCD. Partnering with community networks is also important in addressing readmission risk factors including management of social determinants of health that increase hospital visits. Consistent,patient-centered education using simple and convenient tools helps improve understanding,applicability,and self-care management.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,35177777	A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial of oral hydroxyurea for transfusion-dependent beta-thalassaemia. Hydroxyurea is an antimetabolite drug that induces fetal haemoglobin in sickle cell disease. However,its clinical usefulness in beta-thalassaemia is unproven. We conducted a randomised,double-blind,placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hydroxyurea in transfusion-dependent beta-thalassaemia. Sixty patients were assigned 1:1 to oral hydroxyurea 10-20 mg/kg/day or placebo for 6 months by stratified block randomisation. Hydroxyurea treatment did not alter the blood transfusion volume overall. However,a significantly higher proportion of patients on hydroxyurea showed increases in fetal haemoglobin percentage (89% vs. 59%; p < 0.05) and reductions in erythropoietic stress as measured by soluble transferrin receptor concentration (79% vs. 40%; p < 0.05). Based on fetal haemoglobin induction (> 1.5%),44% of patients were identified as hydroxyurea-responders. Hydroxyurea-responders,required significantly lower blood volume (77 +- SD27ml/kg) compared to hydroxyurea-non-responders (108 +- SD24ml/kg; p < 0.01) and placebo-receivers (102 +- 28ml/kg; p < 0.05). Response to hydroxyurea was significantly higher in patients with HbE beta-thalassaemia genotype (50% vs. 0%; p < 0.01) and Xmn1 polymorphism of the gamma-globin gene (67% vs. 27%; p < 0.05). We conclude that oral hydroxyurea increased fetal haemoglobin percentage and reduced erythropoietic stress of ineffective erythropoiesis in patients with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassaemia. Hydroxyurea reduced the transfusion burden in approximately 40% of patients. Response to hydroxyurea was higher in patients with HbE beta-thalassaemia genotype and Xmn1 polymorphism of the gamma-globin gene.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,"38012299	""Looking ahead: ethical and social challenges of somatic gene therapy for sickle cell disease in Africa. Somatic gene therapy will be one of the most exciting practices of genetic medicine in Africa and is primed to offer a """"new life"""" for persons living with sickle cell disease (SCD). Recently",successful gene therapy trials for SCD in the USA have sparked a ray of hope within the SCD community in Africa. However,the high cost,estimated to exceed 1.5 million USD,continues to be a major concern for many stakeholders. While affordability is a key global health equity consideration,it is equally important to reflect on other ethical,legal and social issues (ELSIs) that may impact the responsible implementation of gene therapy for SCD in Africa. These include informed consent comprehension,risk of therapeutic misestimation and optimistic bias; priorities for SCD therapy trials; dearth of ethical and regulatory oversight for gene therapy in many African countries; identifying a favourable risk-benefit ratio; criteria for the selection of trial participants; decisional conflict in consent; standards of care; bounded justice; and genetic tourism. Given these ELSIs,we suggest that researchers,pharma,funders,global health agencies,ethics committees,science councils and SCD patient support/advocacy groups should work together to co-develop: (1) patient-centric governance for gene therapy in Africa,(2) public engagement and education materials,and (3) decision making toolkits for trial participants. It is also critical to establish harmonised ethical and regulatory frameworks for gene therapy in Africa,and for global health agencies to accelerate access to basic care for SCD in Africa,"while simultaneously strengthening capacity for gene therapy.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,32267841	Influence of sickle cell disease on susceptibility to HIV infection. People with sickle cell disease (SCD) are reported to have low rates of HIV infection,slower progression to AIDS and lower HIV-associated mortality compared to the general population. Mechanisms of potential resistance to HIV in SCD are incompletely understood. We retrospectively reviewed the Transfusion Safety Study to compare HIV status between people with SCD and other congenital anemias who were routinely exposed to blood products during the high-risk period before HIV screening implementation. Non-SCD congenital anemia diagnosis was associated with a higher risk of HIV acquisition compared to SCD (OR 13.1 95%CI 1.6-108.9). In addition,we prospectively enrolled 30 SCD cases and 30 non-SCD controls to investigate potential mechanisms of resistance to HIV in SCD. CCR5 and CCR7 expression was lower and CD4 expression was higher on CD4+ T cells from SCD cases compared to controls. Surface expression of CD4+ T cell CXCR4,CD38 and HLA-DR did not differ between the groups. SCD CD4+ T cells were not less susceptible to HIV infection than controls. Levels of multiple cytokines were elevated in the SCD plasma,but SCD plasma compared to control plasma did not inhibit HIV infection of target cells. In conclusion,our epidemiological data support people with SCD being resistant to HIV infection. Potential mechanisms include lower CD4+ T cell expression of CCR5 and CCR7,balanced by increased CD4 expression and cytokine levels,which did not result in in vitro resistance to HIV infection. Further study is needed to define the risk and pathophysiology of HIV in persons with SCD.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,32171610	Longitudinal Relationships Between Depression and Chronic Illness in Adolescents: An Integrative Review. INTRODUCTION: Depression is prevalent among adolescents with chronic illness. However,little is known about how depression affects chronic illness over time. This review aimed to synthesize longitudinal relationships between depression and disease control,self-management behaviors,illness-related morbidity,and quality of life. METHOD: Four databases were searched,including PubMed,Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature,PsycINFO,and EMBASE. Inclusion criteria were cohort studies examining depression among adolescents aged 10-21 years with a chronic illness and studies published in English. Study quality was appraised using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale and data was synthesized by the outcome. RESULTS: Of the 3,463 articles identified,11 were included in the review. For adolescents with diabetes,increased depressive symptoms predicted decreased metabolic control and monitoring,medication adherence,quality of life,and increased hospitalization. Studies on cystic fibrosis,congenital heart disease,sickle cell disease,and juvenile idiopathic arthritis were limited but demonstrated that depressive symptoms affected the quality of life,disability,pain,and hospitalization rates/costs. DISCUSSION: Evidence supports the need for mental health care strategies suitable for adolescents with chronic illness. Future research is needed to examine the effects of depressive symptoms across diversified chronic illness populations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,29666675	Transfusion in Haemoglobinopathies: Review and recommendations for local blood banks and transfusion services in Oman. Sickle cell disease and homozygous beta-thalassaemia are common haemoglobinopathies in Oman,with many implications for local healthcare services. The transfusions of such patients take place in many hospitals throughout the country. Indications for blood transfusions require local recommendations and guidelines to ensure standardised levels of care. This article summarises existing transfusion guidelines for this group of patients and provides recommendations for blood banks and transfusion services in Oman.

NEGATIVE,36510904	Impact of hydroxyurea on hospital stay & analgesic utilization in sickle cell anaemia with vaso-occlusive crises. Background & objectives: Hydroxyurea (HU) has been useful in preventing sickle cell vaso-occlusive crises (VOC). A few studies also suggest utility of HU,during acute VOC. Sickle cell anaemia (SCA) is of high prevalence in western districts of Odisha State,India,and VOC is a common presentation,despite being mostly of Arab-Indian haplotype. This study was undertaken to evaluate the impact of HU on hospital stay and analgesic utilization in acute painful VOC of SCA. Methods: Homozygous sickle cell disease (HbSS) patients were categorized as cases who were receiving low-dose HU (10 mg/kg/day) and patients who were not on HU were considered as control. Days of hospital stay,analgesic utilization and visual analogue scale (VAS) score in patients were compared with that of control. Analgesics used to control pain were tramadol hydrochloride,ketorolac and diclofenac. Results: A total of 359 homozygous sickle cell disease (SCD) patients with VOC were studied (187 patients and 172 controls). The patient group had lesser mean days of hospital stay (1.4 days less than controls,P<0.001) and required lesser days of analgesic utilization than controls (1.18 days less than controls,P<0.001). Significant differences were observed between patients and controls concerning VAS score and amount of tramadol hydrochloride,ketorolac and diclofenac utilization (P<0.05). Interpretation & conclusions: In this study,HU was found to have beneficial effects in acute VOC of homozygous SCD,which includes shortening the duration of hospital stay and reducing the net amount of analgesic utilization during hospitalization.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,33026052	Outcomes of multidisciplinary team interventions in the management of sickle cell disease patients with opioid use disorders. A retrospective cohort study. OBJECTIVES: To identify the magnitude of opioid use disorder (OUD) among sickle cell disease (SCD) patients; emphasize on multidisciplinary team (MDT) role; estimate cost-effectiveness following the proper use of therapeutic guidelines; and facilitate the reduction of emergency room (ER) visits and the length of stay (LOS). METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included SCD patients aged 14 years and above,who have OUD. Data was collected between January 2016 and December 2018. Data included ER visits,hospital LOS,opioid consumption,and narcotic prescription tracking. The target group was followed with a set of interventions for pain management and healthcare resource utilization. Results: Twenty one SCD patients were identified with OUD. Following the interventions,there was a statistically significant decrease in ER visits of these OUD patients (from 8709 visits in 2016 to only 94 in 2018). Morphine consumption decreased by 82% and meperidine by 60%,over the 3-year period. Moreover,there was a huge reduction in both ER and LOS costs for this cohort of patients. CONCLUSION: Establishing an MDT and a series of interventions for SCD patients with OUD,including educational activities for caregivers and patients; establishing a palliative/pain clinic and a SCD addiction clinic; and implementing an adequate opioid prescription tracking system resulted in a significant reduction in both the cost and number of ER visits and hospital LOS and dramatically decreased opioid consumption.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,33519708	Consequences of beta-Thalassemia or Sickle Cell Disease for Ovarian Follicle Number and Morphology in Girls Who Had Ovarian Tissue Cryopreserved. Women with beta-thalassemia (BT) and sickle cell disease (SCD) have a high risk of infertility and premature ovarian insufficiency. Different fertility preserving strategies,including ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTC) and oocyte cryopreservation has been considered,and healthy babies have been born after successful OTC and transplantation. We evaluated follicle number and follicle health in ovarian tissue from a cohort of BT and SCD patients who underwent OTC before the age of 18 years. Patients undergoing OTC from 2002 to 2019 were included. A total of 14 girls and adolescents with BT and four with SCD,aged 2.8-17.4 years at OTC were included together with a reference group of 43 girls and adolescents with non-anemia diseases considered to have normal ovaries aged 0.6-17.9 years at OTC. Ovarian follicle density was measured in cortex biopsies and compared to the reference group. Expression of proteins associated with follicular health was evaluated using immunohistochemistry. Follicles were detected in the ovarian cortex biopsies from all patients with BT and SCD. The follicle densities were within the 95% prediction interval of the reference group in all cases. A similar expression of six proteins essential for follicular health was detected using immunohistochemistry in BT,SCD,and references. OTC should be considered an option for young girls and adolescents with BT and SCD.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,37158403	Impact of prenatal corticosteroid therapy on sickle cell disease in pregnant women. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate safety of prenatal corticosteroids in pregnancies of women with sickle cell disease. METHODS: A multicenter observational study of patients with sickle cell disease,comparing vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) requiring hospital care between pregnancies with versus without prenatal corticosteroids. RESULTS: In 40 pregnancies exposed to prenatal corticosteroids,compared with 370 unexposed pregnancies,VOC were not more frequent (62.5% vs 57.9%,P = 0.578) but they were more severe,with more intensive care hospitalizations (25.0% vs 12.9%,P = 0.039),emergency transfusions (44.7% vs 22.7%,P = 0.006),and acute chest syndromes (22.5% vs 8.9%,P = 0.010). These differences persisted after adjustment for severity and type of sickle cell syndrome (for intensive care admission adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.73,95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10-6.79,P = 0.031 and for acute chest syndrome aOR 4.15,95% CI 1.57-14.4,P = 0.008). VOC occurred on average 1.2 days following steroid administration. When comparing 36 patients receiving corticosteroids for fetal maturation with 58 patients who were hospitalized for obstetrical complications before 34 weeks of pregnancy but that did not receive corticosteroids,VOC incidence was not significantly higher (41.7% vs 31.5%,P = 0.323). CONCLUSION: The present study was the first to study the impact of prenatal corticosteroids on sickle cell disease. They were associated with more severe VOC,suggesting that steroids should be avoided in these women.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,30548773	Impact of erythrocytapheresis on natural anticoagulant levels in children with sickle cell disease: A pilot study. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is being increasingly recognized in children with sickle cell disease (SCD). In a retrospective cohort study,we identified bilateral central venous catheter (CVC) placement as an independent risk factor for VTE. At our institution,the only indication for bilateral CVC placement in children with SCD is erythrocytapheresis. To investigate the impact of erythrocytapheresis on coagulation,we measured levels of natural anticoagulants in 11 patients with SCD on chronic erythrocytapheresis,immediately before and after apheresis. We demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in most parameters. Additional studies are needed to further investigate the exact etiology and clinical impact of this acute decrease.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,33097032	Characterization of HIV risks in a Brazilian sickle cell disease population. BACKGROUND: A low prevalence of HIV in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients has been reported in the literature though mechanisms for this are not understood. METHODS: HIV risk behaviors were compared between SCD cases and non-SCD controls using a self-administered audio computer-assisted self-interview. SCD cases were recruited from a multi-center SCD cohort established in Brazil; controls were recruited from SCD social contacts. Categorical variables were analyzed using Chi-Square or Fisher exact test. Continuous variables were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: There were 152 SCD cases and 154 age/location matched controls enrolled at three participating Brazilian centers during 2016-17. No significant differences in number of sexual partners (lifetime or previous 12 months),male-to-male sex partners or intravenous drug use were observed. Cases received more transfusions,surgeries,and acupuncture treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Besides the risk of transfusion-transmitted HIV,which is now exceedingly rare,SCD and non-SCD participants demonstrated similar HIV risk behaviors. Causes other than risk behaviors such as factors inherent to SCD pathophysiology may explain the reported low prevalence of HIV in SCD.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,32034210	Epidemiology and Predictors of all-cause 30-Day readmission in patients with sickle cell crisis. The 30-day readmission rate after hospitalization for a sickle cell crisis (SCC) is extremely high. Accurate information on readmission diagnoses,total readmission costs and factors associated with readmission is required to effectively plan resource allocation and to plan interventions to reduce readmission rates. The present study aimed to examine readmission diagnoses and factors associated with all-cause 30-day readmission after hospitalization for SCC. We analyzed 2016 nationwide readmission database (NRD) to identify patterns of 30-day readmission by patient demographic characteristics and time after hospitalization for SCC. We estimated the percentage and most common readmission diagnoses for 30-day and 7-day readmissions after discharge. We studied the relationship between risk factors and readmission and the impact of readmission on patient outcomes and resulting financial burden on health care in dollars. In 2016,of 67,887 discharges after index hospitalizations,18099 (26.9%) were readmitted within 30-days. Of all readmissions,5166 (7.6%) were readmitted within 7 days. The spectrum of readmission diagnoses was largely similar in both 30-day and 7-day readmission with more than 80% patients in both time periods readmitted with diagnoses related to SCC. The mean length of stay for readmitted patients was significantly longer than the index hospitalization (5.3 days (5.1-5.5) vs 4.9 days (CI 4.8-5.1,p < 0.01). Also,the mean cost of hospitalization in readmitted patients $8485 was significantly higher than the index hospitalization $8064 p < 0.01. In 2016,readmission among patients with SCC incurred an additional 95,445 hospitalization days resulting a total charge of $609 million and a total cost of $152 million in the US. On Multivariate analysis,age group 18-30 years,discharge against medical advice,higher Charlson comorbidity index,low socioeconomic status and admission at high volume centers were associated with a higher likelihood of 30-day readmission. Among patients hospitalized for SCC,30-day readmissions were frequent throughout the month post hospitalization and resulted in an enormous financial burden on the United States healthcare system.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,29048550	Altered Neurophysiological Processing of Auditory Attention in Preschool Children With Sickle Cell Disease. Objective: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic red blood cell disorder that often leads to stroke and executive dysfunction in school-age children and adults. This study aimed to characterize the development of the neural correlates of selective attention,an early component of executive function,in preschool children with SCD. Methods: Auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded while children attended to a story stream in one ear and ignored a second story in the other ear interchangeably. In total,12 patients (mean age = 5.5,7 males) and 22 typically developing children (mean age = 4.4,10 males) were included in the final analyses. Results: By 100 ms,more positive ERP amplitudes were observed for attended relative to unattended stimuli in typically developing children but not those with SCD,suggesting deficits in the ability to focus attention. Reduced attention effects were associated with lower performance intellectual quotient. Conclusion: There are deficits in early attention modulation in young children with SCD.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,35836008	Phenotypes of sickle cell intensive care admissions: an unsupervised machine learning approach in a single-center retrospective cohort. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with multiple known complications and increased mortality. This study aims to further understand the profile of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions of SCD patients. In this single-center retrospective cohort (approval number 0926-11),we evaluated SCD-related ICU admissions at our hospital in Sao Paulo,Brazil. Admissions were clustered using clinical data and organ dysfunction at ICU admission. A hierarchical clustering method was used to distinguish phenotypes. From 140 admissions obtained,125 were included. The mean age was 30 years,48% were male,and SS genotype was predominant (71.2%). Non-surgical causes of admissions accounted for 85.6% (n = 107). The mean Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (SOFA) was 4 (IQR 2-7). Vasopressors were required by 12% and mechanical ventilation by 17.6%. After analysis of the average silhouette width,the optimal number of clusters was 3: cluster 1 (n = 69),cluster 2 (n = 25),cluster 3 (n = 31). Cluster 1 had a mean age of 29 years,87% of SS genotype,and mean SOFA of 4. Cluster 2 had a mean age of 37 years,80% of SS genotype,and mean SOFA of 8. Cluster 3 had a mean age of 26 years,29% of SS genotype,and mean SOFA of 3. The need for mechanical ventilation was 11.6%,$0.44,and 9.7%,respectively. Mortality was significantly higher in cluster 2 (44%,p = 0.012). This cohort of critical SCD admissions suggested the presence of three different profiles. This can be informative in the ICU setting to identify SCD patients at higher risk of worse outcomes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,35456398	Vignette-Based Reflections to Inform Genetic Testing Policies in Living Kidney Donors. Family history of kidney disease increases risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in donors. Pre-donation genetic testing is recommended in evaluation guidelines and regulatory policy. Collaborating across several institutions,we describe cases to illustrate the utility as well as practical issues in incorporating genetic testing in transplant protocols. Case 1 is from 2009,before pervasive genetic testing. A healthy 27-year-old Caucasian male had an uneventful donor evaluation for his mother,who had early onset ESKD of unclear cause. He participated in paired-exchange kidney donation,but developed progressive kidney disease and gout over the next 10 years. A uromodulin gene mutation (NM_003361.3(UMOD):c.377 G>A p.C126Y) was detected and kidney biopsy showed tubulointerstitial kidney disease. The patient subsequently required kidney transplantation himself. Case 2 was a 36-year-old African American female who had an uneventful kidney donor evaluation. She underwent gene panel-based testing to rule out ApolipoproteinL1 risk variants,for which was negative. Incidentally,a sickle-cell trait (NM_000518.5(HBB):c.20A>T p.Glu7Val) was noted,and she was declined for kidney donation. This led to significant patient anguish. Case 3 was a 26-year-old Caucasian female who underwent panel-based testing because the potential recipient,her cousin,carried a variant of uncertain significance in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1-beta (HNF1B) gene. While the potential donor did not harbor this variant,she was found to have a likely pathogenic variant in complement factor I (NM_000204.4(CFI):c.1311dup:p.Asp438Argfs*8),precluding kidney donation. Our cases emphasize that while genetic testing can be invaluable in donor evaluation,transplant centers should utilize detailed informed consent,develop care pathways for secondary genetic findings,and share experience to develop best practices around genetic testing in donors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,35059711	Standardizing Opioid Prescribing in a Pediatric Hospital: A Quality Improvement Effort. BACKGROUND: Opioids are indicated for moderate-to-severe pain caused by trauma,ischemia,surgery,cancer and sickle cell disease,and vaso-occlusive episodes (SCD-VOC). There is only limited evidence regarding the appropriate number of doses to prescribe for specific indications. Therefore,we developed and implemented an opioid prescribing algorithm with dosing guidelines for specific procedures and conditions. We aimed to reach and sustain 90% compliance within 1 year of implementation. METHODS: We conducted this quality improvement effort at a pediatric academic quaternary care institution. In 2018,a multidisciplinary team identified the need for a standard approach to opioid prescribing. The algorithm guides prescribers to evaluate the medical history,physical examination,red flags,pain type,and to initiate opioid-sparing interventions before prescribing opioids. Opioid prescriptions written between January 2015 and September 2020 were included. Examples from 2 hospital departments will be highlighted. Control charts for compliance with guidelines and variability in the doses prescribed are presented for selected procedures and conditions. RESULTS: Over 5 years,83 037 opioid prescriptions in 53 804 unique patients were entered electronically. The encounters with >=1 opioid prescription decreased from 48% to 25% between 2015 and 2019. Compliance with the specific guidelines increased to ~85% for periacetabular osteotomies and SCD-VOC and close to 100% for anterior-cruciate ligament surgery. In all 3 procedures and conditions,variability in the number of doses prescribed decreased significantly. CONCLUSION: We developed an algorithm,guidelines,and a process for improvement. The number of opioid prescriptions and variability in opioid prescribing decreased. Future evaluation of specific initiatives within departments is needed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,31107563	A justice-based argument for including sickle cell disease in CRISPR/Cas9 clinical research. CRISPR/Cas9 is quickly becoming one of the most influential biotechnologies of the last five years. Clinical trials will soon be underway to test whether CRISPR/Cas9 can edit away the genetic mutations that cause sickle cell disease (SCD). This article will present the background of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and SCD,highlighting research that supports the application of CRISPR/Cas9 to SCD. While much has been written on why SCD is a good biological candidate for CRISPR/Cas9,less has been written on the ethical implications of including SCD in CRISPR/Cas9 research. This article will argue that there is a strong case in favor of including SCD. Three benefits are achieving distributive justice in research,continuing to repair the negative relationship between patients with SCD and the health-care system,and benefit-sharing for those who do not directly participate in CRISPR/Cas9 research. Opponents will argue that SCD is a risky candidate,that researchers will not find willing participants,and that the burden of SCD is low. Of this set of arguments,the first gives pause. However,on balance,the case in favor of including SCD in CRISPR/Cas9 research is stronger than the case against. Ultimately,this article will show that the historic and sociopolitical injustices that impede progress in treating and curing SCD can be alleviated through biotechnology.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the influence of climate on hospitalizations of sickle cell anemia (SCA) adults and children,we analyzed the health and meteorological parameters from a metropolis (1999-2018). 1462 hospitalizations were coded for SCA patients in crisis (M:F = 715:747) and 1354 hospitalizations for SCA patients without crisis (M:F = 698:656) [age = 22.9 vs 15.2 years and duration of hospitalization (DoH) = 5.7 vs 4.4 days,respectively,]. More hospitalizations were for adults than children in crisis,and for children than adults without crisis. More children and adults were hospitalized in winter andspring than in summer and autumn     Hospitalizations correlated positively with humidity (lag -5),maximum pressure (lag -2),mean pressure (lag -2),and thermal amplitude (lag -2),and negatively with maximum temperature (lag -3). DoH positively correlated with minimum temperature (lag -4). Understanding these complex associations would induce attitudinal/behavioral modifications among patients and their caregivers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,37391656	Sickle Cell Crises in Pregnancy: Fetal and Neonatal Implications. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited condition worldwide. In the United States,SCD affects 100,000 births every year,mostly persons of African descent. In SCD,red blood cells assume a sickle shape when deoxygenated. This leads to the occlusion of small blood vessels and decreased oxygenated blood flow,resulting in ischemic and thrombotic injury to various organs,which further leads to organ dysfunction. In pregnancy,patients with SCD are at an increased risk of vaso-occlusive crises,which further increases the risks of maternal,fetal,and neonatal morbidity and mortality.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,28060121	The Sickle beta-Thalassemia Phenotype. Sbeta-thalassemia (Sbeta-thal) is common among Gulf Arab patients with sickle cell disease,but the phenotype of this group had not been well-documented. We have studied a group of Kuwaiti patients and compared the phenotype in the homozygotes (SS) and Sbeta-thal patients. Complete blood count,hemoglobin quantitation,serum bilirubin,and lactate dehydrogenase were determined with standard techniques. The patients were screened for alpha-globin genotype. The Sbeta-thal patients were also screened for the HBG2 Xmn-1 polymorphism. beta-Thal mutations were determined by arrayed primer extension or direct sequencing. There were 70 SS and 32 Sbeta-thal patients with mean ages of 14.8+-5.9 and 14.2+-5.9 years,respectively. The Sbeta-thal patients had more frequent,severe pain episodes per year compared with the SS,while the patterns among Sbeta-thal and Sbeta-thal patients were not significantly different. There were no differences in the frequencies of acute chest syndrome,gallstones,and blood transfusion in the SS and Sbeta-thal patients. However,none of the Sbeta-thal patients had been transfused. Among the Sbeta-thal patients,25 had beta-thal and 7 had beta-thal mutations,the most common being cd39 (C T) and IVS-I-110 (G A),respectively. Sbeta-thal shows a severe phenotype in Kuwait,even among those with Sbeta-thal,in whom the IVS-I-110 (G A) mutation is predominant.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,36310401	Hypoxic storage of donor red cells preserves deformability after exposure to plasma from adults with sickle cell disease. BACKGROUND: Red cell (RBC) transfusions are beneficial for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD),but ex vivo studies suggest that inflamed plasma from patients with SCD during crises may damage these RBCs,diminishing their potential efficacy. The hypoxic storage of RBCs may improve transfusion efficacy by minimizing the storage lesion. We tested the hypotheses that (1) The donor RBCs exposed to the plasma of patients in crisis would have lower deformability and higher hemolysis than those exposed to non-crisis plasma,and (2) hypoxic storage,compared to standard storage,of donor RBCs could preserve deformability and reduce hemolysis. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: 18 SCD plasma samples from patients who had severe acute-phase symptoms (A-plasma; n = 9) or were at a steady-state (S = plasma; n = 9) were incubated with 16 RBC samples from eight units that were stored either under conventional(CRBC) or hypoxic(HRBC) conditions. Hemolysis and microcapillary deformability assays of these RBCs were analyzed using linear mixed-effect models after each sample was incubated in patient plasma overnight at 37 C RESULTS: Relative deformability was 0.036 higher (p < 0.0001) in HRBC pairs compared to CRBC pairs regardless of plasma type. Mean donor RBC hemolysis was 0.33% higher after incubation with A-plasma compared to S-plasma either with HRBC or CRBC (p = 0.04). HRBCs incubated with steady-state patient plasma demonstrated the highest deformability and lowest hemolysis. CONCLUSION: Hypoxic storage significantly influenced RBC deformability. Patient condition significantly influenced post-incubation hemolysis. Together,HRBCs in steady-state plasma maximized donor red cell ex vivo function and survival.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,28836806	The Kennedy Krieger Independence Scales-Sickle Cell Disease: Executive components of transition readiness. PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE: Youth with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at an increased risk for executive dysfunction and simultaneously have increased self-management needs compared to typical adolescents. This unique combination may contribute,in part,to difficulties during transition to young adulthood. Current measures assessing adaptive skills do not assess the executive components (e.g.,initiation,prospective memory) of SCD-related self-care tasks. Modeled on the KKIS-Spina Bifida (Jacobson et al.,2013),the Kennedy Krieger Independence Scales-Sickle Cell Disease (KKIS-SCD) is a new caregiver-report measure that assesses independence with self-management of SCD-specific demands as well as routine daily activities in adolescents with SCD. Research Method/Design: Thirty-three youth with SCD and their caregivers participated in this preliminary validation study examining the construct validity of the KKIS-SCD total and composite scores (Initiation of Routines,Prospective Memory) and exploring relationships of this measure with intellectual functioning,demographic factors,illness severity,and age. RESULTS: The KKIS-SCD exhibited generally good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = .733 to .803),and demonstrated evidence for construct and discriminant validity when compared to an existing measure of adaptive function. The KKIS-SCD was significantly associated with caregiver-report of executive behaviors but not with intellectual functioning,demographic factors,illness severity,or age. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS: Results provide preliminary support for the KKIS-SCD as a reliable and valid tool for the assessment of executive components of self-care management skills for youth with SCD. Identifying specific weaknesses in executive function related to self-care management skills might assist in guiding intervention and individualizing transition planning in these at-risk youth.

NEGATIVE,30658602	Risk factors for recurrent severe anemia among previously transfused children in Uganda: an age-matched case-control study. BACKGROUND: In resource-poor settings,transfused children often experience recurrence of severe anemia (SA) following discharge from hospital. This study determined the factors associated with recurrent severe anemia (RSA) among previously transfused Ugandan children aged less than 5 years. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted in five hospitals in Uganda from March 2017 to September 2018. We prospectively enrolled 196 hospitalised children who had been transfused for severe anemia 2 weeks to 6 months prior to enrollment. Of these,101 children (cases) were re-admitted with a hemoglobin [Hb] level of <=6 g/dL and required transfusion; and 95 children (age-matched controls) were admitted for other clinical illness with a Hb > 6 g/dL. Children known to have sickle cell anemia,cancer,or bleeding disorders were excluded. Clinical and laboratory evaluation were done. Conditional logistic regression adjusted for age,was used to determine factors associated with RSA. RESULTS: The median time (IQR) between the earlier transfusion and enrollment was 3.5 (1.9-5.7) months for cases,and was 5.0 (2.9-6.0) months for controls (p-value = 0.015). Risk factors (adjusted odds ratio,95% confidence interval,and significance) for development of RSA were: hemoglobinuria (36.33,2.19-600.66,p = 0.012); sickle cell anemia - newly diagnosed (20.26,2.33-176.37,p = 0.006); history of earlier previous transfusions (6.95,1.36-35.61,p = 0.020) and malaria infection (6.47,1.17-35.70,p = 0.032). CONCLUSION: Malaria chemoprevention,follow up visit for Hb check after discharge from hospital and sickle cell screening among previously transfused children represent practical strategies to prevent and identify children at risk for recurrent severe anemia. The cause of hemoglobinuria in children merits further investigations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NEGATIVE,36485154	No crystal stair: supporting fertility care and the pursuit of pregnancy in women with sickle cell disease. Growing recognition that the ovary is an end organ in sickle cell disease (SCD),advances in SCD treatment and cure,and innovations in assisted reproductive technologies invite progressive challenges in fertility care for women with SCD. The reproductive life span of women with SCD may be reduced because ovarian reserve declines more rapidly in people with SCD compared to unaffected people. Some young women have diminished ovarian reserve,a risk factor for infertility. Referrals for fertility preservation may be offered and anticipatory guidance about when to seek infertility care provided. For a subset of people with SCD,this information is also applicable when pursuing in vitro fertilization with preimplantation genetic testing to avoid implantation of an embryo with SCD. Here we explore the dimensions of SCD-related fertility care illustrated by the case of a 28-year-old woman with hemoglobin SS disease who initially presented for a hematology consultation for preconception counseling. This case highlights the complexity of preconception SCD management and care and the need to partner with patients to help align pregnancy hopes with SCD treatment and the many associated uncertainties.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,31634463	Dysregulated NO/PDE5 signaling in the sickle cell mouse lower urinary tract: Reversal by oral nitrate therapy. AIMS: Nitric oxide (NO) has a critical,but not well understood,influence in the physiology of the lower urinary tract. We evaluated the effect of NO/phosphodiesterase (PDE)5 signaling in voiding dysfunction in the sickle cell disease (SCD) mouse,characterized by low NO bioavailability. MAIN METHODS: Adult SCD (Sickle) and wild-type (WT) male mice were treated daily with sodium nitrate (10 mM) or vehicle. After 18 days,blood was obtained for nitrite measurement,urethra was collected for organ bath study,and bladder and urethra were collected for Western blot analysis of PDE5 phosphorylation (Ser-92) (activated form). Non-anesthetized mice underwent evaluation of urine volume by void spot assay. eNOS phosphorylation (Ser-1177) and nNOS phosphorylation (Ser-1412) (positive regulatory sites) were evaluated in the bladder and urethra of untreated mice. KEY FINDINGS: Sickle mice exhibited decreased eNOS,nNOS,and PDE5 phosphorylation in the bladder and urethra,decreased plasma nitrite levels,increased relaxation of phenylephrine-contracted urethral tissue to an NO donor sodium nitroprusside,and increased total urine volume,compared with WT mice. Nitrate treatment normalized plasma nitrite levels,relaxation of urethra to sodium nitroprusside,PDE5 phosphorylation in the urethra and bladder,and urine volume in Sickle mice. SIGNIFICANCE: Derangement in PDE5 activity associated with basally low NO bioavailability in the bladder and urethra contributes to the molecular basis for voiding abnormalities in Sickle mice. Inorganic nitrate supplementation normalized voiding in Sickle mice through mechanisms likely involving upregulation of PDE5 activity. These findings suggest that interventions targeting dysregulatory NO/PDE5 signaling may ameliorate overactive bladder in SCD.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,37340519	Indian sickle cell disease registry for surveillance and patient management: Development and implementation. In India,sickle cell disease (SCD) predominantly occurs in indigenous (tribal) people,who are about 104 million. However,screening and diagnosis seldom happen. This situation necessitates developing a comprehensive SCD care model,including a registry. This paper describes the development and implementation of the Indian SCD registry (ISCDR) in six tribal-dominated districts of India. The ISCDR was created in two components-(i) an Android-based mobile/tablet application,(ii) a dashboard/admin panel for patients' data management and retrieval. Data capture involves two electronic case report forms (CRF),that is,the primary form (CRF-1) and the repeat visit form (CRF-2). CRF-1 is completed as soon as the patient is found positive and captures the patient's information,including medical history,diagnosis,symptoms,precipitating factors,hospitalisation history and treatment received. Issues related to quality,security and data-sharing were addressed. After the screening system was functional,ISCDR was initiated. In 12 months,data of 324 SCD patients and 1771 carriers were entered. The study demonstrates the feasibility of establishing an SCD registry in India. It collects systematic longitudinal data on SCD patients,which are essential for programme planning and management. Further,it is feasible to scale up and integrate with other health management databases.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,35360062	Testicular Tissue Banking for Fertility Preservation in Young Boys: Which Patients Should Be Included? Due to the growing number of young patients at risk of germ cell loss,there is a need to preserve spermatogonial stem cells for patients who are not able to bank spermatozoa. Worldwide,more and more clinics are implementing testicular tissue (TT) banking programs,making it a novel,yet indispensable,discipline in the field of fertility preservation. Previously,TT cryopreservation was predominantly offered to young cancer patients before starting gonadotoxic chemo- or radiotherapy. Nowadays,most centers also bank TT from patients with non-malignant conditions who need gonadotoxic conditioning therapy prior to hematopoietic stem cell (HSCT) or bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Additionally,some centers include patients who suffer from genetic or developmental disorders associated with prepubertal germ cell loss or patients who already had a previous round of chemo- or radiotherapy. It is important to note that the surgical removal of TT is an invasive procedure. Moreover,TT cryopreservation is still considered experimental as restoration methods are not yet clinically available. For this reason,TT banking should preferably only be offered to patients who are at significant risk of becoming infertile. In our view,TT cryopreservation is recommended for young cancer patients in need of high-risk chemo- and/or radiotherapy,regardless of previous low-risk treatment. Likewise,TT banking is advised for patients with non-malignant disorders such as sickle cell disease,beta-thalassemia,and bone marrow failure,who need high-risk conditioning therapy before HSCT/BMT. TT retrieval during orchidopexy is also proposed for patients with bilateral cryptorchidism. Since patients with a medium- to low-risk treatment generally maintain their fertility,TT banking is not advised for this group. Also for Klinefelter patients,TT banking is not recommended as it does not give better outcomes than a testicular sperm extraction later in life.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,30656488	Renal Medullary Carcinoma: a Report of the Current Literature. PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: We present an updated report of renal medullary carcinoma (RMC),a rare and aggressive condition. RECENT FINDINGS: There is a majority of male patients,of African descent,in the second or third decade of life. In differential diagnosis,other tumors,such as malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT),vinculin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (VCL-ALK) translocation renal cell carcinoma,and collecting duct carcinoma,may present difficulties. Abnormalities of tumor suppressor gene SMARCB1 have been found in RMC. Reported symptoms were hematuria,pain,weight loss,respiratory distress,palpable mass,cough,and fever. Most patients present with metastases at diagnosis. There is no definite recommended treatment,and protocols are extrapolated from other malignancies,with nephrectomy and systemic therapies being most frequently used. Response to treatment and prognosis remain very poor. RMC is a rare and aggressive tumor. Definitive diagnosis requires histological assessment and the presence of sickle-cell hemoglobinopathies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,32394268	Acute care utilization in pediatric sickle cell disease and sickle cell trait in the USA: prevalence,temporal trends,and cost. The objective of this study was to analyze acute care utilization of sickle cell disease (SCD) and sickle cell trait (SCT) in children and identify trends in emergency department (ED) visits and inpatient admissions over a 10-year period. This is a retrospective population-based study of SCD- and SCT-related ED visits and admissions from 2006 to 2015. Data were acquired from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP),National Inpatient Sample (NIS),and National Emergency Department Sample (NEDS) database. Cost-to-charge and estimated professional fee ratios were applied to approximate costs. Over 80% of medical expenditure on HbSS is through ED-based admissions. There is a statistically significant increase from 2006 to 2015 in the direct hospital admissions associated with patients less than 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with SCT.Conclusion: Among patients less than 18 years of age with HbSS,inpatient admissions through the emergency department accounted for the largest medical expenditure of the SCD subtypes. What is Known:   There are currently no multi-year,nationwide analyses of acute care utilization in sickle cell disease and sickle cell trait (SCT) in the pediatric population.   SCT is more common than SCD,affecting 1.5% of all infants born in the USA. What is New:   Comprehensive annual costs of acute care utilization of patients less than 18 years of age with SCD and SCT in the USA which includes aggregated demographical patient care data and to illustrate temporal trends of acute care utilization in children less than 18 years of age with SCD and SCT   Among patients less than 18 years of age with HbSS,inpatient admissions through the emergency department accounted for the largest medical expenditure of the sickle cell disease subtypes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,35087158	Machine learning-based approaches for identifying human blood cells harboring CRISPR-mediated fetal chromatin domain ablations. Two common hemoglobinopathies,sickle cell disease (SCD) and beta-thalassemia,arise from genetic mutations within the beta-globin gene. In this work,we identified a 500-bp motif (Fetal Chromatin Domain,FCD) upstream of human Upsilon-globin locus and showed that the removal of this motif using CRISPR technology reactivates the expression of Upsilon-globin. Next,we present two different cell morphology-based machine learning approaches that can be used identify human blood cells (KU-812) that harbor CRISPR-mediated FCD genetic modifications. Three candidate models from the first approach,which uses multilayer perceptron algorithm (MLP 20-26,MLP26-18,and MLP 30-26) and flow cytometry-derived cellular data,yielded 0.83 precision,0.80 recall,0.82 accuracy,and 0.90 area under the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve when predicting the edited cells. In comparison,the candidate model from the second approach,which uses deep learning (T2D5) and DIC microscopy-derived imaging data,performed with less accuracy (0.80) and ROC AUC (0.87). We envision that equivalent machine learning-based models can complement currently available genotyping protocols for specific genetic modifications which result in morphological changes in human cells.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,30308028	Oral carbon monoxide therapy in murine sickle cell disease: Beneficial effects on vaso-occlusion,inflammation and anemia. Carbon monoxide (CO) at low,non-toxic concentrations has been previously demonstrated to exert anti-inflammatory protection in murine models of sickle cell disease (SCD). However CO delivery by inhalation,CO-hemoglobin infusion or CO-releasing molecules presents problems for daily CO administration. Oral administration of a CO-saturated liquid avoids many of these issues and potentially provides a platform for self-administration to SCD patients. To test if orally-delivered CO could modulate SCD vaso-occlusion and inflammation,a liquid CO formulation (HBI-002) was administered by gavage (10 ml/kg) once-daily to NY1DD and Townes-SS transgenic mouse models of SCD. Baseline CO-hemoglobin (CO-Hb) levels were 1.6% and 1.8% in NY1DD and Townes-SS sickle mice and 0.6% in Townes-AS control mice. CO-Hb levels reached 5.4%,4.7% and 3.0% within 5 minutes in NY1DD,SS and AS mice respectively after gavage with HBI-002. After ten treatments,each once-daily,hemoglobin levels rose from 5.3g/dL in vehicle-treated Townes-SS mice to 6.3g/dL in HBI-002-treated. Similarly,red blood cell (RBC) counts rose from 2.36 x 106/muL in vehicle-treated SS mice to 2.89 x 106/muL in HBI-002-treated mice. In concordance with these findings,hematocrits rose from 26.3% in vehicle-treated mice to 30.0% in HBI-002-treated mice. Reticulocyte counts were not significantly different between vehicle and HBI-002-treated SS mice implying less hemolysis and not an increase in RBC production. White blood cell counts decreased from 29.1 x 103/muL in vehicle-treated versus 20.3 x 103/muL in HBI-002-treated SS mice. Townes-SS mice treated with HBI-002 had markedly increased Nrf2 and HO-1 expression and decreased NF-kappaB activation compared to vehicle-treated mice. These anti-inflammatory effects were examined for the ability of HBI-002 (administered orally once-daily for up to 5 days) to inhibit vaso-occlusion induced by hypoxia-reoxygenation. In NY1DD and Townes-SS sickle mice,HBI-002 decreased microvascular stasis in a duration-dependent manner. Collectively,these findings support HBI-002 as a useful anti-inflammatory agent to treat SCD and warrants further development as a therapeutic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,32672889	Cost of health care for paediatric patients with sickle cell disease: An analysis of resource use and costs in a European country. BACKGROUND: While multiple studies have examined the cost of health care for one aspect of sickle cell disease care,few have focussed on the overall cost of comprehensive care for sickle cell disease. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of children with sickle cell disease treated in a comprehensive care centre from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2016. Health care utilisation of included patients was based upon data from two main sources. The clinical practice guideline was used to determine the expected resource use of routine comprehensive care (planned elective care),and the financial claims database was used to estimate real-world resource use associated with acute and inpatient care (additional care). RESULTS: A total of 125 children with sickle cell disease were analysed. Expenditures for these patients averaged $5049 [standard deviation (SD) $1634] per child per year. Total yearly costs per patient varied considerably,ranging from $669 to $84 010,and less than 15% of patients were responsible for 50% of the health care costs. The majority (37%) of costs was associated with inpatient hospital care,which increased by age group,27% with diagnostics,19% with treatment,11% with outpatients' visits and 6% with emergency care. CONCLUSION: We have described real-world resource use and expenditures for children with sickle cell disease in a European comprehensive care centre. It seems that costs of a comprehensive approach with effective management in the outpatient setting is favourable when compared to episodic health care.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NEGATIVE,36134546	Risk of COVID-19 hospitalizations among school-aged children in Scotland: A national incident cohort study. Background: There is considerable policy,clinical and public interest about whether children should be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 and,if so,which children should be prioritised (particularly if vaccine resources are limited). To inform such deliberations,we sought to identify children and young people at highest risk of hospitalization from COVID-19. Methods: We used the Early Pandemic Evaluation and Enhanced Surveillance of COVID-19 (EAVE II) platform to undertake a national incident cohort analysis to investigate the risk of hospitalization among 5-17 years old living in Scotland in risk groups defined by the living risk prediction algorithm (QCOVID). A Cox proportional hazard model was used to derive hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between risk groups and COVID-19 hospital admission. Adjustments were made for age,sex,socioeconomic status,co-morbidity,and prior hospitalization. Results: Between March 1,2020 and November 22,"$2,021.00",there were 146 183 (19.4% of all 752 867 children in Scotland) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections among 5-17 years old. Of those with confirmed infection,973 (0.7%) were admitted to hospital with COVID-19. The rate of COVID-19 hospitalization was higher in those within each QCOVID risk group compared to those without the condition. Similar results were found in age stratified analyses (5-11 and 12-17 years old). Risk groups associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 hospital admission,included (adjusted HR,95% CIs): sickle cell disease 14.35 (8.48-24.28),chronic kidney disease 11.34 (4.61-27.87),blood cancer 6.32 (3.24-12.35),rare pulmonary diseases 5.04 (2.58-9.86),type 2 diabetes 3.04 (1.34-6.92),epilepsy 2.54 (1.69-3.81),type 1 diabetes 2.48 (1.47-4.16),Down syndrome 2.45 (0.96-6.25),cerebral palsy 2.37 (1.26-4.47),severe mental illness 1.43 (0.63-3.24),fracture 1.41 (1.02-1.95),congenital heart disease 1.35 (0.82-2.23),asthma 1.28 (1.06-1.55),and learning disability (excluding Down syndrome) 1.08 (0.82-1.42),when compared to those without these conditions. Although our Cox models were adjusted for a number of potential confounders,residual confounding remains a possibility. Conclusions: In this national study,we observed an increased risk of COVID-19 hospital admissions among school-aged children with specific underlying long-term health conditions compared with children without these conditions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,35705370	Sickle cell disease in children: an update of the evidence in low- and middle-income settings. Sickle cell disease (SCD),one of the most common monogenetic diseases in the world,is associated with multisystemic complications that begin in childhood. Most of the babies homozygous for the sickle haemoglobin gene are born in sub-Saharan Africa. Over the years,progress has been made with early diagnosis through newborn screening,penicillin prophylaxis,pneumococcal immunisation,transcranial Doppler (TCD) screening,hydroxyurea therapy and chronic blood transfusions with remarkably improved survival and quality of life of children with SCD. However,wide disparities in outcomes exist between high-income countries (HICs) where over 90% survive to adulthood,and low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) where less than half achieve that milestone. Even in HICs,racial inequities pose barriers to accessing specialised care and receiving treatment for acute pain episodes. Better understanding of SCD pathophysiology is being exploited to develop new disease-modifying drugs and gene therapy approaches to further improve outcomes. Bone marrow transplantation is established as a curative treatment for SCD,but it is largely unavailable in LMICs. To bridge the disparity and inequity gaps,innovative approaches are needed in LMICs. Validated and more affordable,easy-to-use point-of-care tests offer opportunities to link early diagnosis with immunisation programmes and healthcare encounters. Widespread use of hydroxyurea therapy-a relatively affordable and effective disease-modifying drug-in LMICs would help improve survival and quality of life. Integration of SCD treatment into primary care linked to district level/provincial hospitals that are supported with evidence-based guidelines will help extend needed interventions to many more patients living in LMICs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,31937250	Malaria in patients with sickle cell anaemia: burden,risk factors and outcome at the Laquintinie hospital,Cameroon. BACKGROUND: It is believed that the current prevalence of malaria in endemic areas reflects selection for the carrier form of sickle cell trait through a survival advantage. Malaria has been incriminated as a great cause of mortality in people with sickle cell disease (SCD). However,people with SCD,a high-risk group,do not benefit from free or subsisized malaria prevention and treatment in Cameroon unlike other vulnerable groups which may be due to insufficient evidence to guide policy makers. This study aimed at describing clinical and socio-demographic characteristics of patients with malaria,determining the prevalence of malaria in hospitalized children and in those with SCD and without,compare frequency of presentation of malaria related complications (using clinical and laboratory elements that define severe malaria) between children admitted for malaria with SCD and those without and finally,determing the risk factors for death in children admitted for malaria. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of admission records of children age 1 to 18 years with a confirmed malaria diagnosis admitted at the Laquintinie Hospital during January 2015 through December 2018. Clinical features,laboratory characteristics and outcome of malarial infections,stratified by SCD status were studied. Patients with HIV infection,malnutrition,renal failure and discharged against medical advice were excluded from the study. Data were analysed using Epi-info 7 software and analysis done. Chi square test,Odds ratios,CI and student's t test were used to determine association between variables. Statistical significance was set at p-value <=0.05. RESULTS: The prevalence of malaria was lower among children with SCD than it was among children without SCD (23.5% vs 44.9%). Similarly,among those with a positive microscopy,the mean parasite density was significantly lower among children with SCD than it was among children without SCD (22,875.6 vs 57,053.6 parasites/ mul with t-value - 3.2,p-value 0.002). The mean hemoglobin concentration was lower in SCD as compared to non SCD (5.7 g/l vs 7.4 g/l,t-value - 12.5,p-value < 0.001). Overall mortality in SCD was 3.4% and malaria was reponsible for 20.4% of these deaths as compared to the 35.4% in non SCD patients. Convulsion and impaired consciousness were significantly lower in SCD group (OR:0.1,CI: 0.1-0.3,p value < 0.01 and OR:0.1,CI:0.1-0.2,p-value < 0.001 respectively). Death was significantly higher in SCD patients with malaria as compared to SCD patients admitted for other pathologies (3.2% vs 1.5%.,OR:2.2,CI:1-5,p-value 0.050). CONCLUSION: The SCD population has a lower mortality related to malaria compared to the non-SCD population. Meanwhile,within the SCD population,those admitted with malaria are twice more likely to die than those admitted for other pathologies. Jaundice,hepatomegaly and splenomegaly were common in SCD with malaria,however no risk factors for malaria severity or malaria related death was identified.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,32949495	In Vivo HSC Gene Therapy Using a Bi-modular HDAd5/35++ Vector Cures Sickle Cell Disease in a Mouse Model. We have recently reported that,after in vivo hematopoietic stem cell/progenitor (HSPC) transduction with HDAd5/35++ vectors,SB100x transposase-mediated gamma-globin gene addition achieved 10%-15% gamma-globin of adult mouse globin,resulting in significant but incomplete phenotypic correction in a thalassemia intermedia mouse model. Furthermore,genome editing of a gamma-globin repressor binding site within the gamma-globin promoter by CRISPR-Cas9 results in efficient reactivation of endogenous gamma-globin. Here,we aimed to combine these two mechanisms to obtain curative levels of gamma-globin after in vivo HSPC transduction. We generated a HDAd5/35++ adenovirus vector (HDAd-combo) containing both modules and tested it in vitro and after in vivo HSPC transduction in healthy CD46/beta-YAC mice and in a sickle cell disease mouse model (CD46/Townes). Compared to HDAd vectors containing either the gamma-globin addition or the CRISPR-Cas9 reactivation units alone,in vivo HSC transduction of CD46/Townes mice with the HDAd-combo resulted in significantly higher gamma-globin in red blood cells,reaching 30% of that of adult human alpha and betaS chains and a complete phenotypic correction of sickle cell disease.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,29684562	Bone Marrow Transplantation after Nonmyeloablative Treosulfan Conditioning Is Curative in a Murine Model of Sickle Cell Disease. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can be curative for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). However,morbidity associated with myeloablative conditioning and graft-versus-host disease has limited its utility. To this end,autologous HSCT for SCD using lentiviral gene-modified bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood stem cells has been undertaken,although toxicities of fully ablative conditioning with busulfan and incomplete engraftment have been encountered. Treosulfan,a busulfan analog with a low extramedullary toxicity profile,has been used successfully as part of a myeloablative conditioning regimen in the allogeneic setting in SCD. To further minimize toxicity of conditioning,noncytotoxic monoclonal antibodies that clear stem cells from the marrow niche,such as anti-c-Kit (ACK2),have been considered. Using a murine model of SCD,we sought to determine whether nonmyeloablative conditioning followed by transplantation with syngeneic BM cells could ameliorate the disease phenotype. Treosulfan and ACK2,in a dose-dependent manner,decreased BM cellularity and induced cytopenia in SCD mice. Conditioning with treosulfan alone at nonmyeloablative dosing (3.6 g/kg),followed by transplantation with syngeneic BM donor cells,permitted long-term mixed-donor chimerism. Level of chimerism correlated with improvement in hematologic parameters,normalization of urine osmolality,and improvement in liver and spleen pathology. Addition of ACK2 to treosulfan conditioning did not enhance engraftment. Our data suggests that pretransplant conditioning with treosulfan alone may allow sufficient erythroid engraftment to reverse manifestations of SCD,with clinical application as a preparative regimen in SCD patients undergoing gene-modified autologous HSCT.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,29560059	Emergency Department (ED),ED Observation,Day Hospital,and Hospital Admissions for Adults with Sickle Cell Disease. INTRODUCTION: Use of alternative venues to manage uncomplicated vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC),such as a day hospital (DH) or ED observation unit,for patients with sickle cell anemia,may significantly reduce admission rates,which may subsequently reduce 30-day readmission rates. METHODS: In the context of a two-institution quality improvement project to implement best practices for management of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) VOC,we prospectively compared acute care encounters for utilization of 1) emergency department (ED); 2) ED observation unit; 3) DH,and 4) hospital admission,of two different patient cohorts with SCD presenting to our two study sites. Using a representative sample of patients from each institution,we also tabulated SCD patient visits or admissions to outside hospitals within 20 miles of the patients' home institutions. RESULTS: Over 30 months 427 patients (297 at Site 1 and 130 at Site 2) initiated 4,740 institutional visits,totaling 6,627 different acute care encounters,including combinations of encounters. The range of encounters varied from a low of 0 (203 of 500 patients [40.6%] at Site 1; 65 of 195 patients [33.3%] at Site 2),and a high of 152 (5/month) acute care encounters for one patient at Site 2. Patients at Site 2 were more likely to be admitted to the hospital during the study period (88.4% vs. 74.4%,p=0.0011) and have an ED visit (96.9% vs. 85.5%,p=0.0002). DH was used more frequently at Site 1 (1.207 encounters for 297 patients at Site 1,vs. 199 encounters for 130 patients at Site 2),and ED observation was used at Site 1 only. Thirty-five percent of patients visited hospitals outside their home academic center. CONCLUSION: In this 30-month assessment of two sickle cell cohorts,healthcare utilization varied dramatically between individual patients. One cohort had more hospital admissions and ED encounters,while the other cohort had more day hospital encounters and used a sickle cell disease observation VOC protocol. One-third of patients sampled visited hospitals for acute care outside of their care providers' institutions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,28323673	Clinical 'pearls' of maternal critical care Part 2: sickle-cell disease in pregnancy. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The current review outlines the challenges in managing pregnant women with sickle-cell anemia,who are at risk of becoming critically ill during pregnancy. RECENT FINDINGS: Sickle obstetric patients pose unique challenges to the anesthetist and intensivist. We discuss the role of prophylactic transfusions for specific indications like acute anemia and twin pregnancies. The management and prevention of vaso-occlusive crises and chest crisis are also outlined. The role of the multidisciplinary team cannot be overstated.Massive obstetric hemorrhage in this population is difficult,and unique considerations such as cell-saver technology and tranexamic acid usage are discussed. Secondary complications such as pulmonary hypertension and stroke are also considered,with a summary of the latest treatment guidelines. SUMMARY: This is a challenging cohort of pregnant patients who have a significantly increased morbidity and mortality. This review aims to aid management of these patients on the labor ward for both obstetric anesthetists and intensivists.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,28699284	A monocyte-TNF-endothelial activation axis in sickle transgenic mice: Therapeutic benefit from TNF blockade. Elaboration of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a very early event in development of ischemia/reperfusion injury pathophysiology. Therefore,TNF may be a prominent mediator of endothelial cell and vascular wall dysfunction in sickle cell anemia,a hypothesis we addressed using NY1DD,S+SAntilles,and SS-BERK sickle transgenic mice. Transfusion experiments revealed participation of abnormally activated blood monocytes exerting an endothelial activating effect,dependent upon Egr-1 in both vessel wall and blood cells,and upon NFkappaB(p50) in a blood cell only. Involvement of TNF was identified by beneficial impact from TNF blockers,etanercept and infliximab,with less benefit from an IL-1 blocker,anakinra. In therapeutic studies,etanercept ameliorated multiple disturbances of the murine sickle condition: monocyte activation,blood biomarkers of inflammation,low platelet count and Hb,vascular stasis triggered by hypoxia/reoxygenation (but not if triggered by hemin infusion),tissue production of neuro-inflammatory mediators,endothelial activation (monitored by tissue factor and VCAM-1 expression),histopathologic liver injury,and three surrogate markers of pulmonary hypertension (perivascular inflammatory aggregates,arteriolar muscularization,and right ventricular mean systolic pressure). In aggregate,these studies identify a prominent-and possibly dominant-role for an abnormal monocyte-TNF-endothelial activation axis in the sickle context. Its presence,plus the many benefits of etanercept observed here,argue that pilot testing of TNF blockade should be considered for human sickle cell anemia,a challenging but achievable translational research goal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,30895451	Sickle cell retinopathy. A focused review. PURPOSE: To provide a focused review of sickle cell retinopathy in the light of recent advances in the pathogenesis,multimodal retinal imaging,management of the condition,and migration trends,which may lead to increased prevalence of the condition in the Western world. METHODS: Non-systematic focused literature review. RESULTS: Sickle retinopathy results from aggregation of abnormal hemoglobin in the red blood cells in the retinal microcirculation,leading to reduced deformability of the red blood cells,stagnant blood flow in the retinal precapillary arterioles,thrombosis,and ischemia. This may be precipitated by hypoxia,acidosis,and hyperosmolarity. Sickle retinopathy may result in sight threatening complications,such as paracentral middle maculopathy or sequelae of proliferative retinopathy,such as vitreous hemorrhage and retinal detachment. New imaging modalities,such as wide-field imaging and optical coherence tomography angiography,have revealed the microstructural features of sickle retinopathy,enabling earlier diagnosis. The vascular growth factor ANGPTL-4 has recently been identified as a potential mediator of progression to proliferative retinopathy and may represent a possible therapeutic target. Laser therapy should be considered for proliferative retinopathy in order to prevent visual loss; however,the evidence is not very strong. With recent development of wide-field imaging,targeted laser to ischemic retina may prove to be beneficial. Exact control of intraoperative intraocular pressure,including valved trocar vitrectomy systems,may improve the outcomes of vitreoretinal surgery for complications,such as vitreous hemorrhage and retinal detachment. Stem cell transplantation and gene therapy are potentially curative treatments,which may prevent retinopathy. CONCLUSIONS: There is lack of evidence regarding the optimal management of sickle retinopathy. Further study is needed to determine if recent progress in the understanding of the pathophysiology and diagnosis of sickle retinopathy may translate into improved management and outcome.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,33484967	BMI1 enables extensive expansion of functional erythroblasts from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs) from ABO-matched but genetically unrelated donors is commonly used for treating anemia and acute blood loss. Increasing demand and insufficient supply for donor RBCs,especially those of universal blood types or free of known and unknown pathogens,has called for ex vivo generation of functional RBCs by large-scale cell culture. However,generating physiological numbers of transfusable cultured RBCs (cRBCs) ex vivo remains challenging,due to our inability to either extensively expand primary RBC precursors (erythroblasts) or achieve efficient enucleation once erythroblasts have been expanded and induced to differentiation and maturation. Here,we report that ectopic expression of the human BMI1 gene confers extensive expansion of human erythroblasts,which can be derived readily from adult peripheral blood mononuclear cells of either healthy donors or sickle cell patients. These extensively expanded erythroblasts (E3s) are able to proliferate exponentially (>1 trillion-fold in 2 months) in a defined culture medium. Expanded E3 cells are karyotypically normal and capable of terminal maturation with approximately 50% enucleation. Additionally,E3-derived cRBCs can circulate in a mouse model following transfusion similar to primary human RBCs. Therefore,we provide a facile approach of generating physiological numbers of human functional erythroblasts ex vivo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,29325430	Rapid and Sensitive Assessment of Globin Chains for Gene and Cell Therapy of Hemoglobinopathies. The beta-hemoglobinopathies sickle cell anemia and beta-thalassemia are the focus of many gene-therapy studies. A key disease parameter is the abundance of globin chains because it indicates the level of anemia,likely toxicity of excess or aberrant globins,and therapeutic potential of induced or exogenous beta-like globins. Reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) allows versatile and inexpensive globin quantification,but commonly applied protocols suffer from long run times,high sample requirements,or inability to separate murine from human beta-globin chains. The latter point is problematic for in vivo studies with gene-addition vectors in murine disease models and mouse/human chimeras. This study demonstrates HPLC-based measurements of globin expression (1) after differentiation of the commonly applied human umbilical cord blood-derived erythroid progenitor-2 cell line,(2) in erythroid progeny of CD34+ cells for the analysis of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9-mediated disruption of the globin regulator BCL11A,and (3) of transgenic mice holding the human beta-globin locus. At run times of 8 min for separation of murine and human beta-globin chains as well as of human gamma-globin chains,and with routine measurement of globin-chain ratios for 12 nL of blood (tested for down to 0.75 nL) or of 300,000 in vitro differentiated cells,the methods presented here and any variant-specific adaptations thereof will greatly facilitate evaluation of novel therapy applications for beta-hemoglobinopathies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,30265442	Mouse Models of Pain in Sickle Cell Disease. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic blood disorder that impacts millions of individuals worldwide. SCD is characterized by debilitating pain that can begin during infancy and may continue to increase throughout life. This pain can be both acute and chronic. A characteristic feature specific to acute pain in SCD occurs during vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) due to the blockade of capillaries with sickle red blood cells. The acute pain of VOC is intense,unpredictable,and requires hospitalization. Chronic pain occurs in a significant population with SCD. Treatment options for sickle pain are limited and primarily involve the use of opioids. However,long-term opioid use is associated with numerous side effects. Thus,pain management in SCD remains a major challenge. Humanized transgenic mice expressing exclusively human sickle hemoglobin show features of pain and pathobiology similar to that in patients with SCD. Therefore,these mice offer the potential for investigating the mechanisms of pain in SCD and allow for development of novel targeted analgesic therapies.   2018 by John Wiley & Sons,Inc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,33658643	Correction of murine sickle cell disease by allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation with anti-3rd party veto cells. Despite advances in gene therapy allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT) remains the most effective way to cure sickle cell disease (SCD). However,there are substantial challenges including lack of suitable donors,therapy-related toxicity (TRM) and risk of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Perhaps the most critical question is when to do a transplant for SCD. Safer transplant protocols for HLA-disparate HSCT is needed before transplants are widely accepted for SCD. Although risk of GvHD and TRM are less with T-cell-deplete HSCT and reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC),transplant rejection is a challenge. We have reported graft rejection of T cell-depleted non-myeloablative HSCT can be overcome in wild type fully mis-matched recipient mice,using donor-derived anti-3rd party central memory CD8-positive veto cells combined with short-term low-dose rapamycin. Here,we report safety and efficacy of this approach in a murine model for SCD. Durable donor-derived chimerism was achieved using this strategy with reversal of pathological parameters of SCD,including complete conversion to normal donor-derived red cells,and correction of splenomegaly and the levels of circulating reticulocytes,hematocrit,and hemoglobin.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,31178391	Editing the Sickle Cell Disease Mutation in Human Hematopoietic Stem Cells: Comparison of Endonucleases and Homologous Donor Templates. Site-specific correction of a point mutation causing a monogenic disease in autologous hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) can be used as a treatment of inherited disorders of the blood cells. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an ideal model to investigate the potential use of gene editing to transvert a single point mutation at the beta-globin locus (HBB). We compared the activity of zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) and CRISPR/Cas9 for editing,and homologous donor templates delivered as single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (ssODNs),adeno-associated virus serotype 6 (AAV6),integrase-deficient lentiviral vectors (IDLVs),and adenovirus 5/35 serotype (Ad5/35) to transvert the base pair responsible for SCD in HBB in primary human CD34+ HSPCs. We found that the ZFNs and Cas9 directed similar frequencies of nuclease activity. In vitro,AAV6 led to the highest frequencies of homology-directed repair (HDR),but levels of base pair transversions were significantly reduced when analyzing cells in vivo in immunodeficient mouse xenografts,with similar frequencies achieved with either AAV6 or ssODNs. AAV6 also caused significant impairment of colony-forming progenitors and human cell engraftment. Gene correction in engrafting hematopoietic stem cells may be limited by the capacity of the cells to mediate HDR,suggesting additional manipulations may be needed for high-efficiency gene correction in HSPCs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,38262104	Effect of voxelotor on murine bone marrow and peripheral blood with hematopoietic progenitor cell mobilization for gene therapy of sickle cell disease. In preparation for hematopoietic stem cell mobilization and collection,current ex vivo gene therapy protocols for sickle cell disease require patients to undergo several months of chronic red cell transfusion. For health care equity,alternatives to red cell transfusion should be available. We examined whether treatment with GBT1118,the murine analog of voxelotor,could be a safe and feasible alternative to red cell transfusion. We found that 3 weeks of treatment with GBT1118 increased the percentage of bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells and upon plerixafor mobilization,the percentage of peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells. Our data suggest that voxelotor should be further explored for its potential safety and utility as preparation for hematopoietic stem cell mobilization and collection.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,34329381	Murine bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells have reduced hematopoietic maintenance ability in sickle cell disease. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by hemolytic anemia,which can trigger oxidative stress,inflammation,and tissue injury that contribute to disease complications. Bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) tightly regulate hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) homeostasis in health and disease,but their functionality in SCD remains unclear. We identified for the first time that murine SCD MSCs have altered gene signatures,reduced stem cell properties,and increased oxidative stress,due in part to hemolysis. Murine SCD MSCs had lower HSC maintenance ability in vitro and in vivo,as manifested by increased HSC mobilization and decreased HSC engraftment after transplant. Activation of Toll-like receptor-4 through p65 in MSCs further contributed to MSC dysfunction. Transfusions led to an improved MSC and HSC oxidative state in SCD mice. Improving the regulation between MSCs and HSCs has vital implications for enhancing clinical HSC transplantation and gene therapy outcomes and for identification of new molecular targets for alleviating SCD complications.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,33514718	Cas9-AAV6 gene correction of beta-globin in autologous HSCs improves sickle cell disease erythropoiesis in mice. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated beta-globin (HBB) gene correction of sickle cell disease (SCD) patient-derived hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in combination with autologous transplantation represents a recent paradigm in gene therapy. Although several Cas9-based HBB-correction approaches have been proposed,functional correction of in vivo erythropoiesis has not been investigated previously. Here,we use a humanized globin-cluster SCD mouse model to study Cas9-AAV6-mediated HBB-correction in functional HSCs within the context of autologous transplantation. We discover that long-term multipotent HSCs can be gene corrected ex vivo and stable hemoglobin-A production can be achieved in vivo from HBB-corrected HSCs following autologous transplantation. We observe a direct correlation between increased HBB-corrected myeloid chimerism and normalized in vivo red blood cell (RBC) features,but even low levels of chimerism resulted in robust hemoglobin-A levels. Moreover,this study offers a platform for gene editing of mouse HSCs for both basic and translational research.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,38506770	Ex vivo culture resting time impacts transplantation outcomes of genome-edited human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in xenograft mouse models. Ex vivo resting culture is a standard procedure following genome editing in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). However,prolonged culture may critically affect cell viability and stem cell function. We investigated whether varying durations of culture resting times impact the engraftment efficiency of human CD34+ HSPCs edited at the BCL11A enhancer,a key regulator in the expression of fetal hemoglobin. We employed electroporation to introduce CRISPR-Cas9 components for BCL11A enhancer editing and compared outcomes with nonelectroporated (NEP) and electroporated-only (EP) control groups. Post-electroporation,we monitored cell viability,death rates,and the frequency of enriched hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) fractions (CD34+CD90+CD45RA- cells) over a 48-hour period. Our findings reveal that while the NEP group showed an increase in cell numbers 24 hours post-electroporation,both EP and BCL11A-edited groups experienced significant cell loss. Although CD34+ cell frequency remained high in all groups for up to 48 hours post-electroporation,the frequency of the HSC-enriched fraction was significantly lower in the EP and edited groups compared to the NEP group. In NBSGW xenograft mouse models,both conditioned with busulfan and nonconditioned,we found that immediate transplantation post-electroporation led to enhanced engraftment without compromising editing efficiency. Human glycophorin A+ (GPA+) red blood cells (RBCs) sorted from bone marrow of all BCL11A edited mice exhibited similar levels of gamma-globin expression,regardless of infusion time. Our findings underscore the critical importance of optimizing the culture duration between genome editing and transplantation. Minimizing this interval may significantly enhance engraftment success and minimize cell loss without compromising editing efficiency. These insights offer a pathway to improve the success rates of genome editing in HSPCs,particularly for conditions like sickle cell disease.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,38394231	Sickle Cell Disease in an Older Adult Population: A Retrospective Review of Health Care Resource Utilization. Sickle cell disease (SCD) has a history of health inequity,as patients with SCD are primarily Black and often marginalized from the health care system. Although recent health care and treatment advancements have prolonged life expectancy,it may be insufficient to support the complex needs of the growing population of older adults with SCD. This retrospective study used a cohort (N = 812) of Medicare Advantage beneficiaries 45 years and older (ages: 45-54,55-64,65-74,75-89) with SCD to identify associations of SCD-related complications and comorbidities with emergency department (ED) visits,potentially avoidable ED visits,all-cause hospitalization,and potentially avoidable hospitalizations,2018-2020. The 75-89 age group had lower odds of an ED visit (OR 0.56; 95% CI 0.32-1.00),65-74 age group had lower odds of an ED visit (OR 0.49; 95% CI 0.31-0.78) and hospitalization (OR 0.50; 95% CI 0.31-0.79),compared with the 45-54 age group. Acute chest syndrome was associated with increased odds of an ED visit (OR 2.02; 95% CI 1.10-3.71),avoidable ED visit (OR 1.87; 95% CI 1.14-3.06),and hospitalization (OR 3.61; 95% CI 2.06-6.31). Pain was associated with increased odds of an ED visit (OR 2.64; 95% CI 1.85-3.76),an avoidable ED visit (OR 3.08; 95% CI 1.90-4.98),hospitalization (OR 1.51; 95% CI 1.02-2.24),and avoidable hospitalization (OR 6.42; 95% CI 1.74-23.74). Older adults with SCD have been living with SCD for decades,often while managing pain crises and complications associated increased incidence of an ED visit and hospitalization. The characteristics and needs of this population must continue to be examined to increase preventative care and reduce costly emergent health care resource utilization.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NEGATIVE,30371676	Intravenous and Intra-amniotic In Utero Transplantation in the Murine Model. In utero transplantation (IUT) is a unique and versatile mode of therapy that can be used to introduce stem cells,viral vectors,or any other substances early in the gestation. The rationale behind IUT for therapeutic purposes is based on the small size of the fetus,the fetal immunologic immaturity,the accessibility and proliferative nature of the fetal stem or progenitor cells,and the potential to treat a disease or the onset of symptoms prior to birth. Taking advantage of these normal developmental properties of the fetus,the delivery of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) via an IUT has the potential to treat congenital hematologic disorders such as sickle cell disease,without the required myeloablative or immunosuppressive conditioning required for postnatal HSC transplants. Similarly,the accessibility of progenitor cells in multiple organs during development potentially allows for a more efficient targeting of stem/progenitor cells following an IUT of viral vectors for gene therapy or genome editing. Additionally,IUT can be used to study normal developmental processes including,but not limited to,the development of immunologic tolerance. The murine model provides a valuable and affordable means to understanding the potential and limitations of IUT prior to pre-clinical large animal studies and an eventual clinical application. Here,we describe a protocol for performing an IUT in the murine fetus through intravenous and intra-amniotic routes. This protocol has been used successfully to elucidate the necessary conditions and mechanisms behind in utero hematopoietic stem cell transplantation,tolerance induction,and in utero gene therapy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,36669729	Sickle Cell Trevor Thompson Transition Project (ST3P-UP) protocol for managing care transitions: Methods and rationale. BACKGROUND: Emerging adults with sickle cell disease (EASCD) experience significant challenges transitioning from pediatric to adult care. Acute care utilization increases,quality of life (QOL) declines,with an increased risk of mortality. Currently,there are no practice standards to guide emerging adults through the transition process. We are creating a structured transition education (STE) based program for EASCD by customizing the Six Core Elements (6 CE) of Health Care Transition model and are evaluating the effectiveness of adding peer mentoring (PM). METHODS: The Sickle Cell Trevor Thompson Transition Project (ST3P-UP) is an ongoing multi-site,cluster randomized clinical trial with a target enrollment of 537 EASCD aged 16 to 25 years in pediatric care. Each site (n = 14) comprises a pediatric clinic,adult clinic,and a sickle cell disease (SCD) community-based organization (CBO). Sites are randomized 1:1 to either STE or STE + PM. EASCDs are followed prospectively for 24 months. Rapid cycle plan-do-study-act quality improvement (QI) methods are used to implement the STE. The primary objective is to compare the effectiveness of STE + PM versus STE only at decreasing the number of acute care visits per year over 24 months. The secondary objectives are to compare overall healthcare utilization and patient-reported QOL outcomes at 24 months. CONCLUSION: We aim to demonstrate the feasibility of using a QI approach to implement 6 CE-based practice standards at 14 disparate SCD clinical programs to guide EASCD through the transition process. We hypothesize that adding PM to the STE program will improve acute care reliance,QOL,and satisfaction with transition outcomes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,28617328	The Long-Term Consumption of Oats in Celiac Disease Patients Is Safe: A Large Cross-Sectional Study. A strict gluten-free diet (GFD) can be diversified by non-contaminated oats,but there is a shortage of long-term studies concerning its safety. We compared long-term treatment outcomes and factors associated with the introduction of oats between celiac patients on a GFD with or without oats. Eight hundred sixty-nine previously diagnosed celiac patients were interviewed. The validated Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS),Psychological General Well-Being (PGWB),and Short-Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaires were used to assess symptoms and quality of life,serological tests were performed,and results of histology were confirmed from patient records. We found the median duration of GFD to be 10 years and 82% using oats. Factors predicting the consumption of oats were diagnosis after the year 2000,advice from a dietitian,detection by screening,and mild clinical presentation. Oat consumers and non-consumers did not differ in dietary adherence (96.5% vs. 97.4%,p = 0.746),the prevalence of symptoms (22.9% vs. 22.5%,p = 0.931),positivity for endomysial antibodies (8.8% vs. 6.0%,p = 0.237),histological recovery after one year (63.1% vs. 60.0%,p = 0.773),malignancy (4.8% vs. 3.3%,p = 0.420),osteoporosis/osteopenia (9.2% vs. 11.0%,p = 0.489),or fractures (26.9% vs. 27.9%,p = 0.791). The oat consumers had better SF-36 physical role limitations and general health scores. Based on our results,the long-term consumption of oats in celiac disease patients is safe and may improve quality of life.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND: Non-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCWS) most frequently presents clinically with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like symptoms,although many extra-intestinal manifestations have also been attributed to it. No studies to date have evaluated the presence and frequency of gynecological symptoms in NCWS. AIM: To evaluate the frequency of gynecological disorders in patients with NCWS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-eight women with NCWS were included in the study. A questionnaire investigating gynecological symptoms and recurrent cystitis was administered,and patients reporting symptoms were then examined by specialists. Three control groups were selected: 52 patients with IBS not related to NCWS,56 patients with celiac disease (CD),and 71 healthy controls. RESULTS: 59% of the patients with NCWS showed gynecological symptoms,a higher frequency than in healthy controls (P = 0.04),IBS controls (P = 0.01) and CD controls (P = 0.02). Menstrual cycle alterations were more frequent in patients with NCWS than in healthy controls (26.5% vs 11.3%; P = 0.03); the patients with NCWS suffered from recurrent vaginitis (16%) and dyspareunia (6%) significantly more frequently than healthy controls. Twenty-nine percent of patients with NCWS reported recurrent cystitis,a finding higher than in the control groups (vs healthy P = 0.0001,vs IBS P = 0.001,vs CD controls P = 0.04). Microbiological examinations were negative in most of the patients with NCWS and recurrent vaginitis or cystitis. During the 1-year follow-up,46% of patients with menstrual disorders and 36% with recurrent vaginitis reported resolution of symptoms on a wheat-free diet.

Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes severe complications and deaths all over the world. COVID-19 also has indirect effects from the lockdown and the possible lack of food. We aimed to evaluate the perception of this in Celiac Disease (CeD) patients who require a lifelong gluten-free diet as a therapy. Methods: We invited by e-mail CeD adult patients from the University of Salerno (Campania,South Italy) and the University of Padua (Veneto,North Italy) to answer an ad hoc COVID-19 survey. Results: We sent the web survey to 651 email addresses and we received 276 answers (42,4%). CeD patients did not feel more vulnerable because they had CeD (not at all 56.6%) and they did not worry much about the possible shortness of gluten-free food during the epidemic (not at all 48.5%). The most worried were the elderly patients,patients with other comorbidities and females. Finally,CeD patients were happy with remote consultations and explicitly asked to have them. Discussion: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted a proportion of patients with CeD; in particular,women,elderly patients,patients with other comorbidities. COVID-19,although a challenging experience from the medical and the psychological point of view,has offered an opportunity to practice,on a large-scale,a remote consultation approach for CeD healthcare.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,35129887	[Cereal related complaints in children]. There's a lot of attention for gluten-free diets on social media. Doctors get many questions about gluten sensitivity or possible wheat allergy. With some basic knowledge,it's easier to give answers to these questions and to prevent unnecessary and sometimes harmful diets. This article gives basic information about cereals,gluten,grasses and their crossreactivity. We give an overview about the differences between celiac disease,gluten sensitivity and IgE-mediated wheat allergy. We also describe diagnostics,treatment and natural history of coeliakie,gluten sensitivity and wheat or cereal allergy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,33183548	Inconsistent effects of gluten on obesity: is there a role for the haptoglobin isoforms? BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There is no clear evidence about the effects of gluten intake on obesity. It is known that gluten's effects on gut permeability are mediated by zonulin,a protein identified as pre-haptoglobin 2,a physiological regulator of the intestinal barrier. We investigated the obesogenic and inflammatory effects of gluten and its association with the haptoglobin genotype. METHODS: This was a single blinded,crossover study,including 40 overweight or obesity women free of celiac disease. Participants adopted a gluten-free diet (GFD) for 8 weeks and consumed a gluten-free muffin (GF-M) or a gluten-containing muffin (GLU-M,24 g gluten) for 4 weeks,switching muffin type during the subsequent 4 weeks. During a follow-up period of 4 weeks we evaluated the usual diet (UD). Food diaries were collected to estimate the macronutrient intake and dietary inflammatory index (DII ). Bodyweight and composition,resting energy expenditure (REE),and cytokines were assessed. Haptoglobin alleles (Hp1 and Hp2) were genotyped to characterize zonulin expression. RESULTS: Energy and macronutrient intakes were similar during both periods,except for protein intake,which was higher during GLU-M. DII scores indicated a more inflammatory profile during the GF-M and GLU-M periods compared to UD. No differences were observed in body composition or REE between interventions when the Hp genotype was not considered. Nonetheless,those carrying the Hp2-2 genotype (overexpressing zonulin) presented lower REE and higher levels of IL6 and IL1beta only during gluten intake (GLU-M and UD) compared to age- and body mass index-matched Hp1-1 carrier. These results suggest an obesogenic and inflammatory action of gluten only in those overexpressing zonulin (Hp2-2). CONCLUSION: These results highlight the importance of zonulin as the mediator of gluten obesogenic and inflammatory effects. Our data suggest that in the presence of gluten,zonulin release is associated with a reduction of REE and an increase of inflammatory markers that are not seen in zonulin low producers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,31320223	Celiac Disease and Its Role in the Development of Metabolic Bone Disease. Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy that occurs in genetically susceptible hosts with the ingestion of gluten-containing products. Ongoing gluten consumption leads to intestinal damage,characterized by villous blunting and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes,resulting in malabsorption. Pertinent to the development of bone disease,malabsorption of calcium and vitamin D leads to secondary hyperparathyroidism and metabolic bone disease among individuals with CD. In this article,we review the pathogenesis of CD and the effects of malabsorption on bone health. Imbalances in bone resorption and formation particularly in individuals with CD and persistent disease activity ultimately lead to a state of bone loss and impaired mineralization. Initiation of a gluten-free diet is critical in the management of CD-related metabolic bone disease,demonstrating improvements in bone mineral density within the first year of dietary adherence.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,37447301	Heavy Metal and Rice in Gluten-Free Diets: Are They a Risk? A gluten-free diet (GFD) is the treatment of choice for gluten-related disorders. It has been associated with macro- and micronutrient deficiencies. Recently,consumption of arsenic-contaminated rice has raised concern because of the potential greater risk that it may represent for people on GFDs,whose rice consumption is high,since it is a fundamental cereal in GFDs. We reviewed the data published over the last 20 years in Medline and Scielo,in English,French and Spanish,on four metals (As,Hg,Cd,and Pb),to assess whether the evidence suggests that celiac disease or consumption of a GFD is associated with increased levels of blood/urinary metal concentrations. The review revealed a few articles that were directly related to the four metals and their relationships with a GFD. The evidence supports that rice-based products are a relevant source of As and other metals. Clinical studies and evaluations based on NHANES have indicated that persons on GFDs have higher As and Hg blood/urinary levels,suggesting that the diet and not the disease is responsible for it. The levels described are statistically significant compared to those of persons on complete diets,but far from toxic levels. The question of whether higher exposure to heavy metals associated with a GFD is biologically relevant remains unanswered and deserves study.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,29063352	Multivariable Analysis of Gluten-Free Pasta Elaborated with Non-Conventional Flours Based on the Phenolic Profile,Antioxidant Capacity and Color. The phenolic compounds,color and antioxidant capacity of gluten-free pasta prepared with non-conventional flours such as chickpea (CHF),unripe plantain (UPF),white maize (WMF) and blue maize (BMF) were analyzed. Fifteen phenolic compounds (five anthocyanins,five hydroxybenzoic acids,three hydroxycinnamic acids,one hydroxyphenylacetic acid and one flavonol) were identified in pasta prepared with blue maize,and 10 compounds were identified for samples prepared with white maize. The principal component analysis (PCA) led to results describing 98% of the total variance establishing a clear separation for each pasta. Both the proportion (25,50 and 75%) and type of maize flour (white and blue) affected the color parameters (L*,C ab *,h ab and DeltaE* ab ) and antioxidant properties (DPPH,ABTS and FRAP methods) of samples,thus producing gluten-free products with potential health benefits intended for general consumers (including the population with celiac disease).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,26486281	QUALITY OF LIFE EVALUATION IN CELIAC PATIENTS FROM SOUTHERN BRAZIL. BACKGROUND: Restrictions imposed by the gluten-free diet generate large changes in the daily habits of the celiac patient,causing a negative impact on quality of life. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the quality of life of patients with celiac disease on a capital in Southern Brazil. METHODS: Patients older than 18 years were included,with confirmed celiac disease for at least 60 days in the period from June to October 2013. A validated questionnaire,with specific questions to assess the patient's quality of life celiac was applied. A total score ranged from 20 to 100 points; the higher the score,worse quality of life. RESULTS: A total of 103 questionnaires were evaluated,96 (93.2%) female,with average score 56.6+-12.35 (28 to 88 points). The comparison between the questionnaire scores and family income was not significant (P=0.139). Patients diagnosed less than 1 year have poorer quality of life than those with more than 10 years (P=0.063). Patients older than 60 years had better quality of life compared with the younger ones (P=0.04). CONCLUSION: There was no association between quality of life and factors such as family income,length of diet and age at diagnosis. Chronological age greater than 60 years has positively influenced the quality of life of celiac patients.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,23184965	Structural genes of wheat and barley 5-methylcytosine DNA glycosylases and their potential applications for human health. Wheat supplies about 20% of the total food calories consumed worldwide and is a national staple in many countries. Besides being a key source of plant proteins,it is also a major cause of many diet-induced health issues,especially celiac disease. The only effective treatment for this disease is a total gluten-free diet. The present report describes an effort to develop a natural dietary therapy for this disorder by transcriptional suppression of wheat DEMETER (DME) homeologs using RNA interference. DME encodes a 5-methylcytosine DNA glycosylase responsible for transcriptional derepression of gliadins and low-molecular-weight glutenins (LMWgs) by active demethylation of their promoters in the wheat endosperm. Previous research has demonstrated these proteins to be the major source of immunogenic epitopes. In this research,barley and wheat DME genes were cloned and localized on the syntenous chromosomes. Nucleotide diversity among DME homeologs was studied and used for their virtual transcript profiling. Functional conservation of DME enzyme was confirmed by comparing the motif and domain structure within and across the plant kingdom. Presence and absence of CpG islands in prolamin gene sequences was studied as a hallmark of hypo- and hypermethylation,respectively. Finally the epigenetic influence of DME silencing on accumulation of LMWgs and gliadins was studied using 20 transformants expressing hairpin RNA in their endosperm. These transformants showed up to 85.6% suppression in DME transcript abundance and up to 76.4% reduction in the amount of immunogenic prolamins,demonstrating the possibility of developing wheat varieties compatible for the celiac patients.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,28688105	Intussusception in celiac disease: Is it a common feature in children? BACKGROUND AND AIM: There are sporadic reports of occurrence of intussusception in celiac disease (CD) but no systematic study yet. We prospectively studied the prevalence and natural history of intussusception in newly diagnosed CD. METHODS: From January 2010 to October 2013,150 children,diagnosed to have CD on the basis of positive serology and duodenal biopsy,were recruited in this study. Abdominal ultrasonography was carried out before starting gluten-free diet (GFD) and repeated in those who had intussusception,on day 3 and then weekly till the resolution of intussusception. RESULTS: The median age was 72 (range,16-204) months,and 79 (53%) were boys. Diarrhea was the presenting symptom in 119 (79%) cases. A total of 45 intussusceptions were detected in 37 (25%) children. Out of 45 intussusceptions,95% involved small bowel. All but one had asymptomatic intussusception. On GFD,intussusception resolved spontaneously within 7 days in 65%,within 14 days in 84%,and within 28 days in 92% of cases,and none required surgical or hydrostatic reduction. On univariate analysis,younger age,low weight z score,presentation with diarrhea,abdominal distension,rickets,lower serum albumin,more severe villous atrophy,and refeeding syndrome were more common in children with intussusception. On multivariate analysis,abdominal distension and hypoalbuminemia were found to be significantly associated with intussusception. CONCLUSIONS: Intussusception is frequently (25%) seen in children with newly diagnosed CD,generally asymptomatic and resolves spontaneously on GFD. It is often associated with more severe disease. Children with CD and intussusception should not be subjected to surgical/radiological intervention.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,33259438	Evaluation of Daily Lives of Children and Adolescents with Celiac Disease and Nursing Approaches. The incidence of celiac disease has been increasing in recent years. Celiac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy that emerges mostly in the childhood period. This disorder is a chronic condition of the small intestine due to gluten intake in individuals with genetic predisposition. In the treatment of celiac disease,gluten-free diet therapy is applied. However,the adaptation process to the diet may create difficulties for patients. Compliance with diet is much more difficult among patients with celiac disease in childhood and adolescence than in adult patients. Children and adolescents face distinct difficulties in their homes,at school,and in their social lives. Besides following dietary treatment,children and adolescents living with celiac disease need peer support to manage their daily routines. In this article,we aimed to discuss the problems experienced by children and adolescents living with celiac disease and nursing approaches to these problems.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,30392830	Murine Norovirus Infection Induces TH1 Inflammatory Responses to Dietary Antigens. Intestinal reovirus infection can trigger T helper 1 (TH1) immunity to dietary antigen,raising the question of whether other viruses can have a similar impact. Here we show that the acute CW3 strain of murine norovirus,but not the persistent CR6 strain,induces TH1 immunity to dietary antigen. This property of CW3 is dependent on its major capsid protein,a virulence determinant. Transcriptional profiling of mesenteric lymph nodes following infection reveals an immunopathological signature that does not segregate with protective immunity but with loss of oral tolerance,in which interferon regulatory factor 1 is critical. These data show that viral capacity to trigger specific inflammatory pathways at sites where T cell responses to dietary antigens take place interferes with the development of tolerance to an oral antigen. Collectively,these data provide a foundation for the development of therapeutic strategies to prevent TH1-mediated complex immune disorders triggered by viral infections.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,23763501	Coeliac disease,gluten-free diet and the development and progression of albuminuria in children with type 1 diabetes. OBJECTIVES: Although a diagnosis of coeliac disease (CD) may be confronting to children with type 1 diabetes and their families,we hypothesize that children with CD have lower urinary albumin excretion,a marker of renal dysfunction. RESEARCH DESIGN: Twenty-four children with type 1 diabetes and biopsy-proven CD,on a gluten-free diet for at least 1 yr,were recruited from a single paediatric diabetes clinic alongside 55 children with type 1 diabetes but without CD matched for age,gender,duration of diabetes,and glycaemic control. RESULTS: Despite comparable diabetes exposure,glycaemic control and nutritional status,children with type 1 diabetes and CD had a lower urinary albumin creatinine ratio than in diabetic subjects without CD (0.9 +- 0.3 mg/mmol vs. 1.6 +- 0.3 mg/mmol; p = 0.01). Participants with CD also showed slower progression in albuminuria over 5-yr of follow-up while a small but significant increase was observed in the children with diabetes alone (1.6 +- 0.3 mg/mmol; follow-up 2.4 +- 0.5 mg/mmol; p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: As urinary albumin excretion is continuously associated with the risk of kidney disease,it is possible to speculate that CD or its management confers a degree of renoprotection. Larger studies are required to test this hypothesis.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,33518167	All Things Gluten: A Review. Gluten is a common dietary component with a complex protein structure. It forms incomplete products of digestion,which have the potential to mount an immune response in genetically predisposed individuals,resulting in celiac disease. It also has been linked with nonceliac gluten sensitivity and irritable bowel syndrome due to wheat allergy. A gluten-free diet is an effective treatment of these conditions; however,it can lead to micronutrient and mineral deficiencies and a macronutrient imbalance with higher sugar and lipid intake. Recent popularity has led to greater availability,but increasing cost,of commercially available gluten-free products.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,29216605	Gluten peptides drive healthy and celiac monocytes toward an M2-like polarization. Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by ingested gluten in genetically susceptible individuals and sustained by both adaptive and innate immune responses. Recent studies in murine macrophages demonstrated that the activation of arginase (ARG) metabolic pathway by gluten peptides contributes to the modulation of intestinal permeability in vitro. Here we characterize the effects of gluten on arginine metabolism and cell polarization in human monocytes from both healthy and CD subjects; both a simplified enzymatic digestion of gliadin and a physiological digestion of whole wheat have been tested. Results indicate that gluten digests induce the onset of an M2-like phenotype in activated macrophages; more precisely,both isoforms of arginase,ARG1 and ARG2,are induced likely due to the inhibition of mTOR and the consequent induction of C/EBPbeta transcription factor. These effects are independent from the origin of gluten as well as from the digestive protocol employed; moreover,no statistical difference can be evidenced between healthy and CD patients,excluding a diverse predisposition of CD monocytes to gluten-triggered polarization with respect to healthy immune cells. Overall,the present findings sustain a role for arginase pathway in the immune response elicited by human monocytes toward ingested gluten that,hence,deserves particular attention when addressing the pathogenesis of CD.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Refractory coeliac disease (RCD) is described as persistence or recurrence of signs and symptoms of malabsorption with small-intestinal villous atrophy despite being on a strict gluten-free diet (GFD) for more than 12 months. RCD is a diagnosis of exclusion. There are two types of RCD,based upon the immunohistochemical features (presence of intraepithelial lymphocytes),response to treatment and prognosis. The treatment of RCD includes GFD and immunosuppressive agents.

NEGATIVE,35902684	Rotavirus vaccination is not associated with incident celiac disease or autoimmune thyroid disease in a national cohort of privately insured children. Rotavirus infection is a potential trigger for autoimmune diseases,and previous reports note associations between rotavirus vaccination and type 1 diabetes. In this report,we examine the association between rotavirus vaccination and autoimmune diseases associated with type 1 diabetes: celiac disease and autoimmune thyroiditis. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using de-identified claims data (Optum Clinformatics  Data Mart). Eligible infants were born between 2001 and 2018 and continuously enrolled from birth for at least 365 days (n = 2,$109.00,225). Twenty-nine percent (n = 613,295) of infants were born prior to the introduction of rotavirus vaccine in 2006; 32% (n = 684,214) were eligible for the vaccine but were not vaccinated; 9.6% (n = 202,016) received partial vaccination,and 28.9% received full vaccination (n = 609,700). There were 1379 cases of celiac disease and 1000 cases of autoimmune thyroiditis. Children who were born prior to the introduction of rotavirus vaccine in 2006 had lower risk of celiac disease compared to unvaccinated children born after 2006 (hazard ratio [HR] 0.71,95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59,0.85). However,children who were partially vaccinated (HR 0.90,95% CI 0.73,1.11) or fully vaccinated (HR 1.03,95% CI 0.88,1.21) had similar risk to eligible,unvaccinated children. Risk of autoimmune thyroiditis was similar by vaccination status. We conclude that rotavirus vaccination is not associated with increased or decreased risk for celiac disease or autoimmune thyroiditis.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NEGATIVE,29710789	Daily Intake of Milk Powder and Risk of Celiac Disease in Early Childhood: A Nested Case-Control Study. Milk powder and gluten are common components in Swedish infants' diets. Whereas large intakes of gluten early in life increases the risk of celiac disease in genetically at-risk Swedish children,no study has yet evaluated if intake of milk powder by 2 years of age is associated with celiac disease. A 1-to-3 nested case-control study,comprised of 207 celiac disease children and 621 controls matched for sex,birth year,and HLA genotype,was performed on a birth cohort of HLA-DR3-DQ2 and/or DR4-DQ8-positive children. Subjects were screened annually for celiac disease using tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies (tTGA). Three-day food records estimated the mean intake of milk powder at ages 6 months,9 months,12 months,18 months,and 24 months. Conditional logistic regression calculated odds ratios (OR) at last intake prior to seroconversion of tTGA positivity,and for each time-point respectively and adjusted for having a first-degree relative with celiac disease and gluten intake. Intake of milk powder prior to seroconversion of tTGA positivity was not associated with celiac disease (OR = 1.00; 95% CI = 0.99,1.03; p = 0.763). In conclusion,intake of milk powder in early childhood is not associated with celiac disease in genetically susceptible children.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NEGATIVE,27367722	Supplementation of Reduced Gluten Barley Diet with Oral Prolyl Endopeptidase Effectively Abrogates Enteropathy-Associated Changes in Gluten-Sensitive Macaques. Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder that affects approximately three million people in the United States. Furthermore,non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) affects an estimated additional 6% of the population,e.g.,20 million in the U.S. The only effective treatment of CD and NCGS requires complete removal of gluten sources from the diet. While required adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) is extremely difficult to accomplish,efforts to develop additional supportive treatments are needed. To facilitate these efforts,we developed a gluten-sensitive (GS) rhesus macaque model to study the effects of novel therapies. Recently reported results from phase one of this project suggest that partial improvement-but not remission-of gluten-induced disease can be accomplished by 100-fold reduction of dietary gluten,i.e.,200 ppm-by replacement of conventional dietary sources of gluten with a mutant,reduced gluten (RG) barley (lys3a)-derived source. The main focus of this (phase two) study was to determine if the inflammatory effects of the residual gluten in lys3a mutant barley grain could be further reduced by oral supplementation with a prolylendopeptidase (PE). Results reveal that PE supplementation of RG barley diet induces more complete immunological,histopathological and clinical remission than RG barley diet alone. The combined effects of RG barley diet and PE supplementation resulted in a further decrease of inflammatory mediators IFN-gamma and TNF secretion by peripheral lymphocytes,as well as decreased plasma anti-gliadin and anti-intestinal tissue transglutaminase (TG2) antibodies,diminished active caspase production in small intestinal mucosa,and eliminated clinical diarrhea-all comparable with a gluten-free diet induced remission. In summary,the beneficial results of a combined RG barley and PE administration in GS macaques may warrant the investigation of similar synergistic approaches.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,33233787	The Diverse Potential of Gluten from Different Durum Wheat Varieties in Triggering Celiac Disease: A Multilevel In Vitro,Ex Vivo and In Vivo Approach. The reasons behind the increasing prevalence of celiac disease (CD) worldwide are still not fully understood. This study adopted a multilevel approach (in vitro,ex vivo,in vivo) to assess the potential of gluten from different wheat varieties in triggering CD. Peptides triggering CD were identified and quantified in mixtures generated from simulated gastrointestinal digestion of wheat varieties (n = 82). Multivariate statistics enabled the discrimination of varieties generating low impact on CD (e.g.,Saragolla) and high impact (e.g.,Cappelli). Enrolled subjects (n = 46) were: 19 healthy subjects included in the control group; 27 celiac patients enrolled for the in vivo phase. Celiacs were divided into a gluten-free diet group (CD-GFD),and a GFD with Saragolla-based pasta group (CD-Sar). The diet was followed for 3 months. Data were compared between CD-Sar and CD-GFD before and after the experimental diet,demonstrating a limited ability of Saragolla to trigger immunity,although not comparable to a GFD. Ex vivo studies showed that Saragolla and Cappelli activated immune responses,although with great variability among patients. The diverse potential of durum wheat varieties in triggering CD immune response was demonstrated. Saragolla is not indicated for celiacs,yet it has a limited potential to trigger adverse immune response.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,9610465	Screening semen donors for hereditary diseases. The Fairfax cryobank experience. OBJECTIVE: To study the carrier frequency of hereditary diseases in potential semen donors with no family history of a genetic disease. STUDY DESIGN: Carrier screening was performed on potential semen donors for chromosomal abnormalities,cystic fibrosis,alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency,hemoglobinopathies,Tay-Sachs disease,Gaucher disease,Canavan disease,and hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (the BRCA1 185delAG mutation). The screening regimen used for each donor was dictated by his ethnic background. RESULTS: Among 361 individuals screened for chromosomal abnormalities,1 carried an inversion,and 4 were possible mosaics. Fifteen of 407 potential donors carried cystic fibrosis,18 of 209 carried alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency,and 2 of 74 carried a hemoglobinopathy. No carriers of Tay-Sachs disease (56 screened),Gaucher disease (32 screened),Canavan disease (22 screened) or the BRCA1 185delAG mutation (22 screened) were found. CONCLUSION: Screening semen donors for a number of genetic diseases that are passed silently from generation to generation is warranted since family history alone cannot identify them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,10894262	Knock-out mouse for Canavan disease: a model for gene transfer to the central nervous system. BACKGROUND: Canavan disease (CD) is an autosomal recessive leukodystrophy characterized by deficiency of aspartoacylase (ASPA) and increased levels of N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) in brain and body fluids,severe mental retardation and early death. Gene therapy has been attempted in a number of children with CD. The lack of an animal model has been a limiting factor in developing vectors for the treatment of CD. This paper reports the successful creation of a knock-out mouse for Canavan disease that can be used for gene transfer. METHODS: Genomic library lambda knock-out shuttle (lambdaKOS) was screened and a specific pKOS/Aspa clone was isolated and used to create a plasmid with 10 base pair (bp) deletion of exon four of the murine aspa. Following linearization,the plasmid was electroporated to ES cells. Correctly targeted ES clones were identified following positive and negative selection and confirmed by Southern analysis. Chimeras were generated by injection of ES cells to blastocysts. Germ line transmission was achieved by the birth of heterozygous mice as confirmed by Southern analysis. RESULTS: Heterozygous mice born following these experiments have no overt phenotype. The homozygous mice display neurological impairment,macrocephaly,generalized white matter disease,deficient ASPA activity and high levels of NAA in urine. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) of the brain of the homozygous mice show white matter changes characteristic of Canavan disease and elevated NAA levels. CONCLUSION: The newly created ASPA deficient mouse establishes an important animal model of Canavan disease. This model should be useful for developing gene transfer vectors to treat Canavan disease. Vectors for the central nervous system (CNS) and modulation of NAA levels in the brain should further add to the understanding of the pathophysiology of Canavan disease. Data generated from this animal model will be useful for developing strategies for gene therapy in other neurodegenerative diseases.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,27039844	rAAV Gene Therapy in a Canavan's Disease Mouse Model Reveals Immune Impairments and an Extended Pathology Beyond the Central Nervous System. Aspartoacylase (AspA) gene mutations cause the pediatric lethal neurodegenerative Canavan disease (CD). There is emerging promise of successful gene therapy for CD using recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs). Here,we report an intracerebroventricularly delivered AspA gene therapy regime using three serotypes of rAAVs at a 20-fold reduced dose than previously described in AspA(-/-) mice,a bona-fide mouse model of CD. Interestingly,central nervous system (CNS)-restricted therapy prolonged survival over systemic therapy in CD mice but failed to sustain motor functions seen in systemically treated mice. Importantly,we reveal through histological and functional examination of untreated CD mice that AspA deficiency in peripheral tissues causes morphological and functional abnormalities in this heretofore CNS-defined disorder. We demonstrate for the first time that AspA deficiency,possibly through excessive N-acetyl aspartic acid accumulation,elicits both a peripheral and CNS immune response in CD mice. Our data establish a role for peripheral tissues in CD pathology and serve to aid the development of more efficacious and sustained gene therapy for this disease.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore",an adolescent Marfan syndrome-specific International Classification of Functioning,Disability and Health for Children and Youth (ICF-CY) model derived from the data describing the adolescent perceived impact of Marfan syndrome on functioning,disability and its contextual factors. Adolescents perceived problems in keeping up with peers in school,sports,leisure and friendships/relationships,and they could not meet work requirements. Moreover,participants perceived to differ from peers due to their appearance and disability. Contextual factors: coping with Marfan syndrome,self-esteem/image,knowledge about Marfan syndrome,support from family/friends/teachers,ability to express needs and peer-group acceptation acted individually as barrier or facilitator for identified themes.Conclusion: Adolescents with Marfan syndrome perceived limitations and restrictions in (physical) functioning. They perceived problems in keeping up with peers and perceived to differ from peers due to their appearance and disability. This warrants awareness and tailored physical,psychosocial,educational and environmental support programmes to improve (physical) functioning and empowerment of adolescents with Marfan syndrome.What is known:  Marfan syndrome is a hereditary connective tissue disorder.  Marfan syndrome affects multiple systems.What is new:  Adolescents with Marfan syndrome perceive (1) problems in keeping up with peers in school,sports,leisure,friendships/relationships and work (2) to differ from peers due to their appearance and disability.  An adolescent Marfan syndrome-specific International Classification of Functioning,Disability and Health for Children and Youth model derived from the data describing the adolescent perceived impact of Marfan syndrome on functioning,"disability and contextual factors.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,26546710	Background differences in baseline and stimulated MMP levels influence abdominal aortic aneurysm susceptibility. OBJECTIVE: Evidence has demonstrated profound influence of genetic background on cardiovascular phenotypes. Murine models in Marfan syndrome (MFS) have shown that genetic background-related variations affect thoracic aortic aneurysm formation,rupture,and lifespan of mice. MFS mice with C57Bl/6 genetic background are less susceptible to aneurysm formation compared to the 129/SvEv genetic background. In this study,we hypothesize that susceptibility to abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) will be increased in 129/SvEv mice versus C57Bl/6 mice. We tested this hypothesis by assessing differences in aneurysm size,tissue properties,immune response,and MMP expression. METHODS: Mice of C57Bl/6 or 129/SvEv background underwent AAA induction by periaortic application of CaCl2. Baseline aortic diameters,tissue properties and MMP levels were measured. After aneurysm induction,diameters,MMP expression,and immune response (macrophage infiltration and bone marrow transplantation) were measured. RESULTS: Aneurysms were larger in 129/SvEv mice than C57Bl/6 mice (83.0% +- 13.6 increase compared to 57.8% +- 6.4). The aorta was stiffer in the 129/SvEv mice compared to C57Bl/6 mice (952.5 kPa +- 93.6 versus 621.4 kPa +- 84.2). Baseline MMP-2 and post-aneurysm MMP-2 and -9 levels were higher in 129/SvEv aortas compared to C57Bl/6 aortas. Elastic lamella disruption/fragmentation and macrophage infiltration were increased in 129/SvEv mice. Myelogenous cell reversal by bone marrow transplantation did not affect aneurysm size. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that 129/SvEv mice are more susceptible to AAA compared to C57Bl/6 mice. Intrinsic properties of the aorta between the two strains of mice,including baseline expression of MMP-2,influence susceptibility to AAA.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,28482718	Pregnancy and mesenchimal dysplasias (Marfan syndrome,Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia). The objective of this article is to attract the attention of clinical physicians to the rare but extremely relevant clinical pathology of mesenchymal dysplasias (Marfan syndrome,Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia) and especially specific characteristics of such diseases during pregnancy. Connective tissue pathology can cover different organs and systems,symptoms of the same disease can vary in different patients thus making diagnostics significantly difficult. Here clinical diagnostic criteria and methods of molecular diagnostics of diseases are described. The pathogenesis of mesenchymal dysplasias is not currently well understood. For the patients with mesenchymal dysplasias pregnancy is fraught with high risk of life-threatening complications. The preferred delivery method for such patients is caesarean section.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,30849283	Perceptions of the impact of chorea on health-related quality of life in Huntington disease (HD): A qualitative analysis of individuals across the HD spectrum,family members,and clinicians. Chorea,a hallmark symptom of Huntington's disease (HD),is characterized by jerky involuntary movements affecting the whole body that can interfere with daily functioning and impact health-related quality of life (HRQOL). To characterize chorea's impact on everyday functioning and HRQOL and identify patterns of perception and experiences of chorea among patients,caregivers,and providers. Data from focus groups of individuals with manifest HD (n = 8 early-stage HD; n = 16 late-stage HD),individuals at-risk or prodromal HD (n = 16),family HD caregivers (n = 17),and HD clinicians (n = 25). Focus group recordings were transcribed verbatim and analysed via constant comparison to identify meaningful and salient themes of living with chorea. Global themes of chorea's impact identified included: watching for chorea,experiences of stigma,and constraints on independence and relationships. Themes distinct to specific respondent groups included: Vigilance (at risk,prodromal); adaptation to chorea (early-stage); loss of autonomy and social life (late-stage); monitoring engagement (family caregivers) and safety (clinical providers). Living with chorea significantly constrains daily functioning,interactions,and HRQOL across the HD disease spectrum. Addressing these impacts via appropriate management of chorea can potentially enhance functioning,HRQOL,and overall satisfaction for persons with HD and their families.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,20423385	Huntington disease: families' experiences of healthcare services. AIM: This paper is a report of a study of the perceptions of family caregivers regarding the availability and adequacy of health and social care services for their family member with Huntington disease,and to compare findings from these reports in United Kingdom and United States of America samples. BACKGROUND: Huntington disease is an inherited neurodegenerative condition. Family members often take responsibility for care of relatives with long-term conditions. Studies have demonstrated there are both positive and negative outcomes for carers. METHODS: During 2006 and 2007,respondents from the United Kingdom (n = 108) and the United States (n = 119) who were caring for a relative affected with Huntington disease completed the Community Health Care Services Scale to identify areas of concern and the extent to which specific issues bothered carers. Data were analysed using statistical tests including chi-square,t-tests and factor analysis. Results were compared between carers in the two cohorts. RESULTS: Three main factors were derived: 'community resources',individualized care' and 'knowledge of Huntington disease'. Carers had concerns about the knowledge of healthcare professionals providing care and thought that there were insufficient services to support them and the affected person. There were different challenges for carers when the affected person had a long-term neurodegenerative condition because these carers were also likely to have responsibilities for earning and caring for children. CONCLUSION: Comprehensive facilities and resources are needed to support families affected by long-term complex conditions. Healthcare professionals need to be aware of the health needs of carers as well as those of the affected person.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,27393121	New measures to capture end of life concerns in Huntington disease: Meaning and Purpose and Concern with Death and Dying from HDQLIFE (a patient-reported outcomes measurement system). PURPOSE: Huntington disease (HD) is an incurable terminal disease. Thus,end of life (EOL) concerns are common in these individuals. A quantitative measure of EOL concerns in HD would enable a better understanding of how these concerns impact health-related quality of life. Therefore,we developed new measures of EOL for use in HD. METHODS: An EOL item pool of 45 items was field tested in 507 individuals with prodromal or manifest HD. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (EFA and CFA,respectively) were conducted to establish unidimensional item pools. Item response theory (IRT) and differential item functioning analyses were applied to the identified unidimensional item pools to select the final items. RESULTS: EFA and CFA supported two separate unidimensional sets of items: Concern with Death and Dying (16 items),and Meaning and Purpose (14 items). IRT and DIF supported the retention of 12 Concern with Death and Dying items and 4 Meaning and Purpose items. IRT data supported the development of both a computer adaptive test (CAT) and a 6-item,static short form for Concern with Death and Dying. CONCLUSION: The HDQLIFE Concern with Death and Dying CAT and corresponding 6-item short form,and the 4-item calibrated HDQLIFE Meaning and Purpose scale demonstrate excellent psychometric properties. These new measures have the potential to provide clinically meaningful information about end-of-life preferences and concerns to clinicians and researchers working with individuals with HD. In addition,these measures may also be relevant and useful for other terminal conditions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,30007561	AAV5-miHTT Gene Therapy Demonstrates Broad Distribution and Strong Human Mutant Huntingtin Lowering in a Huntington's Disease Minipig Model. Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene. Previously,we showed strong huntingtin reduction and prevention of neuronal dysfunction in HD rodents using an engineered microRNA targeting human huntingtin,delivered via adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype 5 vector with a transgene encoding an engineered miRNA against HTT mRNA (AAV5-miHTT). One of the challenges of rodents as a model of neurodegenerative diseases is their relatively small brain,making successful translation to the HD patient difficult. This is particularly relevant for gene therapy approaches,where distribution achieved upon local administration into the parenchyma is likely dependent on brain size and structure. Here,we aimed to demonstrate the translation of huntingtin-lowering gene therapy to a large-animal brain. We investigated the feasibility,efficacy,and tolerability of one-time intracranial administration of AAV5-miHTT in the transgenic HD (tgHD) minipig model. We detected widespread dose-dependent distribution of AAV5-miHTT throughout the tgHD minipig brain that correlated with the engineered microRNA expression. Both human mutant huntingtin mRNA and protein were significantly reduced in all brain regions transduced by AAV5-miHTT. The combination of widespread vector distribution and extensive huntingtin lowering observed with AAV5-miHTT supports the translation of a huntingtin-lowering gene therapy for HD from preclinical studies into the clinic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,31190171	End-of-life measures in Huntington disease: HDQLIFE Meaning and Purpose,Concern with Death and Dying,and End of Life Planning. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Huntington disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. There are no HD-specific measures to assess for end-of-life (EOL) preferences that have been validated for clinical use. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate reliability and validity of three HD-specific EOL measures for use in and clinical research settings. METHODS: We examined internal reliability,test-retest reliability,floor and ceiling effects,convergent and discriminant validity,known groups' validity,measurement error,and change over time to systematically examine reliability and validity of the HDQLIFE EOL measures. RESULTS: Internal consistency and test-retest reliability were > 0.70. The measures were generally free of floor and ceiling effects and measurement error was minimal. Convergent and discriminant validity were consistent with well-known constructs in the field. Hypotheses for known groups validity were partially supported (there were generally group differences for the EOL planning measures,but not for meaning and purpose or concern with death and dying). Measurement error was acceptable and there were minimal changes over time across the EOL measures. CONCLUSIONS: Results support the clinical utility of the HDQLIFE EOL measures in persons with HD.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,23023430	Poor insight into memory impairment in patients with Huntington disease. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients suffering from Huntington disease (HD) have been shown to present with poor self-awareness of a variety of symptoms. The study aimed to assess the self-awareness of memory impairment in HD in comparison to advanced Parkinson disease (PD),mild PD and cervical dystonia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Self-awareness was tested in 23 patients with HD by comparing patient and caregiver ratings in reference to clinical control groups (25 patients with advanced PD,21 with mild PD and 20 with cervical dystonia). Self-awareness was tested using the Self Rating Scale of Memory Functions,which was administered to both the patients and the caregivers. Neuropsychological assessment addressed general cognitive status (Mini-Mental State Examination),verbal learning (Auditory Verbal Learning Test,15-word list) and mood (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale). RESULTS: Patients with HD significantly underestimated their memory dysfunction. Underestimation of memory deficit correlated with disease duration and disease severity in HD. CONCLUSIONS: Huntington disease patients underestimate memory dysfunction. These results add to the previous reports on poor insight in HD in other domains and suggest that anosognosia in HD,albeit usually rather mild,may be a generalized phenomenon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,6219582	Attitudes regarding utilization of artificial insemination by donor in Huntington disease. We report on a study of attitudes toward artificial insemination by donor (AID) of persons at risk for Huntington disease (HD). The subjects of the study were 91 at risk persons and 68 matched controls. Both groups were divided by sex and age (45 yr less than or equal to vs greater than or equal to 46 yr). Demographic data included age,occupation,marital status,religion,education,ethnic background,and family size. We recorded 1) attitudes toward reproduction,2) nature of contact with affected family member(s),3) effects of HD on family planning,4) attitudes toward AID,and 5) concern about donor selection criteria. Results suggest that 1) men and women differ in several ways with regard to their views about AID,and 2) that more vigorous educational programs might increase utilization of AID for the prevention of not only HD,but other human genetic diseases as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,21489966	Gene therapy in mouse models of huntington disease. Huntingtin,the protein that when mutated causes Huntington disease (HD),has many known interactors and participates in diverse cellular functions. Mutant Htt (mHtt) engages in a variety of aberrant interactions that lead to pathological gain of toxic functions as well as loss of normal functions. The broad symptomatology of HD,including diminished voluntary motor control,cognitive decline,and psychiatric disturbances,reflects the multifaceted neuropathology. Although currently available therapies for HD focus on symptom management,the autosomal dominant cause and the adult onset make this disease an ideal candidate for genetic intervention. A variety of gene therapy approaches have been tested in mouse models of HD,ranging from those aimed at ameliorating downstream pathology or replacing lost neuronal populations to more upstream strategies to reduce mHtt levels. Here the authors review the results of these preclinical trials.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,10205260	A worldwide assessment of the frequency of suicide,suicide attempts,or psychiatric hospitalization after predictive testing for Huntington disease. Prior to the implementation of predictive-testing programs for Huntington disease (HD),significant concern was raised concerning the likelihood of catastrophic events (CEs),particularly in those persons receiving an increased-risk result. We have investigated the frequency of CEs-that is,suicide,suicide attempt,and psychiatric hospitalization-after an HD predictive-testing result,through questionnaires sent to predictive-testing centers worldwide. A total of 44 persons (0.97%) in a cohort of 4,527 test participants had a CE: 5 successful suicides,21 suicide attempts,and 18 hospitalizations for psychiatric reasons. All persons committing suicide had signs of HD,whereas 11 (52.4%) of 21 persons attempting suicide and 8 (44.4%) of 18 who had a psychiatric hospitalization were symptomatic. A total of 11 (84.6%) of 13 asymptomatic persons who experienced a CE during the first year after HD predictive testing received an increased-risk result. Factors associated with an increased risk of a CE included (a) a psychiatric history </=5 years prior to testing and (b) unemployed status. The frequency of CEs did not differ between those persons receiving results of predictive testing through linkage analysis in whom there was only changes in direction of risk and those persons receiving definitive results after analysis for the mutation underlying HD. These findings provide insights into the frequency,associated factors,and timing of CEs in a worldwide cohort of persons receiving predictive-testing results and,as such,highlight persons for whom ongoing support may be beneficial.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,27856625	Longitudinal Small-Animal PET Imaging of the zQ175 Mouse Model of Huntington Disease Shows In Vivo Changes of Molecular Targets in the Striatum and Cerebral Cortex. Since the discovery of the HTT gene in 1993,numerous animal models have been developed to study the progression of Huntington disease (HD) and to evaluate potential new therapeutics. In the present study,we used small-animal PET to characterize the expression of molecular targets in the recently reported HD animal model,the zQ175 mouse model. Methods: Male heterozygous zQ175 (Htttm1Mfc/190JChdi,CHDI-81003003) and wild-type (WT,C57BL/6J) animals were imaged with the dopamine D2 receptor radioligand 11C-raclopride,the PDE10A radioligand 18F-MNI-659,the dopamine D1 receptor radioligand 11C-NNC 112,and the 5-HT2A radioligand 11C-MDL 100907 at 6 and 9 mo of age. The outcome measure was the binding potential (BPND),using the cerebellum as the reference region. Selected regions of interest were the striatum for all radioligands and additionally the striatum,rostral cortex,caudal cortex,and hippocampus for 11C-NNC 112 and 11C-MDL 100907. Results: At 6 mo of age,the BPND in the striatum was lower in zQ175 than WT animals by 40% for 11C-raclopride,by 52% for 18F-MNI-659,by 28% for 11C-NNC,and by 11% for 11C-MDL 100907. In the rostral cortex,D1 receptor binding was 22% lower in zQ175 than WT animals. We found an overall reduction in D1 and 5-HT2A binding in the hippocampus of zQ175 compared with WT animals. The BPND of 11C-MDL 100907 in the caudal cortex was also lower in zQ175 WT animals. At 9 mo,there was a slight further reduction of D1,D2,and 5-HT2ABPND in the striatum,whereas PDE10A reached a plateau. Cortical markers were also slightly further decreased at 9 mo in zQ175 animals. Conclusion: Our study indicates a marked reduction of ligand binding to D1 and D2 and 5-HT2A receptors as well as loss of PDE10A enzyme in the striatum of zQ175 mice as compared with WT animals,in agreement with data obtained in clinical PET studies of patients with HD. The zQ175 mouse model recapitulates the expression pattern seen in humans with HD and may have value in further elucidating pathophysiologic events and therapeutic strategies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,16500684	Chemical modifiers of unstable expanded simple sequence repeats: what goes up,could come down. A mounting number of inherited human disorders,including Huntington disease,myotonic dystrophy,fragile X syndrome,Friedreich ataxia and several spinocerebellar ataxias,have been associated with the expansion of unstable simple sequence DNA repeats. Despite a similar genetic basis,pathogenesis in these disorders is mediated by a variety of both loss and gain of function pathways. Thus,therapies targeted at downstream pathology are likely to be disease specific. Characteristically,disease-associated expanded alleles in these disorders are highly unstable in the germline and somatic cells,with a tendency towards further expansion. Whereas germline expansion accounts for the phenomenon of anticipation,tissue-specific,age-dependent somatic expansion may contribute towards the tissue-specificity and progressive nature of the symptoms. Thus,somatic expansion presents as a novel therapeutic target in these disorders. Suppression of somatic expansion should be therapeutically beneficial,whilst reductions in repeat length could be curative. It is well established that both cis- and trans-acting genetic modifiers play key roles in the control of repeat dynamics. Importantly,recent data have revealed that expanded CAG.CTG repeats are also sensitive to a variety of trans-acting chemical modifiers. These data provide an exciting proof of principle that drug induced suppression of somatic expansion might indeed be feasible. Moreover,as our understanding of the mechanism of expansion is refined more rational approaches to chemical intervention in the expansion pathway can be envisioned. For instance,the demonstration that expansion of CAG.CTG repeats is dependent on the Msh2,Msh3 and Pms2 genes,highlights components of the DNA mismatch repair pathway as therapeutic targets. In addition to potential therapeutic applications,the response of expanded simple repeats to genotoxic assault suggests such sequences could also have utility as bio-monitors of environmentally induced genetic damage in the soma.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,36640151	Impact of paternal age on assisted reproductive technology outcomes and offspring health: a systematic review. BACKGROUND: The increase in paternal age and the percentage of births after assisted reproductive technologies (ART) may have consequences on offspring and society's position regarding access to ART must be questioned. Most countries recommend limiting ART to men under 60 years. What is the rationale for this threshold? OBJECTIVE: This systematic review assesses scientific arguments to establish links between paternal age,male fertility,and offspring health. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using the PRISMA guidelines,this systematic review of the literature analyzed 111 articles selected after screening PubMed,ScienceDirect,and Web of Science for articles published between January 1,1995 and December 31,2021. RESULTS: A strong correlation was highlighted between advanced paternal age and a decrease of some sperm parameters (semen volume and sperm motility) and infant morbidity (exponentially increased incidence of achondroplasia and Apert syndrome,and more moderately increased incidence of autism and schizophrenia). The impact of paternal age on pregnancy and fetal aneuploidy rates is more controversial. No association was found with spontaneous abortion rates. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The scientific parameters should be explained to older parents undergoing ART. And for countries that discuss a limit on paternal age for access to ART,the debate requires consideration of social and ethical arguments.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,31462712	The mitochondrial carrier Citrin plays a role in regulating cellular energy during carcinogenesis. Citrin,encoded by SLC25A13 gene,is an inner mitochondrial transporter that is part of the malate-aspartate shuttle,which regulates the NAD+/NADH ratio between the cytosol and mitochondria. Citrullinemia type II (CTLN-II) is an inherited disorder caused by germline mutations in SLC25A13,manifesting clinically in growth failure that can be alleviated by dietary restriction of carbohydrates. The association of citrin with glycolysis and NAD+/NADH ratio led us to hypothesize that it may play a role in carcinogenesis. Indeed,we find that citrin is upregulated in multiple cancer types and is essential for supplementing NAD+ for glycolysis and NADH for oxidative phosphorylation. Consequently,citrin deficiency associates with autophagy,whereas its overexpression in cancer cells increases energy production and cancer invasion. Furthermore,based on the human deleterious mutations in citrin,we found a potential inhibitor of citrin that restricts cancerous phenotypes in cells. Collectively,our findings suggest that targeting citrin may be of benefit for cancer therapy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,24131980	Liver-directed adeno-associated virus serotype 8 gene transfer rescues a lethal murine model of citrullinemia type 1. Citrullinemia type 1 (CTLN1) is an autosomal recessive disorder of metabolism caused by a deficiency of argininosuccinate synthetase. Despite optimal management,CTLN1 patients still suffer from lethal metabolic instability and experience life-threatening episodes of acute hyperammonemia. A murine model of CTLN1 (fold/fold) that displays lethality within the first 21 days of life was used to determine the efficacy of adeno-associated viral (AAV) gene transfer as a potential therapy. An AAV serotype 8 (AAV8) vector was engineered to express the human ASS1 cDNA under the control of a liver-specific promoter (thyroxine-binding globulin,TBG),AAV8-TBG-hASS1,and delivered to 7-10 days old mice via intraperitoneal injection. Greater than 95% of the mice were rescued from lethality and survival was extended beyond 100 days after receiving a single dose of vector. AAV8-TBG-hASS1 treatment resulted in liver-specific expression of hASS1,increased ASS1 enzyme activity,reduction in plasma ammonia and citrulline concentrations and significant phenotypic improvement of the fold/fold growth and skin phenotypes. These experiments highlight a gene transfer approach using AAV8 vector for liver-targeted gene therapy that could serve as a treatment for CTLN1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,29358698	Production of Wilson Disease Model Rabbits with Homology-Directed Precision Point Mutations in the ATP7B Gene Using the CRISPR/Cas9 System. CRISPR/Cas9 has recently been developed as an efficient genome engineering tool. The rabbit is a suitable animal model for studies of metabolic diseases. In this study,we generated ATP7B site-directed point mutation rabbits to simulate a major mutation type in Asians (p. Arg778Leu) with Wilson disease (WD) by using the CRISPR/Cas9 system combined with single-strand DNA oligonucleotides (ssODNs). The efficiency of the precision point mutation was 52.94% when zygotes were injected 14 hours after HCG treatment and was significantly higher than that of zygotes injected 19 hours after HCG treatment (14.29%). The rabbits carrying the allele with mutant ATP7B died at approximately three months of age. Additionally,the copper content in the livers of rabbits at the onset of WD increased nine-fold,a level similar to the five-fold increase observed in humans with WD. Thus,the efficiency of precision point mutations increases when RNAs are injected into zygotes at earlier stages,and the ATP7B mutant rabbits are a potential model for human WD disease with applications in pathological analysis,clinical treatment and gene therapy research.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,29961769	Population genomics in South East Asia captures unexpectedly high carrier frequency for treatable inherited disorders. PURPOSE: Genomic studies have demonstrated the necessity of ethnicity-specific population data to ascertain variant pathogenicity for disease diagnosis and treatment. This study examined the carrier prevalence of treatable inherited disorders (TIDs),where early diagnosis of at-risk offspring can significantly improve clinical outcomes. METHODS: Existing exome/ genome sequencing data of 831 Singaporeans were aggregated and examined for disease causing variants in 104 genes associated with 80 TIDs. RESULTS: Among the 831 Singaporean participants,genomic variant filtering and analysis identified 1 in 18 individuals (6%) to be carriers amongst one of 13 TIDs. Citrin deficiency and Wilson disease had the highest carrier frequency of 1 in 41,and 1 in 103 individuals,respectively. The pathogenic variants associated with citrin deficiency were 24 times more prevalent in our local cohorts when compared to Western cohorts. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the value of a population specific genomic database to determine true disease prevalence and has enabled the discovery of carrier frequencies of treatable genetic conditions specific to South East Asian populations,which are currently underestimated in existing data sources. This study framework can be adapted to other population groups and expanded to multiple genetic conditions to inform health policies directing precision medicine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,26018347	Early Application of Auxiliary Partial Orthotopic Liver Transplantation in Murine Model of Wilson Disease. BACKGROUND: Liver transplantation (LT) is the only option of treatment for Wilson disease (WD) when chelation therapy fails,but it is limited due to the shortage of donor. Auxiliary partial orthotopic LT (APOLT) has been performed successfully in end-stage WD patients,which expands the donor pool. METHODS: Atp7bmice were used as experimental model of WD. Eight- and 20-week-old mice were used as different timepoints to perform APOLT. Serum copper,tissue copper,serum ceruloplasmin (CP),and liver histological examination were observed after operation. RESULTS: Hepatic and serum copper levels in Atp7b mice decreased after APOLT,and copper metabolism disorder of WD mice was relieved at both early and late stages. The progression of pathology in the native liver was delayed only when transplantation was performed at an early stage. CONCLUSIONS: Auxiliary partial orthotopic LT can significantly improve copper metabolism disorder in the Atp7b mice,and early transplantation may prevent the disease progression.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,8605606	Systemic dispositions of molybdenum and copper after tetrathiomolybdate injection in LEC rats. Mutant Long-Evans rats with a cinnamon coat-color (LEC rats) have been established as an animal model for Wilson disease,a genetic disorder of copper (Cu) metabolism. Systemic disposition of molybdenum (Mo) and altered distributions of Cu were compared in eight organs between LEC rats and Wistar rats (normal) at different times after a single intraperitoneal injection of tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) for chelation therapy. Excretion through urine and feces was also examined. Hepatic disposition of Mo was dramatically increased in LEC rats,suggesting that the interaction of TTM with Cu results in enhanced uptake of Mo. Concentrations of Mo and Cu decreased in the liver of LEC rats over time,whereas those in the spleen increased. Although the concentration of Mo taken up by the kidney decreased over time after an initial increase in both rats,Cu concentration increased over time. Cu was not redistributed to the brain. Excretion of Mo through urine was decreased and that into feces was increased in LEC rats compared with those in Wistar rats. These results indicate that TTM is taken up by the liver depending on the Cu content,and the Cu and Mo removed from the liver are mostly excreted through feces. Redistribution of Cu was observed in the spleen and kidneys,but not in the brain.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,8605607	Molybdenum and copper kinetics after tetrathiomolybdate injection in LEC rats: specific role of serum albumin. Chelation therapy with tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) was applied to Long-Evans rats with a cinnamon coat-color (LEC rats),an animal model for Wilson disease,to remove copper (Cu) accumulated in the liver in a form bound to metallothionein (MT). Changes in molybdenum (Mo) and Cu concentrations and their biological forms in serum of LEC rats determined at different times after a single intraperitoneal injection were compared with those of Wistar (normal) rats. The change in Mo concentration in serum of normal rats was mono-phasic,whereas in LEC rats it was bi-phasic. The phase in normal rats and the first phase in LEC rats appeared to reflect the process of uptake and disappearance of TTM in the livers of Wistar and LEC rats. On the other hand,the second phase in LEC rats paralleled the changes of Cu and appeared to reflect the complex formation (Cu/thiomolybdate complex) between Mo and Cu accumulated in the liver. The complex was specifically bound to albumin as determined by high performance liquid chromatography with inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (HPLC/ICP-MS). The results suggested that the changes in the Mo concentration in serum reflected the amount of Cu in the liver.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,"11653951	""Commentary on Zohar's """"Prospects for 'genetic therapy' -- can a person benefit from being altered? In his paper on the effects of Prenatal Genetic Intervention (PGI) on personal identity",Noam Zohar comes to a conclusion about genetic makeup and the uses of gene therapy quite different from the one I reach in another piece in this issue.  Zohar's argument rests on the contention that personal identity changes with alteration of the genome,"following what I have identified as the """"constitutive"""" view.  To see that this is the pillar supporting the weight of his argument",consider the following.  Questions of identity aside,how can it be that altering the genome of children suffering from Lesch-Nyhan syndrome or Tay-Sachs disease so that they now produce the enzyme that they formerly lacked does not benefit them?  Clearly,if their identities were not changed,such individuals would in fact realize great benefit from PGI,since the devastating bad effects of the genetic flaw would be avoided.  Such a change would certainly make the altered individuals better off,that is,it would benefit them.  On this,"Zohar and I do not disagree.  Persistence of identity through such genetic change is the sticking point.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,16698380	Xanthine urolithiasis. Xanthine calculi are uncommonly encountered stones. When they occur,they typically do so in association with inborn metabolic disorders such as hereditary xanthinuria or Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. They may also occur in association with states of profound hyperuricemia such as myeloproliferative disease after treatment with allopurinol. If the underlying disorder is not addressed,a high risk of stone recurrence exists. Therefore,to raise clinical awareness,we reviewed and report our experience in the treatment of patients with these stones,discussing the underlying pathophysiology and approach to treatment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,3821905	HPRT-deficient (Lesch-Nyhan) mouse embryos derived from germline colonization by cultured cells. Embryonal stem (ES) cell lines,established in culture from peri-implantation mouse blastocysts,can colonize both the somatic and germ-cell lineages of chimaeric mice following injection into host blastocysts. Recently,ES cells with multiple integrations of retroviral sequences have been used to introduce these sequences into the germ-line of chimaeric mice,demonstrating an alternative to the microinjection of fertilized eggs for the production of transgenic mice. However,the properties of ES cells raise a unique possibility: that of using the techniques of somatic cell genetics to select cells with genetic modifications such as recessive mutations,and of introducing these mutations into the mouse germ line. Here we report the realization of this possibility by the selection in vitro of variant ES cells deficient in hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT; EC 2.4.2.8),their use to produce germline chimaeras resulting in female offspring heterozygous for HPRT-deficiency,and the generation of HPRT-deficient preimplantation embryos from these females. In human males,HPRT deficiency causes Lesch-Nyhan syndrome,which is characterized by mental retardation and self-mutilation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEGATIVE,31037385	Assessing the effect of nitisinone induced hypertyrosinaemia on monoamine neurotransmitters in brain tissue from a murine model of alkaptonuria using mass spectrometry imaging. OBJECTIVE: Nitisinone induced hypertyrosinaemia is a concern in patients with Alkaptonuria (AKU). It has been suggested that this may alter neurotransmitter metabolism,specifically dopamine and serotonin. Herein mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is used for the direct measurement of 2,4-diphenyl-pyranylium tetrafluoroborate (DPP-TFB) derivatives of monoamine neurotransmitters in brain tissue from a murine model of AKU following treatment with nitisinone. METHODS: Metabolite changes were assessed using MSI on DPP-TFB derivatised fresh frozen tissue sections directing analysis towards primary amine neurotransmitters. Matched tail bleed plasma samples were analysed using LC-MS/MS. Eighteen BALB/c mice were included in this study: HGD-/- (n = 6,treated with nitisinone-4 mg/L,in drinking water); HGD-/- (n = 6,no treatment) and HGD+/- (n = 6,no treatment). RESULTS: Ion intensity and distribution of DPP-TFB derivatives in brain tissue for dopamine,3-methoxytyramine,noradrenaline,tryptophan,serotonin,and glutamate were not significantly different following treatment with nitisinone in HGD -/- mice,and no significant differences were observed between HGD-/- and HGD+/- mice that received no treatment. Tyrosine (10-fold in both comparisons,p = 0.003; [BALB/c HGD-/- (n = 6) and BALB/c HGD+/- (n = 6) (no treatment) vs. BALB/c HGD-/- (n = 6,treated)] and tyramine (25-fold,p = 0.02; 32-fold,p = 0.02) increased significantly following treatment with nitisinone. Plasma tyrosine and homogentisic acid increased (ninefold,p = < 0.0001) and decreased (ninefold,p = 0.004),respectively in HGD-/- mice treated with nitisinone. CONCLUSIONS: Monoamine neurotransmitters in brain tissue from a murine model of AKU did not change following treatment with nitisinone. These findings have significant implications for patients with AKU as they suggest monoamine neurotransmitters are not altered following treatment with nitisinone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
